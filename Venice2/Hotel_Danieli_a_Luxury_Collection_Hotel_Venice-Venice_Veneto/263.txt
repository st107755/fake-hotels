Extremely poor value. All vegetables cold and poor selection overall and most deserts gone before 3pm and not replenished. Service stroppy, never their fault.  When finishing our coffee cigar smoker put on next table and immediately lit a very large smelly cigar - time to leave. Why are cigars allowed in a restaurant?  Most expensive but worst meal for a very long time and Danieli nor bothered.
