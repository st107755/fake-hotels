Great location! Amazing shopping all around the hotel!  Good food!  Venice is just a beautiful city ,  Hotel was excellent, service was excellent. Food was good , food top restaurant has the best view of canal , but watch out for the gangster pigeons that attack the tables once the guests leave.  Rooms were a little small but expected for Europe, we had the balcony canal view , worth the extra money with table and chairs , stunning views.
