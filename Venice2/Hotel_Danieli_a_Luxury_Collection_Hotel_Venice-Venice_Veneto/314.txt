It’s an old hotel with beautiful lobby especially the red carpeted staircase. The room was beautiful as well just that the toilet looks a bit old. Nice tassels key chain for the room key. The receptionists work very slow, waiting long for the check-in. Hair dryer doesn’t work in my room, not user friendly WiFi in here (need to get new password from reception daily), socket switches limited in the room.  At this price we expect much more from the hotel.
