Loved this hotel. The staff were warm and helpful. The main floor bar was beautiful but I went up to the rooftop terrace. The wait staff there summarily ignored me until I spoke to a major domo? and began to receive the service I had expected. All of a sudden a noise erupted from all the patrons......a tugboat was pulling a massive cruise ship down the canal, followed by a second tugboat. It was interesting to see locals and tourists alike taking photos.  Tipping the waiter turned him into my new best friend. Overall a fun experience. Spoiler alert, the bathrooms have to be the most beautiful in Italy.
