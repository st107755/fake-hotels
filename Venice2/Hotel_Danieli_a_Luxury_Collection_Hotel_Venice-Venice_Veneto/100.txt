Stayed for four nights for a special occasion. Stunning views from the roof terrace where breakfast is served. Great room, beautifully appointed and comfortable. Public spaces in the old section are stunning. Nice bistro up in the roof space. Great food but shame all tables donâ€™t have views. Lovely helpful waitress. If I was being picky the only thing I could criticise is that they do their turn down service between 5 and 6 pm, just as you are getting ready for dinner or having a rest from sightseeing. Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting a special holiday.
