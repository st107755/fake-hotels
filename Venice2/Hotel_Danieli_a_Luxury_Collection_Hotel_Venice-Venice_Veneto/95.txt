What a place ! You arrive from the airport steps from the hotel at just few steps from St Marcos piazza  Beautiful castles and scenic view from the top floor overlooking the piazza and other views from the Channel    It was a view to remember every morning during a fantastic breakfast  Nice restaurants all around the hotel.   All tours depart steps away from it  Direct transfer to the st Lucia train station  What else you could ask !?
