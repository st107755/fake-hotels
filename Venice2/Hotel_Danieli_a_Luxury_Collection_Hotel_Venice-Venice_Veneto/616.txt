What an amazing hotel.  Everything about it showed style and class.  The rooftop terrace has such beautiful views over the lagoon, and to have breakfast there was a wonderful start to every day.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Think it has the best location in the city, close to the local water buses and taxis and St Mark's Square.  The only disappointment was being unable to book a table for dinner on the terrace.  Having said that, we ate in the Bistro which has the same views but through glass.  The food was exquisite and we were so well looked after.  Would love another visit without doubt! ðŸ˜„
