I wanted to see for myself how true TripAdvisor patrons mean about Danieli Hotel...it seemed like there's a mixture of love-hate reviews from those who have stayed there. Being in advertising and the marketing industry myself, I've always considered "5-star" ratings of anything (especially hotels) as that--a marketing tactic. I suggest that others should do the same. Also, another reason I appreciate this independent website. By American standards, it only takes one bug for the Illinois Department of Public Health to shut down a restaurant, this hotel management should think twice in regards to their customer service in a global market. With Venice representing as the crown jewel of Italy, its carat and color is devaluing real fast if establishments such as Danieli Hotelâ€¦
