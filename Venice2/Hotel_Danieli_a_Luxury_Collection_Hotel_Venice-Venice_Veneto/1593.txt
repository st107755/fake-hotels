We were staying at the sister hotel , Gritti Palace so thought it would be good to see the terrace bar  here. It was a beautiful evening and so perfect for a Bellini. We were warmly welcomed into the bar and managed to secure a table at the front, overlooking the Isola di S. Giorgio Maggiore/ Isola della Giudecca. Yes, it is expensive but it is a sort of "must do" if you are in Venice. The Bellinis were very good as were the nibbles. The only issue is the seagulls which do swoop onto the table to grab any leftovers. Staff are slow to shoo them away. We walked down the stairs and were able to fully appreciate the wonderful lobby/atrium. Maybe we can stay here next time!
