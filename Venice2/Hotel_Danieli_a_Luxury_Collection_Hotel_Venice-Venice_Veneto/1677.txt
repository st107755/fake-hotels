Had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Danieli in May 2012.  What a treat it was on our 2-week trek throughout Italy and Austria.   The location was incredible, easy to get to all of the sights either walking or by foot.  The room was nicely situated, with a limited view, but enjoyable nevertheless.   The room was spacious, the bathroom well appointed with all the luxuries you would hope for at a hotel of this caliber.  Overall a fantastic stop mid-trip.
