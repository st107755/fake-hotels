Was initially a little worried about other reviews suggesting indifferent service but saw none of that - staff were very friendly right from the moment the porter took our luggage at the water taxi entrance, and room service was very quick. The reception / ground floor bar area is superb and worth a visit even if not staying. The room was immaculate and the roof terrace restaurant (also used for a very extensive buffet breakfast) offered both great food / service, and superb views across the mouth of the Grand Canal and the whole water front. The hotel is just along the waterfront from the Doges Palace and St Mark's Square, so just 2mins walk which was very handy for a 6am visit to get pictures before the crowds arrived. All in all, a wonderful stay and no hesitation inâ€¦
