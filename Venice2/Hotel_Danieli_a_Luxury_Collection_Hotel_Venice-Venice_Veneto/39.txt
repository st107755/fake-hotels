Stayed for eleven days. Exquisite. Well located on the Grand Canal in the center of many activities.   Management and staff went out of their way to accommodate and make the stay memorable and quick to respond to every whim. Concierge desk extremely helpful and full of recommendations to keep our days fully occupied and helpful restaurant suggestions for each evening.  Roberto, the bartender at the lobby Bar Dandolo, where we had a nightly night cap, was superb. It’s great to see a real professional at work.  We couldn’t have stayed in a more historic and enjoyable atmosphere.
