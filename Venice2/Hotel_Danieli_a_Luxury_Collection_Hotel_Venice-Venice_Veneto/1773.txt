This is an absolutely stunningly beautiful hotel with an equally amazing location in Venice. From the Murano glass chandeliers to the classic decor this hotel is perfect for a romantic stay. The buffet breakfast on the rooftop is delicious and has a wide variety of foods along with the million dollar view of the Grand Canal.    It's location cannot be topped.  Close to San Marco square, the Bridge of Sighs and at least a million restaurants.  Their service is as top notch as the surroundings.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel.
