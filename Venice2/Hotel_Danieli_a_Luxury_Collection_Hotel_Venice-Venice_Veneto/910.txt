I've just returned from a 3 night stay at the hotel Danieli, it really is a beautiful hotel with amazing architecture, lovely rooms, centrally located and helpful staff.   I would recommend the breakfast which is a buffet with loads of choice and the best thing is the view over the grand canal.   The hotel also offers lunch, drinks and dinner on the terrace, we had dinner one night which was lovely but not cheap, but we found everything expensive in Venice even compared to London prices.   If your looking for a central, luxury hotel this is the one to book
