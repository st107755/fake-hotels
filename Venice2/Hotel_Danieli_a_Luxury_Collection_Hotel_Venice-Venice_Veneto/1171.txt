We found the hotel Danieli to be an excellent hotel and wonderful spot to venture around Venice from. Our room didn't offer any views but we still totally enjoyed our stay. The lobby area is majestic although the elevator system and finding our room with the three buildings was a challenge. The breakfast buffet on the roof was wonderful as was the view from it's balcony.
