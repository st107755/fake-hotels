ROOMS We stayed as a family of 4 with two children aged 8 & 12 in connecting rooms in the newer part of the hotel. Opulent heavy furnishing -comfortable beds, and not bad size for Europe (but not massive!) lighting not great but that's the only room complaint Room service very quick and efficient we used (for kids menu and ice) RECEPTION Arrival reception somewhat chaotic and slow but pleasant.  FOOD Do NOT recommend restaurant for anything  other than the beautiful breakfast  as its self serve!  Service abominable at all other times and to be very honest the food was not as outstanding as I've heard or for the money spent.   We had Gnocchi  Quatrro Formaggio  (blander than hoped for) Grilled breast of chicken and sweet peppers (Good)  Burrata ravioli  & Olivecream (v good) â€¦
