Spent a few days at the Danieli on a business conference. Extraordinary architecture and opulent decor but 8 Euros for a tiny bottle of coke should give an idea of where the pricing for food and beverage is pitched. Usual gouging for WiFi (15 Euro per day) but breakfast on the terrace on a clear morning can almost make you forget.  Also worth noting that the ease of access is because the main drop off point for tourists is pretty well straight out the front so the hotel is surrounded by a constant, writhing mass of humanity in Birkenstocks and fanny packs.
