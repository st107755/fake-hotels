Our stay at the Danielli was wonderful, the staff was very helpful with dinner suggestions. Our room was spacious, comfortable and very quiet. The view from the terrace is fabulous, we enjoyed breakfast there each day. Even though it  is costly it was worth it as the offerings were impressive. I would recommend this hotel and have to several friends planning trips to Venice.
