Stayed at the hotel last year ...  very excited to be staying in luxury ... wish we hadn't bothered ... the staff who greeted us were rude and very aloof ... infact I was interrupted twice on check-in whilst they served a fellow Italian ... we didn't eat in the restaurant as we were not made to feel welcome ... it spoilt our holiday of a lifetime ... but it didn't put us off beautiful Venice ... just would stay away from this hotel in future .... the interior was stunning ... shame about some of the staff ... the bar staff and cleaners we're the nicest !!!! ... others way above their station x
