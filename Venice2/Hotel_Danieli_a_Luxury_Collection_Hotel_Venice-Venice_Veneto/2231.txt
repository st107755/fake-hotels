This is a superb hotel, in a cracking location, litterally a couple of minutes walk from St Mark's Square, and seconds from the airport water bus stop.. The room and public areas were lovely. We saw no evidence of the staff being unhelpful, quite the contrary, they were very efficient, friendly and welcoming. Recommended.
