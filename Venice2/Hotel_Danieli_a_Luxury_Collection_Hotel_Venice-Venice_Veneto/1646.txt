"That truly is a very nice hotel", as Johny Depp says in the movie The Tourist and I could not agree more :)) From the moment you enter to the moment you leave everything is just perfect. The location is great, the lobby is impressive and beautiful, the food is above average. But the best part of the place is its terrace on the 4th floor - take your coffee & a glass of wine, relax and enjoy! Would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone :)
