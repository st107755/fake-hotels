So much to take in at the hotel you hate to leave.   Our two room suite was beautiful.  The rooms are furnished in period style Venetian.   Our parlor had its own powder room and comfortable seating with balcony with a view of the Grand Canal.   The roof top patio is a must visit.  Sit outside and enjoy the view.
