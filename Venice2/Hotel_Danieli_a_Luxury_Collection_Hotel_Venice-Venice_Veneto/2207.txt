This hotel is part of a disturbing trend in hotel marketing. Check out its website and you'll see incredible rooms. When you get there, you're in a tiny little closet of a room. Now I'll admit the lobby is spectacular. The hotel is so close to the water that it actually flooded when I was there in December, 2010. They had to move the furniture and put up those planks in the actual lobby. I didn't mind that. It was actually fascinating and they are used to it. No water at all in the rooms themselves. The room service is outrageously overpriced. I mean utter gouging! I can't fault the location of the hotel. I wish the proprietors were willing to show their customers more respect by being truthful about the rooms and not engaging in bait and switch advertising. Not classy!
