The hotel is very famous and well known, it is very beautiful inside.  Because it's front doors open to the grand canal and it is steps from St. Mark's its location is convenient but you must be prepared to be swarmed by mass amounts of tourists if you leave the hotel between 9AM and 5PM.  The concierge was knowledgeable and assisted us in getting to Murano and local restaurants.  Avoid the lobby from 11AM to 1PM to save your sanity, it is not a very large area and their are tons of people checking in and checking out and looking for assistance getting water taxis and help from the concierge.  We visited this hotel after spending 2 weeks in the south of Italy, I am unsure if it was this hotel or if it is Venetians in general but the staff came across as being formal and cold -â€¦
