I have stayed in many hotels round he world but the Danieli is my favourite. The service is simply impeccable. My room has a stunning view. The rooftop terrace is beautiful and breakfast is excellent. Though a little expensive. The hotel also feels very homely. Highly recommended. An incredible hotel
