Although an old hotel (a former Palazzo from the 15th century) one can't deny being in a GRAND OLDE HOTEL!  The personnel is super efficient,the food was superb , at breakfast!  and , if staying in the back rooms, they are very quiet, and a very wonderful "air" about them which is hard to explain.  We enjoyed our stay tremendously. The evenings in the bar were very nice and relaxing to the music of the fabulous piano Player and Great drinks. Would recommend it to anyone over a certain AGE!!
