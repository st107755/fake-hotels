this beautiful old building with its impressive staircase and open landings with parquetry floors is divine. Arriving by water taxi and waking into reception area was a real treat - we stayed in a royal suite which was incredibly luxurious and very very comfortable. We ate lunch on the terrace overlooking the canal and had dinner in the suite - service and food were faultless.
