Came here last year to celebrate husbands 70th birthday in Venice although perhaps should  have told the hotel about this and arranged a cake.  We had a fabulous five days.  Breakfasts on the terrace were spectacular looking out over the lagoon and plenty of selection and hot food cooked well. Good check in and excellent service from Concierge.  It was October  and can't complain about  foyer/bar area being too busy. We had an excellent room with a view of Doges Palace and small balcony.  Very well maintained and extremely comfortable. So good we are going back in a couple of weeks.
