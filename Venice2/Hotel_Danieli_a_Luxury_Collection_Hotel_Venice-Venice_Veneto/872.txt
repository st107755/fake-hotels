This is one of the great hotels of the world and I was lucky enough to stay for one night in a room overlooking the lagoon. The staff were well prepared for our visit and the room was stunning. We had an evening in the bar listening to the piano with a coffee and had breakfast on the roof terrace overlooking the lagoon and the Doges Palace. Leaving was all arranged and we left by water taxis from the private hotel boat jetty, what a great experience
