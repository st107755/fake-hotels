The hotel has a unique atmosphere, full of luxury, history and a great service. The room was very nice with great room amenities. I stayed at the hotel in November the weather was not very good and it was so nice to have a warm towel after I took a shower, those kind of details made my stay so comfortable and memorable.    Locations is great just few steps to the San Marcos Square and Cathedral, Ducale Palace,etc.   This is a great option for a Romantic trip
