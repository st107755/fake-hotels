My parents and I stayed here for their anniversary trip and we loved it. Our rooms were spacious, quiet and the service was great. My only complaint is that we were not informed that we definitely need reservations for dinner at the restaurant. They were nice to accommodate us at the bistro but my desire was to have dinner with the wonderful views. After all it was my parents anniversary dinner. We however used the restaurant for the afternoon tea and enjoyed the views but it would've been great to have the views at sunset and enjoy a full meal not just drinks. That is the only flaw I think they had.
