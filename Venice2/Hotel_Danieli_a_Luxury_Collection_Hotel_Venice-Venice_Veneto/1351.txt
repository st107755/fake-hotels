We stayed here for three days during our five week holiday through Italy. The hotel is in a great location for convenience of access to the broader aspects of Venice. The staff were helpful and polite. We dined in the main restaurant which was good and the staff were accommodating, the views are absolutely amazing!  The foyer bar and lounge is perfect for relaxing at the end of each day for an unwind and evening drinks. Would stay there again.
