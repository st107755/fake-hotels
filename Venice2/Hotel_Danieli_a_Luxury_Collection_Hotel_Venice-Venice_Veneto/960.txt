A wonderful experience of Architectural charm, lovely staff and historical surroundings. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants, beautiful historical sites and wonderful views of the canals, landmarks and islands. The hotel is convenient to transportation, easy to get to almost anywhere you would want to go in Venice and within walking distance of the majority of the top sites.
