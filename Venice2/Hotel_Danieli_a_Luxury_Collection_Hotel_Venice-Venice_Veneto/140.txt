Very old, full of history and charm with a great location, but definitely overpriced and lacks luxury. Air conditioning did not work on two occasions we were their, mosquitoes in our room. Staff were polite but not friendly (not even a smile) which created a lackluster experience that lacked soul and sparkle, which is the opposite of our other Italian stays.
