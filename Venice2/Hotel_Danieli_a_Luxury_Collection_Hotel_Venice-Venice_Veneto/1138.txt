Bravo to all the wonderful staff!  We've enjoyed a tremendous 3 night stay.... We were greeted on arrival via hotel's private water taxi, with news that we'd been upgraded to a sumptuous suite. Loved listening to the beautiful piano music in hotel bar  - just added to the special magic of the place.
