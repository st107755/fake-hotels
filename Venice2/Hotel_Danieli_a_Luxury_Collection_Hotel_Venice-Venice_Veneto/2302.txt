My wife and I stayed with our two young children. The Danieli lived up to our expectations, beautiful interior. Rooms were a little small but made up for the fact we were in the old part of the hotel. Staff were very professional and friendly. Venice is a wow destination and we enjoyed our stay. We were let down by the local restaurants around St Marks Square who were only interested in giving poor service, over charging us and  terrible( not in the Danieli!) food! Come on tourist board, smarten up these guys.
