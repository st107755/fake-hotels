Lovely stay in a beautiful hotel. The room was amazing with some lovely finishing touches.   Staff were very attentive and it was great arriving direct to the hotels water entrance.   Bathroom was massive, beautiful and had a bath that was big enough for 2. The shower was also very good.   Bed very comfortable and a very good size.  Breakfast on the terrace is a must do with a great selection and an amazing view.   Overall I can see why this is one of the top hotels.
