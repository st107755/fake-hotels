Wow, the Hotel Danieli did not disappoint. We arrived late, midnight, and they were ready and waiting. We were escorted to our beautifully appointed Jr Suite over looking the grand canal. The bed was very comfortable, very nice linens. Big spacious bathroom. The room was very quiet. Breakfast on the terrace was wonderful and we enjoyed the beautiful view. The concierge is very well staffed and knowledgeable and very helpful. Hotel Danieli is a bit pricey but well worth it!
