My wife and are staying for 4 nights in this beautiful hotel in the very heart of Venezia. Only 30 sec walk from St. Marco and set on the harbour front of the lagoon it is absolutely one of the best hotels in Venezia. Expensive yes, but worth it. Been staying here a few times on business as well and you cant ask for any better service than the concierge's are giving. Get yourself a room with a terrasse overlooking the lagoon - cant get any better than that.
