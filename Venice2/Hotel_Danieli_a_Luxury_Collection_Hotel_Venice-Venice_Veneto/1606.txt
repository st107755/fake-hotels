The Hotel Danieli is in a wonderful position, right next door to the Doge's Palace and hence very close to St Mark's Square. It certainly earns its five star rating. Rooms are comfortable and I was lucky to be allocated a room with a balcony, overlooking a small canal and out over the roofs of Venice. However, others in our group were less fortunate, their "view" being of the wall of the building next door. The restaurant, while being good, is grossly overpriced and the quality of the food does not warrant such prices. This is the reason for my awarding it only a "very good" rating, rather than "excellent".
