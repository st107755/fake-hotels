The Hotel Danieli is a remarkable Luxury Collection property located just steps away from St Marks Square and is situated right on the waterfront with incredible views.  The Danieli has a rooftop restaurant where I luxuriated in incredible views for the days I was there having breakfast while soaking in the 180 degree views of Venice!  Some of my best pictures were taken from the rooftop restaurant!   As a platinum member I was so fortunate to have been upgraded to a suite with a stunning marble bathroom that was enormous!  The room was absolutely lovely and the bed was so comfortable - I slept very well at the Danieli!   Overall the Danieli is a beautiful and the location makes it quite a gem in the beautiful city of Venice!  Highly recommend this hotel.
