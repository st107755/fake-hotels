This wasn't our first time to Venice but we always heard about the famous Danieli Hotel and since we aren't planning to go back again we thought that we had to stay at this  Hotel.   The actual building in really something to appreciate. Classic and a lot of antique furniture. Of of the chairs in the hallways have ropes around them so you can't sit on them but can look at the beauty of piece.  But the hotel needs a lot of renovating. The arms of the sofas in the lobby are black.  The rooms are old and the furniture needs to be changed in the rooms. The trimmings were falling off the chairs and the chair seats need to be changed too. The beds were uncomfortable. The air conditioner was not cool enough - Venice is hot in August. We had a canal view room but we could hardly seeâ€¦
