Definitely the location and the palazzo architecture are absolutely amazing. This is why the hotel was chosen for an important family trip. Imagine having breakfast on the rooftop terrace with absolutely iconic view of Canale Grande and a truly five star choice of food and beverage. The checkin experience was great. However, the checkout not at all, I had to be reminding several times to bring our luggage as we were getting late. The worst part was that nobody took away the dirty dishes from the room after the room service for two days, whoa, and there was not even a glimpse of apology when I mentioned this. Important to note, there are stairs without elevator inside the hotel, which is not friendly for small children or seniors. Overall, I am happy to have been here at thisâ€¦
