The room was small, overlooking an alley. But the furnishings were nice, bed comfortable. There were very few electrical outlets, but this is a very old building, so there has to be a trade-off. The biggest disappointment was the bathroom, which should be rated sub-par, with a very weak shower (no European hand set!), only one size of towel, and ordinary products. On the positive side: the most beautiful common areas imaginable, and a splendid breakfast on the terrace with spectacular views of the Isola San Giorgio and beyond.
