We ended our last Italy trip in Venice. Enjoyed all the sight and sounds of this timeless city and capped each day on the Danieli terrace with a cool drink and continued fascination with the perfect view across the Grand Canal. Very nice, recently remodeled room, Central location to all of our activities, Highly recommend
