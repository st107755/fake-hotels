The hotel itself is beautifully decorated The rooms are spacious & luxuries  The lobby is huge and unique The location is convenient The price is high but you do get what you pay for. The restaurant is on the top floor with a huge balcony with a view The restaurant offers delicious food, tried both breakfast & dinner. Highly recommended.
