The hotel location is beautiful, the terrace is gorgeous and it is hard to believe the beauty when the weather is nice!  As we were celebrating our anniversary they offered us a free bottle of champange, which was a nice touch.   Do not expect views from most rooms. Our room had creaky floors and a bit of dust on the headboard. The bathroom was old but clean.   The breakfast was not included in the  rate and it is very expensive 45 euros per person. The terrace is amazing though and this is what you pay I suppose...   It would be nice if the hotel was to offer more information about the building, which is historic and beautiful, instead we found out more information from friends and locals in Venice.  One of the best restaurants with reasonable prices is just a few steps fromâ€¦
