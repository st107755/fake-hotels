My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay, we had a premium de luxe room which, unfortunately didn't have a lagoon view as the hotel was full. To be honest Venice is such a gorgeous city you son't spend too much time in there anyway. The room was spacious with a lovely comfy King size bed, the bathroom was spacious with lots of little goodies. My only little critism was the bathroon was a bit pongy sometimes but I suppose old plumbing and all that! People have complained about the rooms being old, well it is an old hotel and I think it all adds to the charm. The staff are lovely and we had dinner in their hotel which was expensive but just gorgeous. It was my birthday and they brought a cake and 2 glasses of bubbly which was a nice touch, food and service devine,â€¦
