Where do I start !  We sailed in on a water taxi to the door. The architecture is superb with fabulous murano glass chandeliers, marble staircases etc. Our room was lovely with lovely toiletries and the bedding was changed daily.  They have a wonderful rooftop terrace - a great place for a sundowner !  Breakfast had everything you could think of - including free prosecco !  Just off St Marks Square - is definitely go again !!!!
