This hotel was amazing, from the watertaxi ride to the canalside entrance to the view of Doge Palace from the room. Spectacular lobby, courteous staff, immaculate old style rooms (with amazing marble baths). It is about half block to St Mark's Square but not loud at all. Easy walkable location, and the breakfast buffet on the roof is spectacular. A true splurge hotel at its best. The only downfall: the concierge misdirected us to meet our Doge Secret Tour (fortunately we left enough time to ask the tourist bureau for correct directions), and their food rec left a little to be desired.
