Spectacular setting and hotel. We stayed in the original part of the hotel for three nights. The suite was lovely, but lacked soundproofing and definitely needed updating. Large groups of guests checked in and out at all hours of the day and night. Rooms in the main building are above the registration desk, so it was very noisy. The breakfast terrace is stunning, but again there were fairly large groups that made it crowded and pushy around the buffet area. There was not a fresh egg/omelet station. The gluten free offerings were thoughtful. The bar area is gorgeous, but again full of groups traveling together. We will not stay here the next time we are in Rome. I would recommend stopping in for a drink at the beautiful bar but staying elsewhere.
