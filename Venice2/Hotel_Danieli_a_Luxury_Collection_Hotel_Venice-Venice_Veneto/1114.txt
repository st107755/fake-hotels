we spent 3 nights in this luxury hotel in Venice. Best location but also best services. Our room was large, quite and clean, classic but with all modern comforts. The staff was very helpful and professional. They gave us good suggestion on how to visit Venice. Excellent breakfast. Hotel to suggest for pleople looking for the top  but  ready to spent  a high rate for the room.
