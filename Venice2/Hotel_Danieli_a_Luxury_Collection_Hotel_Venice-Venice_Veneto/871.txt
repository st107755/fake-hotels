We had a beautiful suite on the top floor with a private terrace. It was sumptuous and beyond comfortable. We stayed 2 nights and were treated like royalty. The staff was so accommodating and the included breakfast was wonderful. The view from the restaurant took my breath away that first morning and again when we had dinner there our last night. Fabulous hotel!
