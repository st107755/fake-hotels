Having had a wonderful past experience, looked forward to sharing similar with teen son.  A huge disappointment - altho' updated room with canal view requested - led to very dated and musty-smelling small room over back alley w/ constant noise from a restaurant kitchen - after chaotic front-desk check-in with many unhappy clients.  Ran into close friends staying / paying far less and had much better updated room and location/view - frustrating.  Love the property and location, however, would not stay again after this experience.
