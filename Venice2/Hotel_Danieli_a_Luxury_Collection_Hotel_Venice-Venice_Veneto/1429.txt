Some of the reviews I read of this hotel left me apprehensive that it might be a little tired and have poor service.  But I still booked it because of its history and location.  And was pleasantly surprised by it - our room was huge (and it was just a normal one - not a special lagoon-facing one or anything) - everything was clean, the breakfast was great, the service was good.
