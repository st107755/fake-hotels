Had lunch here today. There's no doubting this is a very pricey outing, but sometimes you just HAVE to treat yourself. As daft as it might sound, I was keener to sample the unparalleled view of the lagoon more than the food, although I have to say, the latter didn't disappoint. I started with the gorgonzola tortellini and my husband had pasta with artichoke and crispy bacon. Both were exceedingly good, but at €36 each they should be. Main course for me was billed as fish and chips, but was obviously more high end than that. It was fillet of John Dory in a tempura batter, sweet potato purée and 2 triangles of sautéed potatoes. The fish was lovely, but the potato was definitely slightly undercooked. It was €66. My husband had various cuts of lamb, which he said was beautifully…
