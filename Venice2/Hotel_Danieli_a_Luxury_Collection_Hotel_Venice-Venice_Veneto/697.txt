We stayed at the Hotel Danieli in October last year and really liked it. Stayed Friday to Monday. Again we were not disappointed quality of staff were exceptional rooms cleaned /. sorted twice a day - breakfast was great and evening meal was superb. Not cheap but you get what you paid for. We asked the hotel to provide a guide for 3 hours including a boat trip. The guide was exceptional in her knowledge and made it very interesting. Would definitely ask for her again. Beautiful hotel
