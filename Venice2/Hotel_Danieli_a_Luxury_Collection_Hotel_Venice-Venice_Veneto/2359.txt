Loved the Daneli.  Stayed for 3 nights in June.  We had two rooms which had just been renovated.  Very comfortable, elegant with gorgeous marble bathrooms.  Our room had  a balcony overlooking the lagoon and grand canal.  The balcony had a table and chairs.  After a busy day of sightseeing it was a great place to relax.   The staff were very attentive.  I would stay again.
