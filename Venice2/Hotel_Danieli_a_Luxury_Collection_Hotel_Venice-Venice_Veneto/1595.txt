This, being an old Doge palace, is the most beautiful hotel at which I've ever stayed.  The common areas exquisite, the guest rooms grand, you can access a boat in the canal from the lobby and there is no where else in the world I would rather have my morning coffee (or mimosa) then the roof top restaurant.  Our room was very large with a huge closet and large pink marble filled bathroom.  The architecture will make you cry.  Don't miss breakfast on the roof even one morning.  And the location, just off the square, is unbeatable.  Will always stay at the Danieli when in Venice if we can.
