We booked a family trip to stay at Hotel Danieli in June 2020.   When COVID hit and it was apparent we would not be able to make our scheduled trip we were informed through Marriott that we would receive a refund (we have the email that states this exactly).  However, Hotel Danieli will NOT refund us our money.  Furthering the terrible customer service of Hotel Danieli we were going to pass our 2 rooms onto friends in Italy since the hotel would not honor their commitment of refunding us our money.  Hotel Danieli would not honor this alternative either as they had closed their doors and no guests were allowed to stay at their hotel.  The customer service is non-existent, we understand the plight they were facing, yet they will not give us the same courtesy.  If this is how they treat upcoming guests I cannot imagine the actual stay!â€¦
