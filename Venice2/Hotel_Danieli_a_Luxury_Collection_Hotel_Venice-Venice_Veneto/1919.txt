It was outrageously expensive as we try to book a double room euro 980 no breakfast and during the phone offer,ask 30 minutes to discuss and when we wanted to cfm but room no more avaible , only very special suite (price x 3 more than the room but with breakfast), which we took as we wanted to remember our venice -stay for next years and the room was very very special but we were super disappointed by the service, unwilling staff, like we had to push them and everything was hard work for them and they act like they couldnot care less. (we should be happy that WE could stay with them) We stayed in many 5star hotels, but never so expencive and never so terrible staff. we didnot want to rate Terrible, because it was a great room and excellent location but we would not going backâ€¦
