We booked via BA and had joined a the owners scheme. On arrival at check-in this led to an upgrade of our room. This became some smallish room with cheap furniture (though with king bed) with oversized drapes taking up a lot of space. There was a  tiny TV in the room and plenty of noise at night and early hours from an adjacent alley.  During our stay we arrived back to the room to find water cascading through the bathroom ceiling. A call to the desk did get a plumber out quite quickly and later a cleaner.  On the service side we found everyone attended to their job, so we have no complaints. During the stay in Februaty (carnival time) I had a BIG birthday and the hotel surprsing us with a bottle and prosecco and small (and fabulous) cake.  Sadly, we did not try the restaurant,â€¦
