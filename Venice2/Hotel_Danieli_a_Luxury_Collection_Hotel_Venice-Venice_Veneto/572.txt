Wonderful hotel, near everywhere that you need to be in Venice. Went from Monday until Friday. Company Award week where we had a full dinner on the very beautiful terrace with the most spectacular views. Breakfast wonderful as was the service in the bar.   Would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a lovely hotel, and that added touch of a little luxury.
