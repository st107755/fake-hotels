Had not been back to this lovely hotel in 45 years and it is still a beauty, the rooms up-dated in an old world style. The restaurant is terrific. The waiter who brought my cappuccino at 3:00 am, my wake up call, was a gem, quiet tap at door, whispering so as not to disturb others; oh that cappuccino was fabulous.
