This is a truly beautiful hotel; the decor is truly stunning. The service is excellent, and the breakfast is well-presented. We ate at the restaurant one evening, which I would give a miss: it is very expensive for an average 'high-end' meal. The cocktails are fantastic in the lounge though, although the service is slightly lacking at times.
