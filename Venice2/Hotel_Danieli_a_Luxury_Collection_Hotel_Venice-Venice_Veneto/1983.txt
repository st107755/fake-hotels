A lovely old fashioned place to stay so close to St. Marks yet only a short stroll away from the quieter side streets.  A wonderful place to relax after a day wandering around Venice.   We stayed in the older part of the hotel - the rooms were a good size and the bathroom was acceptable although decoration was a little shabby. Staff were helpful and concierge recommended some very nice restaurants. Well worth booking dinner whilst you are there - the views from the rooftop restaurant are spectacular and the food is wonderful. Service very good, a little too fast would be my only criticism, but you are not rushed from your table. Breakfast was amazing.
