Outstanding hotel lobby in an old Venetian palace. Also great rooms with a good view. Well worth a visit and a few days stay. Great to arrive by water-taxi from the airport direct to the hotel! Very good location just next to San Marco's square. Few hotels in the world can match the atmosphere of the Danieli!
