My husband and I were blown away by this hotel!   It's even better than the pictures show.  WOW!   The location couldn't be better as you simply step off the water taxi from the Grand Canal and the hotel is right across the street.   You are 3 min walk from San Marco square!    The hotel has this old world charm feel to it.   Loved the reception area  (concierges were amazing and have GREAT recommendations for restaurants and activities)   with the old tasseled keys hanging behind the desk.    We figured it out after the second day that you can leave your keys with the reception and just ask for it every time you come and go.   It's a nice touch to bring back the feel of how things used to be before the electronic card keys even though the tasseled keys they give you areâ€¦
