Its's a very well located hotel. Right next to the ferry station and close to St. Marks Square so you are close to restaurants. The hotel staff were really friendly and warm at check-in and ever ready to help. The only draw back for me personally was that it was a bit loud in terms of the aesthetics. But that is my personal opinion. The beds were really comfortable. Overall I would say a great place to stay
