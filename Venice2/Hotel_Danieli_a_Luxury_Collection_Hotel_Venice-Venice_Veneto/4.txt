I stayed here for a night during my visit to Venice. I knew the hotel was used for the movie THE TOURIST and as a massive Angelina Jolie fan, I just wanted to have that shared experience ... It was a last minute booking, so I was very pleased when the staff informed me that a room was indeed available. My finacee and I had a cheese board and a couple pf cocktails in the bar downstairs as we were not in the mood for dinner.. There was live music and the service was fantastic. Yes, it is pricey but we were expecting that. The room was as luxurious as it can be for a standard room. I loved every minute of it (the bed and bedding are exceptional) and I left with a big smile on my face the next day. Loved it!
