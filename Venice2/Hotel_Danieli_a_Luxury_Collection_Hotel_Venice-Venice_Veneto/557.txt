Beautiful interior to the hotel. Whisked up to the fourth floor by an equally impressive lift. Walked out onto the rooftop restaraunt with breathtaking views overlooking the Grand Canal. The buffet with three chefs to cook your pasta, meat and fish courses. We were a birthday party of four adults and two girls of thirteen and eleven. Fabulous food and experience. This is top of the range expense but worth it for that one off occasion. The buffet is only on a Sunday. The whole family have a memory to treasure.
