The concierge services here are brilliant. Very well informed and most helpful concierges.The location is fabulous, most accessible from all the exciting activity in Venice. It is just a stone throw from the Vaporetti stop and also has its own boat pier both outside and besides the hotel. The lobby and interiors are truly beatiful and the palaces are well maintained and beautifully restored. The piano player in the lounge every evening definitely lifts up the mood. Great to sit around while using the free wireless access in that area on your own device. The breakfast on the Terrazza is most wholesome and plentiful with a very wide selection. Overall fab experience.
