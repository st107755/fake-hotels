We stayed at Hotel Danieli for my partners Birthday and what a treat it was. The interior was nothing short of spectacular. Beautiful marble floors and sumptuous furnishings , we also had a view of the canal. On arrival there was a bottle of Champagne awaiting us , every night there was a little box with two chocolates in on the bed. This is a truly luxurious Hotel. The staff were polite, friendly and helpful at all times. We had a meal on my partners Birthday in the rooftop restaurant where the in house pianist played Happy Birthday. The icing on the cake was on departure the hotels water taxi from its own jetty to the railway station. Venice was beautiful, I will never forget it , or Hotel Danieli
