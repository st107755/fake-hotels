We decided to stay at the Hotel Danieli under our Starwood points while in Venice - it was just such a good price that we really couldn't pass it up.  I am sure that if we had paid full price we would have been less enthused.  The hotel is gorgeous and in a great location near San Marco.  Since using Starwood points perhaps we got the older part of the hotel?  But, it was fine and the room was surprisingly large.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The check in concierge was really nice as well.  The bed was also surprisingly comfortable.  I think we had read some reviews that mentioned the beds being uncomfortable so we were pleasantly surprised by ours.    The room is traditionally decorated - nothing too exciting there - a little dark.  The bathroom had been updatedâ€¦
