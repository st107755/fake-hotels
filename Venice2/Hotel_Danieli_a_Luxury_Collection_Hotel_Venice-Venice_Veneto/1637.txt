A fantastic location and a spectacular building.   However you pay for it in style. Our rooms were not as good as the public areas but i guess some of the suites might be! The bedrooms we had could be described as shabby chic. We had a view of a small canal where the deliveries and bin men came, but hey this is Venice. The rooms were clean and comfortable and we slept well.  There are no facilities for making tea or coffee in the room and the room service prices were €12 for a coffee with an €8 delivery charge. There is a nice bar 2 mins away where a very good take away coffee was €3. Likewise the bar prices were hefty and there were few people in there - not too surprising really. The breakfasts were equally expensive at €48 for continental. We went to a very nice coffee bar…
