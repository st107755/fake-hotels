Stunning hotel in a beautiful city! Close to everything and the staff is perfect. We were treated as if we were the only ones there even though they were quite full. It is a quiet Oasis in a very busy city. The staff was quite helpful in making plans and answering questions. Discreet, professional and polite. A new favorite
