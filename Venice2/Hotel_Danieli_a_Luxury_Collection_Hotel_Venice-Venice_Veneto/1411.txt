The hotel is very nice. Old style with beautiful interior. The staff are friendly and always ready to help. The beds are super comfortable. You have to pay to get decent internet which is a joke compared to the prices you pay for the room. You can get free wifi but it's the slowest possible. The rooms have paper thin walls so you have to hope you get quiet people in the rooms next to you and above you. The location is perfect. Walking distance form everything and you can get a boat taxi to and from both airport and trim station which takes you direct to the hotel. If we come back to Venice I would like to stay at a more modern hotel.
