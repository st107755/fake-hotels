Not sure you can get a better location in all of Venice.  Close to Saint marks Square, restaurants and cafes and bars for adults and young adults.  Public transportation was convenient to get to. The hotel itself is spectacular.  Courteous staff and very clean.  This is a 5 star hotel so expect to spend some $$$.
