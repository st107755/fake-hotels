Perfect location. Beautiful architecture and interior decorating. Very helpful and courteous staff. Would return without question however very expensive.  Morning breakfast/brunch on the rooftop terrace restaurant is completely amazing with your view of the bustling Venice waterways.   Large rooms but a bit dated. Stayed one level up from standard. Believe it was deluxe.  Very expensive!!!!!
