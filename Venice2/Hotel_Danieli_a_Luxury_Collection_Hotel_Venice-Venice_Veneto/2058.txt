We stayed over Easter for 4 nights having stayed one night at the Foscari Palace because there were no rooms available at the Danieli on the day we arrived in Venice. Arriving and departing has to be by water to appreciate the hotel and Venice -we had pre booked our transfers through venicedriver.com who were very professional and punctual. Check in was very quick and I confirmed with the concierge as to the time of our table reservation which he had arranged via email. I found the staff to be very friendly - cleaning, bar, restaurant and office staff were all attentive. Our room was spotless with a large bathroom and plenty of space. Bed was very comfortable.  (room classed as a premium deluxe). A number of the suites are currently being refurbished so are not available. Ironsâ€¦
