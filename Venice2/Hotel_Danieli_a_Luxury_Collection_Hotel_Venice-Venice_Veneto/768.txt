Swanky iconic hotel on the riva was true to form. Staff were courteous but not as warm as most, adding to the class somewhat. Service time was relatively slow as expected, asked for a new hair dryer and bulb replacement that took longer than 10 minutes each time. No free coffee but view from the roof deck unparalleled. Stayed in the excelsior wing maybe older wings would be nicer based on reviews here. All in all it was a classic and fit my expectations
