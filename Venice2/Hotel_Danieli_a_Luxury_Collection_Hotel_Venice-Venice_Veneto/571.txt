Arrived in a beautiful wooden water taxi from Marco Polo airport after the BA flight from London Gatwick delayed by 2 hours. The boat passed Murano where much Venetian glass is blown. Greeted at the hotel jetty and had everything explained to us. The reception staff were very well informed and answered all our questions about the structural foundations and the tides. A room with a view and juliet balcony was stunning and Breakfast on the 5th floor terrace was superb.
