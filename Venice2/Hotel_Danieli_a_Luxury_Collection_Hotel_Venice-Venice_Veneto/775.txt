First i would like to thank the great staff for their help as soon as i arrived i got upgraded from alandalusia suite to a lake view suite#281,  with same amount of money as a complimentary:) that made me happy enough. The suite was more than a expected comfy king size bed nice living room updated tv channels .. the location of the hotel is the best where san marco square is 2 min away by walking and rialto square is 20 min walking. Best coffee shops just under the hotel left and right. Gandulas and water taxi are 1 min away .. the hotel got the best terrace for breakfast the view is indescribable. There is a small fitness room. I cant say enough ill post some pics that said it all.  Thank you i will come again next year
