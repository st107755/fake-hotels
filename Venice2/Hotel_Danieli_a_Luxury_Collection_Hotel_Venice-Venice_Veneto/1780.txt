Considering the money invested, we were rather disappointed with the quality of the room which turned out to have a view into the ironing lady's work room, and the old and small bathroom was a little less than comfortable, but we started each day we stayed there with breakfast on the terrace which was a 5 star experience and one of our holiday highlights. We met another couple who had booked one of the lagoon facing suites who told us it was magificent, so I guess the jump from the standard room to the suite is well worth it! The staff and specifically the Concierge were excellent and super helpful. Perfect walking distance to San Marco Sq and some amazing restaurants.
