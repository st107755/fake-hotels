Beautiful palace on the water with a stunning reception area. I liked arriving by water taxi at the water steps of the hotel, and check in was gracious and efficient. Rooms are ornate, possibly a little overdone, but very comfortable. I had a view over the sea to San Giorgio. My only complaint is the lack of tea or coffee making facility.   The rooftop has a spectacular terrace and restaurant, where a good breakfast is served.   The entire hotel is, unfortunately, let down by the concierge team. For some reason they are the ones who keep the keys and, since they are always away from the desk / on the phone / busy with someone else, queues form for guests to get their keys (and there is definitely no “welcome back” when you walk in). When I asked the Head Concierge (Filippo Bollani) for some restaurant recommendations he was unhelpful and made it quite clear it was a waste of his time. When I then asked for gondola suggestions he grew impatient and rudely pointed to the gondolas outside the hotel.   Tip: the concierge of another hotel advised that since gondolas do not travel very far, what you see depends very much where you start: he recommended hiring one closer to Ponte Rialto so there is time to do one part of your ride on the Grand Canal and under the bridge. Would that have been so difficult for the Danieli concierge?…
