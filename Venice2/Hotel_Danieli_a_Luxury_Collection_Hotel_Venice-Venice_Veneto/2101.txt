Have nothing but great things to say about the Danieli.  It captures all the allure of Venice and the location can't be beat.  Loved the old interior of the hotel with many of the original details of the Palzzo intact.  We had an Executive Suite and the size, while not huge, was perfect for the three of us (we had our 5 year old in tow).  The location of the hotel is perfect, just a half block from the Bridge of Sighs and a block from St. Mark's Square.  The bed was comfortable and room very quiet (we faced St. Mark's Campanile).  The room was clean and we loved the antique furnishings.  We did not dine in the restaurant, but did take a peak of the view from the terrace which has to be one of the best in Venice.  Public transportation is very handy with water taxis and busesâ€¦
