It had been 30 years since we last stayed at the Danieli and it is still as classic a place as ever. Very convenient location with Piazza San Marco just around the corner and the water taxi dock right outside. Breakfast on the terrace is incredible with its panoramic views. It was worth the extra expense to get a canal view room. Can't wait to go back there again and this time it won't take 30 years!
