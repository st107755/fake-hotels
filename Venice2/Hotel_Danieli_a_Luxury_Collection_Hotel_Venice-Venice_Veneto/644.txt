Absolute luxury in every way.  Unbeatable position beside the lagoon. Next door to the Doge's palace. 200 metres from St Mark's square.  The staff were perfect in every way,  Our room was immaculate with a wonderful bathroom.  There is an excellent terrace restaurant with one of the cities best views. Not cheap though, I wasn't too happy with a 32 â‚¬ cover charge.  The next time I visit Venice, This is the hotel we will stay in. We won't even look elsewhere.  Arriving to the door by water taxi is a nice different experience. A half hour trip from the airport,  great fun
