We were walk-in guests, having checked out of a nearby hotel after one night because it was so poor. The contrast at the Hotel Danieli could not have been greater.   We were met by an extremely friendly and helpful reception manager, Ennio, who ensured that our needs were met exactly.   Our room was comfortable, fully equipped, nicely decorated and quiet.    The interior of the hotel is very grand and beautiful but the highlight must be the terrace restaurant on the 4th floor.    This is where breakfast and, at a price, excellent meals are served.   The view over the mouth of the Grand Canal and lagoon is spectacular and not to be missed. We would not hesitate to book  a room in this hotel again. Meanwhile, we'd like to thank all the staff who helped to make our stay soâ€¦
