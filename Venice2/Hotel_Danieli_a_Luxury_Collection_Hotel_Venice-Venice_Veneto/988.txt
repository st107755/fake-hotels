We booked 3 days here at the end of the Orient Express trip as part of a retirement treat for my wife's retirement. the hotel is famous as a former ducal palace and its interior - faithfully preserved - has become one of the landmarks to visit while in the area of St Marks. The hotel is literally next to the Doge's Palace and all top tourist attractions are easily and very quickly accessible. We opted to upgrade to a luxury room with a lagoon view and did not regret it. You will spend quite a bit of money to stay at this 5-star hotel anyway so I would recommend the extra cost of getting what the hotel is best at - looking out at the lagoon, which is a constantly changing tableau of watercraft from morning to night and which provides perfect entertainment while sitting at youâ€¦
