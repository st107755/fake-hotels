What a wonderful hotel to stay in. From arrival by water taxi to the side entrance right on the canal to departure it was so enjoyable. Old world charm was in abundance and the décor was beautiful. Room was great with a very comfortable bed, a separate dressing room and a spacious bathroom with a separate toilet. Very comfortable and it was lovely listening to the gondolas go by. A very nice breakfast was served on the roof top terrace with amazing views across the water.  The location was excellent - one could stroll along the waterfront directly in front, visit St Mark's Square and its many attractions in minutes, catch a gondola right out front as well as water taxis and ferries to the islands. The staff were always very friendly and helpful and helped make our stay so…
