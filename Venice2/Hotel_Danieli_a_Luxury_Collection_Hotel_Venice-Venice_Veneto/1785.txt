We checked in after disembarking our Med cruise.  We enjoyed a drink in the beautiful lobby while awaiting our room key and marvelled at the phenomenal Murano glass chandeliers.  Our second floor veranda overlooked the Grand Canal and was a great location to watch the busy waterway and the people milling around.  Our breakfast on the roof terrace, again overlooking the grand canal, was a wonderful way to start the day. The hotel was pricey but given the decor, location and history we thought it was well worth the expense.  Excellent overall experience and very romantic location.
