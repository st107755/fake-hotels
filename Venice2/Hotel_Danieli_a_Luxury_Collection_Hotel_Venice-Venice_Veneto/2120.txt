charming lobby but very loud - and rooms in that building are not privvy to sound proofing so you can hear all activity from the lobby in the rooms - and they need updating!  the carpet (at least in our room had a huge stain).  the bathroom only had a hand shower so close to the wall that you almost had to lean against the wall to get wet.  what was most unappealing was the service.  they are very aloof - almost snobby.  not pampering or friendly at all.  next time we will not go back.  really a shame.
