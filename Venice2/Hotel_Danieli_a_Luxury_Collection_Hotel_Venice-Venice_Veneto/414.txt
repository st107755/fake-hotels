We loved our stay at the Danieli. All of the staff are well-drilled, patient, accommodating and courteous. The main building is 700 years old and simply stunning. We were very lucky with our room - it was spacious and clean, with a nice bathroom and it looked over the Grand Canal. The bar and its staff are excellent. The Danieli’s location is good too, it’s pretty central so you are about 15 mins walk from Rialto Bridge and other attractions. The walks themselves are great fun as you stumble across some lovely sights. We really didn’t want to leave. We would be back in a heartbeat
