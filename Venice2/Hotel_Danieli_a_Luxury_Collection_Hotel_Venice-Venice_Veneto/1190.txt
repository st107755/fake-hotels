Venice is a world unto itself, as is the Danieli. The usual criteria simply doesn't apply. Venice is Oz and the Danieli is the Emerald City. From the warm smiles and gracious welcome from Maurizio and his team at reception, to the staff of waiters and waitresses at Terraza Danieli, to the concierge desk, to housekeeping....it's a delightful experience, and I can't wait to return. How often does one have the opportunity to relax and luxuriate in a 14th century palazzo, yet with all of the requisite modern luxuries and round the clock service? Right in the middle of the action, this hotel gives you the total Venice experience, so don't hesitate to five in and experience this oasis of civility in Venice. You won't regret it !  heck!
