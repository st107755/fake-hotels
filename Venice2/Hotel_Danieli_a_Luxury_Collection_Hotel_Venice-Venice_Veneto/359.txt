When you first walk into this hotel you instantly fall in love with all the detail and old architecture mixed with some modern details. The chandeliers are stunning! Staff are welcoming and very helpful. Make sure you have breakfast upstairs overlooking the water. Watching all the boats coming and going is very entertaining.
