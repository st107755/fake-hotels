The hotel accommodations were arranged by the tour company we were touring with through Switzerland and Northern Italy, Sunrise Tours out of St. Louis, MO.  The hotel was lovely, very easy walk to St. Mark's Square, and in the perfect location to walk or use water taxi to see and do whatever one would have a mind to see and do.  The service was excellent, friendly, helpful and very professional.  Breakfast buffet was excellent, we ate on outside terrace just outside the dining area and the view was breathtaking.  We would stay here if/when we are fortunate enough to visit Venice again.
