Words cannot describe the emotion I felt when I first entered my room at Hotel Danieli. It was like stepping back in time to a more innocent and regal period of history. This magnificent hotel is a place I will remember for ever as one of the best I have ever had the privilege of staying in. It is such a pity that we are so far from everything in Melbourne but I will attempt to visit you again Danieli. My wife and I still talk about our time here often. 100% perfection!!!
