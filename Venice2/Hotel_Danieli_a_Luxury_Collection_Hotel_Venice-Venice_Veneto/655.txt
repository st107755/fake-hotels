We have recently just returned from a brilliant four days in Venice. The Hotel Danieli from the moment we arrived could not have done more for us. The hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location.   Our room (203) over looked the lagoon and was very large. Great dressing room and bathroom. Everything you'd want from a luxury hotel. The service at the Danieli is exceptional and you are looked after well. Highlights are the Danieli Bistro and of course the wonderful roof terrace. Definitely worth staying at if you're in Venice- we will be back!
