Stayed there for one night during our recent trip to Italy.  It is nice old hotel, right in the center of the city.  You cannot beat the location.  The hotel occupies three buldings, one of them with  the terrace, is being renovated, no nice view of Venice for breakfast. We stayed in the newer part of the hotel.  Not as nicely decoredted as the main building, but still had fabric on the walls and other luxury elements.  We had a corner room, reasonably large, with good size bathroom, small lobby and a walk-in closet.  Clean and well maintained.  The older part of the hotel looks really luxorios, but you can hear squeaky floors and it is very dark.  It is OLD, what do you expect! Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  One specific comment on their private trip to Murano glassâ€¦
