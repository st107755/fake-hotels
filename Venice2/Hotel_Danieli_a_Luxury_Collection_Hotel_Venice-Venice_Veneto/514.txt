We had lunch in the rooftop restuarant a few days ago, Thursday 21st September. The chicken breast dish was rehashed and served as a cube, the deer steaks were so tough my wife sent them back and my lamb dish was overdone, all very poor for the prices they charge which is a lot! They did not charge us for the deer dish. Definitely a no go with such poor food preparation. No wonder Macdonalds with their food, mediocre, well priced for what it is, proliferates worldwide. This restuarant falls well below that.
