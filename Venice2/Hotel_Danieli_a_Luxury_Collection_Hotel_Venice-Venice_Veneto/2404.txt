I stayed at the Danieli only because I used Starwood points.  I didn't want to pay $1000 a night. I'm glad I didn't.  This is a 600 year old palace in a perfect location and with one of the most beautiful entries and lobbies of any hotel but...  The rooms were average at best and noisy.  I will say that the staff was helpful.  Avoid lunch at the rooftop terrace.  40 euro cover charge for our family on top of incredible prices.  All I can say is that I stayed at the Danieli - once.
