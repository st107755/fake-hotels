We stayed in a lagoon view room in the wonderful old palazzo and the room was beautifully decorated, with antique furniture, an extremely comfortable bed, Murano chandelier and huge opening windows with of course, the view over the Giudecca which is completely stunning.  To lean out of the window and watch the scene below could waste hours!   The bathroom is well appointed.  The location is absolutely stunning and the interior of the palace most interesting and ornate.  The breakfast was very good and to sit on the roof terrace looking at that view is one of the most memorable experiences. The service from the waiting/bar staff was superb and perhaps the rest of the staff in the hotel should try to emulate them.  I agree with the other reviewer who said they acted as though itâ€¦
