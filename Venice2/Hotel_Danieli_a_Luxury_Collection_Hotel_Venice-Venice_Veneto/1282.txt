Stayed three  nights , in July 2015, excellent hotel in General, location great and very convenient, Excellent breakfast on terrace with astonishing view, Restaurant and bar staff are great, reception and concierge little confused with the crowed. The hotel is a real Museum and a land Mark in Venice  you can stop taking photos of the interior. Room is  very nice and astonishing bath rooms. Price is not cheap at all but I believe it worth it compared to other same priced Hotels in Venice.
