The original hotel was built a a residence for the elected Doge.  It has a beautiful interior very similar to the palaces of Europe.  It is located very close to San Marcos Piazza, and was central to all of the activities we had planned (5-10 minute walk).  The hotel is located near the southern end of the Grand Canal and has stunning views of the lagoon.  Breakfast on the roof top each morning offered beautiful views of the Venice Lagoon and ship traffic.
