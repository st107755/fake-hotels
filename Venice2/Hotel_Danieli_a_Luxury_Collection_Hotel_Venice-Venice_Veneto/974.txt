What a beautiful hotel lobby. Very helpful service that greets you. Front desk staff was excellent.   Room upgrade with a balcony overlooking the grand canal was a nice treat. Room itself was quite small, maybe overloaded with furniture that was unneeded. No place to store luggage properly.  Maybe typical of European hotel but not a typical price point at this hotel.  I'm not sure I would return here as we also stayed down the street and were more pleased at an equivalent price.  Danieli has a big reputation to live up to - not sure it's still a reality.
