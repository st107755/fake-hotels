We were there for three nights in October.   The public areas by reception are stunningly beautiful, as is the rooftop restaurant, but the rest of the hotel felt tired to us.  Our room was sparsely furnished, and while the fabric covered walls are beautiful, it was hardly cheerful.   We also thought it odd that while we left our room by 9:00 in the morning, the room wasn't made up when we returned at 3:00.   Hardly five star service.  Breakfast is fine, but not as varied or good as I remembered it from fifteen years ago, and serving butter in little wrapped foil packages seemed tacky to us.   Lunch on the terrace was especially frustrating.   There is a 12 euro cover charge per person, even for hotel guests, and my iced tea for 10 euros was canned ice tea, with the can left onâ€¦
