The hotel is a gracious old building (a collection of three buildings).  The room we had was very comfortable.  Whilst the hotel is located on the banks of the Grand Canal inside it is very peaceful.  The service was impeccable - particularly the housekeeping staff.  The one disappointment was the roof top restaurant.  I terrific location and views - the food was very overpriced (even for Venice) and very ordinary.
