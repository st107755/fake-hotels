So, it's expensive.  We knew that.  So go in with your eyes open and simply admire the palatial splendour and moreover the historical legacy of one of the most beautiful hotels - ever.  We stayed for three nights in a Premium Double Room.  Walls lined with silk fabric, a marble bathroom.  It didn't have a view but that didn't matter - if I'd had the money I'd've splashed out more in order to see the lagoon (and the rain).  To stay here is to slip into another world that belongs to other people. And for once, I'd infiltrated their world.  I was made to feel as welcome as if I was staying in the Presidential Suite, the check-in was smiley, courteous, efficient and embracing. We were valued guests from the moment we arrived until the day we left.  As for the beds?  Heaven.  Pillowsâ€¦
