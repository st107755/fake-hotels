I had the fortune to stay at the Danieli 25 years ago, during a corporate sponsored event.  In August 2018, I had the fortune to enjoy this hotel with my 14 year old son... It was like going back in time to the lovely memories I cherished from my first visit. Staff super welcoming, facilitated my visit to Murano in private water taxi... The food was simply delicious.  The rooms are small but laboriously decorated. We spent much of our time resting in the comfortable and opulent lobby/caf√© area.  I was happy to build new lovely memories with my son..
