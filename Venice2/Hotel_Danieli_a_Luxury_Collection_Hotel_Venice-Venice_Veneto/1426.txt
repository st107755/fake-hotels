Just returned from a wonderful long weekend at this grande dame of a hotel.  An icon in Venice.  The building itself is over 700 years old (if I remember rightly) and has been a hotel for approx 200 years and it almost feels like you are staying in a castle.  We loved it. We were upgraded to a wonderful canal view room and given a bottle of Prosecco too (trip was for our anniversary), a very kind thoughtful gesture.  The view was spectacular out across the canal to the Chiesa di San Giorgio Maggiore opposite with gondolas bobbing around in front of you.  Stunning.  I even loved being able to hear the hussle and bustle outside with the windows open.  When closed it was lovely and quiet.  The hotel is higgledy piggledy with uneven floors and stunning Murano glass chandeliers. â€¦
