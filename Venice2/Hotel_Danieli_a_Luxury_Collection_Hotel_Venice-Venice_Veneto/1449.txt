The main hotel lobby is the epitome of Venice style and it is jaw dropping.  However, I believe the only way to stay in a room in the main hotel is if you are staying in one of the suites.  We only had a deluxe room and it was located in the neighboring building.  It was a little disappointing to find out after seeing the lobby we wouldn't be staying in that historic building.  It was probably in the fine print somewhere but I missed that fact.  Regardless, our room was tiny but adequate and still had Venetian charm.  The location of the hotel is great.  It is on the Grand Canal and right next to St Marks square.  Getting to and from the airport/train station is best via a private boat taxi.  You can be dropped off/picked up at the hotel's private dock entrance and you avoidâ€¦
