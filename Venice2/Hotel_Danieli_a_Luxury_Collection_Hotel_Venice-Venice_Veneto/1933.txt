Such a beautiful hotel. Because of our SPG gold status, they upgraded us to a beautiful luxury deluxe double room. The staff was friendly and attentive. Because its a small hotel, the front desk and taxi area can get crowded...just be aware if you are in a hurry to leave. The bell captain was very attentive, however, and found us a water taxi out on the square because of the backup at their own dock. Beautiful rooftop restaurant - just be aware of the astronomical prices! They also charge a 12 euro per person cover charge even if you are a guest at the hotel. But overall wonderful hotel, great location and service. Will definitely stay there again.
