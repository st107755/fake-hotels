we loved the Hotel Danieli, very old very historic.  Our suite overlooked the Grand Canal, and the people watching was awesome.  The historic gothic lobby and stairwell are beautiful. a few steps away from the Bridge of Sighs, St Marks Square and the Grand Canal, also step right out into gondola for a tour around Venice by water.
