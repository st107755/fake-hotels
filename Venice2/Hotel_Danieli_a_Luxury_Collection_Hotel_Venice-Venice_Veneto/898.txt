You can't go wrong by choosing to stay at this beautiful hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful - pricey, as expected. Location is great, couple of steps (we walk a lot, so maybe couple more steps) from St. Marco's square. There is an amazing sea food restaurant around the corner, very small, local place, forgot the name, but I think they recommended it to us in the hotel. The hotel is high end and you will definitely feel it.
