This is my family's second visit to the Danieli, and it is truly incredible!  The rooms are large and well appointed, the location is fabulous, and it is truly reminiscent of "old school" elegance.  This is a hotel that maintains its authentic character without giving up any luxurious amenities.  We will definitely be returning to the Danieli.
