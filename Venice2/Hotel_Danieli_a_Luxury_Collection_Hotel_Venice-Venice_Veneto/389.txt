This was my 5th visit to Venice. And the location of the Daniel made a big difference to the enjoyment of one of my favourite cities. Right opposite San zakaria vaporetto and a bridge away from San Marco, it was very convenient. The service was very nice discussion the concierge. Nice rooms, but could do with more lights. The lobby was straight out of 18th century... And the furniture felt it.... They should modernise and reupholster! The terrace restaurant was great view but not too many vegetarian options  Good fun and will consider it again for my next visit
