We stayed at the Danieli for a weekend away without children. It was the second time, and it was just as amazing as the first time. You feel like you are in the 15th century, with the deco still intact and Louis XV or Marie Antoinette’s everywhere. The service is impeccable, the breakfast buffet includes Champaign etc. It is on the Piazzo St Marco, so no need to walk much. Water taxi’s stop at the hotel itself, and tourists take pictures from you coming out of the hotel ! It is a bit expensive, but really worth it !
