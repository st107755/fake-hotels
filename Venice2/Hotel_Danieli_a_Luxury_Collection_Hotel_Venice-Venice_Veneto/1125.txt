I visit Venice nearly every year... One New Year's Eve I decided to spend it in Venice (trying to experience direct cities and cultures). Expecting fireworks over the Grand Canal but instead dodged firecrackers in St. Marks Sq. As for the Hotel Danieli ~ If you stay in a large suite on the Grand Canal > I assume that you would have a 5 Star experience but for the rest of us.. it's grandeur and history did not make up for the fact that I felt I was overpaying for the tiny room.
