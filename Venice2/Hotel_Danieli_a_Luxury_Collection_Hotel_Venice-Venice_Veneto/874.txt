As SPG platinum guests, we were extremely happy with our stay at this beautiful hotel.  Upon arrival, we were automatically upgraded to a wonderful suite overlooking the grand canal.  The restaurant upstairs had an amazing view and the food was outstanding.  The concierges were very helpful.  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and made our vacation extra special!
