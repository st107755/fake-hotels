When we were in Venice it started to rain.  So we went thru the first doorway we came across which was the Hotel Danieli.  I have never forgotten what I saw in their lobby (if you can call it that).  It was like a palace; created many, many years ago.  Whenever I talk to someone going to Venice, I tell them to stop by this hotel - they will be amazed at what they see.  If I return one day, it will be on my "to do list" - seeing this again.  It should be included on the tour stops!!  I know this is not possible, but if you are reading this, you now know of a secret place to stop and see.
