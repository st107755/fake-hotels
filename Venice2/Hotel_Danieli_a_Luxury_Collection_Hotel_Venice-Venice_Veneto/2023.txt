We booked the Hotel Danieli for three nights as part of a two week trip to Italy in June.It was chosen based on the reviews &  It's a Starwood property which I am a Gold member. Booked a deluxe room. The cost nearly 575 Euros a night.  Upon entering the room the first time, we noticed how musty & old the room smelled. If you suffer from allergies bring your bronchodilators. Upon entering the room each day, we had to adjust to the smell. The air conditioner barely cooled the room & the temperature outside was hot/humid & in the mid 80's. The a/c could not keep up & we had to keep the shades closed all day to help keep the heat out for a cooler nights sleep. The view out the window was a noisy alleyway & a satellite tv dish. The furnishings were dated & worn. Lighting was poor.â€¦
