I took the train from Milan to Venice. While the train station was a little far from the Danieli, the hotel was centrally located to everything else. We were just steps from Piazzo San Marco, high end shopping and numerous restaurants. The hotel kindly accommodated an early check-in. The pictures do not do the lobby justice, its definitely something to see for yourself. The hotel is so beautiful we elected to take the stairs up 3 flights each time we needed to leave or return to our room. Check-in staff was very friendly and welcoming! The concierge desk was helpful and informative. They also hold onto your large room key whenever you leave the hotel. We stayed in a Dandola suite. The room was decorated in a pastel pink and had a separate living area, a beautiful marble bathroomâ€¦
