I have always wanted to stay at this hotel since I was a teenager and saw it in the movie Only You.  It did not disappoint! Beautiful hotel in the middle of Venice.  The view from the rooftop was breathtaking and we loved watching all the boats from there.  The hotel is in walking distance to everything restaurants and shopping.
