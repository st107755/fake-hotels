Stayed just the one night pre-cruise, this hotel is delightfully located on the water front moments from St Marks Square and the Bridge of Sighs. Our arrival by speedboat, through the gondolas, under a bridge, only to step off straight into the side door of the hotel was lovely. The ancient palace is a period piece which still manages to provide first class accommodation. Lovely room in a period style but with all mod-cons and effective air conditioning plus a very comfortable bed. Breakfast on the terrace the next morning was a delight with lovely views across the water to the islands and lido with the odd cruise ship moving in or out. Not suprisingly drinks on the terrace and in the bar were very expensive.
