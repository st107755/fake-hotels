I feel fortunate to have stayed in this old beauty.  We were in a perfectly decorated Dandelo suite in the oldest section of the hotel.  This stay exceeded my expectations.  Everything and everyone was wonderful.  The welcome champagne and fruit from Silver were unexpected lovely treats.  It was a peaceful retreat at night with open windows and no sounds but the beautiful church bells.  They also serve the best drinks in the city off of the stunning lobby.
