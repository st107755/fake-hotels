Beautiful lobby area and wonderful bathrooms in the bedroom. Fantastic location and stunning views from the top terrace where you have a spoiling breakfast with everything you could want.  Definitely worth having a drink in the lobby with a great pianist but the drinks are expensive.  The rooms are quite dark. The reason I was disappointed by this hotel was the staff, sadly they were incredibly slow. After being there 4 days I got stopped at the door when trying to come in as they didn't recognise that I was staying there. There was a lack of personal touches and good service to be able to give more stars sadly.  If service was better this hotel would of got 4 stars because it's beautiful and so well located
