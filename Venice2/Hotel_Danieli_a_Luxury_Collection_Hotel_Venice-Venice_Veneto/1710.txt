Hotel was at a good location, water taxi station just right in front of hotel.  Check in was fast and smooth. We stayed at the executive suite and room was spacious, clean and quiet.Service was not too bad, concierge were friendly and able to give accurate information and directions. They are always ready and prepared to serve you. Walking distance to most of the tourist attractions. We were able to visit those attractions, go for shopping and go back to the hotel room, drop our bags and go out again. Stunning and amazing view just right outside the hotel at night!
