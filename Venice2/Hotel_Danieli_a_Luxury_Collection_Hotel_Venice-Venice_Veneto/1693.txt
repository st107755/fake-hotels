We didn't actually stay at the hotel, my wife really needed the loo rather late at night. So she dashed into the hotel with me following and asked the concierge if she could use the facilities, he was very polite and directed her to them whilst I admired the hotel. Hopefully on our next visit we would be able to consider staying at the Danieli.
