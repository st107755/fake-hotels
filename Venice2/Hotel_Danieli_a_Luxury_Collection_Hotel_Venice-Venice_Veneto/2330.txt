We stayed here in July and it was a wonderful experience.  Absolute decadence, from the water taxi €95 which we shared with a deiightful excentrc history lecturer who was about to explain venice to the the cruise ship people, to the wonderful entrance, a warm welcome, lovely room, unbelivable views when we opened the window we could touch the hundreds of tourists passing by from our fantastic view.  Did not have breakfast €55 eaxh was too much for our pockets but got lovely coffee from the cafe round the corner.  Sheets and bed were superb, all in all a ridiculously expensive but wonderful experience.
