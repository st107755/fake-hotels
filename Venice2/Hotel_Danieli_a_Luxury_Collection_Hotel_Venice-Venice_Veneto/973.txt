Greeted with champagne and cookies in room, overlooking Grand Canal, spectacular views from breakfast room. If you want old world charm in historic building stay here. Lobby bar with snacks great. Even with Aqua Alta on high tide evening staff attentive and added to real Venetian experience. Don't understand the negative reviews. If you're looking for ultra modern Manhattan skyscraper don't stay here. We have been to Venice over 10 times before and will only stay at Danieli from now on.
