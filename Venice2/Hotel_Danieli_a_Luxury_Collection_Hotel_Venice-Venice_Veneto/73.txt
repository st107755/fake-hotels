Walking around St. Mark's and we came upon the famous Hotel Danieli. We walked in and started to explore. Walked upstairs to the terrace restaurant. Found amazing views of the Grand Canal and were welcomed to the terrace by the waiters. Sat right along the balcony and took in all the amazing sites below and all around us. Ordered two glasses of wine, a rose and valpocella from Verona. Both were delicious. We sat for several hours taking the amazing view of the Grand Canal and all the action surrounding it. The glasses of wine, while pricey, along with the priceless setting should not be missed.
