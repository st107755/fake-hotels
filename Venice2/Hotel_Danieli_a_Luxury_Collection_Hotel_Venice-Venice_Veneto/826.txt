My husband and I booked the Danieli months ago because we needed a hotel with elevators for a member of our party of four. Life got complicated and we learned we'd be traveling as a couple. The concierge at the Danieli had been very helpful and responsive to our queries via email about room accessibility and location. Then, when we needed to cancel half the booking, they took it in stride and remained very pleasant.  We arrived on the 19th for a three-night stay in a superior room. We we blown away when we were escorted to a beautiful two-room suite over-looking the canal. They never discussed the upgrade with us and we assume it was due to our SPG status but I like to think it was the darling concierge.   The facility is as advertised but, honestly, the pictures cannot dueâ€¦
