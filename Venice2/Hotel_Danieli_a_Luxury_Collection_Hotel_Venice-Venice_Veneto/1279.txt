We used our Starpoints to stay at Hotel Danieli in June 2015 and were blown away by its opulence. Staying at Danieli is the equivalent to staying at a living museum. The floors and walls are marble; the walls are adorned with museum-quality paintings; live piano music fills the lobby each night; and the list goes on. Our room was very large and was well appointed. The location could not be better -- on the water across from the main vaporetto stop, next door to the Palazzo del Doge, and two minutes from Piazza San Marco. The price tag is not for the faint of heart, but if you can afford it or have Starpoints, it is a uniquely indulgent experience in the heart of Venice.
