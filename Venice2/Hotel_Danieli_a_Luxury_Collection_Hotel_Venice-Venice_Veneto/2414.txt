This was meant to be a highlight but unfortunately this was the abject disappointment.  The service was appalling. A waiter in the very overpriced terrace restaurant was actually chewing gum on the floor. The food was average beyond belief. !!   Absolute apathy from the staff who are unprofessional and lacking any real joy.  Venice is stunning ..The Danieli show be the jewel in the crown.  However it is a drap piece on tinsel washing up against the Grand Canal ..  Such a pity ......
