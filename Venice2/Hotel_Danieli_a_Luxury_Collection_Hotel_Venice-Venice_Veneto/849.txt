We enjoyed a four night stay at the end of August into September in a lagoon view suite. The suite had all the amenities you would expect of a five star but with the added factor of  the spectacular view l. Sitting on the terrace at sunset is simply fantastic. The staff are charming. The head concierge is particularly helpful. Breakfast is chaotic but again the view from the terrace makes up for it and the food is decent.
