hotel danielli has great location, breakfast was great with nice views. room was small until we complained and got larger room. service was spotty. there were some great people carlotta at front desk, luigi and Heitor at concierge. luca the manager was very helpful but i don't want to know the manager. the fact that i met the manager attests to fact that there were problems. missed wakeup calls, no newspaper in the morning, archaic room key system were relatively minor nuisances. one concierge referred me to the internet when i asked about arranging a walking tour.  i thought he should go to the internet for me. the fitness center was being renovated for part of my stay.  Luca kindly arranged for me to use workout facility at the westin, another SPG resort but who wants to walkâ€¦
