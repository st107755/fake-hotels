This hotel is stunning. I was fortunate enough to travel with clients and we had the historic suite. Lobby is stunning, rooms are regal and Venice is truly a magical place.  The breakfast was fantastic as well. If you can afford it I highly recommend the historic suites. Truly a once in a lifetime experience.
