Our room didn’t have any views to it but was nice overall. Room had all the amenities we needed and spacious . The lobby was really cool to relax and listen to live piano player.  The bar drinks were good. Hotel has good location next to canal, water train, gondolas, and souvenir shopping. We bought multi-day passes for water train and used it daily. Hotel was hard to find late night once they closed the main entrance.   Only bad part was WiFi didn’t work almost our entire stay.
