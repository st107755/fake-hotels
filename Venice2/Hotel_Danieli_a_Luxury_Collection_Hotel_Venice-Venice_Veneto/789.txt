So many things I would love to do if I managed the Danieli as it is so sad to see what surely must be one of the most beautiful hotels in Europe slowly falling from grace . Curtain off the bar area to make it more intimate , get rid of all the dried flowers , make the reading room on the left into a tearoom, change all of the lighting ,put some heaters on the rook deck ,  change some staff ( except Elana for she is brilliant ) I could go on and on doing things to polish up this spectacular gem .  Because of its beauty it remains 5star but the quality is in reality 4 star but it could  and should be 6 star .  But for all its faults the Danieli is still an amazing hotel.
