I've learnt in my life that easy is the opposite of simple, so my review on Danieli will be "easy": This XIV Century Palace in the heart of Venice is a lifetime experience. Its atmosphere inspires every human being to feel noble. My 21 year-old son has said something wise about Danieli: "It's impossible to be in a bad mood over here". And, if I were to keep it "simple", I'd spend hours describing every single detail that makes Danieli so exclusive... Glad to meet a Brazilian fellow working at the Concierge, Mr. Heitor, who's made our stay even more enjoyable. Please don't die before staying at Danieli.
