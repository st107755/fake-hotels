Knowing the history and ranking of this hotel, our expectations were admittedly high.  However, after the initial positive impression of the beautiful lobby, we were disappointed.  The room was much smaller than any other hotel room I've stayed in in Europe.  We were in the new section and the decor was, in my opinion, tacky.  The whole room seemed to be a bordeaux red velvet.  The bathroom was tiny.  We also noticed a lot of hard water stains on the tile of the bathroom and on the tub, which I would not expect to see at a five star hotel.  The carpet on the stairs and hallways was very worn.  The worst part, though, was that every single staff member we encountered seemed to be expecting a gratuity, even for the most menial help.  It was the point that we felt uncomfortable. â€¦
