We spent 3 days there prior to taking a cruise, The staff was sharp, accommodating and full of knowledge. If you are staying in the wing where you have to cross over the canal first, finding your room can be confusing the first time. Follow the person bringing up your luggage. The rooms are spacious and very quiet. SPEAKING OF QUIET, DON'T SLEEP IN. GET UP TO THE TERRACE RESTAURANT WHEN IT OPENS IN THE MORNING. THE VIEW ARE SOME OF THE BEST IN THE CITY.
