On a recent trip to Italy, with a quick visit to Venice, we booked a room at the Hotel Danieli. Unfortunately, I don't have a last name, but Elena took superb care of us. I can't say enough about how kind and efficient she was. After a night spent in the Munich train station due to the closing of Austria's border, we were treated like royalty at the Danieli. I obviously didn't see all of the rooms, but our room was fabulous and the hotel lobby is gorgeous! If you don't dine at the Restaurant Terrazza Danieli, I highly recommend at least a drink on the terrace bar, which overlooks the Grand Canal. The sunset was beautiful. The hotel is just around the corner from San Marco square and St. Mark's Cathedral. If you can afford a private water taxi, it brings you to a side entrance,â€¦
