This is a tremendous hotel. Of course it looks amazing and so Venetian but what really makes it are their staff. Make full use of the concierge desk, it is probably the best in the world. From the lady turning down the bed to the maitre'd they smile all day and no guest is too much trouble.  Looking forward to coming back.
