I had a truly world class experience in the Danieli and cannot recommend it more.  Perfect location, beautifully designed rooms with remarkable views, yet quiet, the best roof terrace views in Venice, and the staff was simply wonderful.  Given how busy the hotel is, and how demanding the guests, the staff does a remarkable job across the board.
