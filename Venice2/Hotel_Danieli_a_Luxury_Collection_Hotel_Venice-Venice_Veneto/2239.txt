What an incredibly beautiful hotel.  We were lucky enough to be taken here for a 2 night stay by a company via my partners business.  The hotel is stunning at every turn.  Superbly located between St Marks Square & The Bridge of Sighs.   The front desk staff were always welcoming and charming, the same could not be said I'm afraid of some of the waiting staff.  We were served breakfast in the Marco Polo room due to the large group so this may not be true of the staff in the main restaurant.  The bar  and room service prices were ridiculously expensive but I suppose they can get away with it because they are such a high class hotel.  The room was delightful, the bathroom was very dated but had it been updated it would have probably lost the shabby chic appeal.
