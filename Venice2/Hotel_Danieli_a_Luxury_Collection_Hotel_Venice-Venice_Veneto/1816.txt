The lobby alone is worth a visit.  It is actually in several buildings and can be a bit confusing to find your room.  Location is right next to St. Marks Square.  Hotel staff was very helpful.  One important tip... if you can afford to stay at this hotel, and it is god awful expensive, spend the extra money for a private water taxi from either the train station or airport.  We made the mistake of arriving by train but then taking the Vaporetto to the hotel.  Way too much hassle with even just one suitcase.  And beware of the pickpockets on the dock which is a perfect place for them to work.  We left Venice by air and the best money we spent was for the speedboat direct to the airport.  Well worth the money and if you are staying at the Danieli you are obviously not traveling onâ€¦
