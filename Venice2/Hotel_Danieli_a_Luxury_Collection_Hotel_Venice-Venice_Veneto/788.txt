You will be amazed when first stepping into this hotel.The architecture is stunning. The lobby is absolutely beautiful. Our first room was a little noisy due to a bar down below but the staff quickly found us a new room without any drama. It is right on the Grand Canal and St. Marks Square is a few steps away. I would highly recommend!
