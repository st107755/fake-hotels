We stayed at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had a wonderful time but not due to the hotel. We arranged an airport pick-up for over eur 200 but no-one was there. Turns out to be a van tranfer of 2 mins to be dropped off at the  normal venice watertaxi stand. The way back for some reason is just around eur 115.   The room that was allocated to us didnt have any daylight and looked into a brick wall. This was a premium deluxe room according to management...only after complaining we got moved to another room, which was significantly better.  Staff in general is quite arrogant, unattentive and doesnt really pay attention to what you say. Just a small example, we went up to take some pictures at the roof terrace around 12 and were rudely told to come back after 15â€¦
