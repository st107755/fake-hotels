The hotel is incredibly beautiful, the room is spacious and very comfortable.  We had a terrace overlooking the canal which was amazing.   However, as another reviewer mentioned, the front desk is very busy, when we called with a few questions, they never answered.  The room service line was busy also. We had a 85 Euro credit for dinner in the terrace restaurant as part of booking the hotel through American Express however we were not able to use that either because the terrace restaurant was booked both nights.  When speaking with the reception desk to see if we could use the credit elsewhere in the hotel for dinner, I was told that I could use it in the bar (I don't drink) for a club sandwich or cheese.  Since we were looking for something a little nicer for dinner than a clubâ€¦
