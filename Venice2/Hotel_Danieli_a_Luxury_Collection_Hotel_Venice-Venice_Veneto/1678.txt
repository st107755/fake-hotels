 Stayed here over three days, and immediately when checking in, the front desk was unsmiling and seemingly impatient with us. The service we received was substandard for a hotel of such renown, and we were asked twice by the lobby doormen if we really stayed at this hotel.   we were placed in the renovated wing, but I failed to see how 'renovated' it was, as it didn't not seem particularly modern or large. The room itself was tiny, and even the bathroom shower head leaked! At the very least, the mattress and pillows were nice, but that's the best I can say about the room.   For a hotel with such fantastic reviews, I was surprised at how bad the service was, how impatient the staff were, and the small rooms. At least the lobby looks nice.
