I honestly thought it was a bit over rated. No question the location is terrific (Gritti is probably a nudge better) and the interiors are exquisite ...   BUT I feel that the rest on their laurels a bit and seemed to take the reputation a bit too seriously.  Front desk always felt hurried and people were less attentive to their guest in front of them and seemed more focused on processing them like a factory's. The bellman were quite nice and helpful.   The bellman/concierge steered us to a Murano glass tour (it's a high pressure racket -- don't do it) which I found very disappointing for a hotel of this caliber -- ESPECIALLY since I asked point blank if this was going to be a high pressure sales event and was assured it was not.   If I went back I'd try Gritti instead or maybeâ€¦
