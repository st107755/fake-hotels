After staying in Rome at a 5 star hotel and in Florence at a 3 star hotel, we were expecting this to be the crowning glory of our vacation. Now, it was an absolutely beautiful hotel.  The lobby is in itself artwork to be admired.  The check-in staff was knowledgable and friendly. However, we were taken to our room, which was not in the actual hotel Danieli but an addition to the left of the hotel.  That in itself was fine because the renovation is beautiful.  But our room was small, the bed at first arranged as two twins (we are married and asked for a King), and the view was the worst of any hotel I've ever stayed.  We looked out to a wall.  Not the romantic view of the water we were expecting.  The hotel quickly made the twins into a King, but it still isn't as comfortable asâ€¦
