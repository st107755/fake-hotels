Danieli is a hotel with 6 stars history (14th Cent. palace) 4-5 stars service (Starwood hotels standards) and 10 stars price. Rooms need urgent renovation (like Sacher in Salzburg for example) ie retaining old style but new beds, closets, windows etc.. Overall it's not worth the price as 80% of it goes to image and location.
