I walked up to a beautiful building along the waterfront.  We entered the lobby thru double person revolving doors.  Inside,  It is total old world Italian charm. Well dressed employees, stunning decor, opulent surroundings, stunning blown glass chandeliers.  Clean, friendly, absolute loveliness. Thumbs up..
