Fantastic stay at the Danieli - next door to St. Marks and Doge's Palace - opposite multiple boat stops, so easy to get to anywhere - fantastic service: typical lag between call and delivery < 5 minutes; concierge remembered to book me a table at a great restaurant 2 days later as the restaurant was closed in between with no reminders  Only issue: restaurant charges cover charges even to hotel guests!!
