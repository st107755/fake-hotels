Upon arrival we were blown away by how beautiful this hotel is.  Pure Venetian.  The room was very comfortable and our view of the Grand Canal made it even more enjoyable.  Breakfast at the terrace restaurant was very nice and the view could not be beat.  Staff at the hotel was always nice and helpful.  reason 4 stars instead of 5 is based on the wifi.  Hotel as this price level should not be charging guests for wifi.
