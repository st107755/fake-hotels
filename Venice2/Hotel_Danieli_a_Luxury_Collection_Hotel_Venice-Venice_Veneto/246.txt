Hotel Danieli was a class apart, from the decor to the rooms to the service. The Luxury Collection Hotel held up to its high standards with even the small details and bath products in the room. We got a room on the 4th floor with a sprawling terrace overlooking the lagoon. The water taxi pulls up directly to the Hotel. The breakfast on the rooftop was generous. Prefer to sit indoors than outdoors as the seagulls are pretty bold about grabbing your food. The hotel would have gotten ten stars but fell a little short.... no coffee maker or iron in the room. And this to most is a pretty basic necessity. Who wants a dress ironed by the housekeeping for 21 euros? Or pack iron free clothing for the trip. This would be my only suggestion. Or else, great property, perfect locationâ€¦
