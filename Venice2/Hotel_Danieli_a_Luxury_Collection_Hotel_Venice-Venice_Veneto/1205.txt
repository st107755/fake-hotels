The Hotel Danieli is extremely well located, right on the lagoon and a short walk to St. Marks square.  I am giving it 4 Stars and a 90 point rating as Wine Spectator does wine, where you compare value for the cost.  The location of the hotel, its well appointed public areas, and its superb staff were all top notch.  However, it is very expensive, our room was cramped on the small European style, there was no view, the bathroom had zero counter space, they loaned you an iron but took it back the next morning, and actually charged us 25 Euros as a cover charge in the restaurant, even though we ordered food and drinks (we only ate there once as a result).  We think the latter was because of the lagoon view from the terrace of the restaurant, but no one advised us of the charge,â€¦
