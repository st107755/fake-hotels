We were there for Biennale. The rooms are quite old and does need a renovation. The staff is not very friendly- Concierge guys are a bit intimidating even as they stare you down as you walk in. What I do love is that this hotel has its own speed boat docking area which is very convenient to and from the airport! Itâ€™s location is excellent!
