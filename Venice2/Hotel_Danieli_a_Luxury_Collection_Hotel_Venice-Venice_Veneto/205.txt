We had an amazing time and the first time in Venice. The hotel Danielle was centrally located and although the first day a little underwater the staff was excellent. We loved the Classic look and feel of the hotel and the rooftop restaurant was amazing. We traveled easily on foot throughout the plaza and nearby shops. We found Venice a great place to visit and sight-see. Danielle's rooms were well maintained and staff was helpful and well organized.
