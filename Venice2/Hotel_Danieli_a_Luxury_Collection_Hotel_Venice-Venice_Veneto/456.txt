We spent Christmas Day lunch with friends at Hotel Danieli in the rooftop Resturant. We throughly enjoyed the fine dining and food was exquisite.  Staff were very friendly and attentive from start to finish. Amazing wine selection, and a wonderful sommelier to help choose from an extensive list. View would be amazing on a clear day
