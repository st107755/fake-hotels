One of the grande dame hotels of venice but now part of a group....such a shame as not as good as the Gritti Palace. Do you want upmarket customers or conventions of classless business people? This weekend you were overrun with the latter which meant no lunch on Friday for us at the restaurant! Check in average and the concierge really miserable....this is meant to be a five star hotel guys... Breakfast service really awful and muddled but good food. Dinner was good but expensive and the restaurant almost empty but for a rather noisy piano. You live on your location but care not for your guests! We won't be back I am afraid but will leave it to the badly dressed convention crowd...
