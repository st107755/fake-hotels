My wife and I had 2 nights, booked at short notice at half the advertised price but still plenty of money!  Lovely room but it is the the most I have ever paid for a 15 foot view across to the laundry opposite!  Of course the location is great, the entrance hall impressive and the terrace for lunch in the sun is absolutely memorable!  Another big advantage is getting the conceige to book other restaurants for you - they were always pleasant, helpful and they did not fail!  Service on the terrace was OK (they forget two of our requests) but is not excellent and for the price it should be!  To stay in the Danieli for us Brits is, of course, a historic experience but it's best days are behind it - in places it is shabby.  By today's standards it is definitely not 5* but it is stillâ€¦
