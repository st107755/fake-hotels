My husband & I stayed here for a long weekend at the end of April. Well,what a stunning hotel & breath taking staircase.  From arriving in our private boat on the canal we knew we were in for a luxurious stay at this hotel.  We had a luxury double room overlooking the canal in the main hotel,which was very traditional and just perfect. Reception were very helpful with any needs.  We had drinks on the roof terrace one sunny afternoon  and the view was outstanding. Great location for your stay in venice as there's so much to do, you won't waste time if your already in the perfect location!  Highly recommend.
