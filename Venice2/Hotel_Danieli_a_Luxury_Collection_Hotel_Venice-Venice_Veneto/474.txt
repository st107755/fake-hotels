Of course this is a stunning hotel in an even more stunning location. BUT we arrived by vaporetto, so entered via the front revolving doors, which are not the easiest to enter with luggage. Struggling through, we were not given any help at all. Then a long wait at reception for our room. It was after 2, and the room wasn't ready. But they were kind enough to make up for the wait and the room not being ready to upgrade us to a fabulous room looking over the lagoon, which also wasn't ready. They said they would call when it was, in around 45 minutes. Finally around 5 the room was ready - 3 hours later! The breakfast was excellent, on the balcony, but the staff were really unfriendly. I did not want to sit at the back of the terrace and see nothing, I wanted to be nearer the front,â€¦
