We just returned from a wonderful visit to the Biennale in Venice. The Daniele was the place to stay for a great setting, a luxurious deluxe suite upgrade (thanks Amex Platinum), great views and stupendous service -- especially by Luca at the front desk. The only negative is that the 85 euro food credit provided by Amex was eaten up by the restaurant cover charge (16 euros/pp), a bottle of water and a shared appetizer! Beware: entrees can easily run 60 euros plus! But to be fair, the food is the best in town and if you're there for breakfast you'll enjoy the amazing terrace view, good food and service. When we were departing the water taxi we ordered broke down. Daniele staff immediately jumped into action and took our luggage a distance away, called another taxi and got us onâ€¦
