The room overlooking the waterfront and service were excellent as expected. Eating breakfast on the open rooftop was like sitting in box seats at a wonderful concert, overlooking everything. Lunch was a different story. Still beautiful, still well presented and tasteful, but OMG how expansive. That said , I might just do it again.
