We visited this hotel 15 years ago to celebrate my wife's birthday and were amazed  by the excellent service and the facilities. I arrange this visit to celebrate another of my wife's birthday. At check in we discovered that this hotel was part of the Marriott group. We were told because of my wife's birthday we were informed that our room had been upgraded. In our room we discovered a bottle of Prosecco and a flan with the compliments of the management. This was a very nice gesture. Our bedroom was poorly illuminated both at night and during daylight. The views from our window was a passage way. We discovered when we went to bed that the passageway was used by many people making a noise all night plus below our window was a service door to the hotel giving access to sack cartâ€¦
