We stayed in the original building which was well appointed but claustrophobic. The windows were nailed shut. Our friends were lucky enough to be in the newest building with beautiful furnishings and a stunning balcony overlooking the other islands. All the employees were gracious and helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location close to St. MAr's Square & the Doge Palace. I would definitely return.
