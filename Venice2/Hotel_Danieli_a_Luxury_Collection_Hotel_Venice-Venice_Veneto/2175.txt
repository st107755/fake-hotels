We looked forward to staying at this hotel for months but on arrival we were very disappointed. The female receptionists were rude and unhelpful, we booked a deluxe room for three and the third bed was a camp bed  for a man over 6ft!   When I spoke to male receptionist he said thats how it  is - I asked to speak to manager  but I never heard from him.  We payed Â£627 pounds for one night and I had to sleep on an uncomfortable camp bed as my tall son was too tall to fit on it!!!      The breakfast was very good though on the terrace overlooking venice - I think you pay for the view NOT for the service.  I would not recommend this hotel.
