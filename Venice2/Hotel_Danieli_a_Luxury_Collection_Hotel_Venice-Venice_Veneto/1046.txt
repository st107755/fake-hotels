The hotel is absolutely stunning and in the most wonderful position, literally round the corner from St Marks square.  All the staff are welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast on the roof top terrace was a lovely experience, if you can forget briefly how much it cost.  My only complaint would be the building noise from next door which began early each morning and went on through the day, nothing really however that the hotel could do anything about.
