We did not stay here thankfully,but called in for a meal and drink in the bar.If you read back through the TA reviews you will see that a lot of people have commented on the staff .They are very supercilious and unfriendly you are not made to feel welcome ,in fact you  are probably looked on with indifference. The food in the bar cost 125 euros for 2 with drinks and we are talking about bar snacks here, not a meal.   However to be fair the quality of the food was very good. I would never consider staying here when in Venice however , paying that amount of money I certainly  would expect better treatment.
