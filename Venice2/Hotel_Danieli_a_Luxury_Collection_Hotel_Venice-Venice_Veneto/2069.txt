Great location but this isn't a 5 star hotel. No facilities we could see and there was no real engagement from the staff. Air con didn't work, tv didn't work and no one seems to care as far as we could tell. Staff are surly and not friendly. That said Venice is spectacular and well worth a visit - just try a different hotel.
