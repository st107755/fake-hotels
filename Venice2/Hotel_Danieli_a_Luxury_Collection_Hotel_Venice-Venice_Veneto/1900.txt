The location, on the Grand Canal, is excellent.  Almost adjacent to the Dodges Palace, a few steps from Piazza San Marco and the Basilica.  There are Alilaguna and Vapporetti stops in front of the hotel.  Important if you are traveling with more than a mid size suitcase.  Dragging luggage around Venice, up and down the many bridges over the canals is a challange. I did not realize when I was making arrangements for our stay that the hotel is composed of three palace joined together by bridges.  The lobby is magnificent as are several other public areas. There are some structural issues, resulting from the significant water issues Venice faces,requiring bracing.  That only detracts minimally from the enchantment of the lobby and beautiful staircase. We had a three night stayâ€¦
