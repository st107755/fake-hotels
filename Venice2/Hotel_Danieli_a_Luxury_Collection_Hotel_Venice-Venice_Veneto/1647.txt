One of the more opulent hotels situated next to St. Mark's Square. Upon arrival, we were upgraded which only added to the experience. This is as centrally located as you can get. The staff goes out of their way to help.Pamper yourself.  There is no fitness center, which was surprising in a hotel of this caliber.
