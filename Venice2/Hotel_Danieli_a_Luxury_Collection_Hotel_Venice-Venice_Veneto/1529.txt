This hotel, surely rates near the top of unique hotel experiences. The location right by  Piazza San marco, is ideal.... The hotel is stylish and an experience. The room we had overlooking the canal - very romantic and modern, without compromising  too much on the original 14th century feel. Breakfast on the terrace is a must when staying at this hotel.
