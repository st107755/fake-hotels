This luxurious hotel is indeed a Venetian Palace so I think you can imagine how it looks like . It’s stunning beautiful. The location is perfect quite near St .Mark’s Square and one of the main Vapporetto stations  ( Burano,Murano , the grand Canal etc. ) .  It has its own private gondolas  Lots of restaurants very near .  Service : very good  Rooms are a bit old but of good size and many have a view to the Laguna .  I think it’s a great place to stay .  Price : very expensive.
