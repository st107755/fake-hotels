We have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Danieli and the other reviews hit the nail on the head. This hotel although not cheap is beautiful, a truly iconic building with fantastic views of the water ways of Venice. As my wife could sleep through a war she didnt notice but I was woken most nights due to noise outside but that's the price you pay for the location. The price of the food and bar drinks are ridiculous but they are on the menu before you order so it was our fault. The two of us had a starter, main course and one of the cheaper bottles of wine on the terrace one evening and it was 280 euros and the food was just above average. The main problem is the staff, they just do not listen to you. Believe me compared to some people who stay their we didn't have anyâ€¦
