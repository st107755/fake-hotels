Loved this beautiful historic hotel.  Venice is one of our favourite places and the Danieli is somewhere we always hoped to stay one day.  It did not disappoint - started the day with an extensive breakfast (including sparkling wine) on the breathtaking terrace.  Luckily we obtained a very good deal with citalia which included breakfast.  We stayed in a standard room in the older building next to the main one which was very roomy with a large marble bathroom and the most comfortable bed ever.  All staff were very friendly and helpful - would definitely like to return one day.
