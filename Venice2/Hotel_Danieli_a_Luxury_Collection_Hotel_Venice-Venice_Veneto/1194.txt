Pricey hotel, but the incredible staff brings the value to life in this historic gem RIGHT on the bay.  Reception ( we really enjoyed Vittoria, who recently started at this property and was just lovely ) and Concierge (all of them) were just wonderful!    VERY comfortable bed...dreamy.  We stayed in a room without a view b/c we were there on a Star Friend (thru Starwood Hotels) rate and didn't want to ask for too much. They were very accommodating to ensure we had a NON-smoking room, which was perfect.  Our room ended up being very QUIET, because we weren't on the main thoroughfare of non-stop tourists...yay!  Our room was "wallpapered" in beautiful silk fabric...gorgeous.  If you are wealthy, it is worth asking for a suite upstairs - they are as GRAND as it gets with tremendousâ€¦
