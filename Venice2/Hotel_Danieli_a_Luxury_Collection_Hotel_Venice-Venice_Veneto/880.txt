Through my frustrations of not knowing where to stay in Venice, I opted to choose a very nice hotel near the Piazza San Marco and my choice couldn't have been better. We pulled up to the door via water taxi. Fun view of the canal below. This is a beautiful hotel inside and some movies have been filmed inside too. We were upgraded to a suite and really felt special. ALL the amenities you could possibly want. The location ended up being perfect for all the tours we signed up for. You won't be disappointed. Great staff, English speaking.
