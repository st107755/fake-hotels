While touring the Doge's Palace, we looked out the window and noticed a roof terrace across the way that seemed to be the perfect place to rest our weary feet after a long tour.  When we left the Palace, we went in search and discovered it was the beautiful Danieli ;Hotel.  Every word we can think of to describe how wonderful the terrace is seems to be some kind of cliche.  So, we have to stick to the facts.  There is no better view in Venice, right at the mouth of the Grand Canal.  The staff are beyond superb, taking wonderful care of us.  We enjoyed crisp cold prosecco and bar food, and a beautiful afternoon.  We can't wait to return for dinner.
