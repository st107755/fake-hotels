Of course the Danieli is special but it needs more effort to make it outstanding. When you are paying over €600 per night you expect the basin in the quite small bathroom to hold WATER and when it does not and you tell Housekeeping you expect it to be fixed. It was not.   When you are spending €95 on a main dish  you expect the stones to cook the beef to be HOT, they were not.   Excellent location, great breakfast and good front desk service but for the price not best value.
