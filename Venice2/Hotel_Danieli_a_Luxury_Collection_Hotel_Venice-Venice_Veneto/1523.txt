Stayed here in 2012 as part of our honeymoon trip.  Needless to say it was a stunning entry and we truly enjoyed the atmosphere.  After a long voyage we were in desperate need of some coffee and went upstairs for a cup but they were closed...  what a pleasant surprise when we were invited to sit down and were served regardless!  Wonderful service.
