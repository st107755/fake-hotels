I have been to Venice many times and have been dying to stay here just to see the guest rooms. They were clean and spotless and the bathroom was all marble and amazing. The location was perfect and entire staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel has a rooftop with food, drinks and dinner and lunch with an amazing view.
