Having read several negative reviews regarding the Danieli hotel staff and quality of the rooms, I was a bit apprehensive to stay here. However, I can honestly say that my stay was 100% positive, from my communications with the hotel prior to my arrival , through checkout, I found the staff very professional, responsive to my needs and extremely friendly.  The hotel's location is perfect for visiting the sights and accessing transportation - right on the Grand Canal.  The room was exceptionally clean, quiet, and perfectly equipped with the amenities necessary for a comfortable stay. Although smaller than hotel rooms in the US, it was still quite functional.  I would certainly recommend the Danieli, without reservations, to anyone seeking a luxury experience in Venice.  Thank youâ€¦
