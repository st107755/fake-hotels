Location is unbeatable: right in front of the Gran Canal, with a boat station right in front, 5 minutes walk from St Marks square. The hotel is an old palazzo that has the antique charm - expect that when you book. grounds are very beautiful, luxurious in the old style, to be admired. The hotel is actually composed by 2 separate building and you can notice that walking on the corridors. Old noisy floor wood corridors add certain charm.  Room: expected more for the price, worn out, big, by far not the best decor I have seen, still in the antique theme but not updated. Bed was not one of the best I have stayed (and would expect that for what was paid).
