Just back from the Danieli in Venice; the hotel is undeniably stunning although our rooms on the 2nd floor in the main palace overlooked a small side street that tended to be noisy early in the morning and late at night. Our standard rooms were spacious and lovely although the bathrooms were small, cramped and rather run-down - not at all consistent with the opulence of the hotel in general. Service was extremely substandard overall - we found the public bathrooms without toilet paper; maids did not remove empty glasses and cups from our room when doing the turn-down service; and a bedside lamp with a nonworking bulb which I removed in order to demonstrate that it needed to be replaced, remained untouched. Not what you would expect from a 5* hotel, and certainly not consistentâ€¦
