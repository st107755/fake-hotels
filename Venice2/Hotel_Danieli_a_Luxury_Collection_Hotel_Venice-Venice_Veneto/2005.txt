The room we stayed in was spacious considering the location. We had a king size bed, a small seperate sitting area, and a large bathroom. The closet was somewhat limited. The AC was decent considering what we have experienced in Europe. The concierge staff was fairly good except for one individual who was somewhat stuffy. The staff in general was a hit or miss. Some were pleasant and helpful, while others were stuffy. I asked for a wake up call for 4 AM since I needed to be at the airport by 5 AM. I never received the call. Oh, and they tried to hard sell me on a breakfast deal with the room. I felt that strategy more appropriate for the street vendors. Overall it was a decent stay.
