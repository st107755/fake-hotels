What an amazing stay, super nice room ( you got to pay to get premium room) and super friendly staff. Valeria at the checking in desk was super 👍 nice and the rest of the staff as well. The location is super , you cannot get better than this. The Terrace for breakfast has an stunning view of the grand canal. You have plenty options at the buffet . The room very nice, bed super comfortable and bath shower great. I will definitely will stay here again next year.
