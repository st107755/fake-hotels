The hotel is full of character. If you want full Venetian immersion when you're in Venice, this is the place. We had excellent, attentive service from the moment we booked a room. The concierge staff were very helpful through all phases of our trip. Our room was absolutely superb (luxury lagoon with terrace), with a great view of the Grand Canal and all the going's on down below. The room was a decent size by European standards, bathroom was also very nice. On our group's last night we had an incredible meal at a corner table outside at Terrazza Danieli. The view was just stunning and the food was superb. Only downside is that all of this is quite pricey, especially the Terrazza.  We felt it was a good value overall. Just lovely memories of our stay there.
