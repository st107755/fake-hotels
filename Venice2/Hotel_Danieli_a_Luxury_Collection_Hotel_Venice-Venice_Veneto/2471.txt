Beautiful hotel! very expensive though, however if money is not object then it is a must stay. I will never forget the breakfast on the terrace...how much did it cost- who cares!!! (like I said if you have the money to throw away-throw it) The views from breakfast were the most spectacular I have ever seen. I will remember forever. Was it comfortable, not sure if 2 twins stuck together as a king was so great, was the staff warm and fuzzy...no, did I over pay because I was possibly an American...most definatly, would I stay again...yes.
