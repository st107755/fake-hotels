I went with my friend to Italy and stayed at Hotel Danieli in Venice, Italy.  The staff there were so kind and helpful.  they made our stay there so magical.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!  Chiara was especially wonderful, She was so friendly and helpful! The hotel is one of the most beautiful I have ever stayed in!
