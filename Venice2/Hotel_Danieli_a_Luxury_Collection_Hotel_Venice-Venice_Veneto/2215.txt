We stayed 3 nights at Hotel Danieli, and all I can say it was a wonderful experience.   The hotel is centrally located.   You can grab a water taxi right outside the doors, or if you want to relax on a nice gondola ride it's easily available.   The restaurant on the 4th floor offers amazing breakfast buffets in the morning, and a dinner you would never forget in the evening.  The view from the restaurant overlooks the water, and is very relaxing and beautiful at night.    We had a lovely room, with a nice size bathroom.
