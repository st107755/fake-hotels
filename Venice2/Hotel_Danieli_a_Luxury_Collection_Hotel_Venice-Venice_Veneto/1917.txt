The Danieli is, like a few other Venetian hotels, carved out of a Renaissance palazzo, so it boasts handsome DNA. The plant is baroque and fabulous, and the staff was solicitous and courteous. We felt at home the moment we debarked from the water taxi through the private canal entrance. Our room was amazing, luxuriously appointed with a sizable bathroom and terrace that overlooked the Bacino de Venezia and San Giorgio Maggiore church. A key feature of the suite was the roll-down blackout shutter that gave the room an airtight light seal at night.   Access to the on-premises Terrazza Danieli for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was superb.
