Stayed at this historic hotel for one night using SPG points. Although we stayed at the height of tourist season we were automatically upgraded to a suite overlooking the Grand Canal. Gorgeous view from our room. Hotel staff here extremely nice during our stay. We had room 264, it came with three floor to ceiling windows looking out in two directions, a combined bath/shower, single sink, toilet, bidet, sitting area, writing desk, king size bed, non smoking, dresser, large closet, in room safe large enough to fit two ipads and other items, extra blankets and pillows, air conditioning, and of course the view. Room 264 is a corner room which allows for even more canal viewing. A little noisy because tourists are walking along the waterfront until late into the evening so bringâ€¦
