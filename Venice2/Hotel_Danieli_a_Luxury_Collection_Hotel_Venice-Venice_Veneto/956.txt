Very disappointing experience. Some concierges were borderline lethargic. Check-in and check-out took ages. The room was supposed to have been an upgrade, yet we could not even open a suitcase. Breakfast view was amazing, but charged at a ridiculous price given the quality of the food. Gym equipment although brand new and from a good provider was faulty. Equipment is very limited.
