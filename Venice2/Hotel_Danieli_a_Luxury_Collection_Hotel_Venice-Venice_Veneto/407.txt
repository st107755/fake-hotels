This was a great stay.  Close to everything that you want in Venice and a very nice hotel with wonderful people.  The food was good and breakfast buffet was delicious and plentiful.  If there is one major suggestion (and probably the only reason not given a 5 star rating) was the difficulty in getting to the hotel.  Everyone knows that many of the water taxis are rip offs, and waiting for the water bus with luggage and a family is difficult.  How hard is it for a hotel to maintain their own boat for shuttling to and from the mainland - you are in the hotel business on an island in Venice, but a boat and make it easy on your guests.  Best short term fix, call hotel and have them order a taxi, but be prepared to pay 60 to 90 Euros for a one way ride that takes a maximum of 10â€¦
