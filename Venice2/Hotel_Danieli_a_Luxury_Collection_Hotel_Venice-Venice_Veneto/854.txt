For our 25th anniversary, we wanted to compare 5 star properties in Italy, and Venice Starwood properties in particular (Europa & Regina, Gritti Palace) as well as Londra Palace just down a couple of buildings away. Our experience with Danieli and with Maurizio in particular was the best. He upgraded our room to the best view in Venice. We enjoyed the buffet breakfasts on the roof, and the room service dinner on our lovely balcony (after initial disappointment that the restaurant was fully booked).
