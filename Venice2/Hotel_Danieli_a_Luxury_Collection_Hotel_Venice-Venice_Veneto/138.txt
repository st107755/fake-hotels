We stayed at the Danieli for our 30th wedding anniversary. The last time we stayed was on our honeymoon. How things have changed. The location is still outstanding. However the Hotel and rooms are very tired.The hotel now seems to cater primarily for upmarket package tours. The staff at the reception are super stretched as is the Concierge desk. Service is poor. On two of the days that we stayed there our room was still un cleaned at 4pm yet they were knocking on our door at 8am on our last day keen to get us moving. Breakfast was a queue. Small things make hotels. I told them on booking 2 months before and a week before that it was our 30 anniversary. In most top hotels they clock information like this and might put a personal card in or a small gesture. Not here. Maybe ifâ€¦
