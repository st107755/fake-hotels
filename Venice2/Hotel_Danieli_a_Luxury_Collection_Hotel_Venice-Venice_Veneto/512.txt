Loved looking out our window with a view of Church of the San Giorgio Maggiore---we looked right toward Santa Maria della Salute.  The hotel is located very close to Plaza San Marcos--one walks over Ponte della Paglia with a view of the Bridge of Sighs on their way to the Plaza.  Every morning we enjoyed a breakfast on their rooftop restaurant---the views are spectacular.  We found the concierge desk very helpful, and even though the workout facility is small, all four of us enjoyed using it.  Beautiful lobby--we relaxed while meeting friends there for a drink after a long day of walking.  For us, the location was too tough to beat.
