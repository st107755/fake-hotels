This hotel could not be more welcoming.  Sure, it is beautiful, but the people make it a 5 star.  The concierges were brilliant.  When we wanted a simple, local restaurant recommendation, they always suggested places that were just right for us.  That is a great concierge who is paying attention.  Kudos especially to Filippo Bollani, the head concierge, who is the extreme of charming, knowledgeable and helpful.  He made us fell like the only guests in the hotel.
