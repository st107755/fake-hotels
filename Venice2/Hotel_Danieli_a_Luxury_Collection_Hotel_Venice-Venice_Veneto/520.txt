The rooms are so small I could barely walk. The service wasn't as good as people raved about in their reviews. Definitely don't expect exceptional service at this property.  Some of the concierge and reception employees were quite underwhelming. No smiles and they looked irritated doing their jobs...I asked concierge for a map and he handed me one almost reluctantly! Didn't even open it or give me a quick "the hotel is here" speech. It took forever for the bellman to arrive for the luggage and waited ages for a water taxi as well.   Location is great but a bit crowded with tourists... not as private as the gritti for example.
