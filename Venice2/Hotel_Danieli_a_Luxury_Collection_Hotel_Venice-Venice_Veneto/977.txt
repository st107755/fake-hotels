It is a hotel with beautiful fittings and of historical significance.  But beyond that, I didn't get what the fuss was all about, or why it is so expensive.  Our room was small.  And old.  Maybe it was supposed to be part of the charm, or maybe I had been too tired from travelling, as it was our first stop and we'd travelled over 20 hours.  Having said that, I certainly would have appreciated a bigger space and a higher comfort level, given that fact.
