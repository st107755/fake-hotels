My family and I were extremely excited about staying at the Danieli after hearing such positive reviews from friends and Tripadvisor members, unfortunately we were very disappointed.  The location extremely convenient (the water bus stops right in front, and there is a side entrance for water taxis) and walkable to everywhere, however the hotel itself I would compare to a once beautiful woman for whom the years have not been kind.  The floors slope, the elevator is both slow and jerky, the glass skylight is covered with netting so as not to fall on guests and staff....and the rooms are in desperate need of remodeling. The bathrooms are small and old, and the electrical outlets didn't work very well. It's not that the hotel was dirty (it was very clean), it's just that it is oldâ€¦
