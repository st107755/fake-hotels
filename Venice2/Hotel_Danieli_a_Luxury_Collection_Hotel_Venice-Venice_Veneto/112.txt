We stayed in the Excelsior tower for three days and had a wonderful visit!  This hotel is historic and one of the most lovely hotels we have stayed in.  The lobby is beautifully appointed with Murano chandeliers and a lovely staircase adorned with flowering plants. Our room with balcony was richly decorated and well appointed, with an old world feel and modern amenities.   The staff's service was excellent, whether at check in, the lobby lounge or upstairs terrace for drinks.  They also arranged private transportation from the hotel to Murano one afternoon.  Silver Carpanese, the Resident Manager, ensures that the Danieli staff's level of service matches the beautiful atmosphere. We couldn't have asked for a better location-just walk out the front door and you are just stepsâ€¦
