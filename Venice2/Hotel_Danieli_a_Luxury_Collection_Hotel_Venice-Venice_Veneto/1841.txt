I would never stay in this hotel while in Venice because there are much better ones for much better price, but each time I am in Venice I do pay a visit to their bar. I must say that this time it was so horrible that I decided it was the last time. Already last year I found their sofas quite shabby and noticed they were the same as the ones I sat on 10 years ago and which apparently had never been cleaned. I was also shocked by the ugliness of the ladies room which was totally unacceptable for a hotel of this category.   This time we were thirsty and felt like having one of their cocktails. We walked into a deserted lobby/bar, noticed in the relative darkness that the sofas were even shabbier as usual, but didn't have the nerve to walk away as the waiter was following us.â€¦
