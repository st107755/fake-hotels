I had read previous reviews on the roiftop bar between 3 and 6 pm.  We thought we would go and have a drink and take in the views. Lovely hotel but we really thought it was overpriced for drinks. A spritz aperol â‚¬22 each with pigeons diving on your table for food. This was an unrelaxing experience..... frequently agitated by them. Other people left due to this....once someone left table they where down eating leftovers.... i feel the hoyel coukd try better to conquer this problem amd make the expensive experience more relaxing. The service was good but it doesnt aim yo be a realxing time.
