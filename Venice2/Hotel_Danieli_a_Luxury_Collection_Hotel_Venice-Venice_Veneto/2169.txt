Beautiful hotel in an ideal spot.  Decor reminds you of "Phantom of the Opera".   While suitable for this locale, it can get dreary.   Front desk tends to be chaotic.  Roof top restaurant has a great view.  However, the food is slightly above average.  For the cost, I expected more.  I got the feeling that they were really trying to leverage the recent filming that took place there - "The Tourist".
