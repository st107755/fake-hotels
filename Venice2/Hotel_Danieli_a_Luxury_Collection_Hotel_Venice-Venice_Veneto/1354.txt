Quality and stunning service. The lift is surprising. Stops at the floor you want..sometimes, but it is a typical Italian lift.... Restaurant on the Roof Terrace is excellent. Breakfast there is so charming and romantic and would suit any Honeymoon couple...no. I wasn't on mine! The room I had was quality, and the lady who serviced the room was a wonder.. Like all the other staff, a smiling and warm personality. Which seems to some uo the hotel really.. Warming and Comforting and just, well, just wonderful.
