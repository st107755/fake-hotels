My friend and I spent two nights here in January, our deluxe room overlooking the lagoon was perfect, the attention to detail couldn't be faulted. Our experience of the staff was first class and they could not have been more helpful. It is expensive but well worth the money if you want to be spoilt. The opportunity to spend time in a 700 yr old palace is rare. Glorious!
