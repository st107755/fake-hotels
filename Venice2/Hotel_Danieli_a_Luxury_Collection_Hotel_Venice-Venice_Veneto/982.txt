Stayed in this magnificent hotel for a week for my birthday. Beautiful interior and the room was amazing with a bottle of champagne on ice welcoming us. Centrally located right next to San Marco square.  Celebrated my birthday by having dinner at the terrace restaurant on the rooftop which had spectacular views not the mention the yummy food! A luxury Collection indeed and highly recommended!
