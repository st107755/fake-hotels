Having excitedly made a reservation to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my Birthday, we were extremely disappointed from the moment we arrived at the Danieli for our 3 night stay.  When we checked in my husband enquired if there would be any chance of an upgrade, we were told that it was possible at a charge of â‚¬240 extra per night.  Our room was in the new building at the side with no view and extremely small.  We then had lunch at the 'amazing' La Terrazza restaurant, the staff were unwelcoming, the table linen and staff were scruffy and certainly not 5* quality.  More importantly the food was very disappointing, we would certainly not recommend the Danieli to any of our friends and we will never return to Danieli or any other hotel in their chain.
