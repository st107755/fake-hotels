The Danieli is the most famous girl in Venice , I think . But it has no many flaws !  I did appreciate the upgrade upon arrival ( even though, it was a regular room to me and no view). The reception forgot to let us know the password for Wi-fi and their computer wasn't working properly downstairs. That was a wrong charge in our bill also during check out . There was a charge for over $ 60 that it wasn't from us. It is in a good location , but I don't see myself and my husband coming back to his hotel. There are better choices nowadays .
