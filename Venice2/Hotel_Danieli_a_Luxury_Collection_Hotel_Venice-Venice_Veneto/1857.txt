There is something magical about the Danieli. On a particularly wet afternoon we wandered down for, initially, a quick Pre lunch drink. The amazing lounge was a haven and half an hour quickly morphed into three hours. It's not cheap and cheerful but the spritz is great, there is free wifi, the service is discreet but attentive and the toasted ham and cheese sandwiches are simply amazing. Go in for a drink for the experience, take a book, relax and be completely looked after.
