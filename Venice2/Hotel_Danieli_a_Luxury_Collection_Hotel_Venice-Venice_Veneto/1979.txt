Arrived early afternoon and stayed a single night pre cruise.  Following a horrendous water taxi journey from the airport, we arrived at the Danieli. That main lobby and staircase fair takes your breath away and as you wander to your room you really do feel like you are in a museum.  Having dumped our bags in the room we immediately made our way up to the terrace and thats when the magic of Venice and the Danieli kicks in! With a glass of prosecco in hand, you could never tire of that view of the Grand Canal and of course in typical Italian fashion drinks are always accompanied with fantastic olives etc.  Location wise, you are within "Spitting" distance of Piazza San Marco and the busy touristy part of the Grand Canal. Accepting of course that to some this would be a negative,â€¦
