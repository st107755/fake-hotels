As soon as you step off your water taxi and into this grand palace your jaw will drop. It is exactly as the pictures show. The open salon on the first floor shouts sit for a cappuccino or Bellini.. And we did just that every afternoon & evening. The hotel is a show place however warm and cozy at the same time. The couldn't be more gracious to their guest. The beds are crazy comfortable with a huge bathroom.  The hotel can be full yet very quiet inside with tons of tourist outside. You are in the heart of Venice and steps away from St Marks Square.  You can walk everywhere so wear comfy shoes. The hotel is situated perfectly in San Marco.  Even if you don't get a chance to stay at this hotel, just stop in for a breathtaking look at a masterpiece venician hotel.
