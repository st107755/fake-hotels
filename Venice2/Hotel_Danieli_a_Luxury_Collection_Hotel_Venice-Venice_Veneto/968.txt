I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. It's simply has everything you could possibly need from a hotel. Knowledgeable, and courteous staff who know exactly what they are doing and have done for years. We wanted to go to the Opera and as we had left it very late held out little hope but spoke to the concierge (who I am sorry to say I didn't get his name). Two phone calls later we not only had tickets but these were a few rows back from the stage. Excellent. The rooms are of a good size and very clean, and although I am over 6ft and not of an athletic build I did to my amazement have a bath robe that actually fitted me. My world is now complete.  All I could suggest is can you add some more flowers in the reception/bar area. An absolute pleasure to be able to say I have stayed inâ€¦
