Hotel Danieli is the best hotel we have stayed in, and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels. Do not listen to the other posts! We used the hotels private water taxi from the airport for 50e. We arrived and our room was not ready, so we were treated to the famous Bellini's and appertizers in the beautiful bar! 15 min later we were taken to our room, on the second floor right in fronmt of the building with a waterfront view! The room was beautiful. The only negative, was the bathroom had a musty smell, but that is to be expected from an old hotel. We did not particularliy like Venice, so this hotel made up for it!! The next morning we went to have a cappucino in the terrace restaurant and when I asked for the check, he told me we pay next time! Rarely have I ever received anythingâ€¦
