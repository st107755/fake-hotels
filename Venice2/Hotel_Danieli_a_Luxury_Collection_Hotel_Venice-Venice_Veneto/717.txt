The service was exceptional - check-in was quickly efficient, housekeeping was timely, and the Concierge was very helpful for locations.   As a SPG member, we were given an upgrade so we had a very nice large room with magnificent view of the water.  The lounge/lobby area was very comfortable for resting breaks between the Carnivale doings.  I greatly appreciated the polite signage at the entrance that limits "looky-loo's" so as a hotel guest, the hotel was much more comfortable to enjoy.
