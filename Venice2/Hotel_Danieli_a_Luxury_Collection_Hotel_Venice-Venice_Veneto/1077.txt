A really good hotel if you get a discounted price.  However, if you pay full price then it is not living up to the standards. Room is very nicely decorated (we stayed in newer part of the hotel) but without an "oomph". Mattress and linen are of high quality but pillows were very hard. Breakfast buffet was a big disappointment, compared to another hotel I stayed a night before which was twice less expensive. The choices in buffet were rather limited, especially selection of breads and pastries.  Internet kept logging you off and you had to relogin.
