We chose  room with a balcony so we could watch all the boats going up the Grand Canal.  It wasnt the biggest room we have stayed in but it had everything with lots of little extra touches.The hotel is beautiful, old with the most amazing reception area.  Staff were very helpful.  The restaurant up on the top overlooking Venice was the perfect spot for an afternoon cocktail.  Our Murano trip was just lovely.
