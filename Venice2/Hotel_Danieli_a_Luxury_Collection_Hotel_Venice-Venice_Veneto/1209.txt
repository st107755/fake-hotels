We stayed in the Hotel Danieli as our last stop in a 3 week Italy trip. Due to using my points after the first night were upgraded to the most beautiful suite right on the grand canal with an amazing view. The first room was equally beautiful - just not the same view.  Service throughout the whole hotel was perfect - they were right on anything you needed. The whole hotel was beautifully decorated.  The bar had an amazing pianist that entertained us as we sipped our evening cocktails along with the generous appetizers that accompanied our drinks.  Location of the hotel couldn't have been better.  We were just a bridge away from St. Mark's square (to use as a landmark).  Would definitely go back!!
