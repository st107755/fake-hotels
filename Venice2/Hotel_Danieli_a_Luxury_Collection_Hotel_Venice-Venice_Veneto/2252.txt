Thankfully we did not stay at the Danieli but instead stopped for a cocktail.  The lobby area is definitely "Old World Venice", but that's where it stops.  The waiter was busy chatting with the bartender and was not only ignoring the existing guests, and new guests arriving were simply waiting with no service.  I finally got up and asked if it was self service and finally got some attention.  The men's room had water all over the floor, there were no paper towels and graffiti was evident.  It might be a good idea for the General Manager or at least the assistant manager go into these restrooms and inspect them - this is by no means, five star quality
