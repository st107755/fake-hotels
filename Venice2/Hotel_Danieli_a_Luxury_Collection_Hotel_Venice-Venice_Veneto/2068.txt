We went to the hotel as the first leg of our Italian honeymoon.  The location is wonderful and the staff at the hotel is terrific.  Do not miss having breakfast on the terrace watching the activity on the water below. I also loved the scent of the place....wish I could have brought it home to New York with me! We took the water taxi from the airport which was expensive but worth it!
