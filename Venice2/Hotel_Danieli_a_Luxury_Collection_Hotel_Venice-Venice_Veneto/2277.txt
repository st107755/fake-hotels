My husband and I just came back from two nights at The Danieli in Venice and I have very mixed reviews about our experience. The check in was a disaster. They kept us waiting in a line forever and when they finally got to us, our room wasn't ready. After an hour and a half in Venice, our room still wasn't ready. They finally offered us a drink in the lobby, which is quite beautiful. We were very dissapointed with our room. It was tired and very small. we complained at the front desk and were basically told to take it our leave it. The real highlight of the hotel is the bar on the top floor...it is possibly the best view of venice and the service was excellent. The location of the hotel is also great. Overall this hotel needs a consitent level of service and the rooms needâ€¦
