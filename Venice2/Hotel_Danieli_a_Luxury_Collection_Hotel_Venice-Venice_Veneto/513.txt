We stayed with 60 people for four days on an annual trip. The hotel is beautifully situated next to San Marco square. Starting at the reception we were given a warm welcome. The rooms were not very big but nicely decorated. We dined outside the hotel but did have breakfast and one lunch at the hotel. Fine food, eggs Benedict on request, professional service, luxurious treatment and a beautiful sight over canal grande. The hotel itself has a fantastic grand hall that gives you a feeling of going back into time. Really worth wile if you want an unforgettable stay in Venice.
