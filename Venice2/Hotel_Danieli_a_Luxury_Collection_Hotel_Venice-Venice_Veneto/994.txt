One has to know Venice to understand why the Hotel Danieli is totally fabulous.  Obviously the hotel itself is amazing, the structure, interior design, and the staff are all beautiful and gracious.    However, the location is 5+ star!  Not only is it close to everything, it is also close to a water taxi stop. While walking around the city, I saw so many tourists dragging their suitcases over bridges and cobblestone pathways enroute to their hotels.  It is was so sad.  I would not have understood why location is so absolutely critical in Venice, until I visited.    Go to the Danieli for the grandeur, love it for the location!
