We went for sundowner's on the Danieli rooftop, the views are spectacular, but be aware that you will pay for the view. We arrived there at 6pm, and were told we had to be finished by 6:30pm, as they open for dinner at 6:30pm. If you want to take in the ambiance and the view, not to mention sip your â‚¬17 Spritz slowly, get there earlier than 6pm. A beautiful hotel and a beautiful sundowner spot.
