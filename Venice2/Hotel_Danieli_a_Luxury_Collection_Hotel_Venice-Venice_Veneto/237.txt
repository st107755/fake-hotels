Prior to our trip I researched several luxury hotels for months and read every review and finally decided on Hotel Danieli.  We are SPG members and reserved using cash and points so we were not guaranteed anything but a basic room.  The manager contacted my husband a few days prior to our arrival and asked if we had any needs or were celebrating anything special and my husband mentioned it was my 50th birthday.  Our arrival to the hotel was fantastic - the water taxi glided up to the hotel and we had no trouble getting into the lobby.  The lobby - like out of a dream - so beautiful!  At check in we found out our room wasn't ready (it was only 1 in the afternoon) but they had upgraded us to a Dandolo Suite if we were willing to wait.  Yes - I would have waited and waited for thatâ€¦
