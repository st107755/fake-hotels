I visited the hotel bar daily during my visit to Venice.  The city was crowded, hot and humid and very expensive.   The Danieli was a retreat with beverages, cocktails, atmosphere and friendly service that were actually worth the $20 drink price.  Loved it, and wish I had tried its new Asian fusion restaurant.
