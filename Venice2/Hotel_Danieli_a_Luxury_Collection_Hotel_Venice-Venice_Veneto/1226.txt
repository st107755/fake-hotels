We stayed at this hotel in late July. It is located at the center of every thing with few steps to San Marco place. Although the hotel is very old but it is nicely decorated and clean. The breakfast area at the roof is amazing with view of many areas of Venice and worth taking photos from it. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only problem we encountered was noise at night which happened from movement of outside Wooden windows shield. It seems they were left loose and I took quite long time to find out the cause of the problem and secure them.
