Didn't actually stay here, (prob never will) but visited on an excursion from cruise ship. We had a little while before pick up so decided to sit in the lounge with a drink to get out breath back. It's perfectly located on the Grand Canal, for all sights and easy walking distance to St Marks Square. The lounge is very opulent, with a staircase which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Grand Palace, but the toilets were not what you'd call luxurious! I had a (smallish) glass of very good wine which cost.....20€!!! So you'd probably be looking at well over 100€ for lunch for 2 people....but if you walk further back into the town, you can get a good pasta lunch for around 35/40€ for two with a bottle of wine! Will deffo be going back to Venice one day!!
