My girlfriend and I were told to check the hotel out as it was in the film The Tourist and the views from the bar were insane. They weren't wrong, we went for some drinks in the afternoon, granted the price for a couple of drinks were crazy but the views definitely softened the blow! You look out across the water, watch the gondolas and water taxis and all the hustle and bistle below.
