Words cannot fully describe the sense of awe looking from the window out onto the grande canal!  And the thought that you are staying in a location with the history and prestige of the Danieli is worth the price! The rooms are spacious, beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are phenomenal! The lobby is also incredibly impressive and we enjoyed gathering and laughing together in the meeting areas as we admired the beautiful art and architecture. Don't recommend the hotel's restaurant. The staff was above and beyond courteous, helpful, and made us feel very special!
