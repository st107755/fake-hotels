Got here and as an spg platinum member was upgraded to the Maria Callas suite. Huge suite with large living room, twenty foot ceilings and a large bedroom.  Room had two small balconies with a spectacular corner grand canal view.  Service here is friendly ,helpful and very fast. Could not be happier but although we are well travelled this Suite impresses.
