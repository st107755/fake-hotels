My husband and I were recently on an anniversary trip to Italy and decided to spend a night in Venice at the Hotel Danieli.  While the hotel is absolutely gorgeous, imagine my disappointment when my upgraded room view was a brick building.  I focused on getting my platinum status this year to use suite nights throughout Italy.  Needless to say I was not provided with a suite, which I can understand as the hotel was busy.  However, to be given a room with a view of a brick wall is not the way to treat a platinum member.  There is no incentive to continue to use Marriott exclusively, I guess I will have to try Hyatt or Hilton and see if they appreciate my business.
