We traveled to Venice with our two boys (10,12) in August and the Danieli is a throwback in time. The water taxi to the airport is a great way to see the city and the hotel has a private water taxi entrance. The concierge was very helpful with all our questions and we all enjoyed a drink and some snacks in the lobby. The lagoon view room is a must! Spacious and a canâ€™t beat view of the city and water!
