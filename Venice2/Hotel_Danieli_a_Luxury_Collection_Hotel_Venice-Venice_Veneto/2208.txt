We book Hotel Danieli for 2-3 nights and had a horrible time.  Dinner on the rooftop was extremely overpriced. Covercharge just for sitting.   Room service employee yelled at my husband when he told him that his pasta was not gluten free (He has an allergy and they have overpriced gluten free food at Hotel Danieli), the Room Service Employee insisted that it was and told him not to tell him how to do his job!!! They closed the kitchen without sending him another meal, he missed dinner that night. To make a long story short, they sent us wine and chocolates close to midnight because after consulting the cook, they found out that the pasta indeed was not gluten free!!  There isnt any wifi in the rooms, only ethernet cables for laptop use and internet tv for 15 Euros a day, or 6â€¦
