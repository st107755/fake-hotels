I would like to add some comments about using the Concierge at this hotel for birthdate gifts for my partner's business partner and first time in Venice.  We decided it was a great idea to book some gifts (50th Birthdate) using the services the hotel provides and their Concierge department.  The gifts were simple: private boat Transfer from Airport pier to Hotel, transfer also Hotel to Train station and a evening gondola ride for two.  There was a terrible miscommunication or not communication at all between Concierge and reservations...Concierge told us to book through reservations and they did not communicate well back to the concierge.  Payment was processed in one and the communication failed between the two.  The services were provided but with a few headaches....  On topâ€¦
