Not only is the Hotel Danieli an assault on the senses ..... it has the most amazing terrace that MUST be visited to have breakfast, lunch or dinner; and take in the views of the Grand Canal and Venice. Spectacular is doing it an injustice... It has be one of those things to do before you pass into the next life !
