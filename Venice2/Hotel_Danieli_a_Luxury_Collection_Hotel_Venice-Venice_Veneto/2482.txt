Having stayed at dozens of fine Starwood Hotels over the years, I'd have to say the Hotel Danieli was the biggest dissapointment of them all.  Yes, its a beautiful hotel, with stunning historical charm and probably the best location in all of Venice.  You are within a stone's throw of Plaza San Marco, and as you gaze out of your window at the throngs of tourists down below, they will stare at you and wonder how you got so lucky to be staying at such a fine hotel in the heart of Venice.  However, inside the hotel, the charm quickly wears off.  First, if you believe that a hotel is only as good as its bed, and in your ability to get a good nights sleep, don't even consider this hotel.  I have slept on floors and air mattresses that were more comfortable that this 5-star hotel! â€¦
