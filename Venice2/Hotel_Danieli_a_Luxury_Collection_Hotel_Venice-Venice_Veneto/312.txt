We stopped at the Bar at the Danieli hotels for some drinks and snacks even though we did not stayed at the hotel. The service was slow and sloppy, they forgot half of our order and brought everything out of order. Despite there were very few people at the bar, they kind of rush us to leave.....until I clearly spoke to the waiter and ask him to stop it. So he did. The quality of the food was quite standard, not typical from Danieli, where I dine several time at the Terrace (which is great), in addition to the expected high prices. No price-quality-service relation whatsoever at the Bar. If you can avoid it.
