A gorgeous hotel with history. Arrive by boat at the side entrance if you choose. Marble staircase, chandeliers and ambiance. You have arrived in old world Venice, you will feel like you are back in time. The location is fantastic and the upstairs restaurant overlooks the water with a spectacular view. The staff was overwhelmingly courteous and helpful. This hotel is very special and quant. One of the most impressive properties I have ever seen. The d√©cor of the rooms and common areas were superb. Regardless of its age, the hotel is sophisticated. Artwork, red curtains and carpet are part of the theme. The room key is a fun novelty with its red color, brass and fringe. The Danieli is extremely impressive property! An experience you will never forget!
