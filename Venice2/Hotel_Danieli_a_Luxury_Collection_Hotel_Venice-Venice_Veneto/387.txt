My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary over a long weekend in Venice. Our stay at the Danieli was very pleasant. The interior of the reception is stunning and the atmosphere is unique. We were upgraded to a water view room which was again quite unique. We had a few minor issues with door lock which were promptly rectified. The hotel is not modern and our room and the common areas are kept to the historical theme of the hotel.   The concierge staff was excellent and booked dinner for us at three outstanding restaurants. As we were keen to avoid the large crowds as much as possible, their advice on some pleasant walks to further flung parts of the City was spot on.   Breakfast was fine but not exceptional. The terrace restaurant where the buffet is served is lovelyâ€¦
