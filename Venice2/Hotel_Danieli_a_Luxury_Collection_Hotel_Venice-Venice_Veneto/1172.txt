I'd been wanting to stay at The Danieli for at least 30 years.  Finally, my wish came true and I got to stay there.  Would it, could it possibly be as good as I'd built it up in my mind to be?  The answer, in a word:  yes.  Perfect location, extraordinary service, beautiful decor, fabulous food.  And perhaps the most comfortable bed I've every slept in.
