We were given a room in the "newer" wing... large for venice standards with very comfortable bed, nice linens and good view. That is where my positive review ends. We were summarily dismissed by staff when we arrived at 11.00 AM. check in at 3PM. NOthing more. I am a platinum SPG member... even that wasn't enough for any real consideration. Platinum members are always told at check in that there is no charge for internet. I wasn't told that so when I tried to log on and it quoted me $32 euro per day for on line access I called down. I was told it would not appear on my bill... what do you know? at check out, I was charged  32 Euro per day for internet... when I pointed this out.. the staff member BLUSHED ( seriously) and immediately removed the charges.... leads  me to believeâ€¦
