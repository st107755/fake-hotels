got upgrate to a parcial canal view :-) This is a pure luxury... It is expensive but surely worth it. I am staying only one night on business so enjoy every moment. Great room, balcony , everything is perfect... The bath,the bed, even the hair drier is different... LOCATION is also great ... It is one if the best !
