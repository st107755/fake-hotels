Venice is comprised of 118 small islands and 400 canals and bridges. Its name was derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region in the 10th century. Venice was a financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 and a center for commerce such as silk, grain and spice between the 13th and 17th centuries. Venice is the first real international financial area which emerged from the 9th to its peak in the 14fh century. It was known for its artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. After the Napoleonic wars and the Congress of Vienna, it was annexed by the Austrian empire, until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866. #venice
