I have just enjoyed a fantastic stay at the Hotel Danieli in Venice.  After a warm welcome the man at reception (Ennio) was kind enough to provide a room upgrade to a Luxury Lagoon View. The room was spacious with a breathtaking view across the Grand Canal. It was perfect for relaxing after a day of sightseeing.  The breakfast on the terrace was delicious; a wide-ranging buffet with both hot and cold dishes. The cappuccinos are worthy of a mention! Overall, the hotel is an ideally located and extremely luxurious place to stay. I cannot recommend it highly enough and look forward to staying there the next time I am in Venice.
