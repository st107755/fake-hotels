This hotel was gorgeous, the service was immediate and courteous and the atmosphere was very nice. I just don’t know that we really received more of anything in particular when taking into account the price.  We easily could have stayed somewhere more reasonable and could have been as comfortable.  The highlight of the hotel is the lounge/bar area and the music in the evening.

It’s a casual feel, relaxing and just nice to be back at the hotel but not have to be in the room.  The absolute convenience of the location of the hotel may be what commands the ability to be a bit more pricey. It’s literally right by the main area where you can…
