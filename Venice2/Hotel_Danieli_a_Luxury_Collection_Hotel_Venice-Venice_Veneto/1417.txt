it was on our Venice bucket list, we enjoyed a few coffees and soft drinks at this famous establishment. Incredible decor and architecture offers relaxing surroundings to enjoy a drink or food. Despite a few negative reviews we found the waiting staff to be courteous and approachable, despite it being obvious we weren't there to spend thousands! For Venice also the prices aren't ridiculous, cocktails for around 13-16 euros isn't massively different from other places. There was a lot of rich people who had better clothes than us, but weren't as rich in character or spirit
