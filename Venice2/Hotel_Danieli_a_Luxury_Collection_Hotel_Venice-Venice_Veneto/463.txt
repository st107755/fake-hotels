We stayed in early December and loved every minute - we didn't want to leave and still can't stop thinking about the place. It was exceptional on every level.  Fantastic friendly and efficient staff, amazing iconic location, beautiful historic interiors, top service and delicious food. We highly recommend this place - Yes you pay for it, but worth every penny if you value world class service, views and luxury.  It's what memories are made of.  Don't hesitate to stay here, you will fall in love!
