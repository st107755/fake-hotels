This was beautifully overstated and yet subtle.  Our room was big overlooking the lagoon.  We watched the street sellers plying their trade and the endless cat and mouse game between the african designer bag sellers and the police.  Room service was efficient and not too surly.  Hotel was peaceful excepet the beautiful reception where people seemed to endlessly stream in and out probably to admire the opulent decor.  A perfect romantic hotel for couples.  Although restaurant service was not very friendly and of course the hotel is expensive, much like Venice itself I suppose.
