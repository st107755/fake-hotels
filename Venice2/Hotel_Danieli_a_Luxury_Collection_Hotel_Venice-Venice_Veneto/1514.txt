This was our first visit to the Danieli, and will not be repeated. We booked 4 nights in a Luxury Lagoon View Double with Balcony. The room was located in the Danieli Excelsior building (1 of 3, each very different.) This building has been most recently upgraded so the finishes and fabrics were elegant. The king bed was excellent as were the linens. The view from our balcony directly facing the Grand Canal was perfect, extraordinary, sublime... This concludes the positive portion of my review. Everything else about this hotel was a disappointment. The Danieli seems to be living off past glory and the crazily positive reviews here on Trip Advisor. I simply don't understand all the raves. It's as if these people have never stayed in any of the truly great hotels, so don'tâ€¦
