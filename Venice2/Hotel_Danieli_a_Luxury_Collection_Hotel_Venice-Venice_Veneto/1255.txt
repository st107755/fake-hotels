This five star hotel lived up to expectation and beyond! From the moment we arrived we were in awe of the beauty and scale of this hotel. Rooms and food were fabulous but the most impressive thing for me is that all staff made us feel welcome and put us at ease. It would have been easy for this hotel to be full of pomp but it wasn't. There was no looking down on those if us in shorts and caps during the day and welcomed the public in to witness it's glorious lobby!!  Must remark on the most comfortable beds in any hotel I have ever stayed in!! Just fabulous!!! We had a problem with leaky air conditioning but at midnight it was dealt with swiftly and we were moved to another beautiful room for the evening.  Fully recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Venice inâ€¦
