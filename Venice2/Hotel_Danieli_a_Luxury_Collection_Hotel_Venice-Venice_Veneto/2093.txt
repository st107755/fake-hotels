From the moment we arrived to the fond farewell this was a truly outstanding hotel experience,To stay four days and find no fault and near perfection around every corner was a testimony to the management and staff of the property and their utter professionalism and class. Venice is a theme park with garlic and gondolas and the Danieli is a fitting centrepiece and jewell.Go in the Autumn and avoid the crowds,enjoy the most idillic views from the rooftop restaurant and make sure to spend time in the lounge and watch the floorshow as performed by staff who are quite simply the best. Yes - expensive but worth every penny - save it for a very special occasion.
