We spent three nights in the Danieli to celebrate a special birthday. The staff could not have been more attentive and made us feel as if we were their only guests. Our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The location is perfect for exploring Venice, and the views from the restaurant are magical. We'll treasure the memories of our trip and look forward to returning soon.
