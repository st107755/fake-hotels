Can I do a review for the Danielli when it's probably 10 years since we stayed there? Yes I think so, this is a bucket list hotel - and we have such lovely memories of our stay there. We hired a private boat to take us to the Danielli and arrived in style. Our room had a balcony looking over the lagoon and the gondolas , we felt like celebrities drinking our sparkling wine and taking in the scenery.  The foyer area is spectacular - in those days you were able to purchase a poster of the fabulous staircase and we have it framed and it takes pride of place in our hall. Expensive yes, but well worth it. We stayed again some time after and had a room with a partial view of the lagoon. The price of (I think room No,9 ) had rocketed and we couldn't justify it at the time. Since thenâ€¦
