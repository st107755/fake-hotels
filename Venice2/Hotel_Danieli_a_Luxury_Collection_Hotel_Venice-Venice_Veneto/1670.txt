What can I say ! A magic place with a magic view in a magic city ! A feeling of confort in this building in which every corner is deliciously haunted by the history of Venise. One feels great walking around the floors, discovering pieces and bits of art, decoration, furniture. So go on, don't hesitate ! You will love it !
