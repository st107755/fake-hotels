Wow what a hotel. I have wanted to stay here for years and I wasn't disappointed.  Beautiful public areas. We stayed in one of the suites which was fantastic. Spotlessly clean, amazingly comfortable bed and gorgeous furnishing.  The hotel is in a prime location overlooking the lagoon making it very easy to access all the best Venice has to offer.  Breakfast on the terrace is one not to be forgotten (with the exception of the pigeons who are a real pain trying to steal food) there is a very good selection of cooked and cold food available. Something for everyone.  The staff were very attentive. I look forward to returning soon
