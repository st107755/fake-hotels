Here is the deal. We travel a lot. The ambiance of this hotel is a 10/10. The service and friendliness of the staff is a 5/10. If you aren't staying in a lagoon view room you shouldn't stay here. The other side of the hotel is not enjoyable and won't be a great experience. The staff is fairly rude with the exception of the front desk. If you can get past that and enjoy the location and beauty of the hotel you'll have an excellent time. The roof is one of the most breathtaking places in Venice.
