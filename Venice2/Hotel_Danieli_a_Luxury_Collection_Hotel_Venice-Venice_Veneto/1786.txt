I was walking around with my husband and were looking for a bathroom, we saw this wonderful place , that I never expected to see behind that walls. The hostess very polite. You must see this place is one of the oldest hotels in Venice, the decoration, the lamps so beautiful. So we decided to see the hotel and al it has to offer. We found out the had a terrace, gorgeous """!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was m The most expensive white wine and diet coke ever!!! But it was the best sunset ever!  And if you smoke , is much better to relax and enjoy a Cuban cigar!!! At  least go and see the lobby  and take a picture in the stairs.
