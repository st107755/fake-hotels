You can tell that Venice is all about trapping tourists and this is noticeable in the way staff treated us in the hotel --> condescending, bored, seeming bothered when asked a question. Room was nice, althoug on the first night the room had not been prepared for the night and the next day, when we came back at 4PM, after having been gone the whole day, the bed had not been done. Location is awesome and the hotel is beautiful, but I expected more.
