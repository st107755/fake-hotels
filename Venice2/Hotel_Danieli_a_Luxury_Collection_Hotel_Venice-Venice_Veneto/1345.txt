The location of the Danielli is fabulous.  The lobby bar is lovely but the service was very slow regardless of how many, or how few, clients were present.  For 1400 euros/night we had a view of a wall and such a small closet we had to live out of our suitcases.  We could have lived with all of this (after all it we were in Venice!) had the concierge service been better.  We are very generous when it comes to tipping but we never imagined that so much would be expected up front ..water transportation (50 euros each time), the wifi code ("It's not my job."), a plug for a hair dryer (50 euros). We had loads of friends visiting Venice at the same time who paid far less for much better service. My suggestion would be to go to a smaller hotel or rent an apartment.
