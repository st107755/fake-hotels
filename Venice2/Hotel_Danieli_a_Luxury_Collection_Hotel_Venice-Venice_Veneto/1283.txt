We just got back to Los Angeles last night but we left our hearts in Venice at the Danieli Hotel! The staff was beyond nice and accommodating to all our needs. The Concierges were super helpful and attentive at all times. The check in and check out was so pleasant. And the room was unforgettable - a beautiful Dandolo Suite, recently renovated and designed by the French world known architect P. Yves Rochon. The Danieli was one of the most memorable hotels we have every stayed at (on par with the grandeur of the Ahwanee Hotel in Yosemite but with beautiful updated rooms) from the grand lobby entrance to the details in the room, to the perfectly located entrance right in front of the Vaporetto stops. Our experience from the moment we walked into the beautiful lobby transformed us.â€¦
