The Danieli is a luxurious hotel set in an ideal location right by St Mark's Square and with a vaporetto stop directly opposite. The lounge and main staircase upon entering give a stunning appearance. The room we had overlooking a side street was spacious, very comfortable and quiet. The view from the restaurant terrace was amazing but the food was just OK though nothing special. The service we received was mixed and not quite up to 5-star level or the exceptionally high prices: for example, drinks orders during dinner were forgotten on more than one occasion and had to be repeated; and there was some confusion with bookings made with the concierge before and during the stay. To use Wi-Fi would have cost an extra 16 EUR per day and I did not use it for that reason.
