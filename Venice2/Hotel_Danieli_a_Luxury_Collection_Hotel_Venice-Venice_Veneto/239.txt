Welcoming and friendly staff, especially since we arrived to a flooded reception area in some of Veniceâ€™s worst floods!!  Staff was helpful in explaining the tide times; so we Knew when to get out and enjoy Venice!    Could not explore all of the hotel or use the gym because of the weather, but that was out of the hotels hands!  Beautiful location, loved the room!
