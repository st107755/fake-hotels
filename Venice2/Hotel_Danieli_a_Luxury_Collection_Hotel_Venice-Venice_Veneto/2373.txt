Arrived by boat, that pulled right up the the side entrance. Very cool for anyone that has never been to Venice before. Was greeted by very friendly and helpful staff each of the 6 days we were there. You leave your key at the front when you leave the hotel, and by the 2nd day I didn't have to tell them my room number. Made me feel like a celebrity.   =) The rooms were very true to the whole Venice feel, and well kept. They did get very hot though! Close your bathroom door and leave the air off. Both pump in a ton of hot air. Great location, great staff, amazing hotel, what more could you want? There are 3 buildings, I had heard that the others were not as nice. We lucked out and did stay in the main building so I can't confirm this. Breakfast was nice but like everything elseâ€¦
