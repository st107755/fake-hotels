I really have very few complaints about the Danieli. The hotel is a beautiful historic property in a terrific location. The rooms are nice although mine was a little small. My only complaints are that the service was a little stuffy and they make you check your key in at the concierge desk before leaving. They give you a cute old tasseled key but it is a waste of time to wait every time you come and go.
