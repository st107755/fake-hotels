Frist of all, the staff were really friendly! Every staff member knew that I would get a marriage proposal in Venice, so they treated us very excited, they were trying madly to make my husband happy (like giving gifts to us - chocolates and champagnes). The view from the hotel's restaurant is one of the best views I've ever seen. I watched the movie "The Tourist" the day before we arrived at the hotel, the expectation I felt when I watched the movie became real when I arrived there! Every Italy lover should stay at the Hotel Danieli at least once in a lifetime!
