Being a big fan of Daniel craig as James Bond, staying and visiting one of the Hotel and places where he has shot was in itself mystifying... But reaching the Hotel Danieli by water taxi,being welcomed by amazing staffs, Sara at the Guest relation counter,Dario ,Pierreluigi, Matteo at the concierge, we knew that this stay was going to be memorable... in all aspects... we read that the carnival period had just started and the Hotel had made sure that it participated thoroughly... magnificent decorations in the hall, in the lifts and at all floors... there is also an atelier in the Hotel where one can rent their costumes, which are customized to the person's needs... Food at the terrace Dandolino restaurant is just awesome and Franco is just a delight in finding you the bestâ€¦
