My husband & I stayed at Hotel Danieli for 3 nights during our 10-day trip to Italy.  This hotel is lovely -- VERY old but nicely kept.  Wonderful service.  It's very different staying in a place totally surrounded by water.  Great location right in St. Marks Square.  However, the area was packed with people & very touristy.  We walked our feet off but preferred "getting lost" far from the tourist crowds.  We only waited about 15 minutes to enter St. Mark's Basilica.  Lines are much shorter in the late afternoon, around 3-4:00.  The best part of this hotel was the terrace where we ate breakfast.  It took a while to find our way to the top of the hotel the first day.  What a view!  Right on the Grand Canal overlooking all of Venice!  Breakfast was a buffet.  Delicious. â€¦
