We had a beautiful room with a huge balcony overlooking the city, not the canal.   The room was beautifully furnished with red venetian velvet which looked great.   The lobby of the hotel is immaculate and the hotel is ideally situated 2 mins walk from St Marks Square.   Stay here if you can, it really is stunning although the breakfast is so expensive that we didn't eat at the hotel,  It's much cheaper to get something in the street
