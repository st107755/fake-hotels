We had drinks on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal.  The view was incredible.  The Hotel is like a museum.  We did not stay there but toured it like a museum and had drinks.  It is a must destination.  A truly amazing place.  The drinks were great and the staff treated us perfectly even though we were not staying there
