The Danieli really isn't a bad hotel, but it is overpriced.  The Danieli is a very historic hotel and as a guest it is nice to be able to look around this hotel at your lesiure. The building is very old, charming the atrium is lovely, and it has a lovely writing room.  The restaurant on the top floor has a beautiful view, and that alone makes it worth having a breakfast up there.   On the down side, many of the hotel staff seem very moody, as if to bring this room service order to your room has really put them out.  I got this message continually from staff.  At the 50 Euro breakfast service was non-existant.  I eventually made eye contact with a waiter, who then rushed off in the opposite direction when it was obvious that I might ask him for something, such as another coffee. â€¦
