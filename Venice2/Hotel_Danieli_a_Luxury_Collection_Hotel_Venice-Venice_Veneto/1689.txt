We stayed in this hotel some time ago and the review is long overdue. Where do I begin, from the second you arrive until the time you leave you are well taken care off. The staff do everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The concierge especially helpful with bookings for restaurants or excursions.   The hotel itself is one of the most romantic in the world. The decor is magnificent and rooms decorated to a high standard with excellent amenities. The restaurants in the hotel itself serve delicious cuisine and great cocktails. Excellent for a romantic stay.
