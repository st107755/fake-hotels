During our two week Italy trip, this was the only hotel we did not care for at all. Although Hotel Denali is beautiful and has a great location, it certainly does not live up to its 5 star standard thanks to their very poor housekeeping department and unfriendly concierge staff.   On our first night I woke up with big bites, but this isn't overly shocking since its Venice- where this is water, there is sure to be bugs. I have complete faith it is NOT bed bugs. Either way I requested for our sheets to be changed for peace of mind, housekeeping completely ignored this request. Secondarily the stemware in our room was not cleaned after we used it for a bottle of wine, leaving us to clean them ourselves when we wanted to use them again. Both of these oversights are not acceptable atâ€¦
