Stayed here with another couple. We were in the newest building. Be sure to ask for the building. Larger rooms. Air conditioning. Had breakfast on the roof. Views are spectacular and the breakfast quite good. Hotel arranged a number of site visits, a private boat ride at sunset, and recommended a number of great meals. Very satisfied. Wonderful stay.
