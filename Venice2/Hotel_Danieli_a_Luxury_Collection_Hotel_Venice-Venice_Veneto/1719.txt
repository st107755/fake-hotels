The Danieli was nothing I have ever seen. It has the old world beauty yet I did not feel like I was lost in time since it has all the modern amenities. The service was unobtrusive. Our room was beautiful with an unobstructed view of the Grand Canal. The fooI have to say it was the best Valentine's trip. I highly recommend the Danieli hotel and the terrazza Danieli restaurant for a romantic dinner.
