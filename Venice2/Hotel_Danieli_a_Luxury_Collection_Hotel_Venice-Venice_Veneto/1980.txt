A nice place to stay, really nice view....close from Place St-Marks. Room are really really old...and small. Not really worth the money....a room cost us 427$ US. Not worth it, but nice place. If you take the water taxi or Vaporetto get off at Zacharia station not at St-Marks.But overall it's a unique experience
