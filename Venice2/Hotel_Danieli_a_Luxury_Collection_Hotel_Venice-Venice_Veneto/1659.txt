Just returned from a Valentines/Anniversary break in Venice.  I chose to stay here as my parents had been here and had a lovely time, however once I had booked it would be true to say that some of the previous reviews concerned me a little.  I emailed the hotel and was honest that I was a little concerned and received a lovely email back that was very reassuring.    We arrived by water taxi and right from the off were greeted by lovely doorman and a charming receptionist.  We were given a luxury room and this was lovely.  Recently modernised in a tasteful way sympathetic with the history of the property but with mod cons - flat screen tv, air con and a super shower (to name just a few points) we really were very comfortable.  The beds were lovely and there are loads of towels,â€¦
