My wife and I have just stayed in this hotel for four nights. The location is excellent being so close to St Marks Square and the water buses. The hotel has so much character that we just stared in awe at the decorations, pictures and amazing Murano glass chandeliers. Our room overlooked the water at the front and it had fantastic views. Yes it's expensive but then so are most things in Venice. If you want cheap stay somewhere else - if you want class stay at the Danieli!
