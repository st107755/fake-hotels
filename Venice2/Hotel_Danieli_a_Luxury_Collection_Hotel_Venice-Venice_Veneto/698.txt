Although my friend and I weren't staying at Hotel Danieli (maybe some time in the future hopefully!) we were participating in costume in the 2017 Carnevale celebrations.  "May we come in for a coffee in costume?" I asked the handsome young concierge.  "Of course Madam" was his reply and he escorted us to the guest lounge.  What a beautiful setting, what a gorgeous hotel.  We were seated on Georgian style chairs where we sat like 2 ladies from a Gainsborough painting.  Service was immaculate, coffee and nibbles delicious and the ambience wonderful.  A delightful "coffee" morning ended with a Venetian Spritzer each.  A perfect ending to a lovely 2 hours.  Thank you Hotel Danieli.
