The venue is amazing with the entrance that gives the impression of being outdoors in a courtyard while being inside. Cosy bar with plenty of choice. Stairs going up by half floors with high columns really impressive. Reception room with leaded glasses entirely wooden furbished. An inside bridge flies over a canal leading from one side to the other of the Hotel. View from the roof terrace's restaurant on San Giorgio and La Salute is impressive. Great choice of breakfast buffet. Personnel careful and competent. We got a nice spacious room with a big bathroom but was on the side, with little light as it happens in Venice to the rooms overlooking tiny lanes. Very high priced. If you seek value for money stay clear and go to a Pensione. No point to complain after.You will pay almostâ€¦
