The hotel Danieli is a centrally located property on the grand canal. The staff is first class and very accommodating.  Our room was recently renovated but over looked the alley. They only disappointment of our stay since we booked a premium room. The breakfast buffet is awesome. The piano bar and piano player outstanding. Highly recommend this property. Ask for a grand canal view of you can.
