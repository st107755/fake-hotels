It is a magnificient palace and the prices are in sync with its worldwide reputation:  (in particular for any food & bevereage). The Terrasse restaurant has the most unique panoramic view of the lagoon. Shame that on Sundays they seem to run on skeleton staff and the level of service suffers accordingly
