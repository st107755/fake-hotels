Booked in here for only 1 night wish it could have been more. The hotel is charming and the rooms were spotless and very comfortable.Reception and restaurant staff so helpful and polite. Hotel is  just off St Mark Square so really easy for local sightseeing. It may be a little costly but so worth it for the location.
