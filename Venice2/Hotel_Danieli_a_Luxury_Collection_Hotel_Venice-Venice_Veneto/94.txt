The location of this Hotel is fantastic enough to earn the 4 star review. Just across the cobbles from the Water Bus stop from the airport it is so convenient for a short stay as everything is close by. The Doges Palace next door, and St Marks Square just around the corner. Our rooms 078 and 077 were spectacularly classical Italian. Well  maintained though with a certain aged charm. The floor are slopey and crooked and the furniture well loved but also well used. The bed is superbly comfortable with a familiar Marriott feel, and the air conditioning worked perfectly during our stay in  the very hot weather. The public areas of the Hotel are spectacular and interesting with original artwork and decor. A few small details stopped me from giving this property a 5 star. Housekeepingâ€¦
