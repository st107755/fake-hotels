I was lucky enough to spend a weekend in one of the suites of this hotel and it was absolutely stunning. We felt like we were transported back in time. The hotel service was impeccable with the staff paying attention to every detail, we even received champagne upon arrival. The concierge was particularly good and had recommendations for the best restaurants and walking tours. It is a labyrinth of a hotel much like the city itself. Highly recommended.
