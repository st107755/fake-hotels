This was absolutely mind-blowing beautiful. We did not stay there but we went for a glass of wine and some snacks. From the minute we walked through the door to sitting down with our drinks EVERYBODY was helpful, friendly and accommodating. We do not speak Italian! We took a lot of pictures inside this lovely old lady from Venice. Well done staff, with attitudes like that you will never be out of guests or people like us who would like to drink something and enjoy the opulence of this beautiful hotel.
