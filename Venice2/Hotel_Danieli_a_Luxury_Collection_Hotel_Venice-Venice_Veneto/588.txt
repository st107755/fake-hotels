We stayed in the original palace, I believe Danieli has 2/3 buildings. The room overlooked a side street and other houses but it was a charming view. It was quiet and peaceful and had all the amenities of a five star room.  I loved the dressing room and bathroom although compact and admired the room itself. All the staff members were very helpful and friendly but it was a shame that we could not get any guide to take us around privately. A memorable stay.
