We, a family of 4, spent a great time at this historic hotel. The rooms were beautiful and my two girls didn't wanted to leave them (they felt like princesses) Everyone was helpful, even when we were late for our dinner reservation on the terrace ( a must when staying there). The hotel is close to the Piazza San Marco and other famous Venetian spots, we cannot imagine to stay anywhere else. Thank you for making our stay in Venice a highlight on our travels!
