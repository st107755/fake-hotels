The Hotel Danieli in Venice is truly beautiful but the service and concierge was terrible.  When one first walks in to the Hotel Danieli you cannot help but be impressed bt how beautiful the hotel lobby is...it is truly stunning. But that is where our good impressions stopped.  We called the hotel housekeeping for an iron and were told that the hotel did not supply irons but would do all pressings. But that person did not know how much it would be...and would send someone up with a price list. The pricelist never arrived and after 4 calls we decided to go out a bit rumpled.  The Concierge was not helpful nor approachable with regards to queries about restaurants and or any other night life suggestions. Nor did they ever once say "bonjourno"! or "gratious". The hotel is beauifulâ€¦
