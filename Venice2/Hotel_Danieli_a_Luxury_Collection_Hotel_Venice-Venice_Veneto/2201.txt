We stayed for three days at the Danielli.  I was anticipating a great stay in a historic hotel.  The lobby is beautiful and the location is great.  Just a short walk to St. Mark's Square.  I was very dissapointed by the room.  It was a little shabby.  I had a junior suite and the sitting area was tiny and the furniture uncomfortable.  The staff were the worst part.  Front desk staff did not seem to notice you were there and were not very helpful.  The concierge desk staff were snobby and seemed like they couldn't be bothered.  I was very disappointed in this stay.
