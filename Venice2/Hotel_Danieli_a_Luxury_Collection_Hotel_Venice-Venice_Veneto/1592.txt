The best thing about this hotel is the lobby.  And the views from the terrace restaurant are wonderful.   After that it's unacceptable. The rooms are outdated and very small yet very expensive.  It is a serious letdown after the St. Regis in Florence.  There is nowhere to put luggage and not enough space to unpack. The bathroom is very small (one sink, no counter), the mirrors are chipped and darkened and the room is so poorly lit it's impossible to apply makeup.  Continental breakfast in room is 50 Euros.  Dinner on the terrace requires taking out a mortgage.  I will never stay here again and certainly can't recommend it to anyone.
