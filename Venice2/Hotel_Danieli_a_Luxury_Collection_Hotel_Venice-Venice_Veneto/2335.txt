the hotel was beautiful and the staff was courteous.  the BEST part though was the breakfast - the food, the service, and most importantly - the view was BREATHTAKING.  sitting on their outdoor deck overlooking the water every morning while enjoying awesome breakfast was an AMAZING way to start each day! =)
