I was upgraded to a canal view room that was right out of a Merchant Ivory film.  the hotel remodel is super... upscale and 5 star amenities melded into a super historic property.  this grand dame of Venice is still fantastic.  always love the view from the amazing restaurant.  the breakfast buffet is filled with fresh foods in great abundance. concierge was of great help.
