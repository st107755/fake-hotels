It is a wonderful and luxurious hotel with all meaning of luxury. From the room to every item resides in the room. The bed is great and very comfortable. The room services is superior. Staff is very highly polite, helpful and available. The location is great and I had a wonderful stay there. I have stayed in many luxurious hotels but this one is different.
