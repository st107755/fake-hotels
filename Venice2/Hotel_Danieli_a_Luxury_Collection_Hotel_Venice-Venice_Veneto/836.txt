We (couple + 12-year-old daughter) only had 24 hours in Venice pre-cruise, but staying in the Danieli made this a really special visit. From the private water taxi booked through the hotel (we were met in the baggage collection area, so we didn't even have to lift a finger with our luggage), the comfortable room with stunning view of the grand canal, the location a couple of minutes' stroll from St Mark's Square - everything was perfect! Breakfast and dinner on the Terrazza were the icing on the cake.
