This hotel is absolutely beautiful and in a really great location, easy access to ferries, water taxis, and st mark's square. But the price is high for mediocre service. Front desk and concierge services seemed chaotic and unorganized. The hotel restaurant had a good for breakfast service, highly recommend paying the discounted rate in advance if you're staying for several nights, balcony views are amazing. However the dinner menu selections suggested high quality, but there were hardly any staple choices and what we ordered fell flat for us given the high prices. We felt much better ordering room service or eating in the evening lounge area on the first floor with a very nice cocktail. Clean, authentic looking rooms though.
