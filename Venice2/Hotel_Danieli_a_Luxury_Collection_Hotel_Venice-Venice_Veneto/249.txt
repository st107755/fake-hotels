This was a quaint hotel central to everything Venice has to offer from gondolas out front, Bridge of Sighs / Doges Palace / San Marco Piazza all a very short walk away. Very clean room with international charger in room. Wifi available for a cost. Breakfast at rooftop restaurant a delight for the views and food.
