From the instant I entered into this beautiful lobby I was greeted with smiles and enthusiasm.  At the front desk Fabio was a master welcomer.  My room on the fourth floor with a balcony was nothing short of spectacular, from the furnishings to the view I was taken away.  This was only the beginning of being recognized throughout my stay with eager to please staff and friendly guests every where I turned.  The American breakfast sitting on the terrace is undesirable in words except breathtaking.  The highlight of my stay of course was the 5 star dinner once again an eager staff to please as a team of waiters circles the room constantly.  Take recommendations on food and wine pairings.  I simply can't wait to return again to Venice and this gem of a hotel.
