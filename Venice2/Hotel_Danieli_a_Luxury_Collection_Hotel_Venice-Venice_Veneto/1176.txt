This is one of the best luxury hotel values in Venice. Histori design, short walk to Piazza San Marco and the public areas are beautiful. Our room was good size and a fine value.  Breakfast on their roof veranda is one of the most beautiful spaces to eat and view the great city of Venice. That alone is worth the stay. The breakfast is excellent as well. Also direct access to hotel with water taxi which is a plus..
