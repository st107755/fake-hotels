We stayed at the Danieli for our honeymoon and had an amazing time. The staff were so helpful and the location was absolutely stunning. The view from the restaurant was beyond compare with a spectacular outlook over the bay. Breakfast was a wonderful experience, leisurely and a great choice of fresh hot and cold buffet. The rooms were really clean and well equipped with a decor that was in keeping with the Venetian style we were hoping for. We had a problem with our loo and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. I went downstairs to report the problem and the maintenance man was at the door before I had returned to the room !!! Now that's service !! All in all the Danieli and it's staff gave us the Honeymoon we dreamed of and we highly recommend them. If you want traditionalâ€¦
