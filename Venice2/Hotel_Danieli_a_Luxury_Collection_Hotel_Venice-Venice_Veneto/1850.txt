The hotel Danieli is one of the best hotels I have ever experienced. The Venetian architecture is outstanding and the location is perfect for all of Venice. The room keys are classic and you always meet very interesting people. We were there During the Venice film festival. Don't miss a day trip out to Lido. It is wonderful. You will not be disappointed in the Danieli.
