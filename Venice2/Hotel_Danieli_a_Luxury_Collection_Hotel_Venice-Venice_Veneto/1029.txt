I visited this hotel during one of stops in italy,its location + its reviewd who brought me in this hotel. Usually in venice places are tight but this hotel is more speacious as well as the rooms. Its location near san marco is a bounce.  Tips: try the afternoon tea/coffe between 1500-1800 in the terrace, good service & view!
