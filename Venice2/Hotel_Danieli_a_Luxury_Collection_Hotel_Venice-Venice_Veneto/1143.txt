Oh man, this hotel is amazing to say the least. The entry makes you feel like you are taken back a century. Hotel staff are extremely friendly. The rooms are a tad small but have everything you require. We loved everything about our room except for one thing....the canal we were on is where trash seemed to be loaded onto  boats early in the morning....everyday...other than the early morning noise the room was great. The restaurant on the roof is also worth checking out. Be prepared though, we had 4 people and spent  $587 euros and we only had a few cocktails. Very delicious though
