The location, the terrace restaurant and overall classic Venice ambiance can't be beat!  The lobby is as beautiful as you've heard about, heck there is a reason why the hotel was feature in the movie "The Tourist".  The rooms are not very big, but if you can book rooms overlooking the main canal, you won't regret waking up to the magnificent view.  The checking in/out service is slow, be prepared to wait.
