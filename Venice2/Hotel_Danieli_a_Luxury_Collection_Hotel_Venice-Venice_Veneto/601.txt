My wife and I visited Venice for the first time. We have a lovely experience at Hotel Danieli. The location is brilliant! So close to everything. San Marco is only about 200m away & the ferry station is at the front door.  When we checked in, we were blown away by the reception and lobby area which was built in the 14th century! Our room was quite small but very well decorated and furnished. We loved having a bath in our bathroom.   The rooftop bar in stunning. We had breakfast there both mornings and were impressed with the food offering. The view, however, was the real winner. Just an amazing place to dine.
