This hotel does look good and the location was right near St. Marc's square. It looks great but the desk people act like they can't be bothered to talk to you. I learned a very good lesson always pick a hotel not by it's online pictures but by if the hotel is in the top 20 on trip advisor. I would never go back. It was over priced and customer sevice was not good.
