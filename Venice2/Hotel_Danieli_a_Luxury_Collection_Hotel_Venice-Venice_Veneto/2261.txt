My wife and I along with our daughter and son-in-law have just enjoyed a magical stay at the Hotel Dalieli in Venice. Entering the lobby is like stepping back to a gracious time of luxury travel. The lobby is a one-of-a-kind beauty and the rooms are luxurious. Service couldn't be better...great location...The breakfast on the terrace overlooking the panaply of the Grand Canal is magnificant.
