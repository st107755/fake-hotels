Just back from a wonderful trip to Venice, including one night at the Danieli.  Pros   1. Views: The Lagoon/Grand Canal views from all three of the Danieli buildings are among the most spectacular in Venice...meaningfully better than the views from the Gritti Palace, for example, because the location of the Danieli is beyond the end of the Grand Canal, looking back toward the big church and Grand Canal with great sunset views, or across the Lagoon with so many other great Vistas. It's also fun to watch the hustle and bustle of the gondolas and tourists, based, etc. below. If you can get a Lagoon view room with a walk out balcony, you Coen hours just absorbing and watching. Keep the patio doors open and you'll be entertained by gondaliers signing opera. Note: there are on 8 roomsâ€¦
