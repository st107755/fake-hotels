Such a great elegant, classy and fine hotel in Venice. Location was perfect, Food was amazing, service was awesome! We had a room over looking the grand canal which was amazing! Upon arrival we were greeting with a bottle of champagne in our room with a note for us, which was a nice touch from the concierge(Spg  Platinum).   It is right around the corner from St.Mark's Square but the concierge is more than willing to help if you ask. The lounge in the lobby had great atmosphere and they had someone on the piano each night that added a very nice touch.  Can't go wrong here! It comes with a hefty price but the value it brings to your trip is worth it!
