Stayed here during carnival to experience venedig and one of the most famous palace hotels. The price is really high so also our expectations had been huge. When we arrived via boat from the train station it was easy to find as it is directly at san marco square located. we entered the hotel and walked to the reception. The reception is very small and we waited a while till we got served. You check in directly next to other guests as the space is so limited. Not good if you like privacy. The staff acts very traditional and they show you to the room with telling you a few things about the hotel. Nice touch though and flawless service. The room itself was not to big but with a nice old venezian flair. In the bathroom had been mold directly under the showerhead...  Conciergeâ€¦
