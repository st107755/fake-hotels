Arrived at The Daneli.....walked in and took in the beauty, elegance and history of this fabulous hotel! From the minute my husband and I stepped foot in the hotel the staff were so friendly and welcoming! Yes its expensive but its totally amazing, for most its a special experience that you will never forget! Fabulous food, cocktails, our bedroom (70) in the main building....stunning and views to die for!!!! Breakfast on the roof terrace was amazing a weekend to remember! Thank you to all the staff x
