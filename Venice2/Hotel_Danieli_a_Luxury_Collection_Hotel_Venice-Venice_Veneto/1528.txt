My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Danieli September 9 thru 12 of 2014 celebrating our 48th wedding anniversary,  We had stayed there 5 years ago for an anniversary trip and had loved it so  much that a return trip to Venice meant we would stay no other place.  Last trip we so enjoyed the breakfasts on the terrace on the Grand Canal. This year we opted for a premium deluxe room and was given a luxury room which was beautiful except for the fact we had the view of a wall. Nonetheless, we would have loved it except we were told our room did not include breakfast.  We were told we could make reservations at the desk for 40 euros each for breakfast!!!! Needless to say, we didn't eat breakfast on the terrace and our stay at the Danieli was ruined. We had been in Europe for 3 weeks,â€¦
