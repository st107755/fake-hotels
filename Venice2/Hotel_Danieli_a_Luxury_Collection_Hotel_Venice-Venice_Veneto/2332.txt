We stayed for 3 nights before going on a cruise. The check in was slow and the receptionist was not very friendly. The service is really really really bad, definitely not what you will expect when paying THAT price for a hotel room. Concierge was rude and not very amicable.   The bed was soooo soft that you just sink in it! we end up with a horrible back pain.  Good breakfast and the view on the terrace is very nice. The check out was sooo bad: we asked for a porter to help with the luggage and he never showed up, we had to bring the bags ourselves, and the guy when we finally met him was expecting a tip!! i told the lady in the front desk about the bad service, and she only said: we are not enough to do everything!!!!  On our return from the cruise, we stayed in the Sofitel,â€¦
