We stayed here for a few nights over New Year. There is much to like about the hotel, and I will start with the plus points, which are: -the ambience in the lobby bar, with the piano player, and very fairly priced drinks for an hotel of this standard - the cocktails are mostly 20 euros . A very nice place to be of an evening and a lovely relaxing spot during the day -The decor of the 14th century main building is stunning - people come into the lobby from outside just to photograph it! -the location is fantastic, just a couple of minutes walk from San Marco -the service is mostly good ( although more on that later). Service on departure was excellent -The rooms are comfortable - and lavishly decorated with silk wall coverings and antique furniture. We had a walk in dressing areaâ€¦
