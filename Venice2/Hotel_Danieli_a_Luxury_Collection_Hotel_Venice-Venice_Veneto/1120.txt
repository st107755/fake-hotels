If you are in Venice, you MUST stay at this historic and amazing hotel. The location is fabulous, the interior is magnificent and the service is impeccable. You will love your room even if make stay in the newer part of the hotel. The lobby is just jaw dropping and the terrace restaurant cannot be missed.
