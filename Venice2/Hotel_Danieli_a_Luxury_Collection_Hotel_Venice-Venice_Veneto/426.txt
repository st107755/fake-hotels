So special.  From the beautiful room with original Venetian floor in the old part of the hotel to the bottle of bubbly waiting for us on our arrival to the way we were brilliantly looked after by the concierge, waiting and housekeeping teams.  They were all amazing and the hotel beautiful.  What a fantastic way to splash out for our 10 year anniversary.  One of the most beautiful views we've ever had over breakfast.  And what a breakfast.
