Beautiful Hotel RIGHT NEXT TO the Palazzo Ducale in St Marcs Square. This historical hotel has you feeling like you have entered a time warp. The room was beautifully furnished and the service was incredible. Again the concierge is amazing and happy to assist you with anything. The beds I recalled were one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. A stunning hotel.
