check in was fine, but it was all downhill from there.  The room we were given was dark and stuffy, with no view.  The air conditioning was non existent.  The positives were the location to the vaporitti, and the piano player in the evening was terrific.  the prices for coffee, water,etc. were outrageous.  The concierge was very condescending and not receptive to assisting.   I would not recommend this hotel.
