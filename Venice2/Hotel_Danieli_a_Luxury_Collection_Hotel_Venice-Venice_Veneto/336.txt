Lives up to, and exceeds all expectations. Perfect location on the Grand Canal 50 metres from Piazza S. Marco and next to the Doges Palace. I strongly recommend having the concierge arrange a boat transfer from the airport or train station.   The room was small but perfectly located with a priceless water view, breakfast and dinner on the rooftop we’re completely memorable and the staff attentive and professional.   Undoubtedly one of the world’s best hotels.
