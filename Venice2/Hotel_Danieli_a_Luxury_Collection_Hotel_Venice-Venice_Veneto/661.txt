The best thing at the hotel is the breakfast on the rooftop, food was great and the view was beautiful.   Reception area looks pretty cool too. Location was perfect for our first time in Venice. We could access everything we needed and the important attractions were walking distance.   The rooms are very traditional in style but we had a nice big dressing room and bathroom which was great and spacious.
