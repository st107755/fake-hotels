We stayed three nights at this beautiful hotel in July.  What a treat!  We had a large room overlooking the Grand Canal.  The staff was exceptional, friendly, and attentive.  the room had a tub and shower, and was very large by European Standards.  Even though it is pricey, I cannot recommend this lovely hotel highly enough!
