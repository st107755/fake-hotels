This is one of the best hotels we have ever visited  - the location, architecture of the main hotel, the history, the staff, the rooms, the food and the service all work seamlessly to give an air of luxury and timelessness. On top of that there are the views from the terrace at breakfast and the views from our rooms onto the end of the Grand Canal and the Lido and Giudeca. This is one to which we will return.
