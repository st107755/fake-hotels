This hotel has been on my bucket list forever and I was so disappointed. I arrived late - around 10.30pm and there was no one to greet me off the boat or help with luggage.  My room was fine - twin bed which I always find frustrating when I’m travelling on my own. It had steps up so they couldn’t bring the room service I ordered in on a trolley. The room service menu is very limited after 10.30pm. The bathroom was dirty which is a pet hate but by the time I wanted a bath at 11pm, there wasn’t anyone from housekeeping to clean it again. The room was extremely noisy. I rang reception at just before midnight to ask when the music downstairs was going to finish and was told it would be around 10 minutes which it was. It was hard to get to sleep though with the music and not helped…
