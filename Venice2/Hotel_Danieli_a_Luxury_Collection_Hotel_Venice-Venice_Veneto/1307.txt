Summer vacation with our two grandchildren was made all the better by staying at the Hotel Danieli.  Boy, were they surprised when we landed in Venice and took a boat to the hotel and entered through their private boat dock, right into the lobby.  We had two adjoining rooms with a private foyer.  The service was incredible and the food at the roof-top restaurant was wonderful, even the pasta my granddaughter ordered made her happy.  (If it's not pizza, pasta or chicken nuggets, it's not food for her taste).  We thoroughly enjoyed our thee day stay including the wonderful bellinis every afternoon from the lobby bar.  The remodeling is terrific and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
