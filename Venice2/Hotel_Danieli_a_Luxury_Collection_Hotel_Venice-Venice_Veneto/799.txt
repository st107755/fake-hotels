On our recent trip, we had stayed at Caesar Augustus in Capri--amazing; Palazzo Avina in Ravello--amazing and finally the Danieli....Impersonal staff...rooms the size of a bathroom; overpriced; Average only because of the beauty of the building....I would never stay here again...so many other beautiful options in Venice where you are more than a credit card....Yes....It is just a Sheraton!
