Given the price we expected absolute luxury, but it's not what we got. After we got past the idiosyncracies of this beautiful old place, however, we even forgave the terrible shower and the shabby paintwork. The building itself, the furnishings, the dress and behaviour of staff are from another era, and it grew on us. Breakfast on the upstairs terrace looking down on the hustle and bustle was priceless, even if you did have to watch out for the sparrows. Not only that, it's out the door and you're right there a step away from the sights. Something everyone who visits Venice should experience.
