This is not an easy hotel to review as a whole as there are pockets of good and bad throughout. When staying at one of the best hotels in Venice, one expects superlative service and very good, if not great, accommodation. This hotel falls a little short in some aspects. On a scale of 10, with 10 being outstanding. I would say as follows: location 10; building 10; front desk staff 5; concierge desk (ask for Alessi) 10; roof deck restaurant ambiance 10, food 9, staff 6; bar ambiance 8, food etc 6, staff 7; my room 2; housekeeping 7; etc. In other words great place but needs to have some basic upgrades (eg elevators, air conditioning/heat controls, some rooms) and in some cases an attitudinal shift.
