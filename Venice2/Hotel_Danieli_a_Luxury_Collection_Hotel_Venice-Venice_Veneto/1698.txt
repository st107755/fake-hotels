The Danieli is aways an old favourite for random stop-offs for drinks, many because it is near a vaporetto stop that I tend to use often.  It is particularly enchanting at Christmas as the decor is just magical.  I recommend sitting in the back bar on the ground floor for secret people-watching and fantastic service.
