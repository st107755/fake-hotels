10/10 amazing, the staff the hotel even the background people when you encounter them are so genuinely nice friendly fantastic.  A must is the terrace roof top 7am breakfast Venice is coming alive then, well I really don't think it sleeps, the beds are O so comfortable.  Loved it and definitely will return.
