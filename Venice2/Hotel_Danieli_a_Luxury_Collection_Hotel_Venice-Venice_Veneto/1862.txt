myself and my partner stayed at the Danieli just for 2 nights the 13th and 14th february,we won this stay on bed and breakfast basis the breakfast was outstanding and im sure the other meals were too but unfortunately i cannot justify paying 145 euros at least per head so we ate elsewhere.the hotel though is in a great location , staff were friendly and helpful ,venice is lovely but very expensive.
