Having stayed in several hotels, I thought that I would go all-out and splurge. It was worth it. What a great hotel. As other reviewers say, the lobby bar is spectacular with gorgeous furniture and chandeliers, and waiters in starched white coats, like the old days. I ate at their terrace restaurant which was one of the best views  in Venice, as well as delicious. Only negative comment- the front desk is so very tiny, I felt sorry for the efficient staff, trying to help guests.
