we stayed at the danieli at the start of our cruise in the older part of the hotel. we were upgraded, without asking, into a suite without a view. the room was tired and in need of refurbishing however, service was excellent and the breakfast was fantastic. it was served in a magnificent room with great views and service. at the end of the cruise, we again were upgraded to a suite ,but this time in the renovated part of the hotel. it was fantastic! truly, 4 stars. iwe were sorry to leave.
