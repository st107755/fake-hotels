Over-priced menu, pretentious service. Lackluster selection. We had looked forward to this evening anticipating an exquisite meal. WRONG! The food was bland and very unimaginatively presented.  The sole wrapped over scampi had clearly been assembled earlier in the day and lacked any taste. The veal tournedos were bland, coarse chunks of pretty elderly veal. The sauce, what there was of it, was good and saved the dish somewhat. The absurd stuffiness of the waiters was almost a parody of every diner's nightmare.
