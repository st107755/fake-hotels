Hi just got back again after 3 days at the danieli     was not disappointed this is one of my all time favs    had private transfer for airport book through hotel.   the hotel has had some improvements since last year. the terrace restaurant which has the best views of the city has had a big make over.   very nice food was good at night try booking b&b as its 50 euros for breakfast otherwise.…   our room was a little tired after a word with the manager we were upgraded to the new part which is very nice more plush and what you would expect. my advice is ask for this part  all marble bathrooms flat screens ect  Another tip dont go on a gondola in day to hot and to many try at night around 1030 from other side of realto bridge see pic you will have venice to your self and great at…
