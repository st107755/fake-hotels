This place was exactly what we imagined Venice to be... and more. Amazing location, can walk to so many different stores and restaurants. View from our room was amazing (pictured), perfect sunsets. And the breakfast restaurant's views and food was perfect! The lobby bar could have a little better food menu, but it is a lobby bar... Very old and historic looking, just like it should be!
