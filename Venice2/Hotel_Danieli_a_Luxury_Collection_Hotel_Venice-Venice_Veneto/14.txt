Arriving via the Grand Canal was great, the hotel is very stylish and our room likewise. Staff were lovely. Wi fi was a little hit and miss, but cocktails in the lounge a must. Breakfast on the first day was great, on the second day we found the hot selection lukewarm. Out and about turn right out of the front door then right and right again. This will take you to trattoria del Riveta and plenty of local bars with non tourist prices. St Marks wise although the square cafes were not silly prices we took a TR tip and got a table overlooking the square in the museum cafe, which was just as good. We also had a walk to the Jewish ghetto, where the memorial is very poignant.
