This hotel and its terrace restaurant ruin my 60th birthday. The service was disgraceful only equalled by the bland food and the excessive prices. I tried to complain but was ignored numerous times by the General Manager and then by the parent company but was ignored. They don't care which is like their staff. Don't waste your money or spoil your visit to Venice go elsewhere you can do much better
