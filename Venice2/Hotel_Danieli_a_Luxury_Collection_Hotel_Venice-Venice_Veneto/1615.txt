The Danieli is superb!  In EVERY way. Exquisite surroundings. Professional and courteous, reception and the concierge desk are outstanding. And how lucky to have continuity - and to be greeted and looked after so well! The outdoor dining on the terrace with the best view in Venice was glorious. Thank you - to all - and the best I could wish is for everyone to have the pleasure of this amazing hotel.
