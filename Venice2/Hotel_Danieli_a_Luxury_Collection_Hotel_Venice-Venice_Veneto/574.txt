Perfect location, walking distance from the port and st Marc square. The hotel is very clean but our room was absolutely tiny. The service was great but very slow to check in. The rooms do not have basic facilities you would expect in any "luxury" hotel. No iron and ironing board, no coffee or tea etc.  it's a great hotel but I don't understand how it is categorized as luxury?
