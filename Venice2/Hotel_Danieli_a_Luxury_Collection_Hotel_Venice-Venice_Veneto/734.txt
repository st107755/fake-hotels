We were in Venice, en famille, to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday. We popped into Hotel Danieli for cocktails. The surroundings are quite exquisite, The cocktails did not disappoint. The pianist played and crooned and we whiled away a few hours munching on the never ending snacks and sipping our cocktails. Perfectly lovely
