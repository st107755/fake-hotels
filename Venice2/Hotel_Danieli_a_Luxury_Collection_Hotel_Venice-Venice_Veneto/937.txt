Danieli is one of the most charming hotels in a city that is full of charming hotels! The staff is very good and attentive and arriving by boat in typical Venetian style is a great experience. The one thing you must know is that of course the building is very old as is the interior. As a result, some of the facilities are not quite up to the standard you may find in newer hotels. And its expensive, but that goes fo almost everything in Venice...
