My Partner and I stayed here for a Birthday treat. I cannot fault it. The staff were very professional, and our room was stunning. We could watch the Gondola from our window and the grand canal beyond. A real treat. We were lucky as we went in October so although busy, it wasn't too crowded, and you can step from the Danieli straight to all the main attractions . Two top tips, take a trip to 'Harry's Bar' ( the birth place of the Belini)...expensive , but worth it to experience an original Hemingway haunt that is unchanged and feels like it's stuck in time. Also, do not pay for Dinner at the Hotel, a lovely experience (it is famous for romantic views of the grand canal by moonlight) , BUT you are charged just to sit down. We had a beautiful view  for Dinner and the food was ok,â€¦
