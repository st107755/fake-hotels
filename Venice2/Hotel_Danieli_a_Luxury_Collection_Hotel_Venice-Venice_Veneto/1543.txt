I always wanted to stay in this hotel, from the first time I watched a film with Sofia Loren.  Everything about this hotel is 1st class, top service and standards.    The breakfast area is incredibile and to Restaurant is really romantic.   Would recommend this hotel to anyone with a special anniversary on the way.
