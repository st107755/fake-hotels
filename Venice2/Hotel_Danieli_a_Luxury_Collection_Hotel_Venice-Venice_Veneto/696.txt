The hotel is beginning to show its age. In need of some upkeep and renewal. Plastic plants in otherwise beautiful and historical reception area is NOT the answer. A real shame and bad taste!  Some of the Staff is sometimes a little arrogant and in need of some training and motivation although the younger members were really helpful.  Terrasse restaurant is so beautiful but where are some of the more traditional Italian dishes we come here for?  Concierge services not optimal.  Surely you can do better.
