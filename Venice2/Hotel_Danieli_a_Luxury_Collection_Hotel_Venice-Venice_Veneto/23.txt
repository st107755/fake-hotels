We arrived at Hotel Danieli on October 31, 2019 for a two night stay. We were met at the dock and escorted to reception. We checked into our room in the Palazzo section of the hotel. It was beautiful! Everything about this hotel, the history, the beauty, the people are wonderful. We ate breakfast each morning at the hotel (Terrazza Danieli, separate review). We strolled around Venice each day (separate review of restaurants in the city). It was wonderful!
