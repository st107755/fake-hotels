The beautiful hotel danielli venice spent 3 wonderful nights there without doubt the best bedroom i have ever slept in in italy, A lagoon view room with breathtaking views wonderful bathroom fixtures and fittings and the service second to none these people really know how to look after there guests ,Breakfasts were wonderful with everything you could possibly want and if they had'nt got what you desired they would go and get it for you, all served on the terrace overlooking the lagoon. Staff extremely helpful and curteous Bar prices  and restaurant expensive but this can be expected in venice not just at this hotel but throughout the entire city Anyone who is not impressed by the danielli must be someone exceptionally hard to please i have to rate this hotel 5*
