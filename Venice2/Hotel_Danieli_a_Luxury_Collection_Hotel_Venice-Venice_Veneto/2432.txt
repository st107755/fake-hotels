Stayed at the Danieli for 3 nights. The location is perfect, just steps away from the Bridge of Sighs and around the corner from San Marco. It's an old style palazzo with all the gilding and excess that a Venetian hotel ought to have.  Our room was in the 19th Century wing, with a view of a tiny canal where gondelieri passed each evening, some of them singing. It was a small room, but well designed, and with all the conveniences we needed, along with a lot of luxury detailing like a bathrobe and posh slippers.  The concierge service was excellent. They were able to book us restaurant reservations, a special tour at the palazzo ducale, and train tickets for our destination.  The only complaint was the rooftop restaurant. We knew it would be pricey, since it had a spectacular viewâ€¦
