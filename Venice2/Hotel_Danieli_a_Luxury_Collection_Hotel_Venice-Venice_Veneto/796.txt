Loved the Danieli - it really is an amazing Hotel.  The Staff were very attentive and efficient.  You are in a great location to visit all the wonderful sites in Venice. The Terrace restaurant really does have the superb views that everyone raves about.  Unfortunately we did have a couple of disappointments, firstly I gave up on the Cappuccino at breakfast as they were consistently only just warm, we also found the cooked food (especially the scrambled egg ) the same.  As mentioned in a previous review we also found that empty bottles were left in the room and glasses we used were not replaced for some reason - we had to ask for them. When paying the high price of a stay at the Danieli these things should never happen.
