I loved this hotel, full of old world charm and character - breakfast very expensive - but par for the course in Venice - fantastic views over the lagoon from the rooftop terrace.  I found the staff very helpful and courteous, although on a short break to Venice there is so much to see and so little time to spend in the hotel! Great location
