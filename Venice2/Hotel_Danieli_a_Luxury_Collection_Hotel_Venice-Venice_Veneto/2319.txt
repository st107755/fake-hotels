Absolutely perfect. Staff were attentive, friendly & polite, food and service in restaurant  second to none,wonderful view whilst enjoying breakfast. The Danieli has so much charm and character,our room was tastefully decorated and loved the fact they even provided slippers with hotel logo. Definately worth saving up for,made our first trip to Venice truely memorable.
