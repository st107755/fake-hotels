My wife and I had really been looking forward to staying at this hotel especially since it was a 5-star hotel and we were using Starwood points for our stay. However, upon our arrival, we were informed that the hotel staff would likely be on strike for a couple of days during our stay. They offered to move up to another Starwood property be we elected to stay as it didn't seem that the strike would mainly impact restaurants and room service and we didn't plan on using those services anyway. The staff then gave us a wonderful upgraded room overlooking the lagoon. Everything about the room was first class....the decor, the furniture, the bed linens (truly linens) and the view! We avoided eating at the hotel based on the reviews and costs. And in the end, the staff didn't go onâ€¦
