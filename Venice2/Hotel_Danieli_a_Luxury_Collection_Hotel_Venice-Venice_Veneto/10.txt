From the minute i stepped foot in the Danieli, it was hospitality like no other, the bell men to the wonderful receptionist who had only started two months ago to the gentleman who brought our luggage up. The hotel is a work of art with beautiful decor, colorful and eye catching at every turn and kept clean and tidy. The dinner at the restaurant was amazing and my partner and I thoroughly chose the right spot to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, Danieli is just beauty beyond age and i and definitely coming back here for a longer stay the next time Iâ€™m in Venezia.
