Absolutely fantastic, would return here every time, this is the best hotel i've ever stayed in, due to the friendliest staff, lovely rooms which they upgraded us when we arrived, the biggest bed i've ever slept in, balcony, sent us champagne & cake, also red wine & canap√©s. The view from the dinning room is breathtaking,& the best full breakfast experience.
