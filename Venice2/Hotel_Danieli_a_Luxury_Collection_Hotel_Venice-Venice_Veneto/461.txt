We soent a week here in may and it was both home and hero. The danieli treated us as both a guest and family, we met the gm in the lift and he helped us get a great table at the roof top terrace and made surecwecwere happy. The team were perfectionists. Loved, lived and breathed their work. Loved it and will be back.
