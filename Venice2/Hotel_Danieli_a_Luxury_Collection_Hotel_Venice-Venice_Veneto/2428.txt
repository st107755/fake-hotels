We just returned from a dream trip to Italy with Tauck Tours.  I've waited my whole life to see Venice and it was a 60th birthday gift.  The Danieli is part of the History of Venice and yes, very expensive but it was part of the reason we chose to do a tour having never been to Europe let alone Venice.  It's location, service and rooms were impeccable but i don't know if we could have afforded it if we were not part of Tauck...  If you can....do it.  Venice is magical and the Danieli is part of the magic! (Rooftop dining is wonderful but check to make sure they are serving outside.  Inside is nice but very expensive and nothing special to look at.)
