Just back from 3 nights at danieli booked by my husband as a birthday surprise . We arranged airport transfers through concierge desk -expensive but a very professional and efficient service .  We had a lagoon view room - amazing views towards grand canal . Room itself was spacious .large bathroom with all amenities .room cleaned well and lovely turn down service .there was a bottle of prosecco and a small cake waiting in the room.   We had Sunday brunch at the terrace restaurant .a great experience .food and drink excellent and views breath taking .  Breakfast had a good selection and service was good   Only slight negative was the receptionist at check out -didn't make eye contact and didn't actually speak to us   Have noticed the really good reviews all from guests staying inâ€¦
