Pros: Beautiful terrace restaurant, location, the bathrooms were clean and spacious, the beds were comfortable, concierge arranged private transfer from the airport that was appreciated!  Cons: The hotel requested we book an additional room to suit our family. We absolutely did not need the additional room. The room was super expensive. I understand it is Venice, but the rooms were subpar. Stains on the carpet and chair.   Not what I would expect from a Starwood Property. We were very disappointed with our choice in this hotel.
