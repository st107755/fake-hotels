We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights before boarding a cruise. The hotel is situated close to St Marks Square, and so is in a very busy tourist area. There are water ferry passenger stops outside of the main doors, so one steps out of the hotel into mayhem. We found that there was nowhere intimate to enjoy a bar drink. The hotel has 2 bars, one on the ground floor and one on the 5th floor terrace. The latter has magnificent views, but as it also doubles as the main restaurant, drinks are only available outside of dining hours. The former on the ground floor forms part of a vacuous lounge with hard floor very high ceilings, and could not be described as intimate. It had no views, and reception and check in are almost in the same room. So hardly a relaxing and intimate atmosphere.â€¦
