What can we say? We have just spent 7 wonderful days at Hotel Danieli. Everything about this hotel is '5 star wow', its history, its stunning architecture, beautiful location and elegantly styled rooms. However the quality that really makes it exceptional is the superb service provided by the people who work in the hotel. The manager, the reception and concierge team, the restaurant and bar staff and the housekeeping team are, without exception, helpful, good-humoured and friendly; they really do all they can to make your visit feel extra special. We have loved our stay and feel sad to leave. A truly memorable holiday in a beautiful hotel. Grazie Mille.
