Absolutely stunning interior spaces. I had a room overlooking the Grand Canal, the room decor was rather more Victorian than Italian, but very pretty. Nice restaurant, I had dinner there and service was polished (as expected)... very expensive (but that was also as expected!!). Location is probably the best in Venice, far better than the Gritti Palace in my opinion. Concierge was very courteous and helpful.
