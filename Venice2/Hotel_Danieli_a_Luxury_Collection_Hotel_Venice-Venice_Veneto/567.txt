The Danieli is a "grand old dame" with historic significance that is well preserved. The ambiance is great - beautiful lobby, live music in the Bar Dondolo every evening, fabulous rooftop views for breakfast. The location is excellent - particularly useful in the heat of summer to come back to for brief rests during sightseeing adventures. The concierge is attentive and responsive to all needs. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. With Starwood Platinum upgrades - a suite, welcome gifts etc, I really can't find anything negative to say.
