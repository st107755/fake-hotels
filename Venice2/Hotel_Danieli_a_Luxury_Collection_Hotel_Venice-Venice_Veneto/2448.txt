I stayed there one night on business. For a 5 star "luxury collection" rating it was a dissapointment. Certainly the hall, the roof terrace and the location are magnificent but the rooms are old and overheated (cold not turn it off). The breakfast a dissapointment for the price and the service condescending. For those prices and that history I'd expect more.
