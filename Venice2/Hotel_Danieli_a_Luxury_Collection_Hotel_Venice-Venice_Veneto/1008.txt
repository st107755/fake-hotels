We spent our first wedding anniversary in the Danieli's in Venice. It was our second stay there. Also this time it had been an fantastic trip. Venice itself is an exciting city with lots of special things to discover (away from tourist streams). And the Danieli's is a stunning hotel. Our executive suite was an excellent choice. Though next time we will go back to one of the rooms facing the lagoon. The rooms, the reception hall are not modern but reflect what we expect from the traditional Venice. Luxury, stylish, with sunning views. The breakfast room on the top level provides a fantastic view across the lagoon, the entrance to the Canale Grande and the city. It is remarkable when there is good weather. If it is raining like on the sunday when we were there, it becomes obviousâ€¦
