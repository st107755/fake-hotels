Fantastic views, beautiful hotel.   Perfect location.  Will definitely go back. #spglife.  Service is exceptional and the view from the terrace restaurant is the best in Venice.  Had a fabulous room in the old part.  Loved the balcony.   The concierge, Filipo, went out of his way on many occasions to assist us.
