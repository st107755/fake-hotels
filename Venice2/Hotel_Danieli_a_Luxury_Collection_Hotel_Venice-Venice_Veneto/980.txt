This is a luxurious hotel, ornate and very Venetian. Very comfortable room; king bed. A shower (in tub) with partial glass enclosure is always a challenge to keep floor dry.   Very pleasant restaurant on top floor; enjoyed breakfast on the terrace  with view of Canal.   Concierge very helpful in recommending restaurants, making reservations, providing pre-printed cards for each restaurant, to help you find/contact them.  Located at vaporetto stop, and just steps from San Marco.
