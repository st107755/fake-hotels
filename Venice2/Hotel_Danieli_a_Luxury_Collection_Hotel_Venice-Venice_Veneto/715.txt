Just a few minutes ago I wanted to book a room for us as our Engagement took place here. As we have a little baby I was connected to the front desk in order to know if baby beds are available. The Lady on the phone was quite rude (Simone?) and could not explain me if the such a bed is available. When I tried to ask her to explain me once again what she means, she became that impatient and rude that I had to ask her if I am disturbing her at her work place right now? Her answer was that Ã­t is carneval. I am quite suprised by such communication and very Special manner to treat the guests. Very sad.
