My husband and I had a few wonderful nights at this grand, old hotel. The hotel was beautifully decorated  and our hotel room was stunning. We dined in the roof top restaurant which had fab food, drinks and service and, of course, stunning views of Venice. The hotel is so majestic and in a stunning location but the hotel staff are, in my opinion, quite snooty!
