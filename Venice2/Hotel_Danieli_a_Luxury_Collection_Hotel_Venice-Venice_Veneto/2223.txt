I was expecting a lot more from the Danielli. The rooms are Sub Par. It smelled a bit upon checkin. Perhaps we had a smoker’s room. We were supposed to get a canal view, instead got a wall view. Checkout took 45 minutes, and internet was free downstairs, but cost 20 EU if you order it in your room. (Same internet will work in both places) they failed to mention that to me. The concierge guy was spectacular, that’s the only reason I stayed. Otherwise, I would have swallowed my losses and left.  Wasn’t so impressed with this hotel
