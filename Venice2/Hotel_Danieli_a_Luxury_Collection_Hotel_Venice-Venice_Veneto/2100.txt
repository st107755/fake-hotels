I love the Danieli, i always did,I´m a kind of person that doesn´t look for luxury itself,once in a hotel, but I do mind for a clean and confortable room, a planty and copious coffee-buffet breakfast each and every morning, I´m a very individualist person while  on trips, being alone. I love the Danieli, its eldely atmosphere, slightly frightening , but yet where I fell taking cover of something unknown.
