We arrived at the Danieli by river taxi which was an amazing start. The hotel is beautiful and the location is outstanding as it is on the doorstep of St Marks and overlooking the lagoon.The view from the terrace is breathtaking.The staff were helpful and attentive at all times.The rooms were very comfortable and the beds were amazing. An expensive but wonderful hotel.
