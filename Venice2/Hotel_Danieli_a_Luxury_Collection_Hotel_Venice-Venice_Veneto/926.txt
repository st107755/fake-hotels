We traveled from Rome to Florence to Venice. We started and ended our vacation at two of the nicest hotels, the middle was so so. The staff here were very nice and accommodating. It is a hotel that we will always remember staying, and will book again on any return to Venice.   It was easy to jump on any water taxi, since the stops were right in front of the hotel. Great food all around, just ask the concierge, and he will give you a card and directions to where the good eats are.
