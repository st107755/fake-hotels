My wife, 10 month old girl and I have just returned from 4 nights at the hotel and we wouldn't have changed a thing.   Travelling with a baby was made really by the hotel as we had everything we needed in the room and all of her sterilised bits were bought up to the room while we were out.   We stayed in room 200 and it was very big and beautifully decorated in true Venetian style. The bed was huge and one of the comfiest beds we have stayed in. Our room was on the canal between the 2 hotel buildings which we loved as it made for some great views.   This is a truly beautiful and stunning hotel. The bar, reception and stair case are incredible! I can see why they are a tourust attraction in their own right. Personally this was only beaten by the view over Venice at breakfast.â€¦
