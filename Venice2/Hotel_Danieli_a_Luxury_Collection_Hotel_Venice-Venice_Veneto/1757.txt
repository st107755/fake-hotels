If you have fond memories of staying at the Danieli, do not spoil them by returning.  The location remains superb and the lobby is always impressive, but its all downhill from there.  Our 'deluxe' rooms facing San Giorgio Ile were all threadbare and run down.  The bathrooms had extensive mold and the plumbing did not work (would you like your shower boiling or freezing?).  The phones did not work.  The lobby was understaffed and overwhelmed so allocate 15 minutes everytime you need to pick up your keys.  The concierges did not seem to enjoy interacting with guests, and certain ones could not even correctly identify the locations of the recommended restaurants and bars.  The brunch, which used to be a highlight, is now mediocre and not worthy of the stunning view from the rooftopâ€¦
