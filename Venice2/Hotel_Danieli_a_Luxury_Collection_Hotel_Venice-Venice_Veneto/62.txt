Stayed at Danieli in Venice 9/27 - 30, after visiting Florence and Rome.  Our room was located in the old wing of the hotel - extremely small, decor was very dated, and furniture, carpeting, etc. was rather worn.  Electronics - TV, radio, extremely dated as well.  Staff was friendly, but did not go out of their way to make you fell important (I am lifetime Platinum member).  Breakfast was fair - scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, fruit, cereal, juices, breads - no omelets made to order.  Lobby has character, but is rather cold. Location is convenient.  Overall, very mediocre hotel at best.  To be fair, I stayed at St. Regis in Florence and Rome prior to arriving in Venice, and I would rate these hotels  both 10 +, while Danieli a 4.
