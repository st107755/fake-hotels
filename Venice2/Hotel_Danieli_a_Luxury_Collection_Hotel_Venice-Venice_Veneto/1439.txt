This hotel is the most amazing place. As soon as you walk in the foyer, you are struck by its beauty, with the marble staircase and the arched balconies above. The staff are incredibly friendly and their afternoon tea is a must.   We had a lovely room overlooking the lagoon.  With all its grandeur it still has a homely feel.  You cannot visit Venice without going to the Danieli.
