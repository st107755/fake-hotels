The hotel is very special, the lobby amazing and our room was beatifully decorated in venezian style with a marble bathroom and a lovely view at the lagoon. Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. The breakfast on the roof terrace amazing!! However i would not recommend to go for drinks in the afternoon or dinner up there. Whilst the service within the hotel is impecable, the waiters at the terrace in the afternoon and dinner are slow, very slow, and also not as friendly as one would expect, which can be upsetting given the higher end prices of drinks and food.
