Mid-way through our stay nothing but excellence in service. Junior Suite beautiful and well appointed. Concierge extremely knowledgable with dinner recommendations five stars. Lobby barman superb with piano man playing all the international favorites. Highly recommended - and we are only half way through our visit!
