This was our first trip to Venice, after arriving in style on the Orient Express from the UK.   The hotel was quite simply stunning, it is how you would picture a romantic arrival in Venice to be. We only had a one night stay unfortunately so we didnt get a chance to try the rooftop restaurant or just to sit down and have a drink in the bar.   Our room was beautiful, we two floor to ceiling doors with fabulous views, while the room itself was huge. Location wise it was very close to St Marks Square, which we had to run through as it rained on our one day.  One tip I would give is: ladies, leave the stiletto's at home.
