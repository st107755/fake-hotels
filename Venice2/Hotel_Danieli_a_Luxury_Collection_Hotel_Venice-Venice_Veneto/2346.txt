The lobby of this hotel is stunning and uniquely Venetian.  The hotel sits on the mouth of the Grand Canal (not ON the Grand Canal) very close to St. Mark's square, so the tourist traffic is heavy.  Inside of the hotel, you almost feel like you're in another world.  We stayed in one of the older sections of the building and the room was extremely comfortable and well-appointed.  The service was unbeatable.  The food and beverage is extremely high-priced -- even by Venice standards -- but If you're staying here, you can probably afford it.
