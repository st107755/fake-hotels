I was speechless when I walked into the Hotel Danieli, it exceeded my expectations. the architecture and art were spectacular! the Staff was so helpful especially the housekeeper and so accommodating. The spacious rooms offered a wonderful view of the canals and the grand Canal and also lots of storage space. Close to everything including fantastic restaurants that were quite affordable and delicious right next to the Danieli. We had the buffet breakfast on the rooftop restaurant at the Hotel and it was a highlight of our stay as not only was the food delicious but the view was beautiful. Would stay an the Hotel Danieli time and time again!
