I booked this hotel on a 3 night special offer on the internet.  It certainly lived up to expectations - on arrival I mentioned that this trip was a present from me for my husband’s 80th birthday.  On arrival in our spacious room we found a bottle of sparkling wine and a delicious almond cake.  A lovely surprise.  This hotel could not be better situated as it’s only a few minutes from St Mark’s Square. The buffet breakfast on the 5th floor with fabulous outdoor terrace was excellent.  The piano bar in the evening was delightful.  The personnel are charming and very efficient. Could not recommend too highly this great hotel.  We’ll be returning for his 90th!!
