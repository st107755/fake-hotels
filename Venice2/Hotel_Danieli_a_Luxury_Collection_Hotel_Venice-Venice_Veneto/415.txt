This is a lovely grand, elegant and classy hotel with beautiful reception/lobby bar/lounge area, great ambience and typical Venetian decor. The reception/conceirge staff were friendly, professional, helpful and polite. The conceirge have good knowledge of the area and can help with things like what public water buses to catch to get to the main attractions. The breakfast is served on the top floor restaurant with lovely views overlooking the lagoon. There is plenty choice with a variety of cereals, bread, cakes, fruit, juices, milks, yogurts, cold meats and hot buffet food. Would recommend booking a room with breakfast included as it can be expensive to purchase per day through the hotel at around 50 euros. As we were celebrating my partners birthday we were given a free roomâ€¦
