I have always wanted to go to Venice so we treated ourselves and spent a bunch of Marriott points to stay here. What an excellent choice. The interior is everything you would expect from a former palace, the room was confortable, well appointed and well equipped. The air conditioning worked really well (necessary in August in Venice), the room was quiet, cool and comfortable.  The location is perfect, steps from the Piazza San Marco and the major tourist attractions, steps from the Vaporetto stop and steps from the Alilaguna stop if you are feeling cheap. The hotel has it's own dock if you want to get a gondola ride or a water taxi too. The staff were very attentive and the concierges were very knowledgeable. Highly recommended.
