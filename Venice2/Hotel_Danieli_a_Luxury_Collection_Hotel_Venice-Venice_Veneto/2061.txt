An absolutely world-class, historic hotel in the perfect location.   We stayed in two different lagoon-view suites - being asked whether we would mind moving from the historic room in which we spent the first night, as there were renovations taking place around that might disturb us. We ended up in the most remarkable, comfortable, tasteful suite imaginable.  Sure, there are things they could fix: service in the lovely lounge was a little slow and surly, for example. But these are minor things: this is a very special place.  We did have the advantage of not paying, mind, using Starpointe and suite vouchers, and choosing the free breakfast as a Platinum amenity. The published rates really are eye-watering!
