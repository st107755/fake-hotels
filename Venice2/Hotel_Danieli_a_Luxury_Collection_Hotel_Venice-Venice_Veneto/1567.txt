Our trip to Venice was complimented by our stay at the beautiful Danieli hotel. Our upgraded room faced the lagoon with amazing views of gondolas, cruise ships, water taxis, speed boats and tourists galore. The hotel from outside is ordinary but once through the revolving doors a majestic beauty awaits. The refurbished palace retains the grace and charm of bygone years. Our room included walk in robes, fabric lined walls, period furniture with a beautiful bathroom with luxuriously soft towels and essentials. Pricey? Yes, but a life time experience to be savoured.
