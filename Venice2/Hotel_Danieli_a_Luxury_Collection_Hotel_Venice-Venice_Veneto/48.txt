I was with a group at this hotel last week and while the hotel is still gorgeous, the AC was "shut off for the season". The room was crazy warm and they sent up a fan and gave you key to open the windows; which had no screens. So came home with a big mosquito bite on my neck. The concierge staff looks down at you like they are doing you a favor to answer your questions. The hotel is next door to the mad crowds at San Marco. If I go back to Venice, I would stay further away from the crowds and at a hotel with AC and a better attitude.
