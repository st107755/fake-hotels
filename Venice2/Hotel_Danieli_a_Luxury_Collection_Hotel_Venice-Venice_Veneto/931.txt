Really liked Hotel Danieli.  Our room had a view of the Grand Canal.  It was comfortable and we loved the location.  Walk out the front door, turn right in first alley and our favorite bistro was first location on left.  All the local gondoliers frequented too.  We gravitated there every day for a light bite and Prosecco or beer.  Also ate at the rooftop restaurant for breakfast and dinner (on one occasion).  You can't find a better view for dinner!
