This was our first trip to Venice.  We had a suite on the third floor facing the lagoon.  The view and the experience were amazing.  The suite was impeccable.  The bathroom was just magnificent...all marble, separate room for bidet, loo and shower.  I am redesigning my bathroom at home to match this one!  You are so close to St. Mark's square and all of the touristy stuff, but after dark (and all of the cruise ship passengers) you have it all to yourself!  The location is wonderful.  Our huge suite was amazing. Quiet, luxurious with wonderful views.  the TV in the living room did not work, but there was another in the bedroom that worked fine. We did not even bother to complain since there was no time for TV anyway!  Get ready for hordes of tourists..........more than I everâ€¦
