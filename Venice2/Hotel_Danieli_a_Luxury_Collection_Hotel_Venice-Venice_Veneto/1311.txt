After an incredible stay in Aman Venice in 2014, We decided THIS year TO stay at The Classic and more traditional Hotel Danieli. Big mistake. The prices are similar but oh The Service IS far from equal. The concierges at The Danieli seem to be exhausted and in a constant very bad Mood. YOU wont even GET a Buon Giorno If they see you, let's not pretend a reservation or a more sophisticated request. Same WITH The bell Boy or The reception. The rooms are old, The carpet dirty. Will never stay again in this fancy without The fancy Service, hotel.
