This hotel was all that we expected it to be and more.  We stayed using points and cash so we did not pay the full price for our 2 night stay.  The rooms were  nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable.  Slept like a baby.  All staff were friendly and very helpful in accommodating our requests which was a pleasant surprise as had anticipated a more formal atmosphere.  This was a one in a lifetime experience for us and it was well worth it.  The pictures don't do it justice as the foyer is breathtaking, awe inspiring - just amazing.  We used bonus points for the terrace breakfast - the view alone made it worth it and the breakfast choices were excellent.  I would highly recommend staying here and given the opportunity I would absolutely stay here again.
