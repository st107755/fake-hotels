No doubt. This is one of the best properties we have ever been, The location is not less than fantastic, the building is emazing, But - above all is the wonderful serviece that we recieved from the stuff and especially from ROBERTINO which was our breakfast's waiter and did everything he could to satisfy us. Well done  Robertino!!!
