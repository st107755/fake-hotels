My husband and I started our Mediterranean Cruise in Venice and decided to stay a few days prior to embarking on the ship. The hotel is located on the grand canal and easy access to St. Markâ€™s Square. We were given a room in the annex and on the second day the shower door fell off, of course much to the horror of the Danieli management. They were most kind in righting the situation by moving us to an opulently lovely room and paying for dinner on the rooftop terrace. And to top it off, upon arriving back from sightseeing in the afternoon, a beautiful rose bouquet was delivered. We cannot say enough about this historic hotel and management. Grazie!
