We have just returned from a short break in this wonderful hotel. As soon as you walk into the hotel we were stunned by the beauty of the building.  When we arrived we were attended to immediately by the very polite reception staff. The room was warm and elegant. The bathroom was very clean and well fitted out with robes etc. Thick towels and a shower like a water fall! The beds were extremley comfortable and turn down was a lovely touch. It was our daughter's 18th birthday and they had remembered by putting a birthday cake in the room. :) The views from river view restaurant were absolutely breathe taking. I have never been in a restaurant where there is champagne on offer for a bucks fizz! Breakfast was delicious and masses of choice. My teenagers could eat to their heartsâ€¦
