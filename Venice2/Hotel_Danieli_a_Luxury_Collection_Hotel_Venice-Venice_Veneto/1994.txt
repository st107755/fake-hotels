Getting to Venice all the hotels along the canals is so much more of a chore than any other city. Parking your car for 28 euro a day and taking a boat for another 60 each way starts to add up, not to mention the Venice hotel prices! It's all supply and demand. After all look at the unique city it is and how beautiful!  If you are on a budget you might just get to Venice early and park for the day and not stay there. There is so much charm in Venice and a couple days staying right in the middle of things might just be worth the experience. The Danieli is very nice and the location is hard to beat! The history of the hotel date back into the 1300's! To many that alone makes this hotel stand out! The main feature of this hotel is the restaurant on the fifth floor.  Wow what a view!â€¦
