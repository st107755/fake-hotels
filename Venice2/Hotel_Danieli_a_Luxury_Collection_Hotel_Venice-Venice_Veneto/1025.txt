My wife and I stayed for three nights to celebrate our Ruby Wedding anniversary and the Danielli did not disappoint. Our room was a fabulous 4 room suite and was just superb. Staff and service were very professional and efficient, however we felt that in all departments they could have been more friendly towards the guests, we had just come from the Ritz in London where the staff were much friendlier and customer focused. That aside the building is just magnificent and the views from the rooftop bar are to die for. Location is fantastic just next door to the Doges Palace and St Marks Square.
