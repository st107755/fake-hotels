We have just returned from a week at the Hotel Danieli Venice . We were a bit nervous about staying here because some of the other reviews had previously referred to rude & unhelpful staff.   This was not the case, on arrival we were welcomed with a smile and pleasant chat, registered, then taken to our rooms with a member of reception and shown our room where we were presented with a bottle of Champagne. The room was perfect.   The hotel is magnificent with fantastic architecture.  The lobby and main rooms are really beyond description, they are absolutely beautiful. We have to commend the incredible service we had there, the concierge staff could not be more helpful providing us with accurate information and directions of where to go and not to go.   It had a fantastic roofâ€¦
