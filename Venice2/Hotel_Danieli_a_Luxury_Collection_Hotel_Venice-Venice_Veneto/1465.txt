My husband and I went to the  Hotel Danieli in November for a SPECIAL birthday. We were upgraded to a suite, given sparkling wine and cake and treated to excellent service. It is an expensive hotel, but the lovely drawing room/salon where one has drinks, the magnificent view of the Grand Canal  from the rooftop terrace beyond the dining/breakfast room and the good service made it highly suitable for my special birthday. The hotel is next to the Doges' Palace and the most useful vaporetto stop is just outside the hotel . Highly recommended for a special trip.
