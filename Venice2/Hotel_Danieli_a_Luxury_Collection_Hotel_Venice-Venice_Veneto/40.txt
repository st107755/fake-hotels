We spent two nights in this wonderful hotel- which certainly has the wow factor when you arrive by water taxi. Our room was fine though did not look out over the water but the bed was extremely comfortable and the room had all we needed. Breakfast on the terrace restaurant was gorgeous as the sun was shining and we had an amazing view of the waterways and Islands. We did dine in the restaurant that evening which was fine- though my husband does prefer a plainer choice of food, and we hadnâ€™t looked at the menu before hand so our fault really. The location is fantastic to see all of Venice as its just off San Marco square. Definitely recommend.
