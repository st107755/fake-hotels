This was my first visit to Venice as my 70th birthday present from my husband. Stunning first impressions of the Danieli with the internal decor, atmosphere  and excellent service from reception. Upgraded to a lagoon view room which was spacious and very comfortable with amazing views. Location of the hotel is brilliant for easy access to the  piazza and other historic sites and the roof terrace is memorable for the view over the water. Concierge was most helpful with recommendations for restaurants, getting a kettle for the room etc. Only downside was the food in the hotel. The main restaurant is rather pretentious with a very expensive menu that doesn't justify the price as the quality of the dishes was very disappointing despite their elaborate presentation. Breakfast offeredâ€¦
