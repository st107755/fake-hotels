The hotel Danieli is the most romantic and warm luxurious hotel i have ever been in. The ancient palace was transformed into a cozy hotel. The staff are exceptional. There is beauty around you everywhere you look. This is a must see!!!!  The rooms are comfortable and you have absolutely everything at your disposal.
