We are staying at the Hotel Danieli right now,  for our wedding anniversary,  and having a wonderful time. We have a lagoon view room and I could sit on the balcony watching the boats for hours. We were pleasantly surprised at the comfortable lounge chairs as well as a table and chairs on the balcony. The room is a good size and the bed is vey comfortable. Everywhere is spotless and the service is good. Breakfast on the terrace is a great experience, plenty of choice and omelettes made to order, which this morning was very good. It is very expensive and they take a large chunk from your credit card for anything which may be incurred during your stay, which may be worth knowing in advance, but at the moment I'm enjoying every moment.
