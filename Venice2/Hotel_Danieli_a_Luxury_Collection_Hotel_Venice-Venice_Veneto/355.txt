This 14 th Century Grande Dame of Venice is tired, weary, exhausted and spent.   An extremely expensive three or four star facility on many fair minded scales.    But a one star experience for me.   Location.   Central. An extremely busy tourist hub.   Views.  Excellent from the top restaurant balcony and from the most elite lagoon view suites.   Rooms.   Costly - very.  Priced as a total tourist focussed scam.  Single glazed with significant night time noise. Many rooms are dark.    Food.  Truly average.  Overwhelmed by demand and out of touch with modern cuisine.   Staff.  Polite.   Overall Impression.  I want to be fair and factual, rather than pen this in a dizzy haze of pink champagne and confusion.   This hotel is worn down and tired out.   I see little room for seriousâ€¦
