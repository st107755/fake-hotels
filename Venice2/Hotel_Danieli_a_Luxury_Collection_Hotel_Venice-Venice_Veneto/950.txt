I wanted to stay at the Danieli because it is historical but it was also breathtaking.  We had a suite overlooking the Grand Canal.  The room was very beautiful with champagne and cookies.  Staff was very friendly.  The hotel has very cool walkways and stairways.  Breakfast on the terrace was delicious and possibly had the best view in all of Venice.  The concierge was very helpful as well.  My kids loved everything too.  We were sad to leave.
