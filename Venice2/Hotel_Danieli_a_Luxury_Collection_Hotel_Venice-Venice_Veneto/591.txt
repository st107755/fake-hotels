The hotel is top notch including the service, comfort of the rooms and location. We stayed for two nights and wish we had more time in both Venice and at the Danieli. Our room overlooked the lagoon and was a great place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. The beds were extremely comfortable and the amenities in the room are excellent.   One could not ask for a better location, directly across from the public transportation and a quick walk to St. Mark's square and other sites.
