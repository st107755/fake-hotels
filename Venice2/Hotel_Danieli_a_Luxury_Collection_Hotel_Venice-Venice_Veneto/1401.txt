I went with five girl friends and stayed for three nights and we had a fantastic time! Breakfast on the roof terrace was amazing with delightful views. The staff were courteous and the bedrooms were lovely with such comfortable beds. The reception area of the hotel is absolutely unique with a great atmosphere.
