We celebrated our wedding at the Danieli Hotel, on the terrace. It was fantastic! The aperitif in the hall was superb, the dinner and the wedding cake was out of this world. We had a gourmet meal and every dish was perfect.. They also catered for the vegetarians, vegans and gluten free guests. We couldn't have chose a better place to celebrate. We stayed for one night in the hotel in a really lovely room, some of the guests stayed for three nights and they all enjoyed their stay. The staff were all very friendly and there was excellent service throughout our dinner. I would recommend anyone looking for a special venue for their wedding to consider the Danieli terrace.
