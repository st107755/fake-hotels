I was amazed at the wonderful location of this hotel, the beautiful lobby and the rooftop dining.  What wasn't amazing for the money we paid to stay here, was the service.  There was a one day strike in Italy, and I believe the hotel should have apologized to us for the total lack of service we had for the day.  No one answered the phones, check in was delayed and we had to go to the bar ourselves to get some ice.  Not a real hardship, but we were paying over $2500.00 for two rooms for two nights.  The service was better the next day, but not what it should have been.  An apology would have been appreciated.
