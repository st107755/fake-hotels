I chose Hotel Danieli for my visit in Venice last May primarily for the location. It also helped that I could earn SPG points by staying here. Since the trip was my treat to my mother, it was well worth the splurge.  My mother enjoyed views of the Canal from our room, as well as, great rooftop views during breakfasts at the Terrazza. My mother is unable to walk long distances due to an old injury. I planned to rent a wheelchair prior to our visit. But I first inquired with the hotel. Luckily, the hotel keeps 2 wheelchairs available for the guests to use at no charge. Because of this, my mother was able to enjoy Piazza San Marco longer than an hour. I am grateful to the staff for the kind service: at the reception, concierge, Terrazza. Grazie mille.
