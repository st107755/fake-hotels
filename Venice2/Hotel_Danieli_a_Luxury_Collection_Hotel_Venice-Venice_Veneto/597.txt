Venice, is what you expect. Lovely. My husband and I returned here after 20 years and we had a lovely time. The Danielli is everything we thought it would be. It does not however over look the Grand Canal, (Courtesy  of "The Tourist") We stayed here for 3 nights and had lunch one day. We had been to the Gritti Palace the day before, that was fantastic and we had expectations of the Danielli.The terrace setting was sublime and the views were fantastic. However the food was very disappointing. Neither my husband or I could find a thing on the menu we wanted to eat. We both settled for the soup to start with. It was bland and tasteless. I must have added a ton of parmesan to it to make it more interesting. I'm sure the waiters put it down to my English eccentricity!!! I had pastaâ€¦
