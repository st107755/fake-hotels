Hotel Danieli was excellent. My daughter had booked us to stay for 2 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday. The wonderful staff arranged for us to be collected from the airport, we arrived at the canal side entrance by private water launch, they upgraded our room BECAUSE it was my birthday,even though it was the middle of carnevale. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. When we came back to our gorgeous room on my birthday,they had provided a beautifully presented almond tart with 'Happy Birthday ' written in white chocolate on the slate platter and a bottle of champagne for us to enjoy. My daughter had just informed them about my birthday when she booked and they had arranged it as a surprise! The room was understated elegance, the bathroom was marble and wellâ€¦
