We visited this hotel for drinks when we went to Venice and just wished we had booked to stay there instead. The hotel is truly sumptuous and the staff extremely friendly and accommodating, whilst speaking very good English. Even if you are not staying here, you must visit to take in the splendour and ornate surroundings. The drinks were expensive but the surroundings and experience were worth it, we had Bellinis at around 30 euros each, but I can honestly say we enjoyed every moment.
