We stayed at the Daniellie in August 2011. My previous visit to this Hotel was in 1983 when it really was a five star hotel. Now after my last visit I would rate it 3 star. On arrival it took an hour to check in, when doing so the reception staff would thinki nothing of ignoring you in mid-check in and deal with someone else.

It was 87 degrees the week we stayed, by 1445hours you would expect your room to be made up and ready for siesta, not here. More often than not the room had to be made up at night, if you were lucky enough to be out by 1900. Breakfast was mayhem with longâ€¦
