I recently stayed at the Hotel Danieli in Venice. I must admit that most reviews I read about the property were mixed but I was surprised- We had a great stay. We had a room in the most recently renovated wing of the hotel. We had a room facing the lagoon with a balcony. The room itself was small but with the balcony it was quite nice. It was clean. The bathroom was terrific too! updated and very plush. I would stay here again. The staff was a little uneven and hard to predict. But overall I was surprised- very nice experience.
