This hotel is an experience, starting with the foyer, which is straight from a storybook. We stayed 3 nights total (2 in the new wing and once in the old wing), rooms were spacious, clean and well appointed however the view of the lagoon was like a painting in and of itself. Front desk and concierge service was top notch.
