Going to Venice with a bunch of friends, we decided to stay at the Danieli, because of its long-standing, high reputation...and I do love SPG hotels. When we arrived, the lobby did not disappoint. The beauty, elegance and history of this hotel is really impressive. The staff was all very warm and welcoming. The room was standard SPG - wonderful bed and pillows, mini-bar, robes, turn down service, in hotel restaurant, etc. I did not like the darkness of the room. I think getting rid of the red lampshades could help. The things I was a little disappointed were the food and the concierge. The breakfast should be much better. Staff up there was lovely, but the food was only mediocre for a 5 star hotel and for the price. Room service was really slow at midnight - and the limited menuâ€¦
