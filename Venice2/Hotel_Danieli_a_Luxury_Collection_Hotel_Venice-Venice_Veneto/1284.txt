If you pay over a thousand dollars a night !!! and are required to stand in a crowded line in order to check in I don't know who is the bigger fool. Yes, the palazzo portion of the hotel is ornately beautiful but throngs of camera totting tourists are tripping over one and other to gawk at the splendour. The room does not contain one comfortable chair and the light bulbs needed changing which required several calls to the reception. Calling reception is also a gamble as 4 times out of 5 they do not respond as "we are very busy tonight Madame". The rooftop restaurant is the saving grace, gorgeous view on the lagoon.
