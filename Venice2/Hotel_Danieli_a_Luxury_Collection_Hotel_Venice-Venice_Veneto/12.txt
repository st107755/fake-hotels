My wife and I spent a glorious weekend at the Hotel Danieli. Everything was superb, the room was exceptional and service genuine and attentive. Very convenient location as well. This was my best experience yet at a Marriott property. Exactly what youâ€™d expect and hope for from a fine hotel. Special thanks to Luka and the outstanding concierge team for making a great weekend even better. I unequivocally recommend the property.
