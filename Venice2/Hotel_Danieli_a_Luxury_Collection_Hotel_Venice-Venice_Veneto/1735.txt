Stayed at the Hotel Danieli for 2 nights following a Mediterranean cruise.  Stayed in their gondola-canal suite which was absolutely top of the line as far as plenty of space, beautiful furnishings, amenities and views.  Loved all the Murano glass chandeliers and mirrors.  The hotel lobby was also very beautiful.  I don't think I ever took so many pictures of a hotel room before :-)  As mentioned, the location is also great - right out the front door is the water taxi and gondola launches.  Close to San Marco Square.   The only negative was one hotel employee (out of the 6 or so we met) was quite rude.  For instance, one early evening we had come back from a day of exploring and chose to sit in the lobby to enjoy the atmosphere and pianist before heading up to our room. Knowâ€¦
