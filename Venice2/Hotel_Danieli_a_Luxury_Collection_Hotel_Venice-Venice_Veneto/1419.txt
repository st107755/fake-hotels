From the moment we entered this beautiful building we were treated like royalty by the staff. Friendly, attentive, caring.  The room was gorgeous...we had one of the front rooms in the 17th Century part of the hotel. The view of the lagoon, watching the hustle and bustle of the water bus and gondolas and seeing the fantastic buildings each day was fabulous.  The domestic help maintained the room beautifully. Room service was prompt. Hotel service was excellent and staff were patient and helpful.  This hotel is gorgeous...but no hotel is worth anything if the staff and care is not up to scratch. The team at the Danieli got it just right.  A perfect holiday.
