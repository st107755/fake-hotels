My wife and I were upgraded to a lagoon facing room at check-in for our two night stay. What a pleasant surprise, and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds that we have every slept in. The staff at the Danieli were excellent from check in to check out. It is the perfect hotel from which to explore Venice. Make sure you have drinks in the lobby just to enjoy the ambiance and have the pianist play your wedding song. Simply magical.I would rate it more than a "5" if I could.
