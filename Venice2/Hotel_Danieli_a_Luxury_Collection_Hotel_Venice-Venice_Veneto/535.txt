Short version: you cannot go wrong with this luxurious converted palace (make sure you ask for a renovated room)  Long version: Located just 3 min away from S. Marco, this hotel is right in the heart of Venice. The hotel is right infront of the Zaccaria Water Bus station (about 35-45 min from the airport by water bus). Not only are you located right next to the main attractions, but most tour operators start within 5 min walking distance from the hotel which comes in handy when it's a 8 am tour!   The public areas of the hotel still retain their palatial roots and the lobby is beautiful to sit in. The gem of the hotel is the breakfast/dinner terrace. The morning view will take your breath away as you are perched on the 4th floor over looking the grand canal on misty venetianâ€¦
