This is an old hotel but with modern conveniences including a new wing.  As a James Bond fan, I had to stay here!  We didn't stay in Dr. Goodhead's suite, but we did have a two room suite.  The rooms are very nice, a bit small but I knew what I was getting.  The public spaces of this hotel are magnificent.  As you would expect in a hotel of this caliber, the staff are excellent.  The food was well prepared, but I was looking for more variety on the menus.
