This hotel is not cheap but having stayed at it twice most recently in late April 2013 it is Venice for me. I love the slightly faded decor, the lovely bar with wonderful cocktails and the Terrace restaurant with a wonderful view.It couldn't be more central. I have not found a problem with service. Our bags have always been whisked away to our room or to the water taxi with no fuss, the Concierge staff have always been more than helpful and we have enjoyed two lovely long meals in the evening on the terrace.As we watched the lagoon and the sun come down.  The only reason I haven't given it a five rating is the cost. I would love to stay more otherwise,.
