We were really looking forward to the last night of our holiday staying here but feel let down. The staff are superb, very helpful however the rooms are not in good order, the paintwork is chipped and had finger marks on the doors. also in the main toilets in the hotel were poor and very basic for this standard of hotel. We stayed in another 5 star hotel last year in Venice which outshone the Danieli, sorry but I really feel as though we have wasted our money staying here.
