We decided to stay at the Danieli as we were told by Amex that the much smaller Gritti Palace must be almost full - quoted room rate, €1750 for a standard room, no breakfast. I am so glad we did - 200m from St Mark's Square and all the must see attractions/places of interest is one reason to stay here. The other? This hotel exudes old style 5 star hotel right down to the nightly shoe cleaning service. Unlike the Gritti it's not a place today's movie stars would countenance, yesterdays's, however, would most certainly love the peace and quiet to be found here. This hotel has the added benefit of being set in one of the most beautiful buildings I've seen in Venice (and we saw quite a few). The staff are top of their game, polite and with an uncanny ability to be found in all…
