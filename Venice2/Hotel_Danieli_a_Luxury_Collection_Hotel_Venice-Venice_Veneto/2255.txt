I must say that it is the most charming hotel I have ever seen, it is like living in history and elegance. Everything is perfect: rooms, restaurants, common areas and location.   It is worth to have the Danieli experience even if it is for a few days. Beware that when you'll be there you won't feel like visiting Venice but you will be happy staying inside. No worries, all the most special sites in the city are just around the corner.
