Finishing our round the world tour here was worth every penny.   Positives: 1. Beautiful room, we shelled out for a luxury lagoon view room, amazing view! Room was perfect, bed and pillows so soft and comfy. Shutters are electric and with the windows shut you don't hear much noise from outside.  2. The room service food was good.  3. The bar downstairs was good. 4. The location is perfect 5. The Views! Wow!  6. Turn down was good, little pressie left.  7. Great internet which is free 8. Quiet rooms, no noise from other residents and cleaners were quiet.   Negatives: 1. They need more bar staff. 2. Room service was good, but when we asked them to set up on the terrace they didn't really make much of an effort and myself and my wife moved the table. 3. The balcony wasn't cleanedâ€¦
