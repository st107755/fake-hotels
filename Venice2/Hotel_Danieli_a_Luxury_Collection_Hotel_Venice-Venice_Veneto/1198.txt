Our stay in the Danieli was a dream come true. The location is just perfect as it is close to Piazza San Marco. As soon as you enter this hotel it's grandeur is evident. We loved the elegance of the decor, choosing the stairs rather than the elevator to avoid missing the unique detail. We had booked a double deluxe room, but when checking in we were informed we had been upgraded to a suite with a lagoon view.We were amazed at the generosity of this gesture and by how spectacular the suite actually was....pure luxury. The decor throughout the suite was sumptuous yet extremely comfortable. The lagoon view from the terrace was perfect for watching the gondolas go by.  Breakfast was perfect with ample choice of both food and drinks,with stunning views, unfortunately we could not eatâ€¦
