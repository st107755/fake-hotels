My time in Venice was made even better by the stay in Hotel Danieli. It's a beautiful and very elegant hotel with very kind service people and nice, classy rooms. The only thing that went wrong is that we had to wait a long time for our room to be ready after check-in, and it took a long time for our luggage to arrive because if the amount of guests in the Hoyle. The Danieli Terrace restaurant is great, with great food and drinks. The concierge recommends great restaurants and attractions. We really enjoyed our stay, highly recommended!
