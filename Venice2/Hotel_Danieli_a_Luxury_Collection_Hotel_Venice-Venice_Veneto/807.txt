If you want the best, then the Danieli hotel is just that.  The room transformed me back 200 years.  The whole vibe of the hotel put you into the 19th century.  But the best, by far, was opening your curtains and walking out on your balcony, on the Grand Canal.  Hearing the sounds of Venice.  To sit on the balcony and absorb the moment.  Breathtaking!!
