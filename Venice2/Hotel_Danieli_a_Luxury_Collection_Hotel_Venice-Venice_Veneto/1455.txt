We came for afternoon tea and it was the best afternoon tea weâ€™ve ever experienced.  The hotel is outstandingly gorgeous, staff fantastic and the food is top notch.  The Danieli is exactly what Venice is all about, I could not fault a single thing and recommend that everyone should add a visit or stay at the Danieli to their list of things to do before you die.
