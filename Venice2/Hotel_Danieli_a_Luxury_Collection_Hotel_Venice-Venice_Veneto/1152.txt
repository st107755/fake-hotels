We went into the Danieli with high expectations. The building is indeed truly majestuous, inside and outside, and it is well located. But this is a property living fully on its legacy. The rooms are totally worn-out, the carpeting is smelly and the air-conditioning noisy. The restaurant terrasse is spectacular, but the food just average. Finally the service is stuffy and slow. Next time we'll go to the Gritti.
