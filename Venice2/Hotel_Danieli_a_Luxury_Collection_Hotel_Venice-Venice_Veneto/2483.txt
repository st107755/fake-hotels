The Danieli is probably the best hotel in Venice but it is horribly overpriced (over $1000 euro a night for a reasonably large room (not even a suite) with a grand canal view).  The service is less than impeccable and the concierge desk seems to recommend pretty crappy places (stay away from the Carpaccio, its a well dressed hole in the wall with mediocre food and even worse service).    Their transfer service to the airport is the best money you'll spend in Italy.  I understand that king size bed in Italy generally means 2 twins crammed together but I expected different at the Danieli and i was disappointed.  I am not sorry I stayed at the Danieli, it probably is the best hotel in Venice but next time i am in Venice I will have a better idea of which hotels are better valueâ€¦
