This review is a little late. We stayed at the hotel from September 1 to 4. We were assigned a wonderful room overlooking the lagoon with a wonderful view. The room was in the renovated wing.  I strongly recommend breakfast on the terrace. The view is outstanding and quality of food excellent.  The staff and service was excellent.   The location is right beside St. Mark's Square.  We will definitely return and want to thank hotel and staff for a wonderful say.
