I was amazed by the interior design, beautiful lobby, location is very good, i had a nice breakfast at the top floor restaurant, would be perfect in summer time to seat on the terrace. It was a little dispointing that I had to wait more than 10 mins in the early morning to check out because they could not find the receptionist.
