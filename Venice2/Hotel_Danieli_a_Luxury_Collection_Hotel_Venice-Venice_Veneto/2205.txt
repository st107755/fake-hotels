The view from the restaurant on the roof is just marvellous. It's probably the best view in the world - overlooking the Canal Grande. The hotel is situated just around the corner from the San Marco square. The interior of the building is fantastic, and it is decorated with beautiful pieces of art spanning several centuries. If you can afford to stay at the Danieli, just go there. If you think it's too much to pay more than 600 euros for a night, I would recommend that you at lesat treat yourself to a breakfast or lunch at the terrace restaurant. It's also expensive, but it's good value for money.
