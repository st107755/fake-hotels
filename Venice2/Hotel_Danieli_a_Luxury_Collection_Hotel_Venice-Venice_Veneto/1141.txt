My wife and I finally decided to stay at the Danieli    It did not disappoint. Everything was as expected from a top hotel.  The accommodation, the service, the bar, all very stylish and Venetian.  Highlight is the roof terrace restaurant, wether breakfast, tea or dinner it is a fantastic experience.  We will be back.
