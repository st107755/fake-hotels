My husband took me to Hotel Danieli for my 40th birthday three years ago and it was truly a memorable experience.   I have stayed in some beautiful hotels around the world but this surpassed them all.   We went to Venice again last weekend and stayed elsewhere as the Danieli was full, but we booked dinner on the Terrace.  Again, it was a wonderful experience, the food was delicious, the staff were friendly and engaging, the views "out of this world", the piano player played our favourite tune on request !     I'm not surprised that Hotel Danieli is voted the 3rd best hotel in the world, I think it deserves this title.  I'm astounded at the negative comments on this site !   In my opinion they are not true.
