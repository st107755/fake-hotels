I stayed in a suite at the Danieli- my first visit- for barely 12 hours during a whirlwind business trip, so I don't claim to have given the place a proper 'test drive'. I usually stay at The Cipriani but the Danieli was closer this time.  First impressions: location is good, on the Grand Canal, but I suspect will get busy in summer. I arrived late (midnight) and there was nobody there initially to help with luggage. The guest room corridors felt rather antiquated- rather than classic- and the suite had a tiny shower and single wash basin. The windows didn't open more than a couple of inches- not sure why. Decor was very chintzy, as if last done in the 1980s.  So nothing really negative, and the public areas are beautiful, but I'll probably try somewhere else next time, orâ€¦
