We are a family of three... As soon as we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite (booked through Amex fine hotels). Amazing views of the grand canal... Great location. Everything is within walking distance. The rooftop breakfast was spectacular. However, we didn't love the lunch at the restaurant. Views were great, presentation was amazing but did quite meet the mark in taste, unfortunately. The hotel staff was great, very friendly especially with our young daughter. I personally loved the history that the hotel had to offer (it's SO charming and not outdated at all) but I can understand if that's not everyone's cup of tea.
