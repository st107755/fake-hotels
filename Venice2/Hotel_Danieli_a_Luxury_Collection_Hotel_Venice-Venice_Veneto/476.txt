From the moment you stepped into the hotel lobby, you will be stunned speechless from every piece of marble and every piece of furniture to the extravagant chandeliers WOW is the only word I'm managed to utter. The journey to the suite, never less is an unforgettable experience, with the luxurious carpet, wall papers and their antiques.  Suite is wonderfully designed, clean and large bathroom.  This hotel has 2 wings. Ask to stay at their classic wing  The hotel looks exactly like the picture.  And, another thing is loved their room key. You need to stay here to get what I meant.  Money is definitely well spent :-)
