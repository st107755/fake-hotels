We recently stayed at the Danieli for 3 days and had a great time, I don't really have anything bad to say about the Hotel but I do think the 5stars are a bit of poetic license just because of the history of the Hotel. The room was nice, the bed was exceptional but the bathroom lacked a bit of 5 star treatment as did the dressing room, a lot of the fittings and furniture in these two rooms were very warn/used and could do with replacing. While I appreciate everything is in the venetian style and taste that doesn't really stop a 5 star hotel updating the bathrooms now and again! It seems like there are a lot of tourists, mainly Chinese coming into the hotel lobby to just take pictures, while I really don't have a problem with this, I do have a problem with then having to queue upâ€¦
