We only stayed in Venice for one night of our two week honeymoon. This hotel was by far one of our favorites mainly due to the historical factor (and location of course). Staff was extremely friendly and the hotel itself is picturesque! Perfect for our one night stay! PS I wouldn't recommend the restaurant on terrace for dinner. Extremely expensive for what it is plus they charge you a cover charge of $16 Euro per person even if you're a guest of the hotel. It's free for breakfast so highly recommend going for breakfast.
