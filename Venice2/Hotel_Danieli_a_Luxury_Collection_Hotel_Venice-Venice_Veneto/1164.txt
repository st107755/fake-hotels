We recently stayed at the Danieli in Venice.  We enjoy five star hotels and assumed that was what we were getting when we booked here.  On a positive note -the room we were given was beautiful, facing the water with two large windows.  On a negative note - (1) in order to get to our room we had to climb a steep flight of stairs and follow a maze like configuration.  Took a few days to get used to.  Not good for anyone who can't climb the stairs.  If there is another way around the stairs no on told us.  (2) Concierge service was rude, misleading and unreliable.  When we contacted the concierge from the states we did not receive responses for days and they neglected to do what they  promised.  In person the concierge service was even worse.  I will give credit to the hotelâ€¦
