I was together with my wife on this fancy hotel...maybe it is luxury  and stylish for  Venice taste..for mine not..it it just OLD with very small rooms,old, ugly (maybe because of this old style). The restaurant for breakfast it is in the top of the hotel with a very nice view...the location of the hotel also is very good also.
