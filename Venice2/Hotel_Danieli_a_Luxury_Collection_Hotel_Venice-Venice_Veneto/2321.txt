We stayed at the hotel Danieli for 3 nights in September '09. Here's a brief summary of our stay:  - As we somewhere expected, there was a lot of people. We however didn't expect the amount that there was and didn't expect it to be pretty much all day & night. - Hotel does NOT have an iron for you to use in your room. If you want to have your clothes ironed it will be very pricey. - Room had a great view of the water. With the window closed we hardly heard any of the noise from outside. - Room was very small (a little smaller than expected) and bathroom was even smaller....even though everything was so small we made it work. - In room internet was only wired but was pretty reasonably priced.  If I were to stay in Venice again I don't think I'd stay at the Danieli. It was a niceâ€¦
