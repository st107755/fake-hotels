unfortunately when we visited the lifts were being refurbished and a bit of a trek to get to breakfast , but absolutely worth it.  the views were priceless and the buffet breakfast excellent value for money.  However , dinner in the same area although excellent a tad overpriced ! Definitely worth staying for a special treat .
