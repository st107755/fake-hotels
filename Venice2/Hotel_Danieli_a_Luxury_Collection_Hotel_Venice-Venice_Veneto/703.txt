Outstanding hotel that is ideally located when visiting Venice for a short break, as it's only a short walk from the hotel to the bridge of sighs and Piazza San Marco. As you would expect from a hotel of this quality the rooms are spotlessly clean and the staff were outstanding, from the time we arrived to the time we left, nothing was too much trouble. We were fortunate enough to have good weather and enjoyed breakfasts on the roof terrace, the views over the lagoon are stunning. The selection of food from the buffet was perfect catering for all tastes. We will definitely be staying again.
