Fantastic! Good value compared to London prices at the likes of The Savoy or Claridges. Amazing cocktails! Service very relaxed. Not at all rushed and left in peace to savour the super luxe interior. A great place to bolt if it starts to rain and you don't have a brolly... Don't buy a brolly... Buy a cocktail and an experience instead!
