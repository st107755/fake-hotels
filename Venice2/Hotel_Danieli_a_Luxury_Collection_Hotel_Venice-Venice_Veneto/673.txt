What a wonderful place to stay in Venice.  Central and iconic.  During our stay the main grand lobby area had some renovation works underway, I would assume the lovely reception would feel even more grand.  That said as it was we would stay again.  The place leaks history and feels very grand.  We are glad we stayed here.  We had a standard room booked and were upgraded which was lovely we had a view over the front - fantastic, the only downside being in April the AC is not available so when warm sunshine heats the room the windows are left open, which meant the noise came into the room especially at 4.30 am when the boats start mooring and delivery on the main front.  We did not eat here, so cannot comment, the piano bar in the main area had ambience and was a nice place to endâ€¦
