This hotel has the most spectacular entryway I've ever seen.  Just beautiful with 4-5 stories of marble pillars, hanging plants, stairways/walkways, and warm lighting.  Our room was wonderfully appointed and well located on the 4th floor just down from the restaurant.  The staff was outstanding.  We ate at both restaurants and were not disappointed.  Breakfast out on the terrace overlooking the waterway was magical as was our 4-course candlelight dinner one evening.  The lounge was delightful and we particularly enjoyed the music.  All in all, this is a great hotel in a wonderful location.
