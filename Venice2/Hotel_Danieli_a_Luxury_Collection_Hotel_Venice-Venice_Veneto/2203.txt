I'm just back from a week stay at the glorious Danieli. This was my third stay here. There cannot be a better location in all of Venice, just a few steps from the Piazzi San Marco. We stayed in a luxury room in their newest building, the Excelsior. The rooms were handsomely decorated but on the small side. The air conditioning was excellent and my room was very quiet. The bed was heavenly, the most comfortable one I have had in a hotel in a  long time. The rooftop restaurant has one of the greatest views in the world, but the price for eating breakfast here is very steep.(it wasn't included in my room rate).Staff were friendly and helpful, particularly the concierges. I will definitely stay here again. I have also stayed at the Gritti. If you are looking for a Grand Canal view â€¦
