Very well located hotel facing the lagoon and just a couple minutes walk from San-Marco. The hotel's lobby is very impressive, a real Palazzo. Rooms are very spacious (we stayed in Lagoon view room), but quite worn out, despite in good conditions. Would highly recommend to have a breakfast on the roof terrace with fantastic lagoon view, breakfast itself is very expensive and poor in terms of buffet selection, coffee is horrible, but view is really impressive. Do not even think of ordering anything in the hotel lobby bar, one smallest bottle of diet coke would cost you 8 EUR. Good concierge, who helped always with many topics.
