Walking into the Danieli is quite something. It is absolutely beautiful with wonderful furniture,  paintings and ceilings. This is a really old school, classy establishment. Whisked up to the top floor we were greeted by the most incredible view of the lagoon. Really quite incredible. The staff are wonderful. Very attentive and perfectionists. A real treat. Loved it so much.
