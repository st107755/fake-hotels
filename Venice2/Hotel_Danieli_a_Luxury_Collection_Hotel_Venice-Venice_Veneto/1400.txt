This is a great location - on the waterfront and next to the Doge's Palace! We found all the hotel staff courteous, friendly and efficient. Our room (in the Casanova building) was enormous and well furnished and we had a side view of the lagoon. The roof top terrace, where we took breakfast, is a great asset - a wonderful place to start the day particularly when the weather is warm and sunny as it was for us! We were slightly concerned having read some negative reviews on Trip Advisor but we could find no fault! We had a wonderful experience and would recommend Hotel Danieli!!
