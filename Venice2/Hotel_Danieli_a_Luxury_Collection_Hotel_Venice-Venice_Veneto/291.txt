We began two weeks in Italy by spending five days in Venice, staying at the Hotel Danieli. This gorgeous, historic, luxurious hotel was a great way to start our adventures in Italy. Our room was very well appointed, and we love the Heavenly Bed! The concierge offered great recommendations for restaurants and getting around the city. Additionally one of the water bus stops is steps away from the hotel, so we became experts in using the two-day passes to get around. Thank you for a great vacation and for such great service to all at the Hotel Danieli!
