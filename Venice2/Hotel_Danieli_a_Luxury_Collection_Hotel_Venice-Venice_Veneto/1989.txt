We stayed at the Hotel Danieli as part of our honeymoon tour of Italy. The hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed at. Best location 2 minutes walk from the San Marco square where you will find the Basilica, the clock tower and best cafes and shopping. The lobby was superbly decorated and has a live pianist in the evening, it is lovely to have a drink there before going out for dinner. The rooms were beautiful and cosy. Best part of the stay was the hotel breakfast on the terrace which gives you an amazing view of Venice. Will definitely stay there if we go back to Venice!
