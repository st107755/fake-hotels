Our 2nd visit to Venice after 20 years.  We took a private water taxi from Marco Polo Airport to the hotel, it stopped right at the side entrance, very convenient.  The hotel was really grand and very elegant.  The lady staff at reception was kind and friendly.  After learning that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, she immediately arranged for a bottle of wine and biscuits to be sent to our room, thank you!  Our room with lagoon view was elaborately decorated and furnished in Venetian style.   The room was very spacious and comfortable, and we slept very well in it.  I enjoyed standing by the shuttered windows and look out onto the hustle bustle downstairs.  The hotel is very conveniently located.  Didn’t have too much interaction with Concierge but they were polite…
