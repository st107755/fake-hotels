I'm a longtime Platinum Starwood member, and booked our stay at the Danieli through the Starwood site online.  I had read some less than glowing reviews of the hotel in this and other forums, but felt that the location alone would make it our best choice, and we weren't disappointed.  This is a truly grand hotel, but of a more intimate scale than its website photos would suggest.  Again, I had booked online with points, and never spoke with anyone over the phone prior to our arrival, yet we were given one of the premier rooms in the hotel, overlooking the lagoon. We had a wonderful (though small) balcony, for standing outside and not sitting, with a full 180 degree view.  Gondolas, water taxis, vaporetta, and cruise ships all cruised slowly by, with pedestrians ambling alongâ€¦
