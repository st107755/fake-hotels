One of the most invaluable memory in Venice is the rooftop breakfast at this hotel.  Breath breaking view of the Grand Chanel.  Service is excellent, food quality is top grade.  Although a bit pricey, it is worth for your stay.  The hotel renovation is classical Venetian that you need to learn and appreciate the difference from the model world.
