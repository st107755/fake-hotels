Hotel Danieli deserves its reputation as the top hotel in Venice. It is especially suitable for those who enjoy an elegant and prestigious ambience and who appreciate culture, history and antique furnitures and fittings.   The hotel is in a great location, right next to St. Markâ€™s Square and opposite the piers. It cannot be more convenient as it even has its own private landing for boats.  The roof-top Restaurant Terrazza Danieli offers excellent Italian cuisine, good service and a fantastic view of Venice. Dining there is a memorable experience.  The Danieli is no doubt one of the best hotels in the world and is strongly recommended to anyone who wants the best in Venice.
