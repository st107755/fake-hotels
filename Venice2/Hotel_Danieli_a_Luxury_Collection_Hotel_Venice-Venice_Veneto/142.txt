And you get Marriott points since they now own it. The view from the restaurant terrace is spectacular and a great place for photos as well. The rooms are fairly spacious although Iâ€™m sure it varies a bit by room. The check in process is a bit cumbersome and the staff can be a bit stuffy but overall accommodating.
