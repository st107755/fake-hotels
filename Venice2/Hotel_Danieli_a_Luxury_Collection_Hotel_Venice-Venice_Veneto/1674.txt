I had a mix feeling before I started my travel to this hotel as part of our 2 weeks traveling in Italy and Austria. As other mentioned, this is an expensive hotel picked by my wife and I am the one to pay for as we watched several movies taken in this hotel and she expected that we will have a romantic experience as the actors. The fact was not too far from our expectation as the hotel is really romantic especially during the New Year's eve where all people were having dinner at the roof top and watched beautiful fire works performed from a  boat in the water front of the hotel. Service is excellent although the  staff are quite busy with tourist came from all over the world. They made our expectation as long as you use your romantic imaginery point of view and it last a longâ€¦
