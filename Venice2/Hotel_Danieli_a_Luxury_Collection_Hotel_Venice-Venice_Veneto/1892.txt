We went to the Danieli for an early evening cocktail to soak up the ambience of this grand hotel which has won awards for their bar.    Reception Staff were very welcoming, drinks were nice and nibbles provided were lovely.  The lounge/bar area is classic, with stunning Murano glass chandeliers.  Service could have been slightly ‘warmer’ and I did visit the ladies bathrooms and was surprised to find they were quite faded in grandeur!
