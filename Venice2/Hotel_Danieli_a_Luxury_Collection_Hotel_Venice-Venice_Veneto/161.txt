We stayed at the Hotel Danieli on a trip to Venice to celebrate our 50th anniversary. I had made a reservation for our anniversary dinner at Terrazza Danieli, asking for a nice table as it was a special event. When we arrived at the restaurant (on time), it took three tries to eventually find a table, not exceptional but acceptable. By then we were no longer in a celebration mood, just ended up having a light meal with no dessert and decided we would delay the celebration on our First Class flight back on BA. The restaurant was clearly not understaffed but no one really took ownership. As we did not feel welcome or expected, it is possible that the reservation was simply missed in spite of a confirmation received. Bearing in mind that a 50th anniversary dinner only happens onceâ€¦
