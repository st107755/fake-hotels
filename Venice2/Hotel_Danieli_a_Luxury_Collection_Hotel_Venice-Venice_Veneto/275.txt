This hotel has gone done over the years.  We stayed here 12 years ago and it slowly showing its age. We had a suite, very comfortable  but also very expensive, even for Venice. The location on the grand canal makes it great.  Well ty the Gritti Palace next time, has been a while since we were there,.
