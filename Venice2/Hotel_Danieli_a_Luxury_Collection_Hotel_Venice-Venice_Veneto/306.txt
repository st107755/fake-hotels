Booked in yesterday (Monday) after our sensational stay at the Gritti Palace last year. however from the initial greeting we received from the aggressive Black Security Staff in the hotel lobby on arrival, we decided to try and cancel our room and on asking to see the Concierge about his attitude, he decided he could speak little or no English and just wondered off mid sentence. I went to find the Concierge and my wife went to the front desk to cancel our room; which at least was not a major problem and they were very pleasant and professional. I noted from other write-ups on Trip Advisor that there have been many thefts of purses and wallets at this hotel which is possibly why there is such an over the top security presence. However, this individual needs SERIOUS retraining inâ€¦
