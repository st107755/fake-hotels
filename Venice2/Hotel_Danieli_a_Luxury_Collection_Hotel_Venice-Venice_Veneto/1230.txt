if you are planning to have the ultimate hotel in venice then danieli hotel is the choice , its and amazing old building that was designed in a luxury way , old but very well maintained  with best location in venice , 5 min walk to san marco  i booked the sea view room , expensive yes but totally worth it .  with 3 big windows with a beautiful view of the sea ! .   - i loved the staff of the hotel as i arrived early , at around 10 A.m. and the check-in time is 3 P.m. , but they gave me the room right away without any waiting !   - The breakfast is not recommended ad nothing special about it except the view , and it's very expensive !   - Highly Highly Recommended hotel in venice .
