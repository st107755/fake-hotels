This is a beautiful hotel in the best location in Venice.  Very very expensive.  I paid 580 euro per night for two nights.  The room is newly renovated.  Doesn't have much of a view.  My biggest compliant is check in time is 3pm - it really is!!  You have to wait till 3pm literally.  How annoying.  Even after telling them i woke up at 4am and would love to take a nap at 2pm, they made me wait for another hour.  I have never really experienced that in a five star hotel.
