We spent some time in Switzerland and continued by train to Venice!  We spent 3 day at this gorgeous hotel.  The water taxi dropped us at the door and we were greeted right away.  Our room was amazing.  The view wasn't great but it didn't matter.  Loved the location as everything was an easy walk....beautiful walk!!
