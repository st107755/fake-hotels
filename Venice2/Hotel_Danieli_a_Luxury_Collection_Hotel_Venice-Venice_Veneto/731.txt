I stayed there for a romantic 4 day 3 night trip. I booked online and spent a special request to the hotel. The entire trip went flawlessly. The hotel, while not cheap, is truly a luxury hotel and you get exactly what you pay for. The staff was first class and extremely helpful, the decor is something out of a Disney castle and worth a visit even if you aren't staying at the hotel, and the location cannot be beat. Minutes outside of St. Mark's square the nights were quiet but during the days you start out exactly where you want to be. I ate at the Restaurant Terrazza Danieli which, like most things in Venice, wasn't cheap, but was worthwhile and incredibly romantic. Overall, this is a place that thinks itself a luxury destination and most definitely is a luxury hotel through andâ€¦
