Spent three nights here before boarding a ship and an Adriatic cruise. Love the location - very close to St. Mark's and all the happenings in the heart of Venice.  The public areas are wonderful - especially the Terraza Restaurant on the top floor. Had Sunday brunch there as breakfast each morning. The views are supurb. The front desk and concierge staff were both great. Friendly and very helpful.  My only disappointment is with the room. The rooms are large and well appointed, but they are nothing special. My one window overlooked a building three feet away, and the window only opened a tiny bit. The bathroom was nice - except the shower which was very cramped.  I understand that lots of rooms in Venice lack views - but I sure missed it.
