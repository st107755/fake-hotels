FIRST CLASS, After being in a small boutique hotel in Rome I changed my hotel (two days before)to the Danieli and I am so happy I did. Always 4-5 men working at the Concierge desk, great recommendations, treat you like a queen. Lively busy  lobby, They order you a private water taxi to the airport to pick you up by the door, you don't need to book ahead as you are next to the busy area. Great walking distance to the square  We didn't feel like spending an hour for breakfast and 45 dollars PP so the bartender in the lobby brought us Cappacino one morning with a plate of biscuits and cookies. Beautiful decor, maybe a little DARK but it was a wow when you walked in.    Rooms big and clean, even had a dressing area. I didn't think I would  like the carpeting as I wasn't used to itâ€¦
