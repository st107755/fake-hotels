It is truly an amazing location nearly next door to San Marco.   We were fortunate to get a room in front overlooking the water.    Spectacular view.      The room decor seems a bit dated and stale.   Bathroom was nice. I don't think the front staff, where you drop off and pick up your room key each time you come and go, were the most friendly.   Reception during checkin was great.
