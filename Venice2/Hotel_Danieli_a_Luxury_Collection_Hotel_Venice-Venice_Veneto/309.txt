The hotel very nice i stayed one night so i didnâ€™t experience everything, but its so busy , but they should offer free transportation from and to the hotel.the price they are offering is very expensive comparing to their rate, but the location is perfect although venice is so charming city, in every thing, the two islands morano and borano specially borano  so peaceful and nice community, .
