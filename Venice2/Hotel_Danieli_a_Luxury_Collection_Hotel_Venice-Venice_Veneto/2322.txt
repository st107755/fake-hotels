i stayed in the Danielis for around a week for me the hotel was a BIT overrated if you are used to modern hotels with the arge bathrooms big plasma screens in the room i dnt think its ur hotel the hotel is perfect because you cant find any other hotel with a better location , if you been to venice you will know why you need the location , traveling in venice is not that easy and the hotel is in the centre so no need to use the boats to travel if you were in that part of the city i think the location made it up for the other things .
