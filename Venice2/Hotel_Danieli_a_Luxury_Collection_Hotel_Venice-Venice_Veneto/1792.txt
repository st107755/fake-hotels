This was our second trip to Venice- we came back to the Danieli and got EXACTLY the same room (on purpose.... balcony grand canal view!) It was worth it (and oddly cheaper this year).  Two things you should know:   1) the room service/restaurant prices are OUTRAGEOUS (and I live in NYC...). Instead, go to one of the cafes around the corner from the hotel (when you come out the front door take a hard right and 1/2 way down that alley on your right hand side is a great sandwich shop.  Further down, make a left and it opens up to a mini-plaza.  There are some good restaurants in that courtyard that actually stay open late! (a rarity in Venice)  2) DON"T give them your postcards.  We travelled to 7 cities and 4 countries in June and ONLY the postcards I left with the Danieliâ€¦
