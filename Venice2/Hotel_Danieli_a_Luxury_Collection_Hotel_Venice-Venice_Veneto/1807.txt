This is a fantastic hotel but be ware of the rooms. We had à view of the lagoon which was amazing. The room was small but lovely. Location is absolutely  perfect. It is worth paying up to get the view but i would not pay the lesser price for the rooms without the view. Then I would just come for breakfast at the terrace which is à great experience and worth the 39 eur pp.
