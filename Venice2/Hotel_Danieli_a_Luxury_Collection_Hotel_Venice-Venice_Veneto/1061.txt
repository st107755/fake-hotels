You are right in the thick of it staying at this hotel but as soon as you enter the foyer you are in a serene space!  Beware if you ask for a lagoon room - as we did - the views are amazing but you will have a lot of noise from outside at night.  Of course this is to be somewhat expected when you are staying in Venice right next to St Marks Square and the Vaporetto (water buses) jetty.  It is a shame that there is a large ramp right outside the hotel for the bridge - this makes the most noise at night with people dragging heavy suitcases or simply running on it.  Apart from those niggles - the breakfast terrace is breathtaking with views to die for.  The breakfast buffet was superb.  Friendly attentive service throughout - although we did receive some bad advice for dinner oneâ€¦
