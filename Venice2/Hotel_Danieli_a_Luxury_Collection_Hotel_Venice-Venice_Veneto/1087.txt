Perfect location for picking upriver buses and gondolas. Hotel staff extremely helpful and all speak good English. Was upgraded on check in to a stunning Venetian room. Beds with Egyptian cotton sheets the most comfortable we've slept in!  Only complaint is it was very noisy in the room above at night, sounded like maintenance work rather than noisy guests!
