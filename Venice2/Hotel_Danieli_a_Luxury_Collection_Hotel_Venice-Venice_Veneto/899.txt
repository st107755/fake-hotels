Just an awesome place.  My daughter (who was with me) used to work for the Four Seasons chain and she believes the Danieli is in that class.  I was able (by using a 3rd party site and going with non-refundable) to get us a room for only a little over $400 a night, which you would never get with Four Seasons!  The Danieli is a historic building with a sumptuous, gorgeous lobby.  I knew our room would be one of the smaller ones but was pleasantly surprised that it was bigger than I expected.  The bathroom was very large by European standards and fully equipped and modern.  The staff were all very helpful when we needed anything.  We enjoyed the lobby bar, which provided nice little munchies whenever I got a drink.  We didn’t eat at the hotel (WAY too expensive for me) so I can’t…
