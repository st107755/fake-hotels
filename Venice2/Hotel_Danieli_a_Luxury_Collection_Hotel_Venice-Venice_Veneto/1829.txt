We are currently enjoying our third night at the Danieli, and it has truly been a pleasure. The building, lobby, rooms, all stunning and the location is fantastic. Some other reviewers wanted modern, we don't. We are in an ancient city with an incredible history and this hotel helps you feel closer to that. The rooftop restaurant has the most amazing view of Venice and the canal, and on a sunny morning I cannot imagine a more perfect spot for breakfast. Only one area where improvement can be made from our experience: we arrived to check in and there was nobody behind the check-in counter and six of us waiting. We finally were helped after about 20 minutes. Unacceptable for the premium price, especially when I saw at least four staff doing nothing behind the concierge desk.
