This hotel is beautiful. It's located right on the Grand Canal. The rooms are fantastic. The service is top notch. Venice is without a doubt the MOST romantic city in the entire world. Danieli is the best hotel in Venice. I have stayed in others and this is the best. They make movies here for a reason. If you are in love or want to be, this is the place to stay.
