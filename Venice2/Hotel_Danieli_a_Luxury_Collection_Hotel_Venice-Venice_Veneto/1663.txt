This hotel is ranked as one of the top places to stay in Venice. The choice was Cipriani or Danieli and i went for the latter due to its central location. i chose a lagoon view room, which offered lovely views. However, late night  noise at circa 3 am etc was a problem. if you value your sleep i would head to a back room or a quieter location. Breakfast was inclusive but was average - fruit was fine as was the coffee, but pastries and hot offerings could have been better.   Staff were pleasant enough but reception was undermanned at key times. Prices in the hotel are on the very high side. i guess you would expect that....but frankly if you are going to pay 25 dollars for a glass of white wine there are better spots to enjoy your libation.   The hotel is very old (700 years) soâ€¦
