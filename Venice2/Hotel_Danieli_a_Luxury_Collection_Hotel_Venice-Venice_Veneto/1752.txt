My husband and I spent 5 nights at Hotel Danieli.  This hotel is amazing!  We used Starwood points (hence the 5 stars on value) and were given an amazing upgrade!  The room was filled with beautiful antique furniture, a custom perhaps vintage, chandelier and the walls were covered in the same tapestry an the drapes!  The wooden shutters opened to a wonderful view of the canal!!!!  It was opulence at its best!  Old world too...they don't use electronic keys, instead it is a large key ring that is left at the front desk every time you leave.  A bit of a pain and cool at the same time.  We loved this hotel and look forward to returning someday!
