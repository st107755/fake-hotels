My partner and I have just returned from three nights at the Danieli Hotel, and though I rarely write reviews, I feel compelled to recount the good and the bad... The Good: Utterly perfect location, almost bang next door to Piazza San Marco. Unsurpassed history. Beautiful internal architecture. Nice room with balcony view. FAB towels in bathroom. Glass or two of rose on the 4th floor terrace, on a blue-sky day, overlooking the incredible view is superb.  The Bad: Toilet in bathroom took way too long to fill up. Bathroom had no ventilation. Though free in the lounge, WIFI is 15 euros per day in your room. WHY?? I guess if you're an oligarch, it's small vodka, but I think this is cynical, unnecessary, ungenerous, and casts a pall over one's stay, given general prices. Dinner inâ€¦
