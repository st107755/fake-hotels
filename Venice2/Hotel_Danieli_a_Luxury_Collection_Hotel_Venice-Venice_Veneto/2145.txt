This is our second time at the Hotel Danieli. Overall it is a spectacular hotel, having been a palace with original construction in 1400. Of all the hotels in Venice, it gives the distinctive Venetian old-world feel. During both stays we were given rooms with balconies. There are a limited number of rooms with views on the water. We had a partial view during our last stay and a view of the tops of local buildings in the previous stay, both of which were fine. The balconies are constructed in such a way to afford privacy and are quite nice.There is sufficient dresser and closet space, the rooms are decorated in a sumptuous fashion and the bathrooms are spacious with plenty of amenities. Some decorations are slightly faded or worn, but this adds to the antique feel which is farâ€¦
