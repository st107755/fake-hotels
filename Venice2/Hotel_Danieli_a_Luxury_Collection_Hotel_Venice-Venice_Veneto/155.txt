Prior to actually staying at this hotel, like all of you, I read the reviews.  I was surprised at some of the really negative reviews.  Sometimes, people have expectations that seem unrealistic.  It is a hotel.  It is not perfection.  This is one of the top three hotels in Venice.  The Gritti Palace is nicer.  No question.  However, their location is not as good.  The Danieli has a PERFECT location.  I stayed at the hotel on points.  Even with my gold status, I didn't get an upgrade at the hotel was completely sold out during our stay there.  I paid 60,000 per night points before they raised it to 85,000 per night.  That is a hefty price for their smallest room.  Our room was lovely.  Well appointed.  No water view but we faced in inside courtyard which made the room very quiet.â€¦
