Spent one night at the Hotel prior to Mediterranean cruise that started in Venice.  The hotel was beautiful in the traditional Venetian sense and one could not ask for more in terms of location.  My husband and I spent the night experiencing the magic of Venice strolling around San Marco square , shopping and relaxing.  The staff was courteous and accommodating.  The room lovely.  We were just sad that we were only able to spend the one night!
