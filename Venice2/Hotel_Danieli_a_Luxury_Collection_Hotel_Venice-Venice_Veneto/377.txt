Stayed in the Danieli for 3 nights celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We booked a suite with views over the Adriatic which was stunning. Very beautiful rooms with beautiful decor. The hotel itself is full of history and character with some of the best architecture  I’ve ever seen in any hotel. The staff were tops  in every way from the room staff to the reception and the concierge couldn’t do enough for us. Breakfast was served in the roof top terrace which had the most beautiful view over Venice, the best view you could possibly have. Very expensive but worth it. Would definitely go back.
