Save your money!!!   They don't know what VIP service means though they certainty charge for it!!   We paid for a private transfer from airport to the hotel and booked through hotel for 249.00€ which when we got to the docks we were told how busy this time is and our boat may not be able to take us!  Then our nice taxi driver was persistent and begged the water taxi guy to put us in line.    We waited over 30 additional minutes which was not in of itself bad, if they would have made you comfortable that we were getting there.     We arrived after 1:00pm  scheduled to arrive at noon....and our "VIP Luxury room with noon check in was not ready" but they said one hour and asked we dine upstairs while we wait.   The views were amazing and the risotto was good.    Again, you will pay…
