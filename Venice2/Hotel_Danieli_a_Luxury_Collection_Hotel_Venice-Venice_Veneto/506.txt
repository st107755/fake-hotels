Just the best! Beautiful hotel 2 minutes from st. marks square. Breakfast on the balcony overlooking the main canal is s wonderful start to the day,it's worth a visit just to see the reception and lounge bar.  Featured in several films, The Tourist and James Bond. Fantastic staff, if you can afford it don't bother to look elsewhere
