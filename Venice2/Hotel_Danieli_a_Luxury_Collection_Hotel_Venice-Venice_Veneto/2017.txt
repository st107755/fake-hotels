I booked two connecting rooms for 5 days in this hotel with my family. Positives: 1)Location - cant get any better; two mins walk to St Marco Sq, n taxis drive up to the lobby. 2)Lobby decor: historical, ornate, beautiful. 3)Cafe terrace: bf cant get any better overlooking the main canal n view. Negatives: 1)though not falling apart but some parts of the hotel need some serious upgrading. 2)Reception area setup: the hotel has expanded into 3 blocks but its Reception area has remained the same. Reception service therefore is grossly understaff (always a queue of guests) and the Concierge desk nearby is over worked (always a queue of guests waiting to get their room keys). 3) Concierge staff is the most unsmiling staff ever. They provide you the service but no smile, no greetings,â€¦
