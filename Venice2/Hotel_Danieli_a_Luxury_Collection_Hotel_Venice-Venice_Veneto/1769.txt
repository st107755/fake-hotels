I will always remember this lovely hotel in Venice, Italy.  My stay there was the highlight of my vacation.  The lobby of this hotel is stunning and the Murano Glass chandeliers are beautiful.  The room and bathroom were clean and lovely.  The breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was the best food we had in Venice.  The service was superior and the staff was very friendly.  The view of the Grand Canal while we had breakfast every morning was just breathless.  The location was perfect.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone.
