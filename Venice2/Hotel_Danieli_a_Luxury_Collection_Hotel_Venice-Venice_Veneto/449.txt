We splurged on a room with a view of the lagoon with a terrace to see the NYE fireworks. The room did not disappoint, and if the view is a priority for you, this is one of the best in Venice.  We found the service to be excellent. Very attentive wait staff at the lobby bar with good recommendations, and very helpful concierge staff (Marco, as others mention, is a stand-out). The bartenders made the best martinis we had in Italy, but at 20 euro per, we'd expect nothing less(!) The bar dining options were good and more extensive than you might expect, and that was a convenient option for our teenage son who didn't want to sit through multiple courses. One of our best meals in Venice was at the Terrazzo on the top floor (but skip the new "bistro," which was disappointing). â€¦
