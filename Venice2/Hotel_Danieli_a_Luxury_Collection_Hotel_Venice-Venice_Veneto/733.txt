The property is beautiful and is in one of the best locations in Venice, about a 5 min walk to St. Mark's square. The service was excellent and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Our room was upgraded and is larger than the standard room size. We were delighted about the room size and the bathroom (while somewhat small from a US standard) was beautiful. It was lined with marble walls and beautiful fixtures. The hotel has piano player in the main bar in the evenings, which gives it a romantic touch. The main restaurant has lovely views and outdoor seating but very expensive. Also be prepared to pay 110 Euros for a water taxi to/from the airport.
