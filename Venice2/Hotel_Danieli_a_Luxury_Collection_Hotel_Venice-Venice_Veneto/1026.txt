Lovely staff, wonderful surroundings, steeped in history; not to be missed.  Some rooms are small and have no views....if you are in Venice for long mix up your experience, perhaps with some contrasting hotels, Palazzina G, the Lido Excelsior...Tip well, and expect some tired corners.  Wouldn't change it for the world however.  Don't fix what isn't broken...
