I visited the Danieli 30 years ago, and it was one of the great hotels of Italy and southern Europe. Now it is a Marriott, and I guess that tells you all you need to know. It has a great location, it is a beautiful old palace, and the breakfast room/dining room has one of the best views in Venice of San Marco Basin and the entrance to the Grand Canal. But that is not enough to get the Danieli more than two stars. Can you imagine being in a hotel that costs more than 700 Euros a night and being told by the front desk, "I'm sorry your room is much too hot, but we have turned off all air conditioning for the season. Would you like us to give you a fan?" That is outrageous. That is a hotel that is far more concerned with their own convenience and logistics than with customerâ€¦
