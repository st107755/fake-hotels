We arrived early morning after a long flight from the States, and had prebooked a private water taxi from Marco Polo, so we got quickly to the hotel around 10:00 a.m. Fabio (who, by the way, was quite fabulous!) checked us in promptly and escorted us to our waiting room (Suite 92- gorgeous!). We were happily surprised that we had been upgraded to a beautiful corner suite in the original part of the hotel (which we wanted) and iwas extra special since this trip we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary! Our luggage quickly followed.  Bedroom was beautiful, as was our dressing room and bathroom.  Everything clean and working well!  Views of a small side canal that runs right into St. Mark's Basin (the Lagoon) and we could watch the gondolas etc..coming and going...The hotelâ€¦
