Great location for your daily Venice walks.  Our room was well appointed with great service at the smallest check-in desk (needs to be enlarged). We were personally escorted to our room with the person that checked you in.  Most hotels give you a key and direct you to a elevator to find your room by yourself.  Nice touch for a 5 star hotel.  Hotel bar prices make Hawaii drinks look cheap.  I can't see paying over $20 for a mixed drink even though I can afford it.  The top floor dinning had one of the best views in Venice.  The best place to eat breakfast In the outside open air And see Venice come alive.  Get outside early to beat the 10,000 cruise boat people that start showing up around 10:00am.
