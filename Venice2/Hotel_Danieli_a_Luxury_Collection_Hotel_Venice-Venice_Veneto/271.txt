Perfect Location! the hotel was so beautiful inside - so many places to walk around and discover with in the hotels 3 buildings.  Our room was amazing they gave us an upgrade to a suite when we arrived.  We spent a lot of time on our balcony watching people and boats and the sunrise.  Service was great! The food from the restaurant was really good - would definitely stay here again!
