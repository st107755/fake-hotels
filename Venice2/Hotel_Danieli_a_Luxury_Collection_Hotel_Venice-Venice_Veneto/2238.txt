Stayed here for 4 nights in early October. Beautiful room in the 2nd oldest bit of the hotel. Booked the hotel via the price comparison bit on Tripadvisor, and got an excellent deal from otel.com for a premium de luxe room with breakfast. (cost of breakfast would have been €55 each a day).  All staff very helpful, and no problems checking in or out.  Excellent choice of food for breakfast and on a couple of mornings we were able to eat out on the terrace, which has the most stunning views. Didn't eat at the hotel other than breakfast. (You will need deep pockets to drink or dine in the hotel, as everything is very expensive.)  Others have commented on noise but we had no problems.  Our trip was for a very special occasion and a bottle of prosecco and box of chocolates were in…
