Beautiful old hotel steeped in history. We had a very comfortable stay with a large soft bed, great shower and of the course the hotel is in a great location. The rooftop terrace has a fantastic view but be careful, the prices for drinks are very high, even for Venice. The main public areas of the hotel are beautiful. We couldn't fault our stay.
