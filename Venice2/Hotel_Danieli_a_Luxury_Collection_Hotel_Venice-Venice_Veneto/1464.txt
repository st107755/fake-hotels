We stayed here for our anniversary and can't rate it highly enough. It's expensive but it can get away with it. The location is superb. It was like being in an oasis in the middle of the most beautiful city in the world.  The service was impeccable. Our room overlooked the Canal and what a mesmerizing view. We woke up to the sights and sounds of Venice and watched Venice come alive and go to bed. I can't wait to go back.
