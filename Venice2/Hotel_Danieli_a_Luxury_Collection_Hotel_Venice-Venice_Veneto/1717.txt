This hotel is a histirical monument, you can feel as you are in a movie. Historical interiors, high ceilings, woodden stairs. Everything is GREAT! The breakfast is on the top floor. It is better if you get a seat on the terrace with Venice view. A big choice of appetizers and juice on the breakfast. Very comfortable and nice hotel! Can recommend for everybody who is ready to pay the price for such high level hotel.
