This hotel does everything it can to stay a high quality residence. It is full of old world charm, amazingly clean and the staff work incredibly hard to make sure you have an incredible stay...I would recommend trying to stay in the quieter months, as the hotel can be overrun by rude and ill mannered tourists, but there is little the hotel can do to cure this !!
