So I've just read the most ridiculous review that said terrible location if you don't like crowds??? I'd suggest avoid the whole of Venice if you don't like crowds. The Danieli is a most beautiful hotel. A little frayed around the edges but forgivable. We stayed in Room 9 on the front with a small balcony. The view is awesome. The busy-ness is part of its charm! All the staff we encountered could not have been more helpful or professional. We ate breakfast in the fantastically situated terrace restaurant. It was very good with a huge choice including free Prosecco. We didn't do dinner. We drank one night in the bar. Yes, it was expensive but the good things in life usually are. Only small criticism is that some of the sound insulation between rooms is not that brilliant but itâ€¦
