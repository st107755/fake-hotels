We stayed there for the second time this year and had again a great room facing Canale Grande. It is the old splendor and delight that makes this hotel such a treat. Great service and super friendly staff that help with making all special arrangements like having flowers in the room etc. It is my favorite place to stay in in Venice and always a very special treat. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking venice and Canale Grande is sensational.
