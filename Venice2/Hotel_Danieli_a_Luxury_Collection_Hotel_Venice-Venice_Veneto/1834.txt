We stayed at the Danieli for 3 days last week and have to say this hotel is truly magnificent. It is breathtaking when you first arrive and see the golden staircase. We had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal, it had a small balcony where you could stand and take in the views. We were really well looked after from the reception, Concierge and maid service all done with a smile and very professional. Thank you Danieli for a truly memorable stay.
