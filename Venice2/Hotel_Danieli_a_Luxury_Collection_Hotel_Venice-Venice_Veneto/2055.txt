First of all - the concierge desk was outstanding and arriving to the entrance by water taxi is really cool! But trapped in the tourist trap of Venice it is not surprise that the staff in general do not manage to show much excitement over yet more tourists at their hotel. Fortunately we had booked through Starwoods and got upgraded and some extra smiles upon check-in, and the rooms we got were outstanding. Quality of the room service food was average for a 5-star,  as was the breakfast, but the breakfast room + terrace at the top is world unique. So all in if in Venice you will be just fine to to stay here, you will be ripped off as in most tourist traps, and I guess the staff and mgmt do the best they can can to not appear as the fat cats they no doubt must be with the pricesâ€¦
