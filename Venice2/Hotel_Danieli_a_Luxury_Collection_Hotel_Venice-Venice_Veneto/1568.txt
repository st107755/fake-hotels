Our first visit to Venice was a magical time with a dream setting, the Hotel Danieli. You feel you are in old Venice but with all the modern advantages. The location is perfect soo close to St Mark Square. If you wake up early you can have breakfast and have the square to yourself, take pictures without a hundred people around. Worth every cent!!!!
