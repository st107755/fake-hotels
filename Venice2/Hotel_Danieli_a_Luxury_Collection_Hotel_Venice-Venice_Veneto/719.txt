During a visit to Europe, we were fortunate to be able to stay in this beautiful hotel. This is definitely not an accommodation for the budget conscious, but is well worth the splurge if you can afford it. From the moment you enter, the premises exude wealth, from the automatic revolving doors and the concierge desk, to the beautiful ornate skylights and designer window displays. Every need is catered for here....at a cost of course.  The rooms are beautiful. The fully stocked bar fridge is filled with treats to tempt you with, or you can order room service from the extensive menu. The marble bathroom invites you to take your time and relax whilst bathing, with plenty of fluffy towels on a heated towel rack. An evening 'turn down' service includes a beautifully boxed chocolateâ€¦
