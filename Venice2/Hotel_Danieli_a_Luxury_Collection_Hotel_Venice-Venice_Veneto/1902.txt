Not sure how some people could have had the "most marvelous experience ever" at this palce, unless perhaps they were paying 1200 euros a night and the staff treated them accordingly - and are being asked to write favorable reveiws by management.   If that's the case, fine, I understand - but believe me when I tell you, this is a terribly run, and run down hotel.   Check-in is horrible - rooms don't get cleaned until 4 pm - few exceptions, so if the place was somehat full the night before, you can guarantee yourself that you won't get inside a room until after 4 pm. Venice is an expensive place - everyone knows, but simple cocktails at the bar are  18 to 22 euros - about $25 to $30 - and the service is lousy - bartender stands therepoliching stemware pretending not to see youâ€¦
