The Danieli is perfectly located for a stay in Venice.  Our room was at the front of the hotel, with a veranda overlooking the water; outstanding.  The bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was well appointed. Breakfast in the terrace was great, with an extensive range. Catch a water taxi from the train station, we did & were thankful as it is a fair way to carry your bag.
