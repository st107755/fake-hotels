We came here for a lunch choosing the tasting menu with the wine accompaniments, whilst having a few days away with friends in Venice. The Danieli was chosen for lunch on their Wedding Anniversary, on a fantastic day, the lunch was also fantastic. The staff were slightly aloof though, in contrast with other hotels and restaurants we dined at. The view out over the lagoon was great, the whole experience was great, including the great bill, however that was expected and we would do it again.
