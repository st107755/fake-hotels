This was my wife's dream break. The hotel delivered against expectations - amazing room right on the edge of the water overlooking water taxi's.  Great late night music and a breakfast terrace with views across the water.  Really great - pricey - but for us a once in a lifetime chance to see the city, enjoy the art, and the food and drink.
