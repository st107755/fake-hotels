This hotel is right in the center of Venice on the canal.  It is a combination of three buildings, palaces from the 16th century.  The rooms are fascinating, very large (our suitcases had their own small room) and comfortable.  There is a lot of variation in the rooms, and they all are a challenge to find.  If you cannot do stairs, you would not be happy here.  The elevators are definitely tiny and old-European.  The breakfast buffet on the balcony is a lovely place to enjoy the canal view.  Staff is deliberate rather than speedy, and they do have computers for printing boarding passes.  There is free wifi for 24 hours, then paid after that.
