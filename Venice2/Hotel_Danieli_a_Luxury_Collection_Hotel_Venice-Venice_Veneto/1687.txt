This is the most lovely hotel in a fantastic location. The public rooms are beautiful, and our bedroom in the old palazzo facing the lagoon was exceptional.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The views from the breakfast room were exceptional, as was the quality of the food. If only we could have stayed longer!
