Please go to the Danieli.  Venice is not the cheapest place in the world we all know that but if you are going to go save the extra money and stay at the Danieli the building is amazing the location could not be better the staff in the public areas are very attentive and respectful the restaurant staff are very professional ( you do pay for that ) but the views from the terrace are unforgettable  Don't worry about your water taxi finding you when it arrives the porters are experts and will find you when it arrives so settle back enjoy your G & T or Bellini served with grace and class by the bar man ( mature grey haired, white dinner jacket and bow tied chap )   If you can't stay here go for a drink - you won't regret it
