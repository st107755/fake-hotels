Hotel Danieli is located adjacent Plaza St Marco and is very "Old World" in decor and atmosphere with matching service.  We recommend the roof top restaurant and terrace on a sunny afternoon overlooking the laguna.  It's everything one imagines when thinking of Venice.  Have a Spritz Aperol and enjoy...!
