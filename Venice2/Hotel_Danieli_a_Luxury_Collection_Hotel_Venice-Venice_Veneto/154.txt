I wish there was a ZERO star option! I thought it was a nice hotel and for the price it shouldâ€™ve been.  However, as we were trying to checkout this morning soap opera was filming at the hotel lobby and staircase that morning.  As were trying to leave the camera crew was telling us rudely to move out of their way and to be quiet.  Like we were an inconvenience.  Might I add that we were trying to checkout and trying to get out of their way, but there was no where to move due to a lineup at the back door.  I feel that it was very disrespectful and rude for the hotel to allow that their guests be treated like that at their site.  Due to this I would NEVER stay here again.
