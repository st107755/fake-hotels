After arriving into Venice on the Orient Express, we didn't think our hotel would match the luxuriousness of the train, but were pleasantly surprised as soon as we entered the lobby. Our room had an amazing view over the Grand Canal and gondolas. We were only a few steps away from all the major sites. Breakfast on the 4th Floor outdoor terrace was the perfect start to each day.
