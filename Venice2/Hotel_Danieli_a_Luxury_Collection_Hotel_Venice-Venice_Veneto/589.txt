We stayed at the Danieli for three days at the end of March this year, and had a fabulous time in our beautiful room directly overlooking the Grand Canal. The hotel is really fabulous, and the staff, especially the concierges and front of house, are probably the best that I've ever experienced in years of personal and business travel. I couldn't recommend the Danieli highly enough, and will certainly return again, hopefully for the carnival one year.
