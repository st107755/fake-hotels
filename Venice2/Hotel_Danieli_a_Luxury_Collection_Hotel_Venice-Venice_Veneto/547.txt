So, when you arrive and check into the Danieli, you know your stepping into a time long gone by of charm, class, elegant, sophistication the way a class hotel should be....fortunately we got lucky and were upgraded to a suite which, honestly, I wanted to stay in for a few years!!! Perfectly located, hard to say anything bad about this hotel. If your looking for modern and all aminities state of the art don't stay here but, if you want to take a slice out of history and feel like you were part of the worldclass famous few who stayed at the Danieli, its a once in a lifetime experience you will treasure forever...but I will say that the air condion was the best ever!!
