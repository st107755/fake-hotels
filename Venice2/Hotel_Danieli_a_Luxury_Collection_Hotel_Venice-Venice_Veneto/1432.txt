I went to Venice with my boyfriend (now fiancé)as we have both always wanted to visit.. It was a surprise trip for me planned by my boyfriend to propose!!!! The hotel Danielle is nothing short of amazing.. It is an expensive hotel but the service and quality of everything is second to none. The hotel is not just a hotel, it is an experience & that's what you pay for. Our room was amazing, a gorgeous lagoon view room with fabulous marble bathroom.. We had dinner in the terrazzo restaurant one evening.. Very expensive but we have never had steak like it!! The breakfasts in the hotel are also fantastic, a great selection and a good stiff cappuccino ... We spent three nights in the Danielle & I truly felt like a princess.. From the moment we arrived in the airport and were whisked…
