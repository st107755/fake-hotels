A beautiful hotel in a fantastic location, right on the Grand Canal and next door to the Doge's palace. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly although the concierge gave us the wrong directions to Murano. Our room was a standard luxury room on the side of the hotel, I was concerned that it would be dark after reading reviews but it was absolutely beautiful and the bed was the most comfortable ever! Breakfast was included in our rate and was a fantastic selection. We were very lucky with the weather to be able to eat on the rooftop terrace, the most amazing views..unbeatable! We also had afternoon snacks and drinks on the terrace in the sun which was wonderful, so lovely to be able to watch all the crowds along the edge of the canal below! It is certainly a luxury hotelâ€¦
