First of all, location is perfect! The hotel has a very old-school luxury style. The breakfast at the terrace is great (very nice view).  Rooms are expensive: after being upgraded twice we found ourselves in a suite that was still relatively small in comparison to what you could expect in any other city for that price.  I don't know what you can have in other hotels of the city for this price, but be ready to stay in a very nice but rather small room if you choose the Danieli.
