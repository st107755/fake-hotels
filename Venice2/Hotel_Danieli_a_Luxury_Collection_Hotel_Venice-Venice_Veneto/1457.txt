We spend a magical two nights at the Hotel Danieli to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and a 60th birthday for my husband. We were treated to warm, friendly service from the moment of our arrival. Special treats left in the room to celebrate both occasions and enjoyed a beautiful quiet, comfortable and superbly situated room overlooking the lagoon. Would definitively recommend it for special occasions and we will certainly return soon! Thank You Hotel Danieli and all the staff for making our stay so special .
