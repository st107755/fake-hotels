Ask for a front facing room with a balcony...it definitely helps if you're a Starwood Gold Member plus you can get a late check out! We loved our room BUT they're small and full of furniture so it's very hard to move around in them but the balcony helps. And the bath products are great. The biggest thing you need to be aware of is the upcharge for everything. Be sure breakfast is included...the continental breakfast is 40 Euros per person. And they won't give you an iron (Italy is very tough on this) so our bill was 80 Euros for a few slacks and shirts (this is no joke). The restaurant is expensive too and while the view is stunning they cheese it up with this woman who sings bad pop songs...it would be better quiet. The front desk staff and male manager were not friendly at allâ€¦
