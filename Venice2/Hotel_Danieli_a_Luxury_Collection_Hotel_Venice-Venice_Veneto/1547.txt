So the tourist w Johnny Depp and Angelina had some shots filmed here, but it was not the main hotel where they filmed the movie. Starwood property so of course its nice, but the lobby could use some updates near the bar area-space is dark and not too inviting...The rooms are old world luxury-we had adjoining rooms, w carrera bathrooms, lovely products and red velvet everything..view to the bridge of sighs and the jail and other rooftops-were stunning-loved it...Breakfast was pricey but great overlooking main waterway. Had excellent service when a female problem snuck up on us and the staff was amazing without embrassing us-Would come back just because of that!! no pool here and the oldness makes going from one building to the other and in and out a bit tedious and round about atâ€¦
