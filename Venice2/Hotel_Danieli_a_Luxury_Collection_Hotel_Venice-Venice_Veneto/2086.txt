I think the hotel building is very old, but it is very clean.  Everything inside the hotel is very clean and arranged well. Every thing including the paintings furniture everything is very old fashioned. But in the hotel every thing take too much time. Don't expect much from the staff.The boat or water bus stops on the entrance of the hotel.  You have to be very careful when you are boarding and embark the boat, the floor will be wet and slippery, if you are aged then very very careful.  The number of staff you will find is less compared to other 5star hotels.  The hotel rooms are very good but I think the lights are not upto the mark.  Over all it is a very good experience.  I like this hotel very much.
