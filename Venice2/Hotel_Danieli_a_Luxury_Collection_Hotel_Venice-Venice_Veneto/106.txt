We returned back to the Danieli to celebrate my wife’s birthday and our 25th anniversary. We got engaged in Venice while staying at the Danieli many years ago. We can’t thank the staff for making our visit so special from the moment we arrived. So many nice touches like a bottle of champagne on arrival, birthday cake sent to our room. Thanks for making this a special trip. We will be back.
