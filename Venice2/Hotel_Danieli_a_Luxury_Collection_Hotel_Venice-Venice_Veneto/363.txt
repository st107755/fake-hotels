Yes this hotel is exceptional. Situated in front of the gran canal, near Dodge palace one of the best place in Venice. Build in 14th century, it need some maintenance: windows of the rooms very old, very difficult to adjusted hot water to get a shower, decoration old style, you are in other time, several centuries behind. Very expensive .
