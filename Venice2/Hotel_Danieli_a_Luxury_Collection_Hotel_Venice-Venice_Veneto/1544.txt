Hotel Danieli  is beautifully  located right in the canal in the few minuets walking distance from the San Marco Plaza. It's a luxury hotel with the well trained friendly and helpful stuff. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is served in the outdoor restaurant with the wide varieties of food. We had stayed in Danieli   couple times and each time it was pleasantly memorable.
