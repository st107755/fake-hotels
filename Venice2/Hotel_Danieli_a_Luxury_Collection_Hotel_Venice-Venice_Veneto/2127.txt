Classically beautiful hotel right on the water at the mouth of the Grand Canal.  Featured in the movie "The Tourist" with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.  Lobby is beyond gorgeous as are the views.  Splurged on an upgrade for a water front room and it was worth every penny.  As for a trip to Murano and get a free water limo ride for a great experience.  Pass on the hotel restaraunt for dinner.  Overpriced and eh food.  Breakfast is fine.  Eat at the Algiubagio instead!  It is worth the walk.
