AMAZING hotel ( although pricey) I thought I would not want to stay right by the Piazza San Marco, but boy was I wrong.  This was a dream vacation come thru. The hotel is amazing, the bar is amazing, the views are postcard perfect. Any room with a front view is incredible and to top it off, the breakfast on the top floor is what dreams are made of. A MUST STAY place in Venice.
