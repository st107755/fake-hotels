the hotel was very impressive, to the point I felt slightly out of my league, the staff were courteous and helpful and I'm sure they would of sorted any of my requests. I refrained from asking about information in case I was perceived as an idiot. ( remember the Julia Roberts moment in pretty women.) well it was like that but ten fold. When you consider they had bottles of wine on their menu valued at 40'000 euros.  To be fair, it was the first time I had been to Venice, I went with my 16 year old daughter , the location is fantastic, the hotel is very regal and full of antiques. ( don't take the kids!) staff were helpful but hotel lacked the personal touch and I think this was due to the sheer prices. Maybe a little pretentious.
