We decided that we would spend our 40th wedding anniversary in Venice.  We had a great time, the weather was perfect, not too hot which as we did a lot of walking and sightseeing was great. We were able to have breakfast on the hotel terrace and early evening drinks, the views were breath taking.  The breakfast offered had something for everyone, and we would end eating everything which filled us up till the evening.  Drinks on the terrace was slightly disappointing as we felt we were totally ignored and even got up and left after we waited half an hour to be served!! It depends on who was serving as the following evening the service was great.   Concierge was extremely helpful on the occasions we required information. After an evening of wandering around it was lovely to comeâ€¦
