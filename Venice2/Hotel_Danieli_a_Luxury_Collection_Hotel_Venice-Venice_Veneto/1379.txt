Fantastic character, excellent hotel which appears to be split over three buildings (not that you would know it). Really enjoyed our stay. Tip: When you book this hotel, try and book the terrace restaurant as the restaurant is busy. Terrace restaurant doubles up for breakfast and the view is truly spectacular, especially since none the other hotels appears to have a roof terrace.
