We arrived via private launch to the waterside entrance to the Danieli we didn't have to touch our luggage everything was taken care of without asking. We then checked in although it was very busy at the time we were there, the staff were apologetic and very pleasant. Our room was beautiful and we loved the toiletries in the bathroom. We overlooked the side canal and in the afternoons we could hear the gondaliers singing. The restaurant on the terrace was just gorgeous and we had breakfast there which was a stunning buffet. The Hotel is located right next to the Doge's Palace and is very central to St Mark's. I would highly recommend that you budget in a stay at the Danieli if only for a night to experience the luxury of this fine Hotel.
