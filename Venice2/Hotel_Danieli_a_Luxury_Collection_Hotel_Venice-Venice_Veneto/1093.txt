A perfect hotel, the staff is very efficient and discreet. Impeccable service Heitor the Concierge is outstanding. Housekeeping professional and friendly. The breakfast buffet is very tasty. I however found diner on rooftop restaurant a little bland. In my opinion the danieli should harmonise the food with the perfect quality of the hotel services
