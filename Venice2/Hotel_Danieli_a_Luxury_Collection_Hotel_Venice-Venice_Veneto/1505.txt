Arriving by boat to this hotel, you feel like a star. To be exact, you feel as grand as George Clooney and his new wifey. When the structure comes into sight, and you realize "this is where i'm going to be staying" you will be dumbfounded. of course, it's right in the center of everything but it's splendour isn't revealed just yet.. inside, the lobby is a bit dim which contributes to the mystery of the place. you just know that stories have unfolded in this very hall and on that centuries old staircase, you will be walking on some of the most notable people's footsteps. the wooden floors they creak, the rooms are small but rich in colors, patterns and classicism. In the morning, when i opened my window i saw a small courtyard and heard a man singing in Italian. Sounds cliche,â€¦
