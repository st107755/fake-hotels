The Danieli is one of the truly magnificent hotels of the world. Built in the 1300's it boasts one of the most beautiful views in all of Venice from its rooftop terrace restaurant. The hotel is conveniently located just steps from San Marco square and Basillica as well as Doges palace both of which all visitors to Venice must see. Additionally it is about 100 feet from the Vaporetta stop so you dont have to lug your bags  through the tight walkways which are often crammed with tourists. This is a big deal! Unlike the hotel Cipriani which is across the canal, Danieli does not have a pool but why come to Venice to swim. Go out and enjoy this beautiful, cosmopolitan Italian city!
