Hotel Danieli was absolutely gorgeous.  The lobby looked like something out of a movie, the rooms were so comfortable and romantic and the location is perfect.  We stayed in the newer rooms, so I don't know what the older rooms are like...I would request the newer side of the hotel.  The draperies made the rooms so lush and the marble bathrooms with towel warmers were a great treat after the overnight train we took to Venice.  We didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant but we heard it was very expensive...I'm sure very good too.  The front desk attendants always rememered your name when you were getting your room key, which was a very nice touch.  I would absolutely choose to stay here again on our next Italy vacation.
