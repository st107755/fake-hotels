Class, class and more class:  walls covered in fabric, marble dual shower fit for water fights, instant ( yesI mean immediate ) service from excellent staff.  The rooftop buffet breakfast offers a view and food that kings and queens never had.  If you can afford this place ~ stay there.   PS:  COSTCO made it very affordable for us in at the end of February when Carnival was happening.
