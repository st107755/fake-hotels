There have been very different reviews of the hotel. Obviously the most are positive, some however not. I personally think this is the nicest hotel I have ever been. The atmosphere is beyond words to describe. Being a guest in the hotel makes you feel like a nobleman.

We took a free water taxi to the Mureno island. Of course it is a bit of a tourist trap, but was nevertheless very nice and we had a good and romantic lunch on one of the canals. The restaurant is superb, the food exquisite and the ambiance is wonderful. We had to sit inside since the weather forecast was bad. But that didn’t spoil…
