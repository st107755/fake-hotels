The rooms os the Danieli it´s probably the bigest in the world, confortable and extra  large beds, with extra soft and perfumed linens, of the ultimate quality maybe found in hotels of the same level.Extra hight seillings, it´s wonderful, expensive, of course, but simply the one hotel , I mean, one of a kind.Extra gentel personnel, , we arrived out very early , out of the check in hour, but we were imediatly escorted by a very gentle and beautiful lady to our spendid room, wich hardly happens to others hotels equaly luxurious,but that keeps with that little mind way of treat the guests, plus,it was a magial experience, and I´m too, I can´t hardly way for my next stay in the Danieli, my hotel to last.
