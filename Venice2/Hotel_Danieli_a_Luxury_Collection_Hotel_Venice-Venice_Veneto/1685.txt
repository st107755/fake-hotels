...the Hotel Danieli was a distinguished flagship property of the esteemed CIGA (Compagnia Italiana Grandi Alberghi) Hotel group. It was a living legend, one of the world's most famous, with 12th century roots. The chandeliers in the lobby were polished with pride. Celebrities flocked. The gentlemen at the front desk grinned with pride as they handed over a heavy key hung from a tassled brass knob. It was a five-star hotel performing as a six-star hotel. That was a few short years ago. Danieli, my pink palace, where have you gone?
