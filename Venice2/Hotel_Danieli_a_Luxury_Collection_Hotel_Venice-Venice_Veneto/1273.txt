I have always wanted to stay at Hotel Danieli and my dream came true on our honeymoon.  We were extremely fortunate for the amazing upgrade which was accompanied by strawberries and champagne for our honeymoon.  From the moment we walked off the boat into the entrance, I was enthralled, the hotel is breathtaking and all the staff are so lovely, courteous and warm.

Breakfast was amazing, so much toâ€¦
