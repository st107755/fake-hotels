We came back to Danieli after 3 years ( when i proposed to my wife) and we were again impressed. They upgraded us to a Junior suite and we had a great lunch and dinner at Terrazo Restaurant on the 4th floor of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I don't understand how other people can rate this hotel as terrible...ofcourse the price is high but you know that before you arrive there.
