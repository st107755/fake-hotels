Spent a wonderful weekend in Venice at the Danieli. This is a proper old school hotel with the most fantastic concierge desk I have ever used. They organised trips to Murano and to some of the best (and I donâ€™t mean expensive) restaurants in town. Views of the lagoon from the rooftop bar and restaurant are magnificent.
