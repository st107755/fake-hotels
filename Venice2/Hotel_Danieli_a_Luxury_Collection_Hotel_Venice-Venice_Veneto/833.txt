Stunning hotel. We stayed 4 nights in a junior suite with balcony, the decor is looking a little tired but having a view of the lagoon made up for that. We loved people watching from the balcony. The bathroom was a little snug and the in bath shower was rather temperamental. That aside we loved the location. This is our second visit so we obviously love it enough to return. Breakfast was on the roof terrace, with excellent choice. We dined in the restaurant one evening, the food was amazing, but rather expensive. We loved the bar downstairs and enjoyed listening to the resident pianist.
