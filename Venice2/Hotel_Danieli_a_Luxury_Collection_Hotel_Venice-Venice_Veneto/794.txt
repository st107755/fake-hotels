I stayed in this Hotel from 20th to 23rd October. The Hotel was beautiful and d√©cor stunning Room was very pleasant and clean and was refreshed at least twice a day. The restaurant was superb and we were able to eat on the terrace with beautiful views with at least 10 people serving on. Breakfast was available on the Terrace too and the food was superb. The hotel is close to everything Squares/Gondola/ Taxi rides. All the reception staff were extremely helpful in areas to visit and modes of transport. All the staff were exceptional professional but friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Well worth a visit if you can afford it
