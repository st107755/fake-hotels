I recently stayed two night in this hotel.  I finally had to tackle the maid to make up my room later on afternoon. the lighting in the bthroom was dire.  Oly one light on one side of the mirror???  My husband and I  had a light unch in the bar.  The bar is depressing and not too clean.  Our bar man acted like we were annoying him even asking  for a sandwich.  On the other hand Pierofranco in the roof top restaurant couldnt have been more charming.  The view is the best in Venice...the prices are the highest.  Being part of Starwoods has down graded this once very fine hotel in Venice.  The clients arrive wearing shorts, running shoes and wife beater shirts..not a great sight.  Davide was most helpful and arranged for a water taxi and a porter to take us the the train station.
