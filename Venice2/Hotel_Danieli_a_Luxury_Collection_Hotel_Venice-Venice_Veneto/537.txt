The Danieli lived up to all the hype.  As soon as you walk-in, the hotel foyer takes your breath away.

The staff and concierge were all great, although check-in could have been a little faster.  We requested a complimentary room upgrade but was told the hotel was full, however soon after I overheard the reception staff overing available rooms to others, so I would have preferred to have just been told the truth in the first place.  Our room was in the oldest part of the palace, rightâ€¦
