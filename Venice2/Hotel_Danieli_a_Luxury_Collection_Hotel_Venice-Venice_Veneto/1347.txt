We stayed at the Danieli for our silver wedding anniversary holiday in 2001 and it was amazing. My husband organised a surprise visit to Venice for my birthday this year and I was thrilled to find we were returning to this hotel. However, although it is a truly beautiful building and so historic, the staff and service left much to be desired and the hotel deserves so much better. When we arrived, we had to wait for at least 20 minutes at reception while one member of staff dealt with a large number of clients. When we finally were served, they said they could find no record of our reservation. Having overheard another conversation about the hotel being fully booked, we were understandably concerned. The assurance was given that we would not be "sleeping in the street!"â€¦
