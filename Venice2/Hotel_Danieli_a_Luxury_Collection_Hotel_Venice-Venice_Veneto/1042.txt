This hotel is just beautiful decor very classy and very much Venetian style. Location is ideal right beside St Marks Square but you do pay for that. The food in hotel is beautiful and roof top terrace spectacular. Breakfast very impressive. We dined in one evening very expensive as is drinks in bar. The pianist is a nice touch. All of the staff are excellent at customer service go out of there way to help from the minute we arrived in hotel and we got our room upgraded which was a nice touch. I would highly recommend this hotel for a short getaway.
