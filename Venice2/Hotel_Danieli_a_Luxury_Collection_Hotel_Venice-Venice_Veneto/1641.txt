We first stayed here 10 years ago for our 25th wedding anniversary & couldn't think of anywhere better to spend our 35th. We had a modern room overlooking the lagoon and although it didn't have the style of the old classic rooms it was beautifully furnished & very spacious. The downstairs bar & lobby areas are stunning. We hit lucky with the weather for March & we were able to have breakfast outside on the terrace, which had brilliant views over the lagoon & up the Grand Canal.
