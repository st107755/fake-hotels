Simply the finest hotel I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying in. I couldn’t fault the rooms, ambience, service or the food and the whole experience was amazing from start to finish. Thank you so much to everyone who made our stay so memorable - I will treasure the memories made in this very special hotel in beautiful Venice always.
