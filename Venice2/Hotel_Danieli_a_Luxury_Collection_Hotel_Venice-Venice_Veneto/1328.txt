We decided to splurge on our recent Venice trip. Yes, this is a beautiful hotel and the lobby is stunning...HOWEVER, the staff is cold and the service is absolutely terrible.  I was shocked at how small our room was for $1000. a night - there was not even a place for both of our suitcases.... and we never got so much as a welcome or thank you the entire time we were there.  The roof top restaurant was going to be our special night out and with reservations a month in advance and knowing it was our anniversary they attempted to put us where we did not have any view..and our food was so average - NOT 5 star. Seriously so disappointed although the view is beautiful.  Two of the days we had to stand in line to get into the hotel it was so crowded.  SAVE your money, visit the hotelâ€¦
