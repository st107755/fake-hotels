Hotel was good.  Great location and convenient.  Regardless of age of the hotel, 1000 per room per night your expect the ac to work properly.    We had 2 rooms and the ac wouldn't cool the rooms below 76 degrees.   The rooms were humid and horn so our stay wasn't comfortable.   Breakfest was good and nice views.  For that kind of money you can stay at another place that's more luxurious.   Or simply stay at a 4 star and spend your money on other things.
