Fromthe time you step aboard their private launch on arrival until you leave, a stay at Hotel Danieli is guaranteed to be an exceptionally enjoyable experience.  The hotel is comprised of 2 pillazzi and one mid-twentieth century buildings.  The furnishings are different in each room.  The roof-top ristorante is better than most.  The panoramic view from the rooftop terrace is an experience not paralleled elsewhere.  The hotel is just off St. Mark's square and next door to the Doge's Pillazzo. Enjoy your well-pampered stay!
