Outstanding stay at the Hotel Danieli! Started off with a private watertaxi from the train station to the private entrance for hotel guest only at the Hotel Danieli. It was nice to walk directly into the hotel instead of having to drag out luggage through the tiny alleys, walkways, and stairs of Venice. The lobby is probably what the Hotel is best known for and is by all means as amazing as you probably have heard. It's breathtaking! Our room faced the water and although it was a little dated (definitely needs to be updated a little, but still very nice being classic). It was "fun" to have an actually key to access the room instead of the common keycard, helps to keep the hotel very original. The staff at the hotel was outstanding with a minor few who didn't seem to really careâ€¦
