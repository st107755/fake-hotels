The terrace of Hotel Daniele has one of the most stunning views of Venice. The weather was fabulous, over 22 degrees, the light over the city was magnificent, because this amazing city has one of the most espectacular colour of light in the entire world. It was magic to have a delicious cocktail in this beautiful scenery.
