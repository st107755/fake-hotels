Charging over 500 euros for a room that overlooks a shaft, with minimal light entering, is way too overpriced even for venice. On a more positive note, the beds were extremely comfy and the bathroom was huge. Breakfast was excellent and the views of the Gran Canal Amazing, but the pigeon were at times quite intrusive.
