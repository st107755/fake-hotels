The Hotel Danieli is beautiful but it is very expensive. The reason it is not a five star in my opinion.  The wi-fi in the room is not free.  For over $600 a night I think they should include it at least for Starwood Preferred Guests. Also, we had two rooms, and two bottles of water were provided each night.  One day they forgot to leave them in the mini-bar and I had to call housekeeping.  Anytime I have to call it does not rate a five star. Also, we felt the staff was not very helpful and the concierge, even if no one was there seemed like we were a bother. But great location. That couldn't have been better.
