This hotel is amazing!  We did half points and half cash.  I think we spent about 8,000 points per night and paid $120 per night.  The great thing was that we got upgraded to a canal view room which had a view of the whole canal and part of San Marco Square.  It was just simply amazing!  The view was breathtaking!  The hotel itself is an antique but maintained very well!  The staff was very courteous, some had better attitudes than others but there wasn't anyone that was rude.  Some high end hotels have staff that think they are stuck up.  My wife and I are in our early thirties and to be honest we don't see too many people our age staying at the Luxury collection hotels but we use our Amex Card alot so we rack up a lot of points and when we travel we try to live it up a bit.   â€¦
