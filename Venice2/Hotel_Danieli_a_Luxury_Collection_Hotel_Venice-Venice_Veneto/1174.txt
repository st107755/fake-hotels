This hotel is amazing! It is a wonderful historic site with an amazingly beautiful lobby that used to be a courtyard. It looks like something out of Romeo and Juliet.  Right outside the door are the gondolas awaiting your ride or the boat buses that take you around the Grand Canal. A few short steps away is St. Mark's Square and church. The hotel staff is so nice and knowledgeable. We had breakfast and lunch in the hotel's restaurant which has a unbelievable outdoor balcony overlooking the canal and all of the landmarks. The hotel occupies three different buildings which connect so when you pass from one to the other, you look out onto the canals and can watch the gondolas going by. Highly recommend!
