The Danieli is a beautiful, comfortable hotel. The building is quite... grand. The beds are comfortable, and our room was immaculate. The staff provided amazing service with a smile. They even went the extra mile: when we forgot some valuables in the in-room safe at checkout, THEY made the effort to track US down to arrange the items' safe return. At a lesser property, a dishonest employee might have just pocketed the valuables; but the staff at the Danieli went above and beyond the call of duty to return it. Now THAT'S what I call service!
