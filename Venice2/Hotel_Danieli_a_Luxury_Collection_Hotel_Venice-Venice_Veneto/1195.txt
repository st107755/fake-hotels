The location of this old established hotel is excellent.  The telephone reservation was handled very well and helpfully by the staff and check also. However, the room ,which I believe was typical, was very darkly lit which made it difficult for ladies to do make up etc.  Service in the bar was slow as we had to go and call for a waiter and the porter who delivered our bags would not leave the room without a tip. La Terrazza restaurant was a great place to have breakfast which was excellent as was the service. Lunch here also produced very good cooking. The views are terrific. Concierge staff went through the motions without being over helpful and really had a rather superior disinterested air about them. I have made these points to the management who responded very positivelyâ€¦
