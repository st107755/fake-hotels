Expecting a unique experience, we were arriving in Venice for the first time. I will first cover the pros, followed by the cons.   The best part about the hotel was the fact that it has direct access from one of the canals - a great experience for a tourist arriving at their hotel. The concierge service was great as it allowed us to create an itinerary for the two days we were in the city. We were specifically happy with the restaurant recommendations that were made. The old and rustic feel of the building and lobby definitely adds to the whole experience of being in the iconic city. With respect to the rooms, they dont shy away from being full of colour and grandeur. Beds are comfortable, as are the well equipped bathrooms. We were extremely happy with the Aqua di Parmaâ€¦
