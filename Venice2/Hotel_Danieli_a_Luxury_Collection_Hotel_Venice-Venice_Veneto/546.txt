Breakfast on the roof top terrace was an experience in itself - totally sublime.  Loved every minute of it and one morning we stayed for over two hours, savouring the food and the view. The bedroom and bathroom were rather dated.  I would usually expect better when paying in excess of €500 per night, but it was spotlessly clean with super air-conditioning, keeping it wonderfully cool when staying in the middle of August. The main reception area, central staircase and bar area were absolutely beautiful - a very memorable setting. Tips: If you arrive at the hotel by water taxi, make sure they drop you at the private entrance at the side - our's dropped us at the main dock in front of the hotel so with a walk to the hotel, albeit very short, it didn't feel quite as special as it…
