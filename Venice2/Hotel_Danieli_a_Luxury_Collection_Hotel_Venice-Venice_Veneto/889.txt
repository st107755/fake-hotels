Used to be plush, elegant etc, one came by water taxi and was greeted by porters, right at the main dock. Now have to go to a narrow canal and welcome lacks the quality expected. The rooms are old, smelly, and uncomfortable. The breakfast resemble a fast food restaurant, no Italian class left.  Would never go back
