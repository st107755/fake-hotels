The interior of this hotel is sumptuous to the eye.  The service was first rate and the location can't be beat-- right next to San Marco's Square.  The only critique I have of this hotel is the attitude towards the younger members of our party.  Our 18 year old daughter and her two friends also stayed at this hotel with us. Every time they entered the hotel, they were asked if they were staying at the hotel ( and not in a nice manner).  I can understand and appreciate the attitude of the hotel towards ensuring the privacy of their guests, however, you would think that after the first couple of days the same people who asked them, the Concierge, would make an effort to remember them.
