All good, but for such an hotel you expect to at least to have a good sleep...it was not the case during my stay. I had a room with a view on the lagoon (1.300 â‚¬ per night) and because of the very old windows I was forced to stop my sleep g at 6.30 AM because of the noise coming from the outside...absolutely not acceptable!
