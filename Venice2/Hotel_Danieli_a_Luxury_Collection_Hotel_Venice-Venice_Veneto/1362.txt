A beautiful hotel. The entrance and lobby are really exceptional. Staff is very friendly. Prices are very high, what you can expect on a top location in Venice. Still I find the room overpriced. A bit to basic, quite a small bathroom, definitely some refurbishment is required. Wifi is poor quality, and we got it for free but is not the standard. (for this price not standard for free???). Breakfast is very good. Excellent quality. Only the last morning we were served on top level at breakfast. Staff on the other 2 days was slow and not attentive. Again for this proce 5 stars should be the minimum, so 4 is actually under par.
