We got stuck in the cheap wing and when you look out of the windows, you see a wall. Poor choice for Tauck to use this hotel both coming and going on our Venice & The Dalmation Coast cruise. Only good things were the great breakfast and helpful staff. Never stay here a gain. Way over priced at $500 +
