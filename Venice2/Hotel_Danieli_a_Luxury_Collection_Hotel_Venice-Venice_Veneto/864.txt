this is a truly beautiful hotel and a joy to stay in. we went out of season and the room prices are very reasonable for the quality of the hotel. it is full of charm from a time gone buy. this may not be to everyone's tastes but you don't have to be modern to be better. please be aware that this is still a high end Hotel and obviously drinks in the bar etc.. are priced accordingly !!
