This is the top draw.  There is nothing that we could say which would enhance the experience of staying here. This is 5 star excellence with style and charm. Perfection. The decor of the facilities is 14th century opulence. The curtains in the room look like a grand ball gown in blood red..such sophistication is very rare.
