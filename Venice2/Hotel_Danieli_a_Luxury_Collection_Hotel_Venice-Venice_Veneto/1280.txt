My wife, daughter and I stayed here one night in July prior to departing on a cruise from venice.  We had heard about the Danieli before and knew about its luxury reputation.  The hotel did not dissapoint.  We used points to stay in the hotel, but room typically start at over $500 a night.  The location is incredible, just steps from the Bridge of Sighs and San Marco.  Our room had a view of the Grand Canal.  I woudlnt spend $500-$800 a night to stay here as there are cheaper options also around San Marco, but it was well worth the Starwood points for us.  The staff was very helpfu, especially the concierege that helped us negotiate a taxi to the airport for our party of 11 travelers.  Bravo Danieli!
