We booked our hotel with AMEX Centurion and the hotel upgraded our rooms which was very nice of them.  Between myself, my husband, two teenage girls and a 7 year old, we had 4 bathrooms, a king and three twins in addition to a separate living room.  The rooms were a good size, but the hotel is old.  The teenage girls had a lot of problems getting into their rooms because you have to hold the key a certain way - due to the oldness of the doors and locks.  This created a big problem because they typically had to fetch a maid or someone to open their doors.  The staff is the best I have come across in my 18 day trip through France and Italy.  The waiters up at the Terrace were very good!  As is the front desk.  The hotel is old and beautiful, but the bad comes along with that inâ€¦
