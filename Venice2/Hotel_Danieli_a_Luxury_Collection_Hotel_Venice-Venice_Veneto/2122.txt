If it's in your budget you should absolutely stay here. It's the most beautiful hotel I've ever been to in the ten or so countries I've traveled in outside the United States. It is elegant, tasteful and one-of-a-kind. The staff is very helpful (particularly Irina who is a sweetheart) and the rooms are well-maintained and spacious. It's located right by St. Mark's, so you're near all the main tourist sights and right on the Grand Canal. The breakfast in the morning is on the top of the building and offers the breathtaking view of Venice you travelled all the way there to see.   I'd really recommend this hotel for any honeymooners, or for anyone who doesn't think they're getting back to Venice anytime soon. It is worth every penny.
