We stayed here for 4 nights while in Venice and I would say it was a choice not to regret.  We got upgraded to one of the suites on the highest floor with a view of the grand canal, absolutely stunning.  The staffs were amazing.  I asked for for recommendations to restaurants hear by and each recommendation was exceptionally valued and memorable.  The hotel is centrally located by the waterway terminal and easy assess to historical location within the city.
