We got married in Venice on 4th December and planned it for over a year. We trawled through various hotel websites in Venice and eventually settled on Hotel Danieli as the hotel where we would like to stay. I kept being drawn to the beautiful main staircase.Our wedding party consisted of only my now husband and I.  From the time I booked back in January to when we departed, we were delighted with the excellent service we received throughout the hotel. The hotel is stunning and encapsulates the mood and the beauty of Venice. The concierge department were extremely helpful, in particular Dario, from finding me a hairdresser for the morning of the wedding to finding someone to fill some balloons with helium. Nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded to a beautiful roomâ€¦
