This is my 8th or 9th visit to Venice, but I've not stayed in a hotel before.  As a student living in the city back in the early 80s, I walked past the Danieli every day and promised myself one day I'd come back and stay in style.  A chance bit of googling revealed that a few days in February, flying with Ryanair, wouldn't be as out of my reach as I thought - so I booked for three nights over Valentine's Day for my partner and myself. Communication with the hotel prior to my visit was excellent, all questions answered quickly.  I couldn't fault the staff at all during the stay.  Polite, attentive, unobtrusive, friendly, accommodating and charming.  Before I arrived I mistakenly thought that because I'm 'ordinary' they wouldn't take any notice of me, giving their attentionâ€¦
