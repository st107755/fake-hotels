We didn't stay at this hotel, but had cocktails there one night during our stay in Venice.  What a lovely place, right near St Marks Square on the Grand Canal!   Drinks were expensive, but the ambiance was lovely - frescos, lovely seating, and wonderful piano player - it took me back in time to a more peaceful place.
