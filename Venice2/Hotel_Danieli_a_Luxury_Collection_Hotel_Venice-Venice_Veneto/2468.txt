We stayed at this hotel for two nights in May.  The hotel is beautiful and location really can't be beat.  However, if we had paid full price for our room, we would have been beyond disappointed.  This hotel is extremely overpriced.  Rooms are small and definitely not up to date, but we enjoyed our stay there none the less. We do however have an amazing restaurant to recommend..... Taverna La Fenice.  Get directions from your hotel. Food was amazing and depending on what you order, the service can be quite a show.  It was a wonderful evening.
