Stayed there last week for one night. The check-in process took us (6 people) more than 30 min. It seemed they did that for the first time. Taking our papers for ages and typing all kind of information into their system. And as the rooms weren't ready by then, we left our luggage in the hotel. Didn't know that matching a certain suitcase to a room number / person can be that difficult. Ridiculous!!!! And for that price, the rooms are bloody tiny!
