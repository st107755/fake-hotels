This hotel is beautiful, and I’m giving it 5 stars although I personally believe 4.5 would be more appropriate.  Let me explain.  First off, this hotel is very old, and not 60 years old ‘old’, but centuries old.  With that in mind it is extremely well kept, and you would never guess you’re staying in a hotel this old.  First off-location, location, location.  This hotel is in an amazing location, right near St. Mark's Square.  Doesn’t get better.  Staff is excellent, as you’d expect for this type of hotel, and there really isn’t much to fault other than during our stay there was construction going on in the main lobby which robbed the hotel (ever so slightly) of its glorious splendor (hence, the 4.5 stars, but I'm giving it 5).  While the Danieli is extremely well maintained…
