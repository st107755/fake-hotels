The hotel is in a prime location with access to water taxis, ferrys, walkways, galleries, restaurants. The staff are helpful, professional and attentive, namely Fillipo on concierge as well as Stella on reception.   We upgraded to a double room with a terrace ( balcony) that over looked the lagoon. The room was luxuriously furnished, clean and functional. The view from the terrace is spectacular.
