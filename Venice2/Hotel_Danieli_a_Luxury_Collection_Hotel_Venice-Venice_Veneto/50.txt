Read a lot of the reviews and was surprised to see there were negative comments? First class all the way. From check-in to lobby, location, and yes our room. We used points and stayed a Monday/Tuesday. Got upgraded to a very large room with a balcony...heaven. We looked east over a small canal.  I could be nit-picky about some of the small problems but why, a truly wonderful stay. The lobby bar/sitting area was wonderful at night. The bed was great, the towels great...etc. etc. etc. Trhe location is second to none and although a room in front would have been great for the view...think of the noise...thousands of people walking by all day/night long. I'd take the balcony with a few gondola's below.
