We booked a 'four nights for three' offer through British Airways, which added an extra pleasure to staying in this marvellous hotel. It's a palace of a place to - just enter through the lobby doors to realise you're somewhere very special indeed. It's located right next to the Bridge of Sighs and about 4 minutes' stroll from Saint Mark's Square and commands a breath-taking view across the lagoon from its rooftop restaurant. There just can't be a finer vista while enjoying a superb buffet breakfast.  The staff are attentive and friendly, the bar prices are a little expensive - but what the heck, you're in the lap of luxury and you have one free night's stay at the end of it!
