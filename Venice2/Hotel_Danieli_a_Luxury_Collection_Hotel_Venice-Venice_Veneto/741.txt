What can I say about the Danieli? Simply, its amazing. We got engaged here and I couldn't fault a thing. All the staff were so kind and friendly and really made our stay very special. Our room overlooked the lagoon and standing on the balcony watching the sunset and the boats was simply magical. I'll never forget the weekend we had here.
