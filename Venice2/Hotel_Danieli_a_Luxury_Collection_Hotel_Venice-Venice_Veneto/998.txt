This is a hotel which we haved stayed in some years ago and visited last April a couple of times for lunch in the bar.   We stopped here this year but were not sure if we could have lunch in the bar as there is a brass plaque, on a stand, which seemed to suggest that we might not be allowed in.  However, we were assured that it was ok.  We had some sandwiches and drinks but felt that it was very expensive.  In general, the tone of the bar was, quite in contrast to our other "pit stops" this year not very welcoming.  The Danieli is a very grand "name" in Venice and perhaps our names weren't grand enough.
