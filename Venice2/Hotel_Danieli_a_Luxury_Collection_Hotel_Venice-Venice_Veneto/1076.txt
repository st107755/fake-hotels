What a hotel ! It's in the heart of Venice, just next to Palace of the Dodges. The hotel itself is a palace that belongs to a Dodge Dandalo. If you want to be part of medieval age history, you 'd stay here without any hesitation. The only problem is some rooms are just next to the prison part of the Palace of Dodges; view is not much alluring in those rooms , but decoration of the rooms is perfect and this compensates for the view there. Rooms are very clean and they are done two times a day . Restaurant  has  a superb view although food is not as delicous as one may expect from such a hotel !
