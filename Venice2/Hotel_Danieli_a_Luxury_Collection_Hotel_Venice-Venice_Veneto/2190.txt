Arrive by private water taxi from airport as anything else wont do. On arriving at the hotels own landing station, you enlight into the most amazing foyer/lounge/reception area. The reception staff are very efficient so registration went smoothly. We chose to upgrade to a lagoon view room when booking this hotel & boy did we make the right decision. Room 226 was amazing, the view of the lagoon & its everyday activities was very interesting. The bed was the best bed we have ever slept in, sheer luxury. We sat in sunshine every morning in the hotels roof top restaurant, watching the lagoon activity whilst enjoying our very substantial & varied breakfast. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, very efficient. We hope to try one of the suites on our next visit. Great location 5â€¦
