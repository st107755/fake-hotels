We've stayed there some time ago and it ws great. Perfect location, nice views of the Grand Canal, room was really nice (maybe the bathroom needed some upgrade), quite spacious and i was impressed by the fact that they were cleaning/arranging our room even 3-4 times a day. They offered complimentary boat transport to Westin - for pool access since Danieli doesn't have one.  JUST BEAUTIFUL!!!
