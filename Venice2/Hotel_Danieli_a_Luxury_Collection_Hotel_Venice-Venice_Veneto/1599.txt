Last week my husband and I spent two nights at the Danieli following an Adriatic cruise, and we were extremely pleased with our choice.  A water taxi took us directly to the hotel dock very early in the morning where the charming receptionist allowed us to check into our room right away.  It was spacious, very comfortable with a good sized bathroom and plenty of closet room.  I booked with Starwood points which brought the cost of the room down to a very reasonable rate for a five star hotel.The lobby is beautiful and a great place to have a drink away from the summer crowds.  Also, the concierge service is excellent, very helpful and knowledgeable. We would definitely stay here again.
