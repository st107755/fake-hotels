Short weekend for Valentine's Day- but little did I know we were going to be staying in this jewel of a hotel. Not only for all its architectural grandeur and luxury but because it's the people working there, the staff that make ones stay the most pleasant.  It's very centrally located- anything closer you'd be at the Doge's palace.  Rooms are impeccable, absolute luxury all the way from decoration, towels and toiletries to details you wouldn't think of. Buffet Breakfast is served on the terrace on the fifth floor with an amazing view of Venice. So all in all, aside the perfection one might take for granted from a hotel of this quality, keep in mind the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. Totally worthwhile if you have the chance!
