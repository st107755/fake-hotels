My wife and I spend a long weekend at this gorgeous hotel. she had difficulty checking in and had to wait in excess of time without good communication overall the experience was wonderful. The concierge was the highlight and they were very helpful in arranging cabs etc.  The deluxe rooms were smaller but this is Europe and to be expected. The rooftop restaurant was very nice but they charge extra to dine on the terrace which seems a little strange. Overall a great experience
