Hotel Danieli is amazing! The lobby/reception is spectacular!  The main reason for writing this review is because of the bald guy at the reception who helped with the check-in.  I am sorry that I donâ€™t remember your name but you were very polite, friendly and generously arranged the breakfast for an additional cost. (I am losing hair too so being called the bald guy is not offensive!)
