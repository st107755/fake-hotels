Excellent hotel, the staff always attentive to the guests demands, excellent concierge and the location...wonderful. This hotel is ideally located for shopping and sightseeing. Everyone was polite, friendly and professional and couldn't have been more accomodating despite this being an extremely busy hotel. Our room was large and the bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Although the furnishings were not as modern as expected, the room was very clean and the size more than made up for it. Everything else about this hotel made our trip memorable. The public areas are truly beautiful and I would recommend staying here to anyone.
