Expensive yes, but is it worth it? Without a doubt. The Hotel Danieli oozes elegance and is reflective of old fashioned values. The service is impeccable without being overbearing or making you feel uncomfortable and all the staff were friendly and welcoming. The rooms are a little on the small side and may not be to everyone's modern taste but its an old building and its other attributes more than make up for the size of the rooms. The view from the terrace at breakfast could not be better and the building is a treasure to behold. If you want to experience a little piece of history then this is the place to stay.
