We spent 6 wonderful nights at the Danieli, what a fabulous expereience.  It really felt like we stepped out of reality and into a dream.  This hotel is a "never in your wildest dreams" did you think you would stay somewhere so much like a fairy tale.  As long as you keep in mind that you are staying somewhere several hundred years old and do not have unrealistic expectations, you will find that it is so much better than any hotel built in the last decade.  The Danieli offered excellent sevice, everything you could ask for in amenities, and a piece of history and charm like you have never experienced before! I travel a great deal and have stayed in some of the nicest places in the world, The Daniele is at the top of my list, I even place it well above The Waldorf-Astoria atâ€¦
