Lovely luxury  hotel in the heart of Venice, strongly recommend it! Right in the middle of everything,, typical venecian decoration.I loved the staff, everyone was extremely polite and helpful.   The hotel is stunning, absolutely gorgeous.The only problem is the noice from outside, also the restaurant is extremely overpriced and the quality of the food is not what i expected.
