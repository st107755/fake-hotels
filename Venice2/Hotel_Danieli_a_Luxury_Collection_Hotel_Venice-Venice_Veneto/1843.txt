This was the most perfect hotel we have stayed in .after reading trip advisiors reviews for a long time i cannot understand why people have complained.It was our anniversary and after being shown to our room at 12 ,when we shouldnt have even been allowed into room untill3pm. within ten minutes we had abottle of champagne and beautiful chocolates arrive from the hotel for our anniversary. the room was beautiful ,the food was beautiful ,the staff were polite cheerful and couldnt do enough for you. PLEASE  go and see for yourself you wont be dissapointed.
