This hotel at Christmas is fabulous with a wonderful atmosphere .. I could linger here all evening and not go exploring. Nothing is too much trouble. The location is fantastic, the sense of history immense, the discretion of the staff admirable..  It might be eyewateringly expensive  but that is what you would expect from one of the top hotels in Venice.
