Location, location, location!! And the breakfasts on the terrace restaurant offer extraordinary views of the lagoon, as do the rooms facing the lagoon.  We happened to be in Venice during a regatta, so stepping onto our balconies (small, but terrific vantage points) to experience the pageantry of vendors and tourists on land and of all sorts of boats at sea gave us unforgettable memories.  It's an old hotel, with labyrinthine passageways and dim bulbs as well as the plush velvet and gilded decor of another age.  The internet service was poor, much more complicated than it should have been at hotel in this price range--and those labyrinths and the dim lighting were a little tiresome.  But we had a wonderful time, so close to everything Venice, including delightful narrow streetsâ€¦
