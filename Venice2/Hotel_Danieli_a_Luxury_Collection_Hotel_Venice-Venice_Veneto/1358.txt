My wife and I stayed for two nights in June to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel was amazing - great service, location, comfort, and the list goes on. We had the private transfer to the hotel which was well worth it - a very special way to arrive!! I couldn't recommend the hotel enough - I'd love to go back!
