This is a lovely old hotel in a great location and is particularly great in the low season when there are not thousands of tourists on the front door.  The restaurant is over-rated and the breakfasts are exhorbitant but if you go around the corner for breakfast,  use the concierge, and consider the location it can't be surpassed in Venice.
