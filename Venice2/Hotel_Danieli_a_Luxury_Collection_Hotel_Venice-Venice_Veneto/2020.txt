Hotel Danieli is a spectacular hotel.  The service there was great; although the concierge is perhaps a little understaffed.  The hotel is beautiful, with a certain classical style that can be appreciated only once you are there.  The location is literally next door to the Doge Palace / San Marco.    The Prime Minister of Italy was staying five doors down from us while we were there.  All the security detail in the hallways was a little annoying, as they looked at you suspiciously and they wouldn't let us appreciate all the art housed on our floor near the Presidential suite.  Breakfast on the rooftop was beautiful.  I really can't complain about anything.
