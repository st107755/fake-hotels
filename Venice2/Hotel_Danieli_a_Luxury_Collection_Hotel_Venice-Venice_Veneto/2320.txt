Though the hotel is very convenient to San Marco, I did not like the location.  I did not like stepping out of a luxury hotel into the masses.  Doges Palace was lovely. Dinners at The Gritti Palace and Fortuny at Cipriani were wonderful due to the unique atmosphere.  Our junior suite on the lagoon was in need of updating.  Expensive!  The common areas were very beautiful.
