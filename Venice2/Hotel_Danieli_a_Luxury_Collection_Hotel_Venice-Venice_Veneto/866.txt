There are more hotels than you can imagine but none that I've stayed at that were more beautiful and had an air of beauty and charm like this one. I believe this was an old castle converted into a first rate hotel without losing the charm. In addition a restaurant on top with a view of the main channel that's hard to beat.I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.
