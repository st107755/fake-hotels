The Danieli has been on my "bucket" list for so long that I can't even remember where I first heard about it. On the occasion of our 40th wedding anniversary I decided to fulfil my dream and booked a few days in the Danieli.  The water transfer from Marco Polo airport (despite a 15 minute walk to the boat) was brilliant, dropping off other passengers en route and giving us wonderful first impressions of Venice, the Danielli being the last stop, almost right outside the hotel. Seeing the hotel coming in to view as we approached it was amazing. After negotiating the revolving door with suitcases, I was transported to another world in the stunning, elegant interior of the Danieli, being  every bit as beautiful as I had imagined. I was amazed to see a gondola pull right up at a sideâ€¦
