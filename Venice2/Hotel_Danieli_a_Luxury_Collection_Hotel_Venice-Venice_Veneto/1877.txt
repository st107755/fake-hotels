We were at the Hotel Danieli for New Years Eve and looked forward to this for months. I had been to the Danieli many times years ago - many years ago - but this was first time with the family.  The biggest problem is the staff - from the reception to the concierge - Yes it was New Years Eve and yes they were busy - but the staff was almost "annoyed" with the guests. They never had change for money as an example. Checking out was a disaster - Tons of staff members but very inefficient. Even something so simple as a smile -  Of course there were exceptions and do mean to indict the entire staff but the most visual staff members were not welcoming. In a hotel this price that is not acceptable.  The Lobby is magnificent, room was fine, food - not too great but ok -- Fantastic Viewâ€¦
