I feel the negative reviews are a bit harsh.   We stayed here for three nights and really enjoyed our stay here. Arrived by a water taxi from the airport- amazing way to travel. There’s a lovely hotel lobby, grand bar area, lovely large rooms (well the suite is) albeit could do with some modernisation. We had amazing views of the lagoon.  The staff were lovely and friendly and breakfast was nice. Can’t really fault this place.
