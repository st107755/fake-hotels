We stayed for 5 nights and it was lovely, the staff mostly speak very good English, the reception area is spectacular, Marble and Murano glass chandeliers everywhere, we arrived at around 12:00 and our room was not ready, the reception staff said to try the restaurant  for lunch and then  the room should be ready...   we had a lovely meal in the roof top restaurant (with views over the lagoon... Spectacular!!) of Ravioli and carbenara followed by desert, also lovely, with 2 glasses each of fizzy wine... I didn't expect the bill to be 200 Euros!!  that was the only time we eat there (except for breakfast which we had pre-paid for),   the room was sumptuous the bathroom was all done (floor, walls and counter tops) in Green and white marble, they really know how to pamper you... â€¦
