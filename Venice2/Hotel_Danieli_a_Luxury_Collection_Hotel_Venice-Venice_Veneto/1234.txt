Upon entry to the hotel Danielli, you would feel you have entered a time machine that immediately brings you back some hundred years ago. The feel is so magical and real. Yes it's a high profile hotel with distinct look. The staff are great and the service superb. Just don't count the greens in your pocket and just enjoy every second of your stay. It doesn't come everyday.
