The outside of The Danieli doesn’t really do it justice. When you walk through the revolving doors you are hit by a symphony of gold, marble and glass. An amazing reception area with bar and stairs leading to the rooms. Wonderful staff and a breathtaking lobby give you a hint of what’s to come. Our room was also delightfully ornate and over the top. Deep red velvet, gold leaf and marble. Would I decorate my house like this? No! Does it work here? 100% yes. The bed was awesome and so to breakfast on the 5th floor. Really good food, huge selection and a terrace with an amazing view of the water. The hotel is 60 feet from the water and the taxi area and a minutes walk from St Marks Square. This hotel has everything you need for a great stay in a unique City.
