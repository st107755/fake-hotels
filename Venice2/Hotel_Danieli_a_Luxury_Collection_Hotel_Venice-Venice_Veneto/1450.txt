This was our first stay at the Danieli, an amazing old palazzo next to the Doges Palace on the Grand Canal.  The location is perfect and entering the building (we did it from the water gate, something you do not do every day) you feel that you are back in time and one of the elite invited into opulent shining public gathering rooms.  Our bedroom, however, was somewhat underwhelming, looking a bit dated and tired.  For some reason, we were given a suite with a sitting room and two bathrooms, and we did have a peekaboo side view of the canal.  The staff was late in getting us into our room so they offered us free espresso, a treat which usually costs 9 euros a cup, and for the rest of our stay the service was excellent.
