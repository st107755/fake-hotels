When we ended our 14 day mediterreanean cruise we stayed 2 extra days in Venice and stayed at The Hotel Danieli near San Marco Plaza.We used our Starwood Membership to make the reservations and had a 4 room suite with a spectacular view of the canal and had a wonderful breakfast at the rooftop La Terrezza Restaurant.Overall it was a breathtaking 3 days in romantic Venice
