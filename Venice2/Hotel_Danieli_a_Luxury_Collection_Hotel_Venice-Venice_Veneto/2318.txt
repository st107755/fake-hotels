We stayed in the main building which is a piece of history (14th century palace). The interior is amazing and worth a visit even if you're not staying there. The lobby area is great. The location is fantastic (just a stones throw from Piazza San Marco).  The rooms are decorated in antique venetian style and the shuttered windows open onto an amazing view of venice's busy sea port   - quite an experience.  A bit noisy outside but the location is worth the noise in my opinion.
