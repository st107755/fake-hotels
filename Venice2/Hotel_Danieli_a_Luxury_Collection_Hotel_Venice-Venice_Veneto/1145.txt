Not only is the hotel beautiful (the kind where tourists come in the lobby just to LOOK and see what's inside), but the location is perfect for getting around anywhere by boat or on foot.  Dinner on the roof had the most amazing view, the decor was breath taking in our suite, and breakfast was a delicious way to start each day.
