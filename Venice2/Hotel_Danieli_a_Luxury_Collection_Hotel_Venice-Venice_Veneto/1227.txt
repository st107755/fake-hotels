Inside there is a grand staircase that has all the feeling of grandeur that you would expect in the home of a very wealthy family.  The view from the 5th floor terrace overlooking the harbour is stunning.  All meals are served every day on the terrace.  The evening meal is expensive but the ambience is worth it.
