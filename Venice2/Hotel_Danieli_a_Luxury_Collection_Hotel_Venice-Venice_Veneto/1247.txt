A very cool hotel in the heart of Venice with the most beautiful rooftop restaurant. The rooms are a bit dark with lots of red velvet but that's Venice! I loved the city and the hotel. Would love to go back. We booked through America. Express and were upgraded to a suite overlooking the grand canal.
