I personally made an account just to write about my experience here. The front desk was very welcoming however the servers at the restaurant made our experience very disappointing. We are foodies and go away with the hope of having the best food and service. Complete opposite of what we got. we were pretty much invisible and the food tasted like something I could get a 2 star hotel and it is completely overcharged. my recommendation eat at the local restaurants. the hotel is in my opinion creepy and old. the housekeeping was great. the elevator kept breaking,there were flies in our room, hotel is very hot, and most workers were unfriendly. I will not be returning to this hotel or restaurant because it is a 5 start hotel and we expected to be treated like it was 5 star
