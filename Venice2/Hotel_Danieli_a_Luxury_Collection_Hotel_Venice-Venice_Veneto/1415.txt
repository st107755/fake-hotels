What a fabulous place for a cocktail! They don't come cheap, but neither does this kind of ambience. If you want a deal, buy yourself some Prosecco and drink at home alone, but if you bourg it up a little GO, it won't disappoint. If you can afford to more than have a drink all else looks like it will not disappoint. Live life, and do it with lovely bits of luxury.
