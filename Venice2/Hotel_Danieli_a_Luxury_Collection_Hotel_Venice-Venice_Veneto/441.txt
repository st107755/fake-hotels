What a beautiful hotel!  My husband actually proposed to me here in 2005.  We loved our stay.  The hotel is central to the Square as well as within walking distance to all the amazing sites and restaurants.  Our room was beautiful and classy.  My favorite thing was the historic real key that goes into the lock.  We had high tea there and some amazing meals on their rooftop.  Canâ€™t wait to return again!
