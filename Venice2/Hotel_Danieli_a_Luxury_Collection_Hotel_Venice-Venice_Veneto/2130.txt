We recently stayed at the Hotel Danieli in Venice.  We spent the weekend here after a hectic trade show in Bologna.  We were greeted by a friendly, helpful staff.  Our junior suite was magnificent, facing the canal and the islands of Venice.  The hotel is lovely, certainly depicting old world charm and elegance.  The food at the rooftop restaurant was delicious, and the views were breathtaking, just stunning!  We would certainly return to the Danieli, and in fact, I can't wait to go back...
