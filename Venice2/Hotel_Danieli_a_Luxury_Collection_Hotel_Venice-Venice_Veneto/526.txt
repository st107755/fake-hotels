The most amazing feature is the open air rooftop restaurant overlooking the Grand Canal. Breakfast there every morning was wonderful. Located right next to St Marks Square so great location. Staff was excellent. Classic old palace with amazing internal art and architecture. If you want sleek and modern, this is not the place. Our room overlooked the canal and the larger windows and shutters opened. My only issue was the room was very dark, even with every light on. Also, no coffee maker (Local fire code).
