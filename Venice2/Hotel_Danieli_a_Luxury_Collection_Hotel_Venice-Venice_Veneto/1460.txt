My family and I came back here for tea (my parents stayed here for their honeymoon and 20th anniversary) we were expecting something quite special as it's a rather famous hotel. However we found the waiter was very surly and made a comment about 'the new world' when we asked whether they offered gluten free alternatives for my sister. We were informed they didn't offer gluten free food however we met a couple of ladies in the toilet who told us they did have gluten free alternatives (cakes etc..) in the main restaurant at breakfast! It would have been nice if this could have been offered.  For an expensive tea we expected a little more.. it made us glad we decided to stay in the much cheaper but more charming Hotel Flora.
