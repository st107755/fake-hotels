We booked a last minute break to Venice never having been there before, and arrived at the Danieli Hotel a little earlier than we were able to check in, no problem we left our luggage and went out to explore.  We returned a couple of hours later and were shown to a lovely room with an extra large bed and beautiful bedding.  The room had a dressing room, shower/bathroom with a basin, and a toilet with bidet and basin, lovely toiletries too.  Breakfast was absolutely fabulous with a gorgeous view from the dining room.  The hotel was very luxurious and the staff very professional, although drinks and dinner at the hotel were very expensive we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Danieli.
