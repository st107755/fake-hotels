Everything was perfect at this Hotel. We stayed at the Metropole a year ago, and there is no comparison. The Danieli was magnificient. The room was large and the front desk personell were very accomadating considering we checked in hours earlier than we were supposed to. The Breakfast was outstanding with anything you would want and top shelf all the way. The Dandolo Bar was really nice because the Piano Player/Singer was terrific, entertaining us for hours in the late evening. The only complaint was the concierge staff members who were a bit snooty. Would definitely return to this amazing hotel
