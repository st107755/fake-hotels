The Danieli is everything you would expect from a top class hotel in Venice. It seamlessly blends tradition with up to the minute amenities and impeccable service - and all 50 metres from St. Mark's Square.  ....and add to that the dining terrace with its panoramic views of the Grand Lagoon and across the city and you have a hospitality offering that's impossible to beat.
