The hotel is cute from the minute you walk in. The guys at the desk are very helpful and had our luggage brought to the room for us, as our room wasn't ready when we arrived. The elevators are super small but fun. The room is decorated and finished impeccably. Love the mirror, chandelier and the color of the walls. Really great location, so happy to be here.
