Wonderful staff.  The food is excellent and a high standard of cleanliness of the rooms.  Returned here for our 25th anniversary and have not regretted a single moment  The rooftop terrace is the best views in the city.  All the best sights are walking distance, bring good walking shoes/boots.  No need for a map just follow the yellow street signs.
