Spent 2 nights to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was a real treat. The hotel is beautiful and vibrant.....colours and history second to none. Service was excellent & birthday cake was a lovely touch. Need to mention Filippo (concierge) for the great advice and top service. Being in Venice during the festival / carnival really made the trip wonderful. Private water taxi from airport to hotel a must!!
