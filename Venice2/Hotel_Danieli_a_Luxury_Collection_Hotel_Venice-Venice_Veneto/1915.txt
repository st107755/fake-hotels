Well, what to say about The Danieli that is not already said ?  Centrally located old world charm and opulence dressed in stone,marble and velvet...

My best advice (I've been there 6 times) : go to Venice in winter, lucky if San Mark's Square is covered with snow or when Venice is flooded during the Aqua Alta, I lived both...that was really extraordinary!    Note that although The Danieli  is a palace, when Aqua Alta occurs, elevators are out of service and the lobby is flooded, so do not forget your rain boots because the hotel won't provide them, youâ€¦
