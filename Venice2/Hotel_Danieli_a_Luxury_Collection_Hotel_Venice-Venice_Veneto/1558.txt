Amazing hotel with some great features and the rooms are lovely and comfortable. We enjoyed our romantic visit here. It is very charming in character and gas several theme buildings we were in the red, they are all joined by a maze of walkways. The view from the roof top is spectacular by day or by night . the rooms are grand and stylish down to the last detail and it's close to the attractions and views as well as famous movie spots from don't look now, moon ranker the tourist and so on .    The hotel is fabulous
