We have never stayed 5 star before and this was a "once in a lifetime" for us. We are in our sixties and this stay was booked as a gift from our son (not a popstar or footballer, just a good son) We were a bit apprehensive as this was not our norm but on arrival the hotel was stunning and the staff were first class and were obviously very proud of their Hotel and very helpfull, we really were made to feel welcome. ( 2 cups of English tea Â£24 is not what we normally would expect but this really is what it claims to be = a 5 star excellent Hotel ) Oh well, we will cherish every moment of our stay and keep doing the lottery and who knows one day we might return. Thankyou Hotel Danieli.
