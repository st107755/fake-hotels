Happy to put a chocolate on your bed at night but NO irons allowed in rooms ( 15 euro to press one T Shirt ) NO Tea or Coffee facilities in room.  The hotel is shabby and needs a refurb! So dated!  I recognise an antique finish to scuffed woodwork and walls that Ned decorating.  At £500 a night for a basic room that’s not acceptable.   Book somewhere else on our walks the The Stern, The Centurion and The Cavalieri looks great - we won’t ever stay at Danieli again
