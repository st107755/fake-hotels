Doesn't get any better in terms of location. Loved the hotel staff - very friendly and helpful. Gorgeous rooms - comfy beds, unbelievably fast, free wifi. We had a view overlooking the skyline and others in the family had a view overlooking the water. Both were amazing. Breakfast on the terrace at the top was definitely a highlight. So good + amazing views!
