Left the Hotel Danieli this morning having stayed for 3 nights with my husband and son (aged 12).  Absolutely stunning hotel in the best location.  Yes it is expensive, but worth every penny.  Breakfast on the terrace with the best views of Venice.  Would highly recommend this hotel, staff always friendly and helpful.
