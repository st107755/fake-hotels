This is a grand hotel.  It is in the very best location in Venice.  If you seek a memorable, quintessential Venetian experience find it here.  The rooms are superbly appointed and the views to die for.  The rooftop restaurant is probably the most romantic I have ever enjoyed and the food was superb.  Not at all cheap but worth the cost if you want an amazing memory and not just a place to sleep.  Boarding a vaparetto at 5:30am off the hotel steps to cross the lagoon to the airport is still one of my favorite memories of Italy.  The natty doorman loading our bags for us and helping us into the boat...priceless.
