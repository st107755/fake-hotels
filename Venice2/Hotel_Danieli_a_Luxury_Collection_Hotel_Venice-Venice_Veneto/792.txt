The staff is very good and very attentive. The rooms and buildings are lovely. The only sad part was the arrival of two huge cruise ships coming in way too close to St. Marks Cathedral and the gondolas during breakfast. The ships ruin the atmosphere of beautiful Venice and its a wonder that the city allows it. I am sure the ships add pollution, crowds and water erosion to a place that can not handle anymore.
