There are individuals who expected more comfort in this five star hotel, but the history, locatipn, and ambiance that defines this establishment is what astounds me.  The location is close to central Venice.  One may take a stroll to the center of the town and listen to romantic music, have a simple evening meal, or just relax and reflect upon the people who have walked the streets and bought in the stores you visit.
