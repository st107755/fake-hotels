Just a great experience. As soon as you register they escort you to your room. Ours opened up to the water. Nice view, but there was not a way to keep the early sun coming into the room. Everyday there is a brunch with unlimited champagne on the roof over looking the water and busy boat traffic. Beautiful views and very romantic. Most people go to Venice to see the sights. We go to see each other. Great experience, but not cheap!   We will definitely return.
