A signature feature of this hotel is the bar/restaurant on the  rooftop terrace with spectacular views of the lagoon. However, on our arrival, there was a note in the room stating the terrace is closed for renovation until Spring 2009; This means the hotel has no outdoor space, very disappointing as the weather during our stay was beautiful!
