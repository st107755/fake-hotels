The hotel was definitely grand, without being too spacious. It had a nice balance between the level of luxury provided by its architecture and design, and the level of cosiness of the hotel.   Upon arrival, our bags were immediately taken from us by a friendly bellboy and was checked-in by a lovely receptionist. From listening to the other receptionists staying at the hotel, it seemed that they were able to speak a range of European languages which helped the non-English/Italian customers. We were personally guided by the receptionist to our room who also showed us the room's facilities.   As it was our mother's birthday, we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne of excellent quality. The hotel room was very quaint and traditional. We had an amazing view on the topâ€¦
