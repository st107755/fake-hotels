Fantastic location.   Beautiful terrace for breakfast.  Charming lobby/palazzo interior (if you're in the old part).   But it stops there.     The rooms are standard Italian size - cosy. The decor is "typical" Venetian/Italian. Kind of like Liberace threw up everywhere.   You cannot have an evening drink without a dinner reservation on the terrace after 6 pm - I kid you not.   You can have a drink in the downstairs lobby bar. Fine for the winter but who wants to sit in a fireplace-laden, crushed velvet upholstered room in 25 degree heat?  Room service stops at 10.30.   Again, not what you would expect for a 5* hotel. My fiancée wanted to eat a light snack after a show, circa 10.50 pm.   "No possiamo".  So I got one myself.   Pizzeria was one minute away and the pizzaiolo got me…
