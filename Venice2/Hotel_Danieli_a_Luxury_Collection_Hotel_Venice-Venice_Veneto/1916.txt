We recently stayed at the Hotel Danieli and had a fantastic experience! Great central location, our room was well appointed and very comfortable and the staff very service oriented. Dining on the patio, with it's awesome view of the Grand Canal, was a real treat. We will definately return to experiece the charm of this hotel.
