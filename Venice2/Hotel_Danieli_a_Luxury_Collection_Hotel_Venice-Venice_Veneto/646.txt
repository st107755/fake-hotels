One of Venice's premier properties, the Danieli is adjacent to the Doge's palace and St. Mark's square. The location serves as a perfect hub for public transportation, water taxis, and gondola rides. Great starting point for a Venetian walk. The suites are great- spacious and clean and well kept, especially considering the building's age and history as a palace. Dining on the rooftop offer great food and incomparable views. The bell staff and concierge team make your visit go smoothly. Highly recommended!
