Before our recent tour of Italy i read some reviews and i felt not so sure about this hotel,any way we booked for 3 nights,on arrival we had the pleasure of a guided tour of the hotel and to see the fantastic Doge suite,excellent!!!we stayed in the main building,a beautiful room in every sense absolutely superb!!excellent service in every department from the reception to the bar etc.we spent some lovely late evenings relaxing at the bar for a drink while listening the live music by a nice gentleman from Florence (very good).A very special place,
