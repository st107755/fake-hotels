The Danieli is a one-of-a-kind, historical hotel located in the heart of Venice., right on the Grand Canal near St. Mark’s Square.  Proximity to St. Mark’s Square in my opinion wasn’t a negative – it was fun!  It allows great access by walking to some really cool spots and neighborhoods, including the Rialto for shopping and the Dorsoduro for the Peggy Guggenheim Museum.  It’s also really close to the two main Biennale locations (you can walk to these as well).  All in all, I loved the location!!   The breakfast on the roof overlooking the Grand Canal was also fabulous.  One of the best views in Venice!  And the breakfast service and food were excellent too.  A lot of different food options, fresh fruit, and wonderful coffee and cappuccinos.   Mmmmmm !!  I recommend paying for…
