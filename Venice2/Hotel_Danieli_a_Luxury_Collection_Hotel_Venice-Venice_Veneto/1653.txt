My wife and I spent 5 days at Hotel Danieli.   We booked a lagoon view room and requested a room in the original palace building.     The hotel accommodated our request even during one of their busy seasons which made our Carnivale visit even more special.     The original building is beautiful, but it is need of some TLC (some water damage from the glass roof, etc).    The concierge desk was helpful and got to know us by sight.  Would agree with others that the breakfast is not fantastic if you had to pay separately for it, and the maitre'd there was very rude (although the other staff in the restaurant was helpful)  Overall, a great visit and would recommend the Danieli.
