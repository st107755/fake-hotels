I was a bit hesitant about this place after reading all the reviews about the service but I am happy to report we did not encounter that at all. The service from checking in to the concierge and the restaurant were all wonderful.  To start, we were welcomed to an upgraded room and prosecco (due to my Starwood status). We also opted for the free breakfast as my amenity which is well worth it since it's 39 Euro per person otherwise. The view from the restaurant is amazing.  The concierge desk is very busy but they were helpful with our needs and requests. Overall a wonderful stay in a beautiful and enchanting city and hotel.
