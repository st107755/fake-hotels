Danieli was our favorite hotel out of three we stayed at while in Italy. The staff is very polite and the level of comfort of the rooms is excellent. The restaurant had wonderful breakfast buffet options. The two reasons I held back the fifth star are: 1. The key logistics were annoying. We had to drop off these archaic keys with the concierge each time we left the hotel and had to wait at the desk to retrieve them when we returned. 2. When we were leaving the bellhop took 30+ minutes to bring our bags down and we were running late for a train.
