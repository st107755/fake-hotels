Fabulous hotel in the centre of Venice which was full of character and charm. Get up early to have breakfast on the balcony as the cruise ships go past, which is breathtaking. Hotel is a bit prices but worth it for a special occasion. It would have been five out five, but the hotel lost our bags and couldn't find them for three hours.
