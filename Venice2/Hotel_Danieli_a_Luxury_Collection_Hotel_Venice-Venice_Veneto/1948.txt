Spent two nights in a nice room.  The location is excellent, it is historic, and the staff we encountered were super.  We had a lovely room overlooking the Doge's Palace.  The bar was a great place to unwind and room service was efficient and very good. We would highly recommend as a location convenient to St Marks.
