Daneili is a landmark, a hotel reminiscent of an era that has gone by. The location is the best, a few steps away from the Douge's palace, the main Basilica and St. Marco Square where it all happens. From the moment you enter you are surrounded by grace and pure indulgence. The classic Venetian red velvet is offset with beautiful objects d'art. This historic property has bathrooms in beautiful Carrara marble and onyx.  The rooms are comfortable and the service impeccable. The concierge will do all it takes to make your trip to venice a memorable one.   The breakfast on the terrace with breathtaking views of the city is a great way to start the day. I couldn't ask for more and hope to do this again sometime.
