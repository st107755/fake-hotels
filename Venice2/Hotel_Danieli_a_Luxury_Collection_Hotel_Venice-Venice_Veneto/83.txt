To whom it may concern,  we have visited the Hotel Danieli for the third time in a past years. Although the service was always average, we liked the atmosphere and beauty of this property. This time, however, I experienced the worst service and unprofessional behavior that convinced me to open a TripAdvisor account and write about my experience.  To start with something positive, the check-in went smooth and the lady at the front desk behaved very professionally. Since then, there was no longer a 5* service ..   When we arrived at 3 pm, we went for a small lunch at the restaurant terrace, where we were not really greeted with a smile .. We sat up and the table was literally moving as one of the table leg had no support from floor. We kindly asked to put something under the tableâ€¦
