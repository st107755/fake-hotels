This is one of those hotels where you must throw budgetary caution to the winds.  If you plan on staying at the Hotel Danieli, know that it will likely stretch your pocket book  and leave you feeling slightly uncomfortable.  But it's well worth the initial discomfort, considering the exquisite views, central location, and top notch staff.  This hotel will take you back to medieval Venice with its graceful columns, wooden floors and remnants of antiquity found in the tapestries, art and antiques that adorn the palazzo.   Go ahead, splurge!  Have a drink at the bar (where The Tourist was filmed).  Take in the sensational view from the deck just off of the restaurant.   It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.
