We did not stay at this hotel on our recent trip to Venice, but did have lunch here. We did arrive without a reservation and were told to take the elevator up to the terrace. We were shown to a sunny table and the view of Venice and the island of San Giorgio Maggiore was breathtaking. We ordered drinks and my husband was served his. Fifteen minutes later, I still did not have my wine. I asked again. This pattern continued throughout the lunch-when all the while we were surrounded by 5 waiters who were doing nothing. This property charges a 12 euro person  add on-just for the pleasure of being there. There are other historical sites in Venice where you can see this view for free. This property is riding on its location and there is an arrogance which does not make for a welcomingâ€¦
