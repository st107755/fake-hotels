A sumptuous, luxurious classic. Don't even bother looking at your bill--it is expensive, yes, but well worth it so why ruin your stay by even looking ay the prices (which are no different than NYC, Paris, Tokyo). Fabulous brunch. Lovely service, tons of history and a great location to get out and roam, grab some chicetti and just enjoy. Arriving by water taxi is a must--my kids felt like stars in a James Bond film (or maybe that was me!). And they certainly will always remember it! I had them watch The Tourist for some great interior shots. True, our 2 bedroom suite could probably use some updating but my fear is that it would spoil it so I was happy the way it was. And their rooftop bar away from the crowds is a great spot for an Aperol! Always a favorite!
