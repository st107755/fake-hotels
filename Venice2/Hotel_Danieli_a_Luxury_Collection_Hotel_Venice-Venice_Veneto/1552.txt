My son (14) and I chose the Danieli because it is a Venice icon.  But it was far more than that. Our (premium deluxe) room was old and traditional yet very clean; it wasn't a large room, but absolutely okay and comfortable, and surprisingly light - the bathroom too was large enough for Mom and son to share.  The side-canal view was better than expected, and we even had a small balcony and enjoyed watching the many gondolas pass by. Sure they were singing and the tourists could be heard, but hey - you're in Venice. The hotel personnel was friendly and helpful, with the known Italian "dignity". The lobby was very comfortable and plush, and we enjoyed just lounging, having a cocktail and watching the busy hotel reception after a busy day at the islands.  The location is gorgeousâ€¦
