This was our 4th trip to Venice and each time I'm still in awe of this beautiful place.  In the past we have stayed in B & B's that are usually down a quite little alley, however this time we opted for Hotel Danieli.  I know there are different sections to stay in this hotel, which means the rooms were a bit different based on which part of the hotel you stayed at.  The room was very large, elegant and more than spacious ( 5th floor/West Side).   It was a suite and with my husband being a Starwood Member, this was part of our upgrade.  The view wasn't much to brag about, but when In Venice the only time I was in my room was to sleep.  The breakfast on the terrace was good with a nice variety, and the view was amazing.  Unfortunately when you left to get another plate "the birds"â€¦
