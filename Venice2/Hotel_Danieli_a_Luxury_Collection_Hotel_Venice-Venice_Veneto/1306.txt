Very impressive building, beautiful lobby, flowers, pure luxury. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated and comfortable. The view from the restaurant on the top is breathtaking, very relaxing to sit and watch Venice wake up or its livelihood.  Unfortunately, the bathroom air conditioning did not work and it was very hot and humid. I had to open the window but it was equally hot and not very pleasant. They did tell me at the reception that they are working to fix it, but obviously did not manage to do so. That's why the room was not ready when I arrived an hour later than checking in time. I did not make fuss over it, I was staying only for one night, but to pay that much money for this hotel one would expect full comfort (hence staying there!).
