The location of this hotel is superb.  Firstly, we arraived by boat and went straight into reception - we were undercover all the way, which was nice as it just started to rain en route.  The view from our room at the front was overlooking the lagoon and it was constantly changing - boats everywhere!  You then remember that the whole life of this city is based on water and it was so different to see children going to school by boat, laundry bags being taken by water, rubbish removed by boat and food and drinks delivered by boat too!  The Doge's Palace was very close and also, St Mark's Square, so it was very easy to reach all the sights.  The Concierge desk staff were very helpful and knowledgeable.  The service was very good and the breakfasts were of an extremely high standardâ€¦
