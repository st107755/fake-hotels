The lobby was incredible, and I loved the little detail with the keys, but the actual room left something to be desired. The room seemed to be worn down, and the dark wallpaper made the room seem smaller than it was- I think some renovations are in order.  The concierge was very helpul and the hotel is in a great location. Some people on our tour had better rooms than we did, so you may want to ask for a renovated room when you book.
