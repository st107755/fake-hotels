The Danieli is a destination in its own right.  The lobby and upstairs bar are stunning - steeped in history and romance.  Unfortunately, so are its prices.  The rooms are nice - a standard room with the Starwood Gold upgrade was comfortable, but with no view.  Its worth a look, but you can do more for your money.
