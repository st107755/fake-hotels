Stayed at the Hotel Danieli for 3 nights prior to a cruise with the whole family. I'd booked 3 sperate rooms and requested them all on the same floor. When we arrived, by water taxi, we were treated like gold by the staff. The check in was very quick and efficient, and we were all on the same floor in the same hallway. The hotel is a beatuiful example of old world charm and new world conveniences. The concierge was very helpful and answered all of our questions. Would I stay here again ? In a heartbeat.
