Our four night stay at this hotel was wonderful. The location of the hotel couldn't be better; it is a stone's throw from St Mark's Square and is right by the lagoon! The hotel lobby is beautiful and we had a surprisingly large room with a view over the lagoon. The room decor was old world charm and was very tasteful. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The front desk staff was very friendly. We had both breakfast and dinner at the terrace restaurant. The view is amazing, which made the experience great but service was rather slow. At breakfast, sparrows kept landing on the tables - rather off putting! If you're looking for a romantic hotel right by St Mark's Square, then this is the place for you!
