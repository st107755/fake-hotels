I thought the appearance of this hotel was sensational. The lobby and rooms were something that I have never seen before, so traditional but still clean and comfortable. I think the concierge staff were slightly on the rude side and when paying so much money for the hotel, I wouldve expected better service from staff. Aside from this,the location of the hotel was good. Just a short walk from the main square and with easy reach of water taxis and buses. It was around 10 minutes from the Piazzale Roma where we dropped off our hire car, and around 20 minutes from the airport, both by water taxi.
