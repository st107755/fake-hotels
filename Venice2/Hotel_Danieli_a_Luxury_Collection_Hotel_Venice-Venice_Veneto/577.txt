Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is very centrally located. You have to go by boat only. It is a very old and beautiful hotel. We reached there by 3.30 pm , well after check in time. Our room was not ready for another hour. They seem to be understaffed for the peak season. They alloted us rooms facing the lagoon. However it was very small and poorly maintained. They were kind enough to give us rooms in the new block. Though the view was nothing great the rooms were large and well equipped. The restaurant on the terrace is really awesome. The service there was very good. I would have given it excellent rating but for the unfriendly people at the concierge. When I  asked him whether they have any brochure for day trips he was quite rude. He said curtly that everyone booksâ€¦
