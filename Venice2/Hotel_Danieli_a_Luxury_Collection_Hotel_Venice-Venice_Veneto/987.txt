I have no words to describe how I felt when I visited this beautiful and unique hotel , it's amazing i enjoyed everything , the room were beautiful , the view from the terrace it's mind blowing , I enjoyed my delicious breakfast looking to that amazing view of Venice . I can't forget the bar the drinks are really nice , the guy who play piano just makes the atmosphere even better . I can't wait to go back there again . One of the best hotel that I have ever being . Really recommend it .
