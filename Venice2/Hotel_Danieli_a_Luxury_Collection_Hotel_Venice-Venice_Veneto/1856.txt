My son and I stayed here in August.  We found a good deal on Expedia, otherwise we could not have afforded to stay here.  The lobby is beautiful as are the bar and staircases.  Our room was charming and spacious complete with Murano glass chadelier! The staff were helpful and competent.  It was our second trip to Venice and staying here was amazing!  We went to the Lido on the private motor launch shared with the Hotel Excelsior which made the trip out ever so much more delightful than public vaporetto.
