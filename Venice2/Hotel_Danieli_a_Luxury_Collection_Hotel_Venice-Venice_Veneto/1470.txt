we were recently staying with Hotel Danieli for two nights and it was just amazing. Firstly, without doubt, it has the best of the best location in Venice. The view from your room is unbelievable nice and we are lucky to have our balcony. All fantastic. You must try the restaurant on the top unfortunetely we are not able to sit on the terrace as it is winter but we are looking forward to come back next time in summer. Breakfast you can NOT give a miss. Amazing food quality and top class service crew. Timeless is the legacy if you think hotel is old yes but just amazing and classic , that you are looking for in Venice right ? Hotel is greatly located 2 mins walking to Piazza San Marco and in front of hotel just a few step it is the water bus station taking you to Murano and Branoâ€¦
