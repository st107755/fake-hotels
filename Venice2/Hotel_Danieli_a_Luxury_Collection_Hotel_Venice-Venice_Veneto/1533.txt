This is my every favourite hotel in Venice. Apart from being really beautiful inside, it is very well located being on Venice Island. The rooms at the front in the old part of the hotel are amazing, although they can be noisy as many of the day trippers disembark their boats at piers located outside the hotel.    It is a very romantic Venetian hotel and the restaurant is lovely.   Finally, the only way to arrive at and depart from the Danieli is by water taxi. It's magical!
