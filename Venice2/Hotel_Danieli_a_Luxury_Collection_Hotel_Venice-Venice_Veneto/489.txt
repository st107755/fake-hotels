The hotel was headlined a five star hotel great views from the terrace, impeccable service and a very helpful concierge. We tried several restaurants at the recommendation of the concierge. The junior suite was excellent only marred by the early morning trash disposal. Highly comfortable bed, great buffet breakfast and good dinner  menu. Location to die for right on the opening to the Grand Canal and within easy reach of everything you need to see.
