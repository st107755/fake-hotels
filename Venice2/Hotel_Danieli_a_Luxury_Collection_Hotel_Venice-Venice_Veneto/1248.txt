stayed here for two night in august , i was upgraded to a beautiful room overlooking the lagoon / the beds are very comfortable .staff are extremely helpful .  in my circumstances i found the hotel to be very dark but my eyesight depends on light so it was not very suitable for me  personally .  there is a lack of bathroom amenities for a 5 star hotel such as cotton buds etc . i was not impressed with the breakfast. not much choice in the hot section . i though it very expensive for a diet coke on the balcony bar 14 euros when down stairs at the bar was half this price  just paying for a view yes i can understand paying this price if you are not a paying guest at the hotel but when you ae staying there then get this  price just for a view i don't think this is justifiable andâ€¦
