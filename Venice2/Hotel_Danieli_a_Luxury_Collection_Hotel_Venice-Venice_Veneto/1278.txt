The decision to stay at hotel danieli was the only right thing to do. We decided spontaneously to visit Venice and to stay over night. From the second we entered the hotel( wich besides is one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen. So rich in details you seem to be back in the days of old)where we were welcomed so warmly and most friendly up to the little tour we got whilst being brought up to the breathtaking beautiful room. It was a more than perfect experience! Even though we definitely stayed way to short to be able to benefit of all the outstanding services and restaurants offered in this hotel, having breakfast on the terrace with a view beyond belief was that precious with all the friendly staff around that we, by then, really felt sorry to leave. Thank you soâ€¦
