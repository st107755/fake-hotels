Stayed for 2 nights as part of a tour to the Dalmatian coast. Also stayed here in my previous visit to Venice 2 years ago.  What can I say, this hotel is absolutely amazing. It has character and charm like no other.  Breakfast each morning on the rooftop terrace is a must as the stunning view is jaw dropping.  My personal favourite hotel in Venice and will be the only hotel I stay in in the future.
