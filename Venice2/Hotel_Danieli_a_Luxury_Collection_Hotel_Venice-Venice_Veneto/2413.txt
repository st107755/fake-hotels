This hotel needs a total overhaul! The rooms are dated and in poor condition (torn carpeting, chipped and dirty paint) and the staff is indifferent to their guests. I've heard they are closing soon to renovate...save your money and stay elsewhere until they improve the condition of the rooms and invest in training for their staff.
