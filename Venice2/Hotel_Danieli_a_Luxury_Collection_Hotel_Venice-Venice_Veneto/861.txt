We visit Danieli 8/28-8/28 it was absolutely beautiful!!! Our room had an amazing view of the water. When we first got to our room there was a almond bday cake and champaign which was amazing it was for my 40th bday. That evening i needed to iron my husbands cloths and they brought an iron right to the room. The gym was great too and the best breakfast and american coffee we had through out our trip!!! Venice was beautiful and hands down will return to this hotel!!!
