Seeing The Danieli, you appreciate old hotels again above all the modern same same hotels. Creaking floors, pink marble, high ceilings, chandeliers , are all amazing. You can still feel the craftmanship that made this place so long ago. Attention to detail and style. It is a museum inside a hotel with the hotel itself to see and exhibitions, very stylish of art in the corridors.  Of course on top the excellent location, great terrace on top floor with magnificent views , excellent food and waiters who know what they are doing. Go Venice, Go Danieli.
