Had booked a deluxe room and was upgraded on arrival to a luxury room with lagoon views over San Giorgio Maggiore which was breathtaking.  It really was luxury and it ay not sound much but they have the most comfortable pillows ensuring a good sleep. The staff are polite and helpful and reflect the hotel standard.  The cocktails in bar dandolo are very very pricy and also very potent!  A perfect stay and is definitely to be recommended
