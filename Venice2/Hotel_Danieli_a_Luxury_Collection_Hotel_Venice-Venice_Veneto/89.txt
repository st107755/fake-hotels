Not the 5 star experience I expected.  Never received turndown, took 3 hours and 4 phone calls to get our baggage up to our room, checkin was slow.  Checkout was a disaster that I still have to deal with upon my return home.  I booked 2 rooms both had the same rate at checkout one room was 90 more than the other and the front desk clerk told me only reservations could make any changes even after I showed her the confirmation.   On the plus side lobby bar service was exceptional.
