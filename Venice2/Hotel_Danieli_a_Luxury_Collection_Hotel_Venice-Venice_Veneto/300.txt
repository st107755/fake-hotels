The Hotel Danieli is a five star hotel located in the center of Venice. If you don't want to pay the price for the rooms, just go to the roof top bar for a somewhat expensive drink and a truly exceptional view.  There just seem to be many roof top options in Venice, so this one is quite unique. The service is on par with the 5 stars, the wine list is exceptional. It makes for a great experience in Venice.
