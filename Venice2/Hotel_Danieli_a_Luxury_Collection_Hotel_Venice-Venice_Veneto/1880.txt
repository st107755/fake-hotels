I first stayed in this hotel with my family and vowed to return on my honeymoon.  The Danieli is quintessentially Venetian and has been updated enough to keep it fresh, but not so much that its character has been destroyed (much more character than your typical Starwood hotel).  Our room was beautiful--I kept waiting for Casanova to tap at the window.  Breakfast on the roof is a lovely experience.
