If you want to feel old Venice: close your eyes, don't think about the price, and just book a room at Danieli. It worth it. The view you will get on the Grand Canal is amazing, the room nicely decorated, the bathroom all in marble... ok, the you will probably hate the bed, but you are not in Venice for sleeping.   The breakfast is amazing also. Be ready to keep your eyes closed when you pay the 80 euros bill, eat well, enjoy the view and try to remember this moment forever.
