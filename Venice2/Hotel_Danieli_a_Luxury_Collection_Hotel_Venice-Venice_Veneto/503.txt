My parents and I stayed in the Hotel Danieli October 4-6, 2017.  We accidentally left two brand new purses (that we just bought three days prior) in our room when we checked out.  We reported it to the hotel and they said that no one found them.  They were not sympathetic or helpful in attempting to resolve the issue.  Security should be a priority, and we would have expected so much more from a luxury hotel.
