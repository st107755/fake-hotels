Great location and the property is stunning from the minute you enter. Lobby, stairway and rooms are impressive. However, the service failed to live up to the standard. Failure to answer bellman calls, invisible couple we were in the bar.(where 4 drinks was $90.00 usd)  Really made us feel as though if we did not look like she Che Che guests that are their primary audience, we were then not worthy.
