We started with a private gondola which pulls up to the front door. The rooms were spacious and clean. The Amex platinum upgrade helped. If you take money out of the picture. This place was awesome. We walked to it all. Only seconds from St Mark's Square. The breakfast on the roof top porch was a great start for each day. If you go you must splurge. It's worth it.
