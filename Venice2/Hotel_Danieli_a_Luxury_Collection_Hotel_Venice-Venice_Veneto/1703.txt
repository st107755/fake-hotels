We stayed here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and it is one of the best hotels I have ever visited. Our room was fabulous, room service, staff and restaurant were all excellent, totally 5* in my opinion. We also had a room on the front looking right over the water which had the most fantastic view. Incredibly expensive but definitely worth it for a special occasion.
