Stayed 3 nights at the glorious Danieli in Venice through Citalia. I was unaware of the hotel and chose it as we had previously had a fab holiday at a Starwood luxury hotel (Blue Palace, Crete). My children then reminded me about the hotel's starring role in The Tourist!  The Danieli fulfilled all my expectations, and yes it is true tourists drop in just to experience the lobby! A fantastic situation, glorious views over the Grand Canal,wonderful staff. However it is very expensive, breakfast E39, minibar : small water E8. Venice is awesome but to stay at the Danieli makes you feel part of that history, with so many wonderful public rooms to wander through and such lovely bedrooms It really is the icing on the cake!
