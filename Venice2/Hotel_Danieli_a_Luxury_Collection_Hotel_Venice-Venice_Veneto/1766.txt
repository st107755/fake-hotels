The Danieli has two main selling points over that of other hotels in Venice.  The first is its incredible history as a Palace and I can honestly say I've never stayed anywhere quite like it.  The second is that its located very close to St. Mark's Square and has a fabulous view from the open air terrace restaurant on the top floor, you can enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner while admiring the lagoon and hustle and bustle of tourists and the river, its simply incredible.  The rooms are grand and you can certainly see how it was once a Palace as its very ornate.  The bed was huge, probably the largest bed I've stayed in at a hotel, very comfortable.  The only downside was that we weren't able to have a lagoon facing room, as they were all reserved a long time ago.  That was a shameâ€¦
