We went to Venice for our honeymoon in late March this year taking our 18 month old little girl. The Danieli is a beautiful hotel, the staff are extremely helpful (nothing is too much trouble) and they love children.   The location of the hotel is perfect you are really in the centre of everything. It is expensive though - make sure you book a package with breakfast included we did thankfully!   2 alcoholic drinks at the bar was £26.  But all of Venice is expensive to eat and drink. Unfortunately the terrace restaurant was being rennovated whilst  we where there but I think it's due to open in the summer 08. We got a water taxi to the Hotel on our way out (good fun) , but got the Water bus on return (much cheaper) & you are right by one of the stops so very easy to do. Wonder…
