An historic hotel with a beautiful lobby (a great photo oportunity), and what must be the best location in Venice.  An excellent base from which to explore Venice.  Our room was in the refurbished section and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast on the terrace was really lovely. Reception staff very helpful but because the hotel has so many people staying overnight for cruises etc, the demand on reception is very high and you can have a wait for booking in etc.  On the downside, the drinks and a la carte were very pricey. However there are some nice restaurants down the back streets from the hotel if you want a  more low key relaxing holiday with 'tourist' menus from around 18euros for three courses (e.g. Alla Conchiglia, Castello 4990).  One point: try to get a room onâ€¦
