What a fantastic hotel with fantastic staff in a fantastic position. We got upgraded to a superior double which was beautiful. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and polite. All of the little touches made it feel truly special. Very well equipped for the morning flood in reception and the hotel never smelt of the water. Would go back in a flash and recommend to anyone going ðŸ’œ
