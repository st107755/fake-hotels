Just came home from attending the Carnivale in Venice.  The city was packed!!  It was crowded everywhere.  It was fun and it was not.  Very difficult to get around.  Part of our celebration was to attend an event at the Hotel Danieli.  It was for dessert + Cottillion for about 100 Euro.  There were only three kinds of desserts and they weren't good.  You could buy betters ones at a nearby bakery/deli for less than 20 euro!  They held the event in their lobby/bar area which turned out to be very small of a space for their dance lessons.  It was cramped and not all attendees got to dance.  The lady partner of the instructor discouraged the single ladies from joining because you needed a partner.  This event was way too expensive and dull.  I would choose another event next time.
