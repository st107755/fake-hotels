There was nothing more that the Danieli could have done to make our time in Venice any more perfect. They have an exceptional multilingual staff who can answer any question and jump at the opportunity to provide exceptional service. Without us asking, we were provided with a cake for my son's birthday. The breakfast buffet was OUTSTANDING with breathtaking views of the Grand Canal. Being just a short walk from Basilica Di San Marco, the Danieli arguably has the best location in all of Venice. Rooms were gorgeous with an antique charm and my stay in Venice is filled with great memories largely because of the Danieli
