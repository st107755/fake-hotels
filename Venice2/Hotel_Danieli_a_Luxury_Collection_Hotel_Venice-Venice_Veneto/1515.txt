The hotel is remarkable!!  The service is delivered in an elegant and welcoming manner. The hotel is a real Venetian palazzo (palace) with preserved but recently updated beautiful interiors. It has a traditional side entrance if you arrive by water taxi.  The rooms are truly luxurious. If you don't stay here at least walk into the lobby to see what you are missing.  The restaurant (where breakfast  is served) is on the roof with a stunning view directly over the Grand Canal.  I hope when I get to heaven that it is this fantastic.
