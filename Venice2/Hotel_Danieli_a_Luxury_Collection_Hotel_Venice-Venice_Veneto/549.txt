We had a 2 night stay at the Danieli.  The reception staff and concierge were excellent.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The location was exceptional; it is located next to the Palace, St Marks Square and the Basilica, so location wise it is perfect.  The view from the terrace and from our the room is excellent.  However, the restaurant is not at the same standard as the hotel, both food and service level; I will not have dinner there again but breakfast is good and service good.
