I spent 2 nights in Venice.  I am an SPG Platinum member.  And I never spend the time to write reviews as I am really busy.  I'm doing a review for the 1st time because the Danelli was an amazing experience.    I had booked my 1st night at the Gritti Palace, and was going to decide where to spend my 2nd night (great thing about the low season).  I had originally planned to stay a 2nd night in Gritti Palace as I didn't enjoy the hassle of moving hotels.    When I visited the Danelli, my partner and I felt that we liked the ambience, energy of the hotel more.  The Gritti Palace was more serious and located in a good and more quiet part of town.  But the atmosphere was more sombre and serious, the staff were formal and serious.  At the Danelli, the staff felt more approachable,â€¦
