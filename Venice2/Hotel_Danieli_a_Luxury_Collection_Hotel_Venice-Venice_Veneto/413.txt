Did not stay at this hotel. Only stopped by for a drink. The drinks were very expensive but well made. My husband enjoyed his Vesper martini. The Gondola martini was also good but pricey at 22 euros.They also provided nice snacks. We had to leave the lobby bar by 6 because the high tide will be flooding the lobby. My husband went back around 8 to take a picture and it was flooded.
