After years of wanting to visit Venice, I finally made it. As it was a significant birthday I wanted to go to the best hotel and I wasn't disappointed. It is so beautiful. So close to just about everything; St. Mark's square is two minutes away and the Doge's palace next door. The room was very spacious with a wonderful bathroom and a dressing room. When we return to Venice we will stay here again, definitely.
