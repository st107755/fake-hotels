The Hotel Danieli is house in a beautiful building which is in itself a work of art and contains beautiful paintings and mirrors. It is a pleasure to walk around the building. The hotel is located close to the Piazza San Marco and therefore close to many tourist sites and shopping. It is also close to the San Zaccaria boat stop. Breakfast in the rooftop restaurant is a great treat. As Platinum members we received an upgrade to a suite. We would love to return. While water taxis are expensive, the hotel has a private dock and it is a great way to go to the airport or train station. And there is also public boat service from nearby to/from both the train station and airport, so that is also an option.  There was no coffee maker in the room, nor available in the foyer. I do wishâ€¦
