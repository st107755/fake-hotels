This historic hotel is a must do in Venice, in my opinion. It just beautiful - go upstairs and look down from the restaurant gallery - art! We love the bar in particular , and the piano player especially! the bar staff are warm and friendly , and we sat for hours drinking cocktails and people watching! The drinks are gorgeous too! Small downsides are the lifts , which need some attention, and the slightly grubby guest toilets in reception - they need a lick of paint, and some toiletries.lets you down against an otherwise most glamorous location..
