It's funny to read the comments of people who have not appreciated this hotel.  I returned there last week after several years away to find it as close to perfection as ever.  Superb service; delightful public rooms; great bedroom. Why do so many people not llike it? I suspect it's that at such an expensive place, some travellers expect more extrovert, in your face luxury and obsequiousness among the staff, whereas here everything is done in the best possible taste, which means understated....which those not used to good things often interpret as reserved or even aloof.   Only one small gripe: breakfast coffee could be improved (a minor niggle it shares with its sister hotel, the Excelsior in Florence).
