This is a beautiful hotel. They decorated it for Carnival and spared no expense. It is a quarter mile from San Marco Plaza. The staff was very attentive to all our needs.  The rooms were spacious and thoroughly cleaned each day.  My only complaint was the breakfast they served.  The food was second rate compared to other hotels I've stayed in in Venice. I was just not impressed with any of the food.  Also, the drinks at the bar are kind of steep; $20 for a mixed drink. Knowing that, I would stay here again.
