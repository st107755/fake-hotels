We've wanted to stay here for some time so we were absolutely delighted that it truly delivered the experience we'd hoped for. We had a beautiful room overlooking the lagoon, and were able to sit on the balcony (Yes in March!) and watch the world go by along the waterfront. Our room had been recently renovated and very nicely so, all in keeping with its environment and history. The bed was 1st class ...and some. Breakfast on the terrace was a delight, with a glass of Prosecco to start the day with some fizz. Food and drink were astonishingly pricey, even for Venice, but the atmosphere is priceless. I think you can tell that we liked it...
