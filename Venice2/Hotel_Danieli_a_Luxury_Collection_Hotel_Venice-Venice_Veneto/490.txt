As SPG members, we have been sampling hotels and restaurants around the world, and Hotel Danieli will be added to our favorites list if/when we return to Venice.  Our four-day stay was superb and our room looked out over the water and was as elegant as the hotel itself.  Despite an October visit, the density of tourists was, at times, overwhelming.

A warm welcome by the Reception Staff, and the ease of having our boat pull right up to the hotel's side entrance, both coming and going, minimized bag-drag trauma that most people face in Venezia.  Well done to the bar and lobby staff as well -- always welcoming and helpful, we enjoyed morning espresso's, eveningâ€¦
