The Hotel Danieli provided a first class experience for us.  rom the time we arrived, we felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean, neat and in perfect working order... the service quick and efficient... the location could not have been better.  We will certainly be back!  The breakfast buffet in the Terrace Restorante was a highlight every morning.  Beautiful view and plentiful food options.  (I admit that this is a HUGE benefit of platinum Starwood Status as the "regular" price in 39 Eur per person per day.)  Likewise, we had one beautiful dinner at the Terrace Restourant -- which was amazing.  Watching the sun go down while we enjoyed a beautiful dinner was very memorable.  Best of all, the staff didn't rush us at all, and let us enjoy a true leisure dinner.  Thank youâ€¦
