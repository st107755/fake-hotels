I stayed at this hotel 49 years ago. Then it was the Hotel Royal Danieli Excelsior. Yes it is expensive. We stayed in a large room on the second floor facing the grand canal. The interior is a picture of elegance. The Terrazza Danieli restaurant is $$$$$$ but the service, food and view were worth the splurge. A bottle of champagne was in our room. We thought that the concierge could have been more friendly and was not helpful with our computer problems to print the boarding pass. If we go back to Venice: we will stay at the Danieli.
