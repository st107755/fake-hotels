This is so far my favorite hotel in Venice. The Architecture of the hotel as well as the painting and style of ancient Venice can be feel everywhere. This was the perfect moment to ask my love to be engage in a Gondola witch was organize by the hotel at the very last minute. Thanks for Everything and many thanks to Antonello!
