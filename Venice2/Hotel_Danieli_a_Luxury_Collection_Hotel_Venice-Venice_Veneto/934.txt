We stayed for two nights at Danieli and were welcomed by a lovely staff. Our room was in the new section facing the water, very spacious and excellent air conditioning which is a must in July. The hotel and rooms are beautiful old world Venetian style and we loved it. Bathrooms are gracious, rooms are complete with all needs met.  Breakfast was included for our stay and the best ever!  Eaten on the roof top restaurant with beautiful views. Bar and restaurant expensive but beautiful. Concierge service amazing. Took very good care of us. Gave us best advice on us as individual couple rather than just tourists as a whole. Location was superb...could easily find our way back and right next to the Zapparorto (sic) which was fun to take to Murano and back. (#7)
