Fourth trip to beautiful Venice and very, very disappointed with our stay at the Danieli which is rated as 5 star (should be rated 3 star) and does not compare to the Bauer where we stayed on our last trip to Venice.  This time we had our daughters with us so four rooms in total.. not a small booking.. rooms are nothing like the pictures you see on their site so don't be fooled. Yes the foyer is lovely but the rooms and suites were a huge disappointment.  Old, tired, cramped and cleaners not up to scratch. I had to ring after two days of non cleaning to get room done.. not good enough.  No doorman to help us unload our luggage off water taxi which was dreadful as there were four of us and lots of luggage. Staff on front desk very harried and slow to act. No water views fromâ€¦
