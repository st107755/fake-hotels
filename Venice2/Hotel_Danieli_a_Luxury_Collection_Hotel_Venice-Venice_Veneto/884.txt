As soon as we walked in, saw the amazing decor and grand reception, we knew this stay was going to be great! The pictures did make the place look lovely but seeing it for yourself is something that cannot be captured in the pictures themselves. The hotel staff were very friendly and spoke English perfectly; The rooms were good enough, beds were comfy, bathrooms were nice - it was a shame our room view was the next building but can't complain. I would definitely recommend the tables outside where they serve breakfast as the view is amazing - it was amazing. They have a free private boat taxi service from just outside the hotel to Murano which was convenient and pretty cool. Lots of people around when we stayed, especially newly married couples so was definitely a good choiceâ€¦
