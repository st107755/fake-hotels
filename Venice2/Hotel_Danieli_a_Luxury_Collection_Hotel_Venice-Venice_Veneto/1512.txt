The service at this "five star hotel" is shoddy and impersonal compared to average hostels across Europe. We are on our honeymoon with mostly basic accommodations & this was supposed to be a big splurge.  The bathroom was full of FILTHY towels when we checked in. The concierges are too busy and snobby to help anyone. The wifi, which is free at street caf√©s around the city, costs 15 euros/day and is slow. They won't give you an iron, but will charge you 9 euros a piece to iron clothes for you. To nickel and dime guests that are already paying a fortune is criminal. The best part is the location, the opulent historic furnishings & the people watching, but if you want 5 star service or even just the minimum you would get at a holiday inn, you should go elsewhere.
