Stayed here 10 years ago and just recently. I love the foyer. But the revolving door is stupid. One person comes in, one goes out. We were in a group which became a bottle neck! Our rooms both times were very small. The bathroom tiny.  Two people could not be in it together. We had no views at all, rooftops.  Breakfast upstairs is great overlooking the water. Not very friendly staff....but I find that is normalo in Italy. We were in room 267. Could not find it at first. You had to catch the lift to level 3!
