Museum quality architecture and furniture, with far too exorbitant prices but worst of all  the majority of the staff were totally uncaring. You'd think they'd be happy to work there, smile a little, she some compaction. The only friendly experience I got was from the smiling young lad vacuuming the stairs. Worth taking a look inside but after staying there for three nights, we would never return. Management. Should check out what a five star hotel should offer by trying a gem such as the Excelsior in Florence!
