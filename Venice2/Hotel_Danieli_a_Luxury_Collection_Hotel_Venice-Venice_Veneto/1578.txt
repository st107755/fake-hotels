We stayed here for two nights before leaving on a cruise. The location couldn't be better. Located right near St. Marks Square. The hotel staff was very helpful. The breakfast on the terrace was excellent, with a beautiful view of the Grand Canal. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are very beautiful and very comfortable. It is however very expensive, so keep that in mind.
