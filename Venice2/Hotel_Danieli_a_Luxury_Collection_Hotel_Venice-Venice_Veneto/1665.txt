We stayed here February 6-11th and had a wonderful time.  The hotel is elegant, in a perfect location to all attractions, the staff very friendly and helpful.  Yes, as noted in prior reviews eating and drinking here is very expensive, but you can work around this as there are so many other places to go in close proximity.  All in all, we loved Venice and would definitely stay here again in the future.
