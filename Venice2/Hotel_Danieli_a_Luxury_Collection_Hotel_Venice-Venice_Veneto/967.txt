I think everyone who stays in Venice should stay here at least once!  The restaurant on the top has the most amazing view of the grand canal and the food is delicious and truly an art form (see the photos of our lunch).  The rooms are good and the layout very interesting - room 337 is of course on the 2nd floor not the 3rd!  It's an amazing iconic hotel!!!
