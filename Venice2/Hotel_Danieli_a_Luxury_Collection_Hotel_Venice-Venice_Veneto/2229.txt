This hotel is amazing and we absolutely loved our stay. The location is fabulous and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They provided us with all the information we needed, and gave extra help when required (I broke an acrylic nail and the concierge immediately made me a reservation at a beauty salon to get it fixed, along with a map of how to get there). It is expensive but one can easily see why. Our room was beautiful and we were upgraded and received a bottle of wine as we were on our honeymoon. We would definitely love to return to this hotel.
