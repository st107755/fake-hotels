My family and I have just returned from a short break to Venice. We stayed at the Hotel Danieli and had a superb time. Our rooms looked out over the lagoon and the view was breathtaking as we just watched all the boats come and go in the port and the occasional ocean liner pass through, a little surreal!  The hotel is grand and ornate but it doesn't feel over the top somehow. The staff were gracious and helpful throughout our stay. Definitely make sure you have sundowners on the terrace if it is sunny...
