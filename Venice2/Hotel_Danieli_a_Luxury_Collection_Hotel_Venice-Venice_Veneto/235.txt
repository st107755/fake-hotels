This is an outstanding hotel in a wonderful city. The location is simply the best, there is no better.   The arrival experience was fantastic, the staff were very professional navigating the bureaucracy associated with staying in any hotel in Italy.  The room was pure opulence, a very traditional experience, wonderful bed and linens great maid service.  The condition of the decor was good - not fantastic, part of the room should be repainted. In the corridors carpets were threadbare in parts.   The hotel bar area was good with a great drinks list, as you might expect in Venice super expensive, the service was excellent.  For such a luxury hotel the public spaces are very limited with few intimate spaces.  A great stay, attentive staff, expensive.
