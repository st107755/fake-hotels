This hotel was amazing! It literally was a palace! The fact that it is dead centre of Venice & so close to San Marco square is so convenient. This was my first trip to Italy and my first-ever trip to Europe. I was not disappointed. The food, the restaurants, the bar, the rooms...every little detail was astonishing. If you ever get the opportunity to travel to Venice, Italy; please stay at Hotel Danieli. You will not regret it!
