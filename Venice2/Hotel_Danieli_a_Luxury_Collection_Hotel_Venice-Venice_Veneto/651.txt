I was in Zurich for business, and decide to go to Venice for a few days,  pick Danielle because of proximity to San Pedro square and for the view,  I booked a room ocean front, not cheap, but, when we arrived they upgraded to a room with balcony, there was a bottle of wine waiting for us as compliment, of course we open it and sat in the balcony and appreciate the perfect view, could not have been better. The hotel and the building is impressive, and the service was excellent From helping with questions to booking diner for us in restaurants... We took a "taxi" to the airport and the boat came to the side hotel door, first class...
