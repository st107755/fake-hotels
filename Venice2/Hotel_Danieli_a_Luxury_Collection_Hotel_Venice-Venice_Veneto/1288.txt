The hotel is just like all the pictures.  My son and I had adjoining suites that looked out on the lagoon.  The staff couldn't have been anymore attentive.  The manager actually had someone purchase me a flat iron feeling their converters might not be safe enough.  Had lunch both days of the roof top restaurant and the only view like that in the city.  The hotel could use some updating, but then might lose some of its charm.  It was perfect!
