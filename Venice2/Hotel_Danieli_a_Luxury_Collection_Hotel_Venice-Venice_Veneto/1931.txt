We stayed at the Danieli as part of a Tauck tour and I must say I was less than impressed.  We were not able to have breakfast on the terrace as a Russian group were there, enjoying oysters and champagne.  The place was like a rabbit warren, some of it very dilapidated, and when we wanted to leave our luggage overnight they refused to help us in this regard.  We won't be back.
