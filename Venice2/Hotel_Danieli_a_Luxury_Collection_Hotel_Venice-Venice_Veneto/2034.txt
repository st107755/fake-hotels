Hotel Danieli is only two buildings down from the Doge's palace on Piazza San Marco. The hotel was comprised of two or three buildings, and very beautifully decorated with murano glass chandeliers. The staff was very courteous and helpful. I redeemed Starwood points for the room, and got upgraded to a deluxe room with a walk-in closet and huge bathroom (by European standard). Also got complimentary internet because of my gold preferred member status. The internet was somewhat slow and the TV didn't work. But it didn't matter to us. There is a vaporetto stop right in front of the hotel, so it's easy to get to from the train station.
