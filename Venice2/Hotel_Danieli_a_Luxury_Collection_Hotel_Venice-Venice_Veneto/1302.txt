Beautiful hotel, more like a museum, but missing some of our modern comforts. The doors are tricky, the showers small, rooms are loud (thin walls, as well as people in alleyway below at all hours of day/night), floors are creaky (you will hear every person who passes by your room and every step above you.) It is fancy, but more like your grandmother's fancy than your cool friend Cindy's fancy.
