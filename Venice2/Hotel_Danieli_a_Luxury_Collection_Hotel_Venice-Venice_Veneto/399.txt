The rooftop bar has some of the best views in Venice. You can enjoy a drink and some food on the patio in open air while over looking the city. I would recommend stopping by if you have the time and are willing to pay for a view. The drinks are expensive, most start at 15-20euro for a drink, and they are standard pours. We each had a drink (2total) and it was $50 euros, so make sure you are willing to spend some time there, we were walking past so we didnt spend more than 30mins before we had dinner reservations elsewhere.
