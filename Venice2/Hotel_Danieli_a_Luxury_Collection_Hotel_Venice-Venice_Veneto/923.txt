I will start of by saying this hotel is beautiful! The rooms were gorgeously decorated and the staff was very nice. Favorite part was breakfast on the terrace, food was delicious and view was like no other. Rooms were always kept nice and clean. Would definitely recommend. We did get charged for room service that we never ordered, however, the staff was quickly to fix the error.
