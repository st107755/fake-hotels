We stayed one night at the Danieli pre cruise on the 31st July. We thought we would treat ourselves to this hotel which has had such a well known reputation in the past and is very centrally located just off San Marco's and close to the water taxi stop. Indeed it was very convenient and very beautiful with a lovely terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. However, the service is not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. The reception staff were very polite and friendly but on check in our luggage was taken away and stored. We thought it would be taken to our room but 3 hours later it had not been delivered and we had to go to reception to request it. There was no apology! Meanwhile, we went to the terrace bar to order afternoon tea which was on the menu. We were asked 3 timesâ€¦
