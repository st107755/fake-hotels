We arrived by water taxi and was greeted by a hotel steeped in history.  Hotel Daniele is like a museum to Venetian luxury with beautiful original features and furniture.   Our room (71) was appropriately decorated for the age of the hotel and again oozed historic opulence.  It faced the lagoon so was maybe one of the better views.   Breakfast and lunch was great and very enjoyable on the roof terrace.  We didn't eat dinner.  I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.  Ciao
