This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. It was the first leg our our honeymoon. We were luck enough to be located in the main original building, which is over 700 years old. We had a beautiful junior suite overlooking the lagoon.  Turn down service is an excellent touch and all the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Food was excellent, service is second to none.  We couldn't have been happier for choosing this hotel. If you want a fantastic luxurious hotel then you should stay here!
