This hotel is lovely and the location is fantastic. You can easily walk to so many of the places you will no doubt want to visit while in Venice. The staff was very attentive and responsive; the concierge was great with recommendations and reservations. It is an older hotel and it shows, but that's part of its charm and didn't bother me because it was sparkling clean and had everything else going for it.
