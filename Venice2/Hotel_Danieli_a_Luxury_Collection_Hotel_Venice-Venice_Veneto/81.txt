Most probably the hotel became more famous after the Tourist movie but it is great place to stay.   First of all location - it is just few minutes from San Marco Square. In front thereâ€™s is a boat station so it can take you to any place in Venice by public transport.   The standard room is not so big but it is Venice after all with limited space.  But rooms are decorated in very stylish way.  The lobby is very picturesque.  You must have the breakfast at the terrace, the view is breathtaking and good food.
