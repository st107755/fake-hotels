How much money do you you want to pay for a smallish room with no view and enjoy the company of really bad tour groups? How much money do you want to pay for a room that includes breakfast with the attending tour groups jockeying/fighting for position in front of the crowded buffet? How much money do you want to pay for a room in a hotel with a lovely roof top restaurant where you get to wait for two hours for your meal and hear only from the waiter,"Relax, it's a nice evening.' How much money do you want to pay for a room in a hotel with kids racing through the lobby and fighting each other to get out the door?  I don't know how much you want to pay for all that pleasure, but I personally will never pay for it again - I would certainly never return to the Danieli.  What a pityâ€¦
