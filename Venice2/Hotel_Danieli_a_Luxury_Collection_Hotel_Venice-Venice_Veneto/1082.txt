Stayed here twice, this year, last time was for Carnivale.  Upgraded both times.  View over the lagoon.  Rooms are large, tasteful, old school European and immaculate, if you want sharp , angular, modern, go somewhere else, this was the house of a Doge Dondolo, it's historic and the rooms match the elegance of the building.  Bathrooms are large, tub and shower, marble.  Breakfast is wonderful, drinks in the lobby are a must every evening and the service is outstanding, concierge desk very helpful.  Front desk is wonderful.  The view is magnificent.  Venice can be a pain, by vaporetto this is a single shot from the train station to San Zaccaria, the Danieli is right in front of you. Saint Marks Basilica and Square are around the corner, Doges Palace basically next door as is theâ€¦
