It's not cheap but the Hotel Danielli is a world-class luxury hotel that lives up to its' history and reputation.  Located at the beginning of the Grand Canal, the hotel is right right on the main walk on the water and next to Piazza San Marco and the attractions around it.  If you like that convenience and energy (and it was fine for our group) then the location is outstanding. We had a drink at the sister property, The Gritti Palace, on a quieter portion of the Grand Canal and it was a completely different (quieter) experience.  The rooms are classically Venetian elegant and they were kind enough to upgrade us to a corner room on the 4th floor.  We were high enough to not have the noise be a problem, but friends of ours had a room on the 2nd floor and the noise from the crowdâ€¦
