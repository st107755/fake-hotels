If you want to experience a real old style Venitian hotel then this is the one for you.  It has not undergone  refurbishment in the same way as other 5 star Veinice hotels, but has retained its old style ambience. We had a great christamas holiday with an up graded room and several free gifts from the management. OK so the restaurant food did not compare to the meals we had in the Hotel Eden Rome (equivalent star rating) but this did not spoil our stay as there are so many other places to eat.
