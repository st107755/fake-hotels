We stayed in two adjoining rooms with balconies facing the canal and were overwhelmed by the service, room decor and views from our balconies. We arrived early one morning and our rooms were ready by noon. Upon arrival in a water taxi, we walked in the lobby and were greeted by the beautiful setting and bustling scene and helpful front desk. It is a long walk through the hotel to our rooms, but an old-world hotel with charm and style. We had dinner in the roof top hotel and it did not disappoint either. We also had the buffet breakfast the next morning and it was the perfect way to start a day in Venice. This is a top-rated hotel for a reason and does not disappoint. The connecting rooms were perfect for our family of four.
