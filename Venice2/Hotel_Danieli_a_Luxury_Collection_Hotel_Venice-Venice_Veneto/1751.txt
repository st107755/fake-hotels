Most wonderful and romantic hotel in Venice! Well worth the cost! Most beautiful lobby, wonderful rooms and best location! Rooms are a perfect balance between traditional Venetian style and modern appointments. Wifi in room was very good for both signal strength and speed. Very helpful, professional and knowledgeable staff. Can't imagine staying anywhere else in Venice!
