We visited Venice last June 2016, from the moment we arrived there it was perfect and romantic. From the water taxi to arriving at the Hotel Danieli which is an absolutely amazing hotel, beautiful architecture such an amazing building.  From the time we arrived to the time we left the staff were nothing but amazing and very helpful. Only downside was that it was very expensive to eat there so we found a different place to eat everyday which was actually very nice.
