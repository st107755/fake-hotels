It is not cheap to stay here, but you get a room with character and a location that is hard to beat. it is literally next to St. Mark's Square, and there are water taxi stations right in front of the hotel (Piazza San Marco - San Zaccaria stop), making it easy to go to the airport or to the train station.  The hotel is a mark of luxury and glorious old time. And you feel it when you entered the lobby. Check in counter was smallish and only manned by 1 person when we arrived. So we had to wait for 2 other guests to be served before we could check in. Something to improve on... We booked a room with balcony, facing the lagoon, and as it turned out the room is located in a building adjacent to the main lobby. While it was not extra large, the room was very well appointed,â€¦
