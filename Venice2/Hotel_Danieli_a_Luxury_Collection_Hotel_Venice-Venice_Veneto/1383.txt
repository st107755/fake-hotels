The hotel is beautiful, our room overlooked the lagoon , the view was lovely and to see the large cruise liners passing up close was a interesting . The hotel is 600 years old and the decor and furnishings were superb . As you would expect Venice is a very expensive city and be prepared to pay. The staff in the hotel were very accomodating, the service was excellent, but outside the hotel it is very busy.
