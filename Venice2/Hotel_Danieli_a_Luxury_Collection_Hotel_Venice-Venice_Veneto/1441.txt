Our second visit to the Danieli and we loved it as much as the first time. The hotel is beautiful and a lagoon view room is a must. The staff are helpful, friendly and efficient with the concierge making excellent restaurant recommendations.  Breakfast on the top floor with a fabulous view of the grand canal is also great. Highly recommend the whole experience especially out of season when Venice is quieter.
