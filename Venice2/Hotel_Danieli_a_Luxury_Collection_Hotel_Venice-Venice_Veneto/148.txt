First let me say everyone has different experiences but I’m not sure how you can not love this hotel. It is right on the canal with amazing views, there is no dragging your luggage through the streets of the city because the water bus and taxi stops right in front. The inside is beautiful with classic old world elegance. The staff was so nice and helpful from check in to check out. We were lucky to have an amazing suite with 2 small balconies overlooking the grand canal. We did not eat in the hotel so I can’t talk to that, but there is a beautiful bar with amazing views.  Yes, it is a little on the expensive side, but if you want to treat yourself to something special, this is the place. Just a few steps to St. Marks and short walks to everywhere else. Can’t wait to go back!
