My wife and I stayed here for a few nights before going on a cruise. While it was a little confusing / difficult to get here from the VCE airport, the overall location can't be beat for Venice. Close to St. Mark's square, and a number of water bus stops right in front of you make it simple to get wherever you want to go, let alone just walking around and exploring Venice. The hotel is one of the most interesting (in a good way) properties I've sen. Only down side was our room was "upgraded" to a Jr Suite, but we went from a lagoon view to a room overlooking the building next door and an alleyway. One thing to keep in mind is the light controls are a little difficult to use in the room to turn lights on / off, and there is a main power switch at the door that actually controlsâ€¦
