I did I not stay here (thank God) but was a guest at a dinner party that rented the top floor restaurant for the evening.  Stunning views from the top floor and what beautiful hotel.  But the service and food was way below bar.  When in a 5 star hotel, one would expect good food and service.  Not so here. It is worth going to the top floor for a drink only to enjoy the view, but do not eat anything.
