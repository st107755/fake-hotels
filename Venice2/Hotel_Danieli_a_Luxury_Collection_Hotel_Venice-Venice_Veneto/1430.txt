This is a gorgeous place and is like a living museum with the sloping stairs and artwork. Gorgeous. We had a superior room which was lovely but dark. But checking in was a nightmare. We had travelled very early from uk then vaporetto. The latter the best way to arrive in venice. But our Room wasn't ready for hours. The excuse was that the cruise ship people arrived  en masse at 10am and all the ready rooms are gone, not what you want to hear when you have paid a lot for it. This ruined our stay to be honest. The bags took a lifetime to arrive as well. Gave us free wifi to compensate. Not impressed. Breakfast out on the terrace was lovely and this was a truly convenient spot for hopping about but can't say I felt valued guest at all.
