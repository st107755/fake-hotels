At Hotel Danielli, we had a suite/balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. The view was terrific! The staff is very nice as expected at a luxury hotel.  Our suite was a study in contrasts...literally! The interior small living room and bedroom are poorly lit and garrishly decorated in red velvet and dark wood (think pseudo Victorian steakhouse). The bathroom is great - updated in marble with both a great tub and separate shower.  The hotel has a spectacular rooftop restaurant with 180 degree views of the Grand Canal and all of it's activities. The breakfast buffet is wonderful.   If the Danielli replaced the red velvet, improved lighting, and removed the extraneous lobby decorations, it would certainly move way up the rankings for a luxury hotel in Venice. It's got alot right, butâ€¦
