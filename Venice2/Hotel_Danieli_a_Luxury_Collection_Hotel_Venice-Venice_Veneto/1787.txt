Beautiful old palazzos converted to 3 connecting buildings that make up the hotel. Directly across from the main water taxi port on to Venice so it is very noisy - not at all quiet or peaceful.   We booked a jr suite on all Starwood points and were upgraded to a lagoon suite however the suite we were given was very loud. Stella showed us two other available suites when we shared our concern, even though it was after 11p and she was off at 11p. She went out of her way to make sure we were happy and we ended up with a suite in the Casa Nuevo, the most recently renovated building.. I'm VERY glad I brought earplugs though as the crowd noise outside starts around 5a - again, the noise was just unbelievable. Crazy noisy - like, until midnight and beginning around 5a when boats areâ€¦
