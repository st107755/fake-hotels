Verry nice stay at this hotel perfectly located nearby St Mark's square. Disastrous arrival from airpor where we were dumped under the rain on the pier by the private transfer boat and had to finish carrying ourselves our luggage to the hotel entrance . Managemant apologized and cancelled the transfer fee , still this should not happen in this kind of hotel.  Old romantic hotel with the charm of the past. We had a room with a terrace . Room is on the smaller side , terrace is nice and the view is incredibly magnificent  although could not really benefit from it due to the poor end of march weather.  Staff are attentive to help , concierge is very helpful to recommend outings or nice  restaurants.  Was lucky to check night before that transfer to airport was ok  as it was beingâ€¦
