This would have been 5 * if it wasn't for the slight poor housekeeping. On arrival there was a half drunk bottle of water in the minibar along with an open can of Cola. The following day our room wasn't serviced at all! Once we arose this problem it was solved immediately and it was perfect from then on.   However, apart from this we had a fantastic stay, we stayed 5 nights and each day received lovely amenities from the hotel and the staff treated us gracefully. Alessio from concierge is a true gentlemen. A credit to the hotel.
