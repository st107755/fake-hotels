So disappointing. We were impressed when we arrived. Stunning hotel and suite but the rude service by older male waiters both downstairs in the bar one night and upstairs for breakfast let this hotel down. Also very average breakfast. Complete rip off for the price. Sad to see such a beautiful hotel spoilt by such basic things.
