Became an SPG member back in 2007 and was told at that time (after mentioning I dreamed of traveling to Italy) you MUST stay at the Hotel Danieli.  So when planning my trip to Italy, my hotel choice was easy.   We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and were willing to splurge on luxury hotels.  This hotel is beautiful throughout except our room needed some updating-scuff marks on the wall around the desk, ripped trim on the bottom, front of couch and severely scratched wood flooring.  They also need to put some kind of grippers under the big floor rug that we tripped over repeatedly.  The hotel kindly had Champagne waiting in our room.  Nice gesture. Unfortunately they left 2 dirty glasses to drink it with.  One had red lipstick on the lip and the other had red wineâ€¦
