Truly amazing service and a lovey luxury hotel located in a convenient location. The views are awesome. The customer service and their knowledge of the region and what to do makes all the difference.   Only thing to watch is the price of soft drinks are nearly as much as alcohol at $22 for a 300ml bottle of coke and only $30 for a cocktail. I say you are better to get drunk!!!
