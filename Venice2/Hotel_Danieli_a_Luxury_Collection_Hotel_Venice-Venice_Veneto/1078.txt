We visited this Hotel bar simply because it was featured in a film, The Tourist featuring Angelia Jolie and Johnny Depp, despite its obvious tourist appeal, once you step foot inside your transported to a Downton era, Jazz, Piano and Cocktails! Beautiful Boudoir furniture, dark wood and chandeliers, perfect! Long Island iced tea or the Espresso martini are a must try!
