It was my dream to stay here, ever since I saw the hotel feature in my favorite movie as a child. We had intended to honeymoon here in July 2015. After sending several emails, the hotel did not reply. I had to resort to calling with my enquiry. I would think for the amount you are paying, the customer service would be of a higher standard. Certainly prompt replies to emails isn't expecting too much. In the end, I decided to cancel the reservation based on the lack of service and informed them of why. I then received the confirmation email back without an apology or anything that addressed my concerns. Pretty disappointed!
