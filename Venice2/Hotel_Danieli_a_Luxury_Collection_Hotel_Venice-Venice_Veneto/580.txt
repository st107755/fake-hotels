Our family enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Hotel Danieli. We had a minor glitch on our first night, but were upgraded at no cost by the manager (Silver) to connecting rooms on the top floor - which gave us a perfect view of the midnight fireworks over the lagoon for the Redentore festival. The hotel is just off San Marco square and perfectly located for touring. We loved the dramatic lobby and antique furnishings. All around beauty!
