Hotel service was very good, all the employees were gracious and helpful.  The building itself was fantastic, absolutely gorgeous.  The room was nice but not exceptional.  The breakfast buffet was very good, and the rooftop restaurant had lovely views of the lagoon.  Drinks in the bar were very expensive!  Could not beat the location - our water taxi picked us up from the hotel dock and whisked us to the airport.  Being so close to St. Mark's square was great as we could easily return to our hotel as our weary feet needed.
