We stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate my wife's (big) birthday. Pricey but worth every penny. It is a preserved 12th Century Palace that was owned by the Doge's family until 200 years ago when it became a hotel. 75m from St. Mark's Sq. overlooking the lagoon.  Amazing views at breakfast from the terrace.  Every member of staff was incredibly polite in an old fashioned polite and genuine way not a fake 'have a nice day' way. The concierge staff are as you would expect very polite, knowledgeable, professional and speak about 4 languages each. They recommended excellent restaurants.  Arrive by River Taxi, and as you walk in your jaw will drop as you take in the decor. We had a large room overlooking the lagoon with a comfy bed, large bathroom and beautiful furniture. Roomâ€¦
