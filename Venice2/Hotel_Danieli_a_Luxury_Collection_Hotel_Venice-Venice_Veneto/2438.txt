My husband and I were taking a few days together for my  birthday treat.  I had dreamed of staying there after seeing the hotel in a film.  Our room 202 was  a side room with balcony  and not much view.  The decor was satisfactory if not a little worn, but that for me was part of the charm. The comfort of the bed and pillows for me were sadly unsatisfactory.  The majority of the staff  were very  good and helpful but a couple of their concierge staff were rather the opposite. Breakfast on the roof terrace was a wonderful way to start the day altho the food was rather average by todays standards. We dined one evening  up there and  everything except the food was superb. I was extremely disappointed, and the price  made it all the more distasteful. Nevertheless overall i'm gladâ€¦
