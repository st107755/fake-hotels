This hotel is magnificent it is right on the water, a gondola awaits you. The rooms are elegant, lots of marble and the bed was shaped like an old fashioned sleigh. A waterway was just outside from the room and you could hear the gondoliers singing as they went by.The food was wonderful, but you were also within walking distance of many sidewalk cafes. It was a quick walk to St. Marks square and many shops and of course more eateries. You can find beautiful and unusual carnival masks all over Venice along with all the high end designer clothes. It is a beautiful city with much to see, I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys history and the elegance of old architecture.
