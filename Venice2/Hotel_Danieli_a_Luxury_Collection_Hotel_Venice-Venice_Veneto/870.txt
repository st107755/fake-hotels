I stayed here about a year ago but didn't review it because there was so little to be negative about. Regardless of the price get a river taxi from the airport, it feels like you are entering another world. Enter through a side door straight from the canal. The reception is breathtaking. Service over the top attentive. Rooms completely over the top chintzy gaudy and old school venetian pomp (just what you want). The view from the rooftop restaurant is probably one of the most iconic views in the world. No wonder a coffee costs so much. You're right in the heart of the city, (the Doges palace is next door so I'm sure he'd pick the best location). If you can afford it don't go anywhere else.
