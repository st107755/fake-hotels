Hi went to Venice for four days stayed at the Danieli. This has to be one of the worlds great hotels. Fantastic decoration like a fairytale film set.Great Staff great attention. what more can I say. I would add a note of caution prices like most of Venice are steep. I would definitely go back again and again.spend the money get the private speedboat from the airport E110 and drops you off at the private entrance for the Danieli
