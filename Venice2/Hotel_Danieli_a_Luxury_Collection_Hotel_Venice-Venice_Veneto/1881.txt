Stayed in July at the start of the school holiday season with my daughter. Loved the grace and beauty of the hotel. The lobby has the same beauty as the Peninsula in Hong Kong, the rooms are fine, but not stunning when you consider the price, but it is the classic hotel of Venice. Our most enjoyable moments came when dining in the evening on the top floor terrace overlooking the rest of Venice. Breathtaking! I enjoyed the best buffalo mozzarella ever, so fresh it ooozed. They were more than happy to just prepare a Spaghetti Bolognese for my daughter. What memories are made of. The Concierge were all helpful for advice especially re Gondalier ride prices, so all in all a great stay. Make sure you arrive by water taxi!
