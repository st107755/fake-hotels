We were privileged to stay 4 nights in the very special five star hotel located near San Marco. The lobby is spectacular, the rooms very comfortable, the sheets, blankets and towels all first class. The view from the terrace restaurant in magnificent,. However we were disappointed that in such a five star hotel one cannot have freshly cooked eggs and the scrambled eggs and bacon were luke warm. Also the range of fruit available was disappointing ...no strawberries or raspberries . The service was friendly and first class
