Just returned after 3 day break in Venice. Arrived by water taxi organised by hotel which was spot on. Room and hotel very comfortable and the reception area is a must to see. All in all a lovely hotel to stay in and very convenient for getting around . We didn't eat in hotel as prices seem to be very expensive. Breakfast was included and whilst the standard was ok if you had to pay the prices separately the quality wouldn't reflect the price.
