We loved this hotel. The service was top notch, the lobby is gorgeous, the lobby bar beautiful. We reserved a room with a furnished terrace, and we were so happy we did. The balcony was large, with two comfortable lounge chairs and a table with two chairs, and it overlooked the Venetian lagoon. We loved it! What a place for a late afternoon or evening glass of wine. The breakfast on the top floor terrace was also spectacular. The only small complaint I had was reception offering to convert your money for you at checkout. Really beneath this level of hotel.
