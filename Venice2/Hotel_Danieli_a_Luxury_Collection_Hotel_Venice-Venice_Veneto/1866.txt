We stayed at hotel danieli during carnival 2013. The hotel was very accommodating letting us stay only one night like we had wanted instead of their policy of a two night minimum during carnival. We would have stayed longer but the hotel is very expensive and just wanted to stay the night for the experience. The staff was very nice at check in, they even upgraded us to a great room in the front of the hotel with a view of the lagoon. They were helpful with directions to locations in the city. The hotel is beautifully decorated and it was a great experience.
