Pro: This hotel is beautiful. The concierge provided so much amazing information and details for where I should walk and explore, and I had the best local experience. I found many gems in the city for local cuisine and drinks. The bed was very comfortable, and every night I had a great sleep. The bathroom was stunning, and it was truly a beautiful bathtub with shower. I felt like royalty.   Con: My view was an interior brick wall. For my first time visit, I wish I could have viewed a canal or another building, but my view was the hotel roof with a brick wall blocking any view. Also, I had asked for a king bed, and I received two twins.  Overall: The hotel is stunning, so I would definitely stay again, but I hope on my next stay I'd have a king bed with any view.
