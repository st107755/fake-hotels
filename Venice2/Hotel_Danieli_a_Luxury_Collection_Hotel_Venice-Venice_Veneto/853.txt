Location, location, location. My room was nicely renovated, not a large room but nice. Tub/shower combo in bathroom, not my favorite for this price point. No in room  coffee maker. :-( I will try The Gritti next visit. The breakfast buffet is a good value especially if you get a table on the terrace, great views of the lagoon in every direction.!
