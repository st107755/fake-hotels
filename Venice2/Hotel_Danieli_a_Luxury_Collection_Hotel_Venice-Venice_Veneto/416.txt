Having just stayed at a perfectly serviceable but cheap airport hotel nearby; I was reminded of what I really like about a hotel.   My room was quiet (excepting with the window open), bed and sheets perfect (think Egyptian cotton), bathroom perfect and shower super hot.   The staff are pretty good too. Accompanied to my room from checkin. Genuinely good recommendations from th said concierge team. Great bar (though hopefully piano music is your thing - the pianist is pretty good).   Breakfast was superb. Silver service; everything you could wish for.   This is the W Hotel or anything like it. It’s a labyrinth of a former castle. And all the better for it.    Wifi is perhaps a bit on the slow side. But it’s free. 1mb.
