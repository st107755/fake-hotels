We booked the hotel Danieli as our last stop in Italia before moving onto France.. We knew this was a silly amount of money but the name and also my husbands mother and father stayed here twenty or so years ago won us over and we decided as it was our honeymoon we would spend the money.. The location is fantastic one minute walk to St Marks Square and the design is as you would expect if you had read up about it.. Vintage and beautiful! Check in was slightly confusing you go to reception who then tell you to sit for five minutes then go collect your keys from concierge and then go back to reception to get someone who will show you to your room.. Little over complicated!  also I didn't feel wow ed.. I know it's a little thing and most people can afford to stay there but for usâ€¦
