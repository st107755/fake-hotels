Come for a drink and enjoy the view.  Visit the most beautiful hotel of all in Venice, with its ancient decoration and architecture. Typical, spectacular and beautiful.  Amazing view, the service is perfect. Cocktails and appetizers are top!  We came twice, second in afternoon. Coffees and desserts are excellent.   I love this place!
