We spent New Year's Eve here - a 3 day visit with our teenage children. The rooms are a nice size and some have a great view over Venice. The hotel restaurant is a highlight, with amazing views from the terrace. Breakfast is a bit limited, but the dinner is very good, and very expensive. The New Year Cocktail dinner was a big, big disappointment though: a cheerless room, with a limited selection of very uninspiring food and an understocked and understaffed bar. Incredibly expensive for what was provided! This was a "trap" we need not have fallen into!
