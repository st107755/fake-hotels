My parents had stayed here a few years and highly recommended it.  It left much to be desired.  Expensive and needs major upgrades.  The staff is slow and seems to not really care.  We waited almost an hour to get a drink at the rooftop and it was overpriced and lousy.  I think there are better places to stay now for the amount of money it costs.
