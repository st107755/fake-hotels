Every need was met.  The staff was wonderful.  We were directed toward places that were not as touristy which really made the holiday.  The view from my room was breathtaking.  The lobby bar was a great place to meet family and friends and our trip to Murano was just a short launch ride away.  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fantastic Venice experience.
