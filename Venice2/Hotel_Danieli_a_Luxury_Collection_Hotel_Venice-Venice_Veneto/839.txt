We arrived in the morning via a private boat reserved by the hotel from the airport.  Would highly recommend this as a great way to unwind from being on a plane and to see Venice the way it should be seen.... from a boat.  At check-in we were upgraded to a suite on the main canal.  Great room with a great view (room 228).  Chiara at the front desk took care of everything for us from check-in to getting into the room so promptly.  Everything about our stay was top notch including the breakfast and dinners on the terrace on the top floor.  Great romantic setting especially at sunset. Make a dinner reservation before sunset to fully enjoy the ambiance and views.  Venice is expensive so splurge a little more by staying and eating at the hotel.  Truly like a second honeymoon for us.
