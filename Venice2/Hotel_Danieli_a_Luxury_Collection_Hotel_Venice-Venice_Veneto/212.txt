A very overpriced hotel, breakfast is a complete ripoff, 53 euros. Table staff have no idea, lean across you while eating to retrieve plates etc. the service to Murano is a complete take, its all about getting you there so you will buy something. I would suggest other hotels to stay at, half the price and double the room space. Some of the staff were quite surly, i felt like i was ripped off which left a dirty taste in my mouth.
