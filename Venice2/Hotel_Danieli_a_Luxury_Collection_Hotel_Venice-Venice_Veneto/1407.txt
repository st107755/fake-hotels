We stayed at Hotel Danieli quite a while back now, and I just cannot get it out of my mind. It is the most sumptuous and beautiful hotel in Venice.  We stayed at the Gritti Palace for 2 nights and Danieli for 3 nights. Danieli gives off the more boutique vibe and, in my opinion, just has more character to it. It is an experience from the moment you walk in and it doesn't stop there.  Rooms:  Stayed in their junior suite and everything was impeccable. The view out of the cute little balcony was just what we were in Venice for. We were greeted by a full set of Aqua de Parma toiletries in the cutest basket - we had the feeling that the hotel really cared for our well being and that was just one way of showing it.   Service:  Top notch service, extremely friendly and welcomingâ€¦
