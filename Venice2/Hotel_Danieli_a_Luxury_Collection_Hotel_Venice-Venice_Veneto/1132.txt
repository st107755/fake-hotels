Everyone should stay at the Danieli at least once in their life. What can I say? It was incredible. Would I stay there again? Maybe yes maybe no but I certainly hope so. The service was impeccable. The private boat transfers and porter service is worth the money. Because believe me, they were 100% professional, courteous, and worth it. Truly. We received an upgrade on arrival, and they were so kind to treat us to champagne and birthday cake for my husband on the night of his birthday. Bravo Danieli. Hope to see you soon.
