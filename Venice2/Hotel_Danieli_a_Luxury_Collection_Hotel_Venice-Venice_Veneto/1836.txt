Had a fantastic stay at Hotel Danieli last week.  It is absolutely stunning.  Our room was fabulous, with a great updated bathroom, plenty of space.  In particular, they were very gracious about a misunderstanding about us having our children, and made great accommodation with rollaway. The lobby and overall architecture is truly breathtaking.
