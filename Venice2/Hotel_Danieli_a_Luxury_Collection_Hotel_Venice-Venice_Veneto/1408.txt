The hotel staff were amazing, unfailingly polite and friendly.   I was expecting a stuffier atmosphere and was pleasantly surprised.   Our room overlooked a side street and canal.  It was spotlessly clean and well maintained.   The heating in the bathroom was hard to adjust but we were cool enough in the bedroom.  When we left, the staff came to say goodbye.  We felt like royalty.  Thank you.
