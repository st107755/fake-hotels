this hotel has everything you need, a good location, well appointed luxurious rooms, a restaurant located on the roof with a magnificent view of the Venice. But what makes it better is its people. From the staff at the reception to the staff at restaurant we were served with warm efficiency. Allesio at the concierge desk is particularly helpfully, he has so many recommendations for places to go and nice restaurants to dine in.
