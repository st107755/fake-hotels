Old world venice charm at its best ...just like in the movie the tourist.. Best was the champagne breakfast on the rooftop with amazing views of the grand canal..thumbs up !!! Centrally located right next to San Marco place..lots of small cafes n bars  around to have a good time.. Also most venice attractions close by and a few minutes walking distance..
