A once in a life time experience is to stay and eat in this hotel. While I imagined better seating and tables on the roof top dining area, the service, quality of the food and most importantly the view from the top of this hotel is simply breathtaking especially when the sun is setting from the south. The hotel interior is a masterpiece with rich history. It's also great that this hotel is affiliated with spg.com so you can collect lots of points during your stay.
