When we sailed up the Grand Canal in Venice to Hotel Danieli, we were mesmerized. The Lobby, absolutely enchanting, attracting masses of tourists. Great location!  Rooms highly priced and yet very tired and in need of refurbishment, particularly bathrooms.  Totally unsuitable for older patrons or those with mobility issues. Beautiful terrace with incredible views of Grand Canal great breakfast. Don't dine in the evening as every dish attracts an additional surcharge. Service inconsistent. We would not stay here again.
