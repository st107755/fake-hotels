We as a family (3 adult children) fulfilled our life-long wish to stay in the Danieli.Located just 5 minutes away from San Marco, this historic Grand Hotel makes you feel, you live in the magnificiant Venice history. The reception was warm-hearted, The staff improvised and made 2 adjacent rooms with a communicating door possible.The luxurious rooms are large, in beautiful Venetian baroque style, with all modern equippment needed. The breakfast on top floor at the roof-restaurant with the option to eat on the terrazza with the breathtaking view is a unique experience. It's worth the high price, the stay in the Danieli is an event.  Too bad, that they charge you for WLAN in the room (in this high-price segment you expect this service to be included!). I only can recommend thisâ€¦
