Went for my dads birthday during carnival weekend . Lovely setting and friendly, helpful staff. Rooms are clean and the lobby is beautiful.  However, although I am aware it’s a very old and historic hotel, it is very dark and somewhat dingy in the rooms themselves. There are also fake flowers on all the tables in the bar.. surely a 5* hotel with 5* prices could afford real flowers? Especially at carnival time? It made it all look a little tired and old fashioned.  It’s a great setting to visit Venice but very traditional and looks as though it could all do with a little sprucing up. Breakfast was also 53 euros each!
