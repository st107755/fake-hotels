Our room compared to other's we were with was very small.  We had two full sized beds we had to push together.  The bathroom was very old and out dated.  Not much room to move around in the bedrooom itself.  However, we did have a small balcony that overlooked one of the narrow canals.  Breakfast was great, which was the only food we actually had at the hotel.
