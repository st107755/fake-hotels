Best location in this famous hotel which we stayed. The lobby was gorgeous and you can see the marble columns tiled from the bad soil of Venice.The lobby was gorgeous but the rooms were lacking.  The restaurant on the roof was nice for breakfast and offered a great view but the service was lacking. Not worth the price
