We stayed here for 2 nights this September expecting to be wowed by everything at the Danieli but we were not. I had prearranged with the hotel to be picked up for their private water taxi and after we picked up our luggage we couldn't find their representative. After 20 minutes we called the hotel who told us they were waiting for us. It turned out that their guy was holding up 5 different names at a time so unless you exited luggage claim at the right moment, you didn't see him or your name. After that our water taxi ride was terrific n we arrived quickly at the hotel only to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in!! Never in my life have I waited to check in at 5 star hotel. Than we were also told that the rooftop bar and restaurant would be closed all weekend for a weddingâ€¦
