Hotel Danieli... from the moment you walk through the lobby doors prepared to be in awe. The hotel is absolutely stunning! The service is indeed 5 star and the staff was eager to please.  The best part of this hotel was by far the breakfast on the rooftop Terrace- the view is to die for. We knew we would not be in our room much, so we opted for the deluxe double and got upgraded to the premium deluxe double on arrival. Gorgeous room, but small.. no need for anything bigger though. Great location but it is quite touristy.. we were able to get off the beaten path and escape the crowds thanks to the concierge.
