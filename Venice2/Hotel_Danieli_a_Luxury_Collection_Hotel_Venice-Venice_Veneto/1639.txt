We came to the Danieli with high hopes for it being a fantastic hotel! To our disappointment the hotel did not live up to our expectations. Check in procedure and check in staff were rude and unpleasant. The staff in general are stiff, uncooperative and not guest centric.   Rather disappointing stay at the Danieli!
