This is a beautiful hotel in the world's most beautiful city. The entrance lobby is stunning and the rooftop terrace spectacular but the Danieli's most important asset is its staff. they were without exception friendly, charming and helpful. Special mention must go to Elena and Giacomo. When we checked in Elena noticed, without our mentioning it, that it was my birthday. She immediately arranged for an upgraded room and a bottle of fizz to greet us. The room was charming with a view of the Grand Canal. Breakfast was sensational and made even more so by the stunning rooftop views. We will certainly be back.
