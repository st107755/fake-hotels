I have visited Venice for a long weekend and selected Danieli as the hotel to stay in. The hotel is incredible. Beautiful, classy, friendly and has excellent staff. I could not find a single flaw! Our room was spacious, well equipped and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and our view (on the Grand Canal) was spectacular! I would recommend it to anyone visiting Venice. Great experience. One tip would be to get the breakfast included. It was just delicious!
