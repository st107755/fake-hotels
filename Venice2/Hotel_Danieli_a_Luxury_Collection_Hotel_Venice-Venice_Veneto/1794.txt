A very fine hotel by European standards, originally a high ceilinged palazzo with a incredibly beautiful lobby and the location is outstanding, right next to the Grand Canal close to St. Marks Square with direct access to a water taxi landing. We had a very beautiful guest room, very finely decorated including a walk-in closet and marble tiled bathroom. Pricey, especially the food and beverage. A drink in the lobby is $25, and they charge for WiFi in the rooms (not the lobby), which I thought rude considering the price of the room, but they only have about 60 guest rooms and an immense staff, so I can understand how they need to make their money somehow. Definitely worth the price if you can afford it.
