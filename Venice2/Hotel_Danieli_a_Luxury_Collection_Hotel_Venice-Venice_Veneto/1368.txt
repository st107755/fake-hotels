My wife and I decided to enjoy a meal in the hotel Danieli as we believed that any 5 star hotel would have a restaurant to match this however, was not the case. We ventured to the famed restaurant and were horrified at what we discovered. The food was at best from a bar/cafe in some seedy area. The end result was that the food was sent back and we were given the meal on the house. We were even invited to come and try the restaurant once more one the house...we declined and felt that even for free the food was so not up to par that we had better regroup - after all  THIS IS ITALY how can you not cook great food here...!!!!
