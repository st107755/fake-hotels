The front facing balcony rooms have the finest panoramic views of Venice the Grand Canal and the lagoon imaginable - bar none. The location of the hotel, again, is second to none as it is only 300 metres away from St Marks Square. The rooftop restaurant surely ranks as one of the best locations in the world and is an unforgettable experience together with both superb food and waiter service. The d√©cor, food and service is more than excellent and the price, whilst not cheap, is the best value for your money that you will ever spend anywhere in the rest of the world.
