We have just returned from the Danieli after a four night stay.  The interior of the hotel is lovely.  We had a nice Double room which was clean and comfortable but no view and we have had larger rooms in other hotels in Venice that were not as expensive.  Throughout our stay the Terrace was closed due to repairs before the main season starts.  This involved new sun blinds being fitted which blocked the view from the windows at breakfast and because of this we decided not to pay the high cost to eat here in the evening.  Staying at the Danieli is expensive and we were annoyed to find that we were being charged 15 EUROS per day for Wifi.  We had a couple of drinks in the bar and although very expensive enjoyed the experience.  This really sums up our visit enjoyed the experienceâ€¦
