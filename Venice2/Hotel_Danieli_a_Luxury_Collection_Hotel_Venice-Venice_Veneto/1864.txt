Stayed 14th february to 18th february and wanted this to be a magical romantic weekend+ for my partner and I. The hotel danieli delivered on this front. The surroundings were beautiful, the staff courteous and helpful and we were left to enjoy our time as we wanted, and when we were elsewhere, everything was made to feel perfect for our return. We did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment but if it was to the same standard as the rest of the staff delivered I'm sure it would have been delightful. We did have some wonderful cocktails in the bar at the close of each evening and the ambiance and music added soul to our romantic evenings. "If I fall in love...it will be forever...".  We have magical memories of this place, hope you find them too....
