Nice hotel  to look at, but we prefer a more modern hotel. The elevators are very small and the corridors are narrow and in the plenty of them orientation is not easy. The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean but for us a little bit too kitschy. The prices are high, but that is typical fort Venice
