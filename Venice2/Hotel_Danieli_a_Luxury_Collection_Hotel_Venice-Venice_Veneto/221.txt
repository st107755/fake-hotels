Good property, but lobby needs to be worked upon for maintaining standards. Rooms are beautifully done. Room service for breakfast is good, but dinner time was absolutely ridiculous. We ordered a Mac n cheese, the food wasn’t delivered and the reason we get is that they forgot. The Concierge team is one of the best I have ever meet. You ask for it and  they ensure it’s done. Special thanks to Mr.Luigi. Now the time to Checkout was not so pleasant, breakfast buffet was added when we dint have it. But they then took it off the bill.  With JW Marriott and St.Riges entering the market shortly, existing hotels will have to up the quality or will surely start losing Guest.
