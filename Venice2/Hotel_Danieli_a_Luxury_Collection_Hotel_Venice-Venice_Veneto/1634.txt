this hotel has one of the best location in Venise. It is living on his good (and old) reputation, but you can not only build your future based on your name or your reputation... The service must be perfect in a 5 stars palace...  On the last floor, the open terrasse, the nicest place, the service is unbielevable, very poor, the maitre d'. seems to be the owner, and when we ordered he did not have even a look at us... You have to wait 30 minutes before been served, and some of the guests do not wait and prefer leaving the place. Amazing ? Honestly, I am very disappointed by the absence of qualified service and they should renew their staff with some more motivated and professional people instead. The current staff has accumulated too many bad habits... I will never be back.
