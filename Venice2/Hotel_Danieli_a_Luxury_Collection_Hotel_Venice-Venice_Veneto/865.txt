This is our second stay at the Danieli and it never disappoints. Our family had 4 rooms all with balconies overlooking the Grand Canal. The rooms are elegant, spacious and exceptionally comfortable. Breakfast in the Terrazza Restaurant is fantastic. The service is impeccable and the food is abundant and delicious. Unfortunately, it was closed for a private party the night we wanted to dine, but the concierge found us a delightful local place that was perfect for our family. We booked through AMEX and had upgrades and wonderful amenities.  If you want to treat yourself to an experience of a lifetime, bite the bullet, forget the cost and stay at the Danieli.
