a special event warrants a special property to celebrate my 70th birthday in a special way i flew to venice, stayed at the hotel danieli and boarded the orient express on september 22, my "big birthday" last time i stayed at the danieli was with my now deceased husband, so it was a bittersweet stay, of course, the hotel is fabulous and the staff was lovely, the waiters on the roof top restaurant surprised me with a birthday cake just as i was leaving to board the orient express, a truly kind and thoughtful gesture obviously  very expensive property and worth it for a special event
