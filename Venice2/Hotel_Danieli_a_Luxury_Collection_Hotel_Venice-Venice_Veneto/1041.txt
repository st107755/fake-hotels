The lobby entrance is exquisite! Service was absolute perfection. For the best experience at this hotel, request a room with balcony facing the Grand Canal...then your time will be superb! Be aware that other rooms vary in size, and you could (like my friend) pay a lot of money for a small room facing the wall of the next house (she didn't want to pay anymore and was happy to eat on the outside terrace, but that was the highlight for my friend.) our room faced the Grand Canal, so it was truly Grand! It was a great welcome to Venice to see all the boats and gondolas from our room...and the terrace upstairs for the breakfast buffet is in a class all its own! The breakfast has anything you can imagine! A magical time!
