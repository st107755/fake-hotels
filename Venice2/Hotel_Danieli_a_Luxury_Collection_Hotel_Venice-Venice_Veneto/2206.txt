The Hotel Danieli is one of the most wonderful hotels to stay at. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel special, this is down to it's most wonderful staff and management. Nothing is too much trouble I love it so much I can't wait for my next visit and always book before I leave so I know I am coming back. I room with a lagoon view is a must, as is lunch or diner in there spectacular restaurant .for something for that special person this is a must .
