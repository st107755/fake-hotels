This hotel is supposedly rated a 5 star.   Unfortunately it did not meet our standards.  We booked it because our previous stay at the gritti palace was excellent.  This hotel was also part of the luxury collection by SPG and has been dubbed a sister hotel to the gritti palace.  Let me tell you that they are miles apart. The rooms were significantly cheaper and since we were travelling in a large extended family group, this hotel seemed to fit our budget.  Pre arrival- Was able to communicate with the hotel and did not have any real issues  Check in- was pretty uneventlful and we recieved our bags promptly.  Rooms-we were upgraded to rooms that faced the grand canal.  These rooms were larger then the rooms the rest of our family had...i guess i was upgraded because of my spgâ€¦
