I have stayed at The Danieli twice and what I love the most about it is the looks. It looks truly beautiful and really reminds me of the old time Venice. The restaurant upstairs has some awesome views aswell. The hotel is located couple of minutes walking distance from Piazza San Marco so that's definitely perfect.
