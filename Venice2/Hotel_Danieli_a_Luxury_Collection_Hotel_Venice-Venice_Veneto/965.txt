I've been to Venice five times, most on day trips, but 4 years ago we stayed at the Palazzo Stern.  This time we thought we would go even better and go to the Danieli for three nights. Big mistake. Our room was at the back of the hotel and very hot. Too hot to sleep in. So the first Friday night was not at all good. The hotel did take this board and it was better on the Saturday and Sunday.  At 7am on Saturday and Sunday morning (and at 0520am on Monday) we were woken by huge crashing and banging at the back of the hotel. This sounded like recycling rubbish being collected. On the Monday it lasted from about 0520 to 0700.  So very poor sleep.  We had a small glass of wine each on the terrace (18 euros each).  Great views but you are bombarded by a flock of pigeons every minuteâ€¦
