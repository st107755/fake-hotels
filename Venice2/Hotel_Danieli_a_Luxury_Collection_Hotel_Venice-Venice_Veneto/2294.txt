Firslty a private water taxi from the airport to the Danieli jetty is a must.  We were upgraded to a junior suite which was divine. Bed was so comfortable, a huge bathroom with 2 wash basins, plenty of cabinet space for ones things, a professional hairdryer, plenty of toiletries etc. Towels changed twice a day, bed turn down service complete with chocolates! Plenty of hangers and drawer space too, all as you would expect but don't always get in some 'luxury' hotels. Makes The Hilton and Grosvenor in London look like youth hostels. Yes the restaurant is not cheap, our food was divine.  Jaw dropping views from the restaurant terrace, what a way to start the day! Staff very helpful and polite. Location couldn't be better. The Danieli oozes character with a few corners knocked off,â€¦
