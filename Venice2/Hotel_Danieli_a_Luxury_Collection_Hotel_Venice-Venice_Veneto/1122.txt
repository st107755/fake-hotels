We stayed two nights here in mid-October.  I was told to stay at the Gritti Palace by a friend, but it was booked.  The reservation person suggested the Hotel Danieli.    What a wonderful place.  It's situated at one end of the Grand Canal, with a breathtaking view.  I've copied a panorama to this message.  This view was awesome no matter what time of day it was.  We were *very* near the Piazza San Marco.  There is a very wide area to stroll in front of all of these buildings and lots of activity all day long.    We were given a suite with two balconies facing the water at which we drank tea and coffee after our day's activities.  [none in the room... you have to call room service]  We could sit there for hours.  Morning breakfast on the roof was a full buffet with omeletâ€¦
