When we arrived we are “upgraded”.  When we got to the room we noticed it was very hot.  We called the front desk to have them check on the air conditioning.  No one came.  We went to dinner and came back to find the upgraded sweltering!  We called them and asked them to be moved.  We were moved to a room that was a little cooler but so much smaller!  I would not recommend this hotel.  Needs serious work on upgrading the rooms and air conditioning.  Very disappointed.  Not worth the luxury cost.
