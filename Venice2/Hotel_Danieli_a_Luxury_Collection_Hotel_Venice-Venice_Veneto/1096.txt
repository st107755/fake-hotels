We stayed at Hotel Danieli for 3 nights at the beginning of February.  This is an amazing hotel, in a great location.  As soon as you walk in you are met by concierge and as you walk through the luxury of the lobby opens up to reception and the bar/lounge to the left.  We were very well looked after, the staff were super professional and helpful.  This is a slick and well run hotel - our room was serviced twice a day yet we NEVER saw any sign of the housekeeping, near our room or any other, and we were popping in and out of the hotel at various times of the day.  We enjoyed drinks in the bar.  the cocktails are 18 Euros each but bearing in mind this is central Venice, a 5* hotel and the amazing service were did not think this unreasonable, especially with the nibbles and canapés…
