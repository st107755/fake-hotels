Stayed here for the first time and enjoyed it very much. Rooms (Deluxe) in the main building are nice and spacey by Venice standards and well equipped. Staff is very friendly, helpful and pay attention to details at truly a five-star level. Only the bar after dinner could use some overhaul in maybe a little bit more nice attitude, less snobbiness and definitely lower prices ... or a better selection. But 20 Euro for - at best - a rather average red wine is not right when the service is not at top level.
