Had a fabulous 4 day stay at Danieli - lagoon view interconnected rooms, amazing views, great shower and toiletries, an elegant decor. Yes, there are crowds in front of the hotel - but you get this in every single centrally located hotel in Italy, be it Savoy in Florence or Principe de Savoia in Milano. Yes, there is early morning noise - we had acqua alta one day, and starting at 6.30 workimen started putting up the barries outside. Perhaps installing 3-layer windows would solve the problem, but we didnt feel it as such - we knew we would not find Serenity in La Serenissima these days. Location is much better than Gritti - at Danieli you get to see the full expanse of the city, two seconds away from the San Marco, and we would always take a pass through San Zaccharia to avoidâ€¦
