Located right around the corner from St. Mark's. The lobby is great the staircase reminded me of Hogwarts. The room were  clean, but had old wall paper and carpet. The bathrooms were  more comtempory.  We loved breakfast on the terrace above the Grand Canal. The coffee was  very good and the selection on the buffet was fresh. Service was quick and friendly throughout our stay. This may not be rated high, but we enjoyed our time here and can recommend it to other families.
