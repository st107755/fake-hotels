After watching the movie "The Tourist" with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp I was desperate to stay at the famed Hotel Danieli.  It was magnificent and like staying in a living museum.  It exceeded all my expectations including the roof top restaurant.  Everyone was elegantly dressed and the bar in the lobby was beyond!
