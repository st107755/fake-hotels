We enjoyed a wonderful stay at Hotel Danieli, from the moment we arrived we loved every minute, our rooms were perfect and the staff were welcoming and professional.  The location is great, 2 minutes from San Marco Square, the decoration is pure Venetian opulence, our room was gorgeous with an amazing view of the lagoon (am I gushing too much... no!)  The breakfasts catered to every palate and the restaurant has a breathtaking rooftop view, to be honest you could spend have a day just grazing on brekfast and drinking coffee...  Whilst this is not the most budget conscious hotel in Venice it has to be one of the most special and worth every penny (euro) - highly recommended
