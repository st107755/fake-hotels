Stayed here after a Mediterranean cruise.  Staff were indiffernt, some unfriendly and some borderline hostile. A real anti American feeling permeated the hotel. Even the bellman treated us like we were bumpkins.  Rooms were outrageously expensive and the decorating reminded me of what you would expect from a Wild West bordello. Very negative experience. If you want bad service for an outrageous price stay here
