This magnificent hotel is situated in the heart of the most picturesque city in the world. It’s decor is tasteful and historic while being stunning and refreshing as one never sees this in today’s world.  Our room was exquisite and had every amenity we could need. The staff was superb having gone to great extents to accommodate our every need. All are to be commended. In fact, their care and concern would be reflected by an owner, not a worker. What a pleasant surprise!!  If it sounds as though we couldn’t say anything bad, it’s because we would be hard pressed too as nothing was wrong with this establishment .
