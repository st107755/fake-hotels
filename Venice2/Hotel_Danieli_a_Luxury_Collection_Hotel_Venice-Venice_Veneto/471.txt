If you are looking to impress first thing in the morning or last thing at night this is your place. The breakfast room Is al fresco and you overlook the lagoon ( gondolas and various boats) itâ€™s a restaurant at night so you get the same with pretty lights. Our suite Danola was perfect with canal view. Location is fantastic, 15/40min walk to Realto Bridge ( romantic pizzas/wine) depending on how many kisses and hugs you have on the way.
