During my visit to the Venice Bienelle .. I decided to try staying at the extremly unique antique hotel. It was only a few minutes walk away from all the galleries. It's very well preserved rooms make it almost living in a palace. Even the keys remain in their old designs. Dining is a must. It really felt living a an 18th century palace with a modern day service.
