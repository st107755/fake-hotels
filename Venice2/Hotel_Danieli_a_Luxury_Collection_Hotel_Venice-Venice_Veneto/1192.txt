My husband and I stayed in this hotel a few years ago.  It was a very lovely stay.  The customer service was magnificent.  They made us feel like we were very important people.  The hotel is very charming.  Our room was very small but elegant.  The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was actually a good size it had everything we needed, very clean and lighting was very bright.   We were offered a free ride on a nice boat to the glass factory.   I have not read other reviews so I don’t know if someone has already mentioned that hotel Danieli was in the movie the “tourist” .
