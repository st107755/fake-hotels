Danieli is an institution and it will always be. It is a historical place in which is a pleasure to have an overnight stay. Atmosphere, architecture, staff, view and location of Danieli are compensating for bathrooms a little bit out of time and their nice keys that sometimes give a little bit of headache to unlock the door... But this is still the reason to come back. Keep taking good care of this remarkable place
