I had a pleasure to stay at the hotel to celebrate my wedding anniversary. The location cannot be better, the hotel is just around the corner of San Marco square, right in front of the pier with boats from/to the  airport.   We stayed in a Venetian Style Room, which was gorgeous and improved even further our experience during the trip. The staff was very friendly and  always prompt to help (except one gentleman in the bar at the hotel lobby who didn't seem very happy, however it was the only fault and I believe to be one off).   We also had dinner at the main restaurant where the service was great. Despite the cold weather during our visit, it was very sunny and we had the privilege to enjoy a cup of coffee at the restaurant terrace with a great view.   Please use your commonâ€¦
