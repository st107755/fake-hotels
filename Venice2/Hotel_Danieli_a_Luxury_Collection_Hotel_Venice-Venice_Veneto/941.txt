We loved this hotel. My wife and I stayed twice in one week wrapped around going to the nearby hockey world championships. The first stay we had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal. Tremendous view. The second stay we had a jr. suite with a balcony over the canal next to the hotel. This was probably the most beautiful room we have ever stayed in anywhere. The free breakfast was an Easter Sunday buffet anywhere else, including an omelet chef. The hotel is an old palace that is stunningly beautiful. The staff is amazing. Truly 5 star in every way. They have lots of staff always on duty, so little waiting or wanting. They treat everyone like a king/queen. The location is one block from St. Mark's square, the center of activity in Venice. This is truly the place to stay inâ€¦
