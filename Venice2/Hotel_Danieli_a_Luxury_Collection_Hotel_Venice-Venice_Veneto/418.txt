Amazing in every way, from the monumental heurdouvres served complimentary during happy hour on Fridays in the lobby bar, to the ambiance and pure fact of historical significance, to the military level of efficiency in the rooftop restaurant....which would be the highest level of fine service I've seen in Italy.  Pricey, but worth every penny.
