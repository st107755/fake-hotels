The Hotel starts with a magnificent foyer and great bar with the best coffee I found in Italy. It was under repair so some things were a struggle but overall its a superb visit. Our room overlooked the Grand Canal and had a lovely view. It was a big room with a great bed and facilities. Breakfast in the dining room is a great treat, fantastic views and very good food. Would love to live there.
