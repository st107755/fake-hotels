Although the hotel must have been an icon in Venetian hotellerie, it definitely needs a new wind: it lacks freshness and staff seems as old and without spirit and ambition as the furniture. The setting and roof terrace are wonderful but the rates are exorbitant. The price/Quality ratio is out of proportion!  Time for a change!!
