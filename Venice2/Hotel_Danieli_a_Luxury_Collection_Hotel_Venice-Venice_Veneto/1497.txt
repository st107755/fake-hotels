If Venice is on your bucket list, then refine your list to include staying here. Sad to say we didn't, but friends who had, recommended that we at least pop in here for afternoon tea. Oh how glad we did just that! (I'm drooling at the memory ...)  When all is hustle and bustle and heat and crowds and more besides - stepping through the door into this haven is to step into an oasis of calm. Absolute bliss.
