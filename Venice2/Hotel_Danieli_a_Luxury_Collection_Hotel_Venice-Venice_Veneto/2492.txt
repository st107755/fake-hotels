We stayed there during April this year. As New Yorkers, the weather was kind of warm for us. We requested to have the air conditioning on but we were told that the heating system was still on so the A/C would not work. We had to open the windows but ended up staying up all night trying to kill the mosquitos, after being bitten for couple times. The concierge service was somewhat helpful, but not too friendly though.  Maybe it's because we don't look rich enough and we used the Starwood points for the free stay (but excuse me, we need to have 12,000-16,000 points for a free night stay and we stayed there for 3 nights). My other friends stayed at a category 2 hotel there and they had better personal attention and service than us.
