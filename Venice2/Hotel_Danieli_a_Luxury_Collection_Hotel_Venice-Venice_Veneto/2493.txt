I've stayed at the Danieli on each of my three trips to Venice. I obviously loved it the first time. I took some very good advice and each time asked for a room in the old building, not the annex, and I have never been disappointed. I did not have the money for a room facing the lagoon, but I was always rewarded with a pleasant room facing a small canal on the side. However, what won me over the first time was taking the hotel's private boat from the airport to the lagoon, then down that same small side canal to a little landing that led to the hotel's side entrance. That was it for me. Walking into the main lobby and looking up at the amazing internal architecture sealed my loyalty. This was everything I had expected from the world's most delightfully decadent city.  Breakfastâ€¦
