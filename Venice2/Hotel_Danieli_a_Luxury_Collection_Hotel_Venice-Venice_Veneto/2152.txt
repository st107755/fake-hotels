If you are traveling to Venice, this is the only place to stay. The rooms are beautiful and the breakfast and dinner on the terrace is such a wonderful experience.  The concierges at hotel are the best and what you come to expect from a 5 star hotel. Its such an elegant hotel , you wont be disappointed.
