This hotel is an iconic building. Being here it felt like being in a museum.  The room was quite small with over-sized furniture, but it's ok for a single traveler like me  Unfortunately I didn't get the room with a view due to budget constraint :-( Service was ok in general, but very good from room service.  The hotel has a few computer with internet & printer facilities in the lobby; free of charge - very good to print last minute boarding passes.  I was there during summer - it was scorching hot and like most buildings in Europe, the hotel aircon was almost non-existent, even in room.
