Personally - I was very excited to stay at the Danieli - I saved up points throughout the year to cover my parents and our room. The cost of the hotel paying without points is even more. I was simply - disappointed ... I am a SPG platinum member was not treated as expected or honestly well. Both rooms were small - tiny - and not nearly as luxurious as the pictures or the St. Regis in Florence. Our service was pretty awful we are treated at the lowest level people staying at the hotel both by the day to day staff but mostly the concierge - every time it seemed like an inconvenience. The location is great to get to the square - however - it means a ton of tourists. I wish we went someone a little nicer, helpful, comfortable and quieter. Lesson Learned!
