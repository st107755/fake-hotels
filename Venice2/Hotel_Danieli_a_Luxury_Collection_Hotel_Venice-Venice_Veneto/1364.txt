The Danieli is extraordinary and known to generations of Venice Travellers. The hotel is pretty much unchanged and does look a bit dated and things such as lifts are a bit hit and miss, but these are minor issues which fade away in the beauty of this establishment. The rooms are large and comfortable, staff are friendly and helpful and of course, nowhere could be more convenient, there is little to beat arriving by water taxi straight into reception. I have stayed in other places in Venice, but nothing compares with this
