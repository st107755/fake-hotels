We arrived on Monday 13th Feb and left on the 16th ! The whole experience was amazing all staff were wonderful and so helpful ! Our room was amazing with wonderful views ! Just a minute away from st Mark's Square ! The breakfast was second to none and the dandolo bar was lovely ! Yes expensive but worth every penny and we will be returning ! For an experience to remember stay at the Danieli !
