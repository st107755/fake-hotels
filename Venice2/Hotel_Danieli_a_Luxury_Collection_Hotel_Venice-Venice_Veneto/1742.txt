This Hotel is a truly romantic place where all senses are awakened and history surrounds! I have stayed there twice. The view from my room was amazing, I was informed that it was the viewpoint from which Venetian noblemen would once watch the arrival of merchant ships from the Orient with their wares. I had celebrated my Birthday on the Restaurant Terrazza Danieli on the top floor, and it was an amazing experience!
