Flawless from start to finish. Yes this hotel is not cheap, don't book if you're on a budget. But it's worth it, breathtaking for every angle. Gold status recognised, and well looked after. Will visit again, loved! View from room and breakfast area postcard perfect. Staff great and location can't be beat!
