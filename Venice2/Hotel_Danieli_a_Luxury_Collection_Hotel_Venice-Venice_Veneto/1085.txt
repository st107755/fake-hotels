When you enter the hotel, you will feel like Angelina and Johnny from their movie, The Tourist. Seriously, as soon as you enter the hotel, you will feel the luxury it brings.  The floor, since its made of wood, can be quite noisy especially in the middle of the night, when everyone is sleeping. The room we had, which was 4X (can't remember, but you had to go to 2nd floor, walk past that floor lobby, walk upstairs via tiny stairs until you reach the room. The room is so hard to look for, that even when we asked a housekeeping staff where the room was, she helped us find until she can't and just said that she's new there.   The toilet's bath tub is also leaking so when we took shower, there was water all over the place.
