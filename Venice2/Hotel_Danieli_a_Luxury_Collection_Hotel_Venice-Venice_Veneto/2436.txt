Memorable stay. Greeting at the reception on arrival was the quickest I' ve ever seen even though there were other people being helped by the reception staff. The decor and architecture in the lobby, stairs and hallways were extraordinary and quite interesting.  Our room was very comfortable but smaller than what we were expecting however I must say that we received a promotional price much lower than the normal one during Carnaval.  The bathroom disappointed me and I even recommended to Starwood that they change the marble tiles in the shower as they were showing some unattractive holes that didn't look natural. Also, I told them there should be some Murano glass in every room (chandelier for example) since we are in Venise and this is one of the Top hotels there.  Breakfastâ€¦
