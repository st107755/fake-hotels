I took my husband to the Danielli for his Christmas present 28 - 31 Dec 2006.  The hotel is beautiful and welcoming.  Our room was clean and nicely presented and fully stocked with everything we needed.  The concierge was very helpful and so were all the other staff. The mini bar was a bit expensive but aren't they all in the hotels.  I was worried by what I had read on trip adviser before going to the hotel but need not have been.   I certainly will be going back and would definitely recommend it.
