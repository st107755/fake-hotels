This was the start to our long planned "honeymoon" trip through Italy and the Danieli did not disappoint. From Being met at the airport and whisked straight to the hotel's quay, we enjoyed our stay at every stage. Our room, while not exceptional, was very spacious and comfortable. A respite from the busy world outside. The cocktails in the bar were delicious, and par for the course in terms of price in Venice. But the breakfast on the Restaurant Terrace was just magnificent in every respect. What a view, what a way to start the day in this unique location. There's plenty of good dining and entertainment around St Marks Square and you are on the doorstep of Venice, at the heart of a world heritage site. It was a great stay. Thank you!
