It was our bedroom that made this a disappointing stay. The shower was positively hazardous- water temperature scalding hot and handle so stiff it could barely be turned. You had to get the cold going full volume before attempting hot. Moldy grout, not very clean bathroom, super slick barrel tub so get out at your own risk! And the glass door on shower/tub wasn't a good seal, so the floor floods a bit.  Of course a 14th century building will have plumbing problems but we were in the newer section overlooking a side canal. The air conditioning barely worked. Internet was dicey in the room. Vacuum cleaners in the hall for most of the day.   When we asked for an adapter they sent a guy to the room who acted as if he'd never seen an American plug before, or an adapter. Reminded meâ€¦
