If you want to fell like a real king this is the place to go. We have booked a triple room and we had the privilege to stay in a junior suite. The view was excellent overlooking the lagoon. Don't expect an modern bed inside the room, but the atmosphere is great. Special price for the breakfast on the top of the hotel. food is fine but if you are lucky to have a sunny morning everything is perfect
