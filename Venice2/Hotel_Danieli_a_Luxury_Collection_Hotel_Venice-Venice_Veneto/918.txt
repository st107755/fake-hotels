We stayed here for a romantic getaway for our first visit to Vencie and what a lovely place. So much history, romance, and sophistication. Would highly recommend this hotel given the location, service and to really visit Venice in style. A gondola from the side entrance stepping into the hotel was the icing on the cake!
