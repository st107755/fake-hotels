I was fortunate enough to spend three nights at the Danieli towards the end of September. I had booked a deluxe lagoon view room and was very lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite.  I had dinner on the terrace the first night.....what a delightful experience. Superb view and extremely good food.  The staff were all welcoming and kind which made a big difference to me as I was travelling alone, 69 years old! I felt safe and comfortable. If you are able to visit Venice, I would recommend the Danieli, despite the cost I was glad that I raided my savings to stay there. Also, I booked the concierge water taxi to take me to the port.....again, it was worth every euro.
