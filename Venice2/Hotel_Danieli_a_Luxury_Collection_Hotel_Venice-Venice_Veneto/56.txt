We stayed at the Danieli some years ago and upon arrival I mentioned this fact at reception. We arrived early and had to wait an hour for the room to be ready and the receptionist booked us in the same room on level 4 with the balcony, overlooking the Grand Canal, as we had the last time we visited.  So the start of our stay was a wow. The hotel is beautifully appointed. Our room was outstanding & the views from our balcony were picture perfect. Breakfasts were a nice buffet and service was wonderful.  Our first night we dined in the hotels Bistro and enjoyed great service and good food.  And the location is just next to St. Mark's Square, perfect again.  Oh, the Concierge go out of their way to assist you with dinner reservations and transfers. Great team of guys.  Why goâ€¦
