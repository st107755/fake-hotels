I stayed last weekend at the danieli in a luxury lagoon view room in the excelsior wing. Having fond memories of a stay at the danieli as a child 30 years go, and happy to pay for an elegant venetian experience, I was truly shocked to see the room we were given - dark, dirty, electric socket hanging from the wall (which my 2 year old son saw straight away and tried to fix himself) within a 70s/80s style tower block with zero charm. The view is spectacular, albeit through windows which are chest high, so all my son could see was a black wall.  All this for €800+ is truly shocking.  I re-read the reviews on trip adviser and quite a few people have made very similar observations (although crowded out by suspiciously hyper positive comments), I wish I had spent time considering…
