We stayed at the Hotel Danieli for a few nights and it was great. The location is great, right near Doge palace. Only problem we had was that the check in lady did not tell us where to go (each person before us and after us had someone accompany them to their room, not sure why we didn’t) so we wandered around until we finally found a worker who was showing the people who were in line behind us where their room was. That worker gave us better directions and we found the room ourselves. Nothing like the service we had at the St. Regis in Florence or Rome. No one told us anything about our room so we missed out on the two free waters on day one as they were in a closet. Room was fine, nothing special however it was neat to overlook one of the water streets and see gondolas going…
