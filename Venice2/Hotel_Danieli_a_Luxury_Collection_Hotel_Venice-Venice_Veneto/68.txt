One of the worst rooms and experiences I've ever had. The room was below average, frayed carpet, old wallpaper, askew lights. The towels feel like they are from the Holiday Inn down the street vs. a 'Luxury collection'. Had to call guest services 3 times to get a simple vanity kit for the morning. The room is LOUD - might as well pitch a tent on the street go get the same experience. 10 years of loyalty / status meant nothing. Talked to several other guests at breakfast all of whom were disappointed in their rooms. Never coming back here again, and will actively encourage people to stay away. Anyone can buy a pretty building and turn it into a hotel but if this is what the 'luxury collection' has come to mean for Marriott / Bonvoy then Hyatt here I come!
