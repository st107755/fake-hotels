The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful as well as the view!  Be prepared to pay a 16 Euro cover charge per person, just to sit down.   We had a group of 4 for light dinner and drinks, and got a 400 euro bill.  (64 euros was the cover charge).  The food was ok, nothing special.  You pay for the atmosphere and the scene.   We weren't staying at the hotel we just came for dinner.
