A wonderful old Hotel like in a Movie. True 5 Stars!! High Quality Luxury in every Corner. Nice and polite People working there. Fantastic Rooms in typical Venezia Style. The Bar , Restaurant and Breaktfast were a Highlight to! It is just around the Corner of all Sightseeing spots and one itself. We will come back for sure.
