The hotel itself is beautiful.  The staff was excellent. The location is ideal.  Easy access for arrival/departure and the location allowed for quick trips back to the hotel during the day.  Sit in the bar for afternoon tea or a cafe and admire the decor.  An absolute must is breakfast in the upstairs restaurant. The view is fantastic and the staff was impeccable.
