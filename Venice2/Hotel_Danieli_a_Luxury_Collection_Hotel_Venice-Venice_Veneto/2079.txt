Four of us went in for a drink last week.  Yes the surroundings were impressive but the drinks were very expensive.  I was also upset that they would not give me the wi-fi code - only residents can use this.  When I asked for it - the staff were very dismissive.  I get the impression this is not the place to go for a drink only - perhaps you get better service if you are a resident.  Their attitude put me off ever thinking of booking there.
