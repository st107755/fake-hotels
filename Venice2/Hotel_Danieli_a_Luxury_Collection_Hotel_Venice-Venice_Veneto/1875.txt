We visited the hotel for  a long weekend in December. The experience was exceptional (as any other SPG hotels we have visited). The hotel is expensive but you totally get what you pay for.  Location wise, the hotel is next to the Palazzo Ducale, in Piazza San Marco, right in the historical centre, which makes it very convenient as everything is very close.  The building is an old Palazzo, very well preserved and newly referbished sending you back in time, feeling like living in the Venetian times. Our room was very luxurious and spacious enough. We had a partial view at the Grand Canal as our room was at the top flour.  The service in the hotel was top quality. The staff was very friendly and helpful with all our inquiries as expected from a five star hotel.  I totally recommendâ€¦
