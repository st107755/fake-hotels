This hotel is possibly the best that I have ever stayed at. The accommodation was superb, the staff couldn't do enough for you, the food was excellent, and the ambiance was quite unique. Of course it comes at a price but, for those on more modest means, it is one of those places that you are willing to visit and spend a lot more money for a special occasion.
