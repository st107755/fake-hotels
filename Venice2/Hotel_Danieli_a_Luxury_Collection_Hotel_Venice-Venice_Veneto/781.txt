Danieli is a timeless hotel that has kept its traditions in spite the velocity of tourism that Venice experiences on a daily basis.  It's close to all the tourist traps for those who want to sightsee and check the boxes and offers a great escape from the crowds after battling with the masses during the day.  If you really want to go to Venice than the Danieli is a great choice.
