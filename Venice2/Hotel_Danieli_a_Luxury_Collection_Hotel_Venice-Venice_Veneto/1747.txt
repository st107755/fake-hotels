A stunning reception, great location, two restaurant areas for breakfast, one has an amazing view over looking the Grand Canal. A truly romantic city that this Hotel will help any romantic holiday/break along nicely, I've stayed in 3 hotels in Venice all for business & this was the best location & views by far.
