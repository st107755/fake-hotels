We stayed for three nights on a Citalia package, the price for which seems to be far below the generally advertised prices for this hotel.  The building is magnificent and amazing.  The staff are all friendly and helpful.  Our rooms, in a newer part overlooking a small canal, were roomy, well equipped and very attracttive.  Breakfast on the terrace, looking out over the lagoon in the sunshine, is an incredible experience and not to be missed.  But we could not afford to experience the restaurant for dinner!  The location, of course, is excellent - and, in our rooms, noise free.
