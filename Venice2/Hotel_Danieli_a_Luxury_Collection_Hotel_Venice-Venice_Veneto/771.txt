It will be my at least 10 stay to this hotel. Me and my wife are maybe planning our wedding there. Every visit i get charmed by the ancient and rich culture that indulge this hotel. The service is #1 and the staff is very nice and helpful. Don't forget to have a Bellini at the main lobby bar. Thank you so muck and looking forward to caome back soon.   Dr Boutin
