I agree with another reviewer that the staff at this hotel are rude and surly. They do not smile and act as if they are above you. Some of the worst waiting staff I have experienced. Reception staff were helpful and nice as were Concierge. One restaurant recommended to us by Concierge had a very bad review so we cancelled our booking. Concierge said they knew of the reviews but did not agree with them.  I would rate this hotel as 3 star at best. Very expensive and lives on its reputation. Staff training in customer service is needed immediately. If you order a cup of tea in the bar it will cost 12euros for a pot of hot water and a tea bag that you put in yourself. Do not recommend and would not return. Better hotels and better prices elsewhere.
