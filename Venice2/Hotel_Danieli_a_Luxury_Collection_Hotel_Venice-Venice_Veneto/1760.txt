The magic Venetian palazzo overlooking the lagoon and San Giorgio Maggiore. Beautiful interiors, perfect location just few steps from San Marco, good service. The Terrace restaurant gives one of the best views of Venice. The standard rooms may a bit disappoint you but it is fully compensated by the atmosphere.  The higher class rooms are very good taking in consideration the age of buildings. Strongly recommended to get a feeling of the city.
