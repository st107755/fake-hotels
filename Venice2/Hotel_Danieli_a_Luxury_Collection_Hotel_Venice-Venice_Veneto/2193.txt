The Danieli Hotel is beautiful. Exceptional styling and wonderful antiques. However, be careful when checking into the hotel as the rooms can range from luxurious to broom closets. The room we had, 306, was tiny and had a view of a wall and ceiling vent. Very disappointing for over 600 euros per night. In addition, we were not afforded the chance to move to a better room.
