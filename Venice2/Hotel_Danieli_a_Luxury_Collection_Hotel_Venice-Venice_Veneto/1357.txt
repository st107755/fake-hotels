Very nicely situated in Romantic Venice, but woefully over-priced and over-rated.  Were here four days. Stuck in elevator once; took 15-20 minutes before help arrived.  Our room had a fine view of the shutters in the building next door.  Enough said.  Spend your hotel dollars this way if you must, but you can find better value elsewhere.
