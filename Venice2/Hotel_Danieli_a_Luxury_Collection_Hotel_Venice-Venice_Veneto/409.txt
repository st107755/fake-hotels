We had a twin room which was pretty tired and for the price lots of things needing repair. The lights had bits missing,  the main light had a cloth stuffed into the connection joining the ceiling.. Comfy beds and the nice little touch with chocolates and the bed turned down  was ok But to be honest we could have lived without it . Old fashioned and needed an-update as the Bathroom had very offensive tiles on the walls and a crap shower head. Tea and Coffee served in our room with no sign of a biscuit and over eager staff waiting to wiz away your glass even when you hadn’t finished you drink in the bar.. we were charged €16 for a drink one Night then € 20 the next night for the same drink....
