The Hotel  Danieli, formerly a Starwood, now a Marriott brand hotel is quite old, but beautifully maintained. It fronts on the Grand Canal and is a short walk to St Marks Square. The rooms are beautiful and we were fortunate to have a room on the Canal, with a balcony. We enjoyed breakfast as well as dinner on the rooftop restaurant and beverages in the formal lobby which has a piano bar. Take a good look at the chandeliers. Very beautiful. The staff was most accommodating and made us feel welcome.
