We stayed here for 4 nights in February for my husbands 50th birthday. I can't begin to express what an amazing stay we had.   The hotel is totally breathtaking, by far the best hotel in Venice. As previous reviews have said it is expensive to eat and drink at this hotel. (so is the whole of Venice!! ) But in my opinion it's worth every penny.   The service you receive from the staff from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave is wonderful. From reception to house keeping. Always a smile and a friendly hello.   We had breakfast at the hotel on 2 occasions. This really is a must if yr budget allows. The food is delicious with so much to choose from. The views from the terrace are spectacular and should not b missed.   The rooms are beautiful. Beds are so comfortable. Greatâ€¦
