Absolutely brilliant hotel with the nicest staff - we got upgraded to this gorgeous suite it was quiet peaceful beautiful environment - everything was perfect this hotel MADE our trip! We didn't order room service as it was so pricey - but breakfast buffet was great and they made eggs on order too and the terrace is beautiful the view is stunning ( when you aren't being attacked by the birds haha) - it was the perfect end to our Italy trip!
