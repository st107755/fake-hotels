Since the whole trip to Venice was gift for name day celebration i was quite ready to enjoy every second of the weekend. The hotel is actually amazing.The building, the location, the lobby and the views are spectacular. The restaurant was a little disappointing, especially when the prices are so overrated and after having lunch the food is not as good as you expect.We knew it already that the price for the breakfast was that expensive though we decided to have it the second day of our stay. The waiter place us in the indoor area (!) where we could not see the view and actually enjoy the rooftop. Later on after asking again to be moved outside,he was quite helpful and changed our table to another in the balcony area. Overall it was a nice experience though you do not get the 5â€¦
