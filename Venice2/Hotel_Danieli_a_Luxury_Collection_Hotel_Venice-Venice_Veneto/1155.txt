If you seek perfection, you've found it. Fantastic hotel, great atmosphere and staff. It looks very authentic and classic, but the rooms are still quiet. We stayed here during NYE and attended the party. So we only have some party pictures, but it was the most fun in a long time. Great view over the river, and very peaceful area.
