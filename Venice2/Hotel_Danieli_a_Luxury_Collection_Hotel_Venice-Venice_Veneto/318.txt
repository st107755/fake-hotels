You cannot go wrong with a Luxury collection. Obviously the property is oldie but well preserved a d Beautiful!! If you are lucky enough to get a room facing the canal you are in heaven ( i did not understand why would they close the curtains on turn down). All services are top, concierge super help-full. Location is unbeatable!! The only downside (not so down) is the rooftop restaurant that besides the OUTSTANDING views and pretty decent food (not fantastic) has a very stubborn maitre D' (who's behavior obviously ruined our night). I have to emphasize: the view is Unbeatable!!!
