Stay at this hotel should you want something different!  My first step into the lobby was wow. It was real stunning in all the way, just like the palace. The front desk person was so nice. And you would be amazed by its key. They were not using a keycard, but the key with a bell (very old and unique). For the security reason, this traditional key came with a little key security system in itself (do not much how to describe, yet it was my first time seeing this).   The guest corridor on the 2nd floor was wonderful. It was like I was walking along some palace-like museum in Europe. Also, please definitely check out the roof-top restaurant, and the view from there would not be able to find where else in Venice.   One little thing was that this hotel would be extremely extremelyâ€¦
