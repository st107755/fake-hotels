The Danieli promises to be one of the world's great hotels...but sadly not any more. This is not the fault of the location, five star plus, our lagoon view room fabulous (the bath though needed an Olympian effort to exit), the concierge were excellent, breakfast could have been perfect, but some of the staff seemed to forget to smile. No matter, my greatest gripe though was that the restaurant was closed for the week end (weddings). Yes, we were given two great recommendations by the concierge, but it was not the Terrace .On the Friday and after dinner, we returned to the hotel only to find St Marks Sq flooded. No one from the Council could be bothered to put up the raised walkways. Yes, it was fun to cross the Square in bare feet and trousers up...yes, no illegal traders toâ€¦
