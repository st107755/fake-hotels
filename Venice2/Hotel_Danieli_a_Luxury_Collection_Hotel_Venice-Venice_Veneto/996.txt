We had a wonderful stay at the Danieli in April. World class service, historic, fabulous location and the roof top terrace and restaurant are second to none. A room with a view of the lagoon is a must. We were able to keep the windows open all day and night due to the gorgeous spring weather and low tourists. I suspect in the peak season it might be noisier. Loved every night we stayed!
