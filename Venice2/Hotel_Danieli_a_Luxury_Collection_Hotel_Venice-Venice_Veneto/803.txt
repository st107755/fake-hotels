We booked into this hotel for our final 2 nights in Italy. Our fourth trip to Venice and this hotel has certainly made it the best.  We were extremely luck to receive an upgrade but even so the hotel is just an experience in itself. Sitting on the Terrace is something out of a movie and a lifetime experience.  We have had an experience that will never be forgotten - thank you Danieli!
