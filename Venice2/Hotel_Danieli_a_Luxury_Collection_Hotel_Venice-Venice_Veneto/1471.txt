I had a lovely time at Hotel Danieli in June 2014.  The property is beautiful and very convenient to most Venice sites.  We had a lovely balcony room that overlooked a small canal.  In late afternoon and evenings the gondolas would glide past below and often a gondolier was singing or playing music.  Such a quintessential Venetian experience.   The beds were very comfortable and service was excellent.  I will most certainly stay at the Danieli should I be lucky enough to visit Venice again.
