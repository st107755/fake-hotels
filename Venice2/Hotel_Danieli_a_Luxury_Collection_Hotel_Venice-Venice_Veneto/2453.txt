Arrived at this hotel for a pre valentines break, from the outside the hotel is nothing special but once we stepped through the doors the decor was amazing! I have never seen anything so nice in my life! Went to check in found it hard to understand the receptionist after about 15 mins he said he would show us to our room, I dont know if this was done to all guests or was he just asking for a tip(he didn't get one!) The room was in the new wing of the hotel but we didnt have a nice view the room however was big enough as we were only there for 3 days although T#the beds were so uncomfortable! The sheets were too starched which gave myself and partner a terrible rash from sleeping on them. I had to sleep on a blanket to stop my skin hurting. Breakfast wasn't included in our rateâ€¦
