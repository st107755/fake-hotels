This was a good choice among many great hotels in Venice.Our suite had a great view of the water and walkways,room was comfortable with good service.A step away from all the places to visit venice.The terrace restaurant offered exquisite Italian cuisine.The wine list offered had reasonable mark up and good collection to choose from.There is a cover charge of 49 euros to be aware off for dinner.Breakfast was ample and numerous choices.Staff was helpful to recommend other great places to eat.Recommend it highly.
