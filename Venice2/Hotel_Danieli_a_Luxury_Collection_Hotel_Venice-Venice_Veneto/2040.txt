Stayed here one night in the premium deluxe room.  Was given a very nice room on the top floor in the Casa Nuova block with a partial view of the lagoon from our windows. The room was very venetian an spacious extremely the bathroom.  It was also very good that I was given late checkout at 4pm. Service wise, the receptionist Frederica provide extremely friendly service on arrival and she remembered us on our Check out day. Very impressed with her professionalism and enthusiasm.  Well done!! The lobbies and corridors and stairs were all palatial. Would certainly return again if I can afford it again.
