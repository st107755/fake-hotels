My husband and I decided to stay at the Danieli during our 2 week vacation throughout central and northern Italy. We were not disappointed with our spacious and old world accommodations which  included a beautiful Murano chandelier in the center of the room as well as exceptional hotel amenities and attentive service. I do advise upon check-in that one request a room in the original building as we were initially assigned a modern room in the newer adjacent structure.
