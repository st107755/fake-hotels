Gorgeous , initially private home of Venetian nobility.., existed from the Renaissance era! If you would like to know how is feels to be a part of that old elegant luxury ,you might want to stay there for several days, it's not inexpensive but really worth it for the experience . It's got a good service and the squeaking stairs bring the old world charm ;)) the fireplace, the venetian plastered walls, the chandelier, the flooring ..all museum quality . If it's too expensive to stay, just visit to marvel ..
