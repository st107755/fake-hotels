The lobby has to be seen to be believed. It is just so wonderful.   Our corner room had windows facing two directions and they opened to let in fresh air.  The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was great also.   Breakfast on the rooftop was extra special and delicious as well.   The staff were great, greeted us as we passed by. We loved it.
