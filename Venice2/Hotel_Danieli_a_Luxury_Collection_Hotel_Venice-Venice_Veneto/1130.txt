This is just fantastic, especially for the price. Elequant marble staircases and coumns, tapestries, lavious furnishings.Their lounge and bar area is spectacular, but the drink prices are very high. The hotel employees are class1, the room we were in was small but very comfortable. Really loved staying here. Right on the water, with a water taxi stand right in front, and within walking distance of many attractions, this fine hotel is our best recommendation if you are coming to Venice to spend most of your time checking out the attractions.
