We savored our lunch at The Danieli every time we visited Venice (way back in the 80s and 90s). Sorry Trip Advisor makes me tell a fib on our visit date. We ordered a first course, dessert and wine for two and savored the view as much as the wonderful food. I can remember we spent about $100 for two which was plenty in those days. I can still close my eyes and imagine very clearly the entire two hours we spent. It was fun walking into that perfect looking lobby, riding the elevator to the open air restaurant and pretending we could have stayed there if we'd have wanted. Even the bathroom was fabulous! It's been years and I hope to go back once more. It's a bit disturbing reading reviews about poor service. We outsiders were treated very well. Thank you for the memories.
