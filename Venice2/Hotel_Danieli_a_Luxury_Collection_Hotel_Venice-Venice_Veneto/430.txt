Went there with my daughter. Booked two rooms and they said because I am an SPG member that they had upgraded us two room types. Really!!! Our rooms were next to each other which was a good start. However, my wife does not travel lightly, even for just a couple of days and the size of the room was, to be honest just acceptable. We had two suitcases. What was not acceptable was the wardrobe. When we looked the number of hangers was fine, except they actually took up all the room that was in the wardrobe. You had to get rid of hangers to be able to hang, just some of the clothes. The bathroom was OK except my daughters who when she went to take a shower found water pouring out all over the bathroom. We had bulbs in lights that were broken and the door handle to the room came offâ€¦
