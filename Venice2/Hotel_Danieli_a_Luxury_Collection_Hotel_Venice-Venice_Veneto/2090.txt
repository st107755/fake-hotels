If wanting to experience Venuce in its true light than this hotel is a must. We took a water taxi from the train station and arrived to the hotels private pontoon. We didn't have to worry about a thing from the moment we got there. Bags were taken care of, rooms were ready early and we had the nicest view. When you step outside the hotel everything is at your doorstep. Markets, shops, st. Marks square and restaurants.  The food and room service is expensive at this hotel so we just went to local restaurants.  I can't wait to return one day
