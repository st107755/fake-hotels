My wife and have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Danieli and it met all our expectations of a 5 star hotel. We arrived by water taxi from the airport which we arranged at the airport for 120 euros  rather than taking up the offer from the hotel for which they quoted 300 euros. Check-in was fine and we had a top floor room which we found to be well equipped and very comfortable for a historic hotel. The room wasn’t noisy I think due to its top floor location. We had cocktails and food in the bar which was excellent, perhaps the best Irish coffee ever. The location is great for accessing anywhere in Venice with Vaporetto, water taxi and gondolas available close by. We walked all over the city and nowhere is more than a wonderful 30 minute stroll through the narrow streets…
