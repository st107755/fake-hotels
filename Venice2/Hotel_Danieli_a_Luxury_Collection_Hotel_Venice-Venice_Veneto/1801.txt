The perfect hotel for experiencing the history and atmosphere of Venice. Location is the very best! Breakfast on the terrace restaurant is worth the view every morning over your coffee. the price tab is hefty especially if you consider the tv broke twice and one morning we were without hot water for 30 minutes. These problems were remedied immediately. Like with many high end hotels, all of the extras cost extra. It was insulting that Internet access was 6â‚¬ per hour. For this experience in Venice I dont think you could do better. We felt the price was worthwhile for a several night stay in Venice.
