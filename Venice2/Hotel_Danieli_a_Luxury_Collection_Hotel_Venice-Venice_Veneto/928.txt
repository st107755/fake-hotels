Wonderful lunch, my wife and myself felt our trip to Venice deserves a special meal and this didn't disappoint. Yes, it was expensive, but it came with everything you expect of a special meal. We had John Dory, risotto pasta and steak and each dish was wonderfully cooked, flavours pouring out of each mouthful.
