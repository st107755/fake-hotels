Hotel Danieli is the quintessential Venetian hotel and its lobby, rooms etc. have fully preserved the look and feeling of historic Venice but with new modern finishes and amenities, including new beds, re-done bathrooms etc.) It is moreover run by Starwood Hotels under their luxury collection so the service level is at the very top.  I can't of anything better than arriving at Danieli's pier along one of the narrow canals leading out to the lagoon in the hotel's own boat. Fantastic!
