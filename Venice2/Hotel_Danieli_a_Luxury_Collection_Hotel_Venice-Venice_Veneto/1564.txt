Stayed here with friends and was so very disappointed - found staff very rude most especially in the Terrace restaurant where we were made to fell very unwelcome. Started on arrival, reception was full of Americans checking in and the staff were lovely and took ages with each one - then came our turn. Different experience completely, we were rushed through check in  and not even given a smile or a map as the others had been given. that attitude basically continued throughout the weekend...shame as it is a lovely hotel but just do not book if you are from Europe - you will be made to fell like a second class citizen !
