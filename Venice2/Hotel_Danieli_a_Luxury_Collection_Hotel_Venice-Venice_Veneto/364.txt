Excellence in every aspect of this hotel. If you want some luxury and kindness at the end of your sight seeing day then this hotel is for you. We were at the hotel for 4 nights and from the moment we walked through the doors to the time we left we were treated with great respect and kindness. From the concierge, the reception staff, the waiters, the chef and the room staff, we received wonderful smiles, superb service and consideration. The bed was very comfortable and as we were on the fourth floor we heard no noise. Our stay at this hotel was memorable and the best we have ever experienced. Worth every euro.
