As Platinum Starwood Members, we were very impressed with the Daneili Hotel. The hotel has one of the best locations in all of Venice overlooking the end of the Grand Canal and exudes wonderful old world charm. If you are a loyal Starwood member, you have three choices while in Venice - Gritti, Westin, or Danieli.  We visited each one. All were very nice and you can not go wrong staying at any one of them.  But if you have a choice, pick the Danieli. Here's why: - Location- The hotel is within a short walk to all the major attractions. The Vaporetto and Water Taxi's are steps from the front door. - Charm - The hotel is made up of three beautiful palaces. The Danieli Excelsior palace was the most recently renovated, The lobby is stunning. - Rooms - We were given a beautiful suiteâ€¦
