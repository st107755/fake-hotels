I like this Hotel a lot. In fact, I've been there several times. I like the style, the details, the view, the magnificent atmosphere. Terrazza Danieli Restaurant was an amazing tasting experience. It has a special view over Venice, her lagoon, Palazzo Ducale and Grand Canal. Unfortunately, people smoke a cigar while you're still sitting on the table and the waiters behave with an "quasi" indifference that does not justify the treatment reserved for those who decided to spend a considerable sum of money in that place. But anyway, I like Danieli and I recommend it to those who want to experience the best Venice has to offer.
