You can't top the location of this hotel, located just around the corner from St Mark's Square. Our room was comfortable and quite large by European standards. The staff was attentive and very helpful. Free internet was available in the rooms, although it was somewhat slow. Breakfast is included with the (quite pricey) room rate, and the view from the rooftop restaurant is fantastic.
