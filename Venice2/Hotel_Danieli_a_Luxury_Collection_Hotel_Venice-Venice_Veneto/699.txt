The Danieli has a great reputation but the service and rooms do not live up to its standard. The location is fantastic and the main hall is beautiful (you can just visit it without staying there). However, the service is pretty terrible. For example, even though we stayed at the hotel and the terrace was open for a full lunch, we were not allowed to have coffee on the terrace for just coffee. That is simply not acceptable for a 5 star hotel. The rooms are also a bit aged and the bathrooms pretty old school which is not necessarily what you expect for the price tag.
