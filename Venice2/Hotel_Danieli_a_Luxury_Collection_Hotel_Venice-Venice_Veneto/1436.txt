Simply beautiful hotel. Exceptional service - do not miss the rooftop terrace. Go to the bar or restaurant, doesn't matter, just kick back and enjoy the view. Stayed in the Punta Della Dogana Suite, stunning. Highly recommend. Even if you can't stay, wander into the lobby, and then to the bar. The views will not disappoint.
