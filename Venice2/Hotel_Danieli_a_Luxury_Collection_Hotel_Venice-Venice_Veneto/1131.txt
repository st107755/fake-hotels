The location of this hotel is excellent but unfortunately it falls short of service. We always stay at 5 star hotels where possible and this hotel falls very short. We arrived at around 2pm and our room wasnt ready which was fine we were early so they directed us to the rooftop for a drink which we thought was nice however the lady at the rooftops reception said they were too busy and full when clearly there were at least 12 tables empty. We had a suite over looking the grand canal it was comfortable but tired and the bathroom needed a good clean , the shower also blocked up. For an international tourist destination we were surprised how little english the room service operators understood and always got our orders wrong. But the worst experience at the hotel was the conciergeâ€¦
