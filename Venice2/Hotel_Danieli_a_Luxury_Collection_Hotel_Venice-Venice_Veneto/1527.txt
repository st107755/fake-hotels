Our Venice stay was enhanced by the Danieli both for its perfect location and for its charm and service.  To begin with, the rooms are spacious, especially by European standards and comfortable.  And the breakfast service on the roof top restaurant excels for its view and for the morning offerings.  What a great base for experiencing the mood and beauty of Venice.  I can't imagine not returning to this wonderful old and charming establishment for its service, location and old world comfort.
