My family and I stayed in two deluxe premium rooms. I didn't think the rooms were worthy of any more than a 3 star rating. We travelled all through Italy with Venice being our last stop and I was absolutely disappointed with this hotel. The rooms were in poor condition with the air conditioning just barely working. We went out for a whole day and returned to find our rooms had not been serviced though someone had come in and left the televisions on. When my husband went to complain the maids rushed in apologising saying there was a misunderstanding. The only good thing I can say about our rooms is the beds were very comfortable with a turn down service and the location of the hotel is excellent. I would definitely not return to this hotel again and I would not recommend toâ€¦
