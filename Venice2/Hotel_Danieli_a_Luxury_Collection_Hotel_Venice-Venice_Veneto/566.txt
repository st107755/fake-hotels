We stayed here last year to celebrate my birthday as well as completing my cancer treatment.  It was absolutely perfect.  They acknowledged my Gold status and gave us a beautiful canal view room. This hotel is ornate and gorgeous in its old furnishings.  Right out of a fairytale.  The employees have the best customer service I have ever encountered. We were truly treated like Queens.  It had been my dream to stay here when I finally beat cancer and I did it, and it couldn't have been any better!   Grazie!
