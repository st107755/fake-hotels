Myself and my boyfriend visited the danieli once we read the amazing reviews on trip advisor, we were told that we could go up to the top floor for a drink as it was during the day, the views were beyond belief and the service was also exceptional.   You wouldn't be visiting for a midday drink if you were on a tight budget though, from memory one drink was around â‚¬20, but in our opinion it was worth every penny for the views!
