Just got engage & what a beautiful hotel to stay at, it's a magical place and already, my partner & I are planning to go back. We stayed for a few nights & it was a magical time, relaxing with breath taking views from our Luxury Lagoon room balcony. Excellent service & fantastic resturant upstairs Terrazza Danieli, having lunch on the roof top over looking San Marco. Thanks Hotel Danieli for everything & fond memories will live on.
