Staying here was like living a dream.  The whole place is spectacularly beautiful.  It can get a little dicey at check-out time, which will the small staff is hard to move guests through the check out process at the same time.  I'd stagger leaving rather than waiting for the check out time.    We loved the room which felt very different than most hotels.  Very familiar, palatial in its proportions and comfortable.  Of course, the last thing you want to do in Venice is stay inside, so I felt torn the whole time with sitting in this spectacular property and soaking in the history of it with the need to get out and see everything.  A wonderful place.  Great small touches make it a first rate place to stay.
