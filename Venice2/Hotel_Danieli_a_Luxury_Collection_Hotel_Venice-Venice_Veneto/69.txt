No doubt this hotel is elegantly appointed, but the rooms are exceptionally dark,  everything including buffet breakfast was nice but not exceptional and some of the staff especially the females were testy if not frankly rude. The location is great but Iâ€™ve been happier with other properties in Venice.  I would not go back to this hotel
