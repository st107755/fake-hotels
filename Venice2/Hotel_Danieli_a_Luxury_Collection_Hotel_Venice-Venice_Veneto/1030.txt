Superb location and a hotel of character and style. Situated just along from St Mark's it is ideal for sightseeing. The reception areas are beautiful; people enter the hotel just to see them. Bedrooms are characterful. I asked for a lagoon view, which on one hand was wonderful but brought with it constant noise from the boats and people passing by; not a quiet location. Breakfast on the outside roof terrace gives one of the best views in Venice and the selection of food was excellent.  The only downside was an evening meal in the restaurant for a special occasion. The food was very, very ordinary, the service only average and very slow, and the bill was astronomical. We had eaten in a top UK Michelin restaurant a few days earlier at a fraction of the price for much better food.â€¦
