Like another recent reviewer, I have been meaning to write this for a long time and have just gotten around to it.  The Danieli is like no other place i have ever stayed.  While I don't always travel first class, I have stayed at my share of luxury hotels over the years.  The Danieli is the finest hotel by far that I have enjoyed.  Stunning lobby, suite with a magnificent view, and cigars in the lobby bar - what more can one ask for.  The service is outstanding.  What ever we needed, they made happen.  I could go on, but suffice it to say that my next trip to Venice will include the Danieli.
