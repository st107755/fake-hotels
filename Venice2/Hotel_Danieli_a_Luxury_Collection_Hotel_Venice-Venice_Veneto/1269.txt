We stayed one night at the hotel and thank god for that.  Its an old hotel really dusty minimal natural light penetration really stuffy.  The room is big in size but the furniture bedsheet and bathroom are old and dirty.  The hotel is in need of refurbishment.  The concierge were rude and unhelpful they never really listened to you and they always look irritated.  There breakfast wasn't fresh eggs and waffle were not cooked on the spot they were part of the buffet and seemed soggy.  The hotel does have an ATM which was amazing and the location was great it was right in front of a water station and the gondolas stop, however I would not stay here again.
