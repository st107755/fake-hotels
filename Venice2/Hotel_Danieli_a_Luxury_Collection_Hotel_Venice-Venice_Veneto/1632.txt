We stayed there for 3 nights and it was wonderful! The hotel is beautiful and the location can't be beat. I loved having breakfast on the terrace every morning looking out over Venice bay and Santa Maria Della Salute. Our room was small but sumptuously furnished and the service was outstanding! I will return some day!
