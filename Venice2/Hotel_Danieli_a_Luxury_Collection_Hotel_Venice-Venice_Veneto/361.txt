Run don't walk away from this hotel. Rooms are old and dark. Keys difficult to use and AC very poor. Best part is the view from breakfast but the hotel is NOT worth the price they charge. We were really excited to stay there but we were much more excited to leave.  We had two rooms one booked with AMEX points. Two or three times they told me I'd used Expedia.
