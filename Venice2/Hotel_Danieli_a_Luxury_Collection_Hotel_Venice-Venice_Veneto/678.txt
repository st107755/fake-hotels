went there with the family for the eastern weekend. although this is a 5 * luxury hotel the rooms are old. clean, big eanough, they had rooms with connecting doors. bathroom is clean, old and small. probably this is the case with most of the 5* hotels in venice... on the other hand the staff is very friendly ! breakfast is on the 4th floor and if the weather is nice one can sit outside on the terrace with a beautifull view. really nice. the lobby is nice, shows the glamour of the past, it is quiet busy. so nice for people watching, always something to see. you can take a taxi boat from venice marco polo airport directly to the hotel. the hotel is 5 minutes walking from the san marco square.  location : 8.5/10 service : 8.5/10 food : 8/10
