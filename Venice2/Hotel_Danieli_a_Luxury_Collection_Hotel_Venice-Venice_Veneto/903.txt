We were on holiday in this SUPER very very beautiful hotel for 10 nights from 17/7/2016 til 27/7/2016. We had chosen for bed and breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful.We got an upgrade of our luxurious room on arrival to a suite Dandolo in the main building. Very very beautiful suite nicely decorated with glass of Murano. There was a nice attention ready for us upon arrival: a bottle of Prosecco. Our suite was very well maintained. The breakfast buffet was very good and there was a great choice of fresh food. The staff was very friendly with a courteous correct service. We have taken 2 times a dinner on the terrace of the hotel.The food was excellent with again a perfect service and we had a very beautiful vieuw from the terrace. This hotel is very well located,â€¦
