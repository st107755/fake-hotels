A stunningly beautiful hotel, great service and a roof top restaurant with one of the best views in Venice. The breakfast selection is huge and great quality. Made even better by the view.  We stayed in June so weather warm and no too hot. The hotel is perfectly placed as a base near to all the main sites and a welcome rest stop from all the walking trains of cruise ship visitors.   We didn't eat on the restaurant as there is so many great places close by to choose from. The menu looked good but v expensive.  We will be back!
