As others have said, the interiors of this hotel are just drop dead gorgeous.  It's a little creaky and worn, but people:  it's a centuries-old palazzo.  That's the entire point.  I booked using the american express platinum "fine hotels" or whatever so I got the bonus deal they offer through that.  In that context, I was very happy with the hotel.  We got a room upgrade to a gorgeous, extremely clean, enormous princess-worthy suite.  The bed/bedding was very comfortable.  The shampoo/shower gel/condition/lotion I thought was pretty cheapo and like something you'd get at a mid-range marriott, but that's a fairly small complaint and they offered a lot of other little bathroom amenities.  We got breakfast included, which is a very ample buffet with pastries, some savory thingsâ€¦
