The Danieli is a diamond not in the rough but in one of the best City in Europe. The location and the view position this hotel to see the best in Venice, it's people and water ways. The hotel's hospitality started when we first communicated from Boston Massachusetts with questions and arrangements for one night with two families of 4 each. The transportation that we ordered met us at the security at the airport and we all went through there process.  The welcoming at the front door to the interacting from all staff was fantastic. Smiling and never letting us feel like we're  a burden or this was just another day at a 5 star hotel. Our hotel room was very clean and presentable before and during our stay. The historic look of the hotel is appealing and compelling for us to returnâ€¦
