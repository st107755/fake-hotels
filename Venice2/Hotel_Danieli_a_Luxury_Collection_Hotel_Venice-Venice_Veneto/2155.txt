I stayed in the Danieli For a week with my boyfriend. The hotel was absolutely amazing and the staff were just beautiful. It was very clean and looked superb inside. The staff were always on hand to help and would go out of there way to make sure your stay was perfect. The hotel was used in the recent film "The Tourist" Feat Angelina Jolie. Although this hotel is very expensive, It is worth every penny and I would indefinitely visit there again.
