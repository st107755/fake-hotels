This hotel was our second destination of a week in Italy celebrating our thirtieth wedding anniversary and, quite simply, it was superb.  Our suite was sumptuous, the surroundings beautiful, restaurant Danieli magnificent and the hotel staff were delightful.  From entering to leaving the hotel oozed pure class and we would most gladly stay there again.
