Stayed here for 4 days and we had a suite which was massive. Very quiet and could have been brighter.  In the evenings they have a piano player who sings along which is quite nice when you’re enjoying your nightcap or having a drink before you go out.   They have their own stage so easy to get a direct transfer from the airport. We came in and left by speedboat.  Evrything in Venice is expansive but the additional £80 each that we payed for breakfast each day was just plain ridiculous. The rooftop restaurant where this is served is one of the best views of Venice but if you decide to eat outside then expect to be attacked by sea gulls. Much better to stay in. They will make anything you want but most have eggs in some form and unfortunately people take cold food and take it away…
