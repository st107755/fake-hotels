Great location just off of St. Marks Square. Our room overlooked the lagoon and we could have spend our entire three days looking out the windows. The rooftop terrace had an even better view and the food was sumptuous. The lobby is decorated with beautiful Murano glass chandeliers and our room even had smaller versions. The staff was very friendly and we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of prosecco in an ice bucket with some local biscuits on the side. A wonderful experience in Venice's finest hotel.
