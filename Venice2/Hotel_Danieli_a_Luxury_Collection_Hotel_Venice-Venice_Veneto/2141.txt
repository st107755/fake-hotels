This is a Starwoods? Although the web-site looks great and it has all that history - this hotel is not worth the price or the reputation it has.  Service is lax - Check-in took forever - the front desk is understaffed - two people being waited on and two in line in front of us. 45 minutes later, once we were "checked in" we're then told the room wouldn't be ready until 3:00 (it was noon) - all done without a trace of customer focus or care present in the process. It was 6 am for people arriving from the states - no attempt to say that they could get our luggage so we could switch into more comfortable clothes - where we might be able to go to eat (the roof restaurant) - nothing - just that the room would be available at 3, and then "Next!",  The buffet breakfast was $52 eurosâ€¦
