For location it doesn't get much better.  It's about one hundred feet from the start to St. Marks Square.  This is a beautiful hotel and you will take many pictures inside the hotel as well as out.  We got an upgrade for being SPG Gold and the room was really nice and roomy.  You are only a walk away from most anywhere in Venice.  You are very close to the largest public boat ride area in Venice, from there you can get to anywhere in the Venice/mainland area.  We had a room in the back of the new building, which put us very close to the back of St. Marks and were able to lay in our bed and listen to the church choir singing on Sunday afternoon, so nice. Do not eat at the hotel!!!!!  As a general rule for our first night at a new hotel in a new area, we always order room serviceâ€¦
