Reception rooms and wonderfully grand and it has a good position on the Lagoon. Fabulous view from the roof terrace restaurant too. But it is soo expensive!! Coffees, drinks, snacks, meals are all exorbitant. I stayed in the Monaco in 2018 and preferred it hugely... still wonderful position, terrace and views but not such a rip off.
