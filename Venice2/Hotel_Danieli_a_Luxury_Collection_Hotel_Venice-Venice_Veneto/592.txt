if you have seen the movie The Tourist then you have seen this hotel, its absolutely beautiful and it has an amazing roofdeck bar/restaurant. Its not only a thing of beauty but its located near lots of restaurants and bars and you dont have to walk far to eat or drinks if you prefer to venture out of the hotel.
