Had an amazing stay for 2 nights at this incredible, historic hotel.   We had an ocean view room that was accessible by a small flight of stairs, which was fine for us.  The room was small but very lovely, nicely accommodated and with a view that is second to none.  The location is also second to none - right next to St. Mark's Basilica and San Marco Piazza.  This is one of our favorite hotel experiences ever and we hope to stay here again.
