This hotel has one of the best location in Venice, 100 meters form Piazza San Marco and 50 meters form Dodge Palace.  The building is amazing, very nice entrance, nice corridors, and wonderful terrace at the roof, where you will take a very complete breakfast, with a lot of fresh fruits, and I love it.  You can see the Lagune of Venice during breakfast and the view is lovely.  My own regret is about rooms.  For me nothing special, I was really expecting something very comfortable for this price (1800 â‚¬ / night, written on the door ... !) it's of course not what I pay but ...  You will not find adaptor for electricity in your room, the mini bar is very poor, bathroom, also ...  You like luxury rooms, don't choose this hotel
