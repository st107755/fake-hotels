My sister and I went to Venice in October of 2007 for my job. The hotel was in an amazing location. It has it’s own dock so the water taxi can drive right up, which is a huge selling factor as I saw many tourist walking across town rolling their bags.    The hotel was very pretty and old fashion. Our room opened up to a canal–which my father laughed about because anyplace else and it would have been an alley. We often heard singing as the gondola drivers passed by. Our room was very pretty and the bathroom was large enough to handle us both getting ready at the same time! (Not an easy task for doing hair, make up etc.) I would rate the hotel pretty high based upon location, look, comfort, etc. It is not a modern hotel, but when you go to Venice that should not be what you are…
