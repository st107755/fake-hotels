Attention please! The pictures Danieli Hotel do not reflect the real situation.  We visited Danieli spring 2012. We came at 2.45 p.m., but our room wasn't ready yet, since check in time at 3.00 p.m. We waited in a hall 45 minutes, but nobody not came to us and not told  what the room was ready.  When we finally got into the room, we were shocked. The room was dirty, the cracks on the walls. But the worst thing was the bathroom, dirty sanitary, rust, mould and fungus. Safe in the room did not work. We are told about this problem to room service, but the master came only an hour later, but he couldn't to repair the safe. Agreed that the master would come the next day from 10 till 11 next morning, when we'll be in the room. We waited until 12 but no one came. We went for a walkâ€¦
