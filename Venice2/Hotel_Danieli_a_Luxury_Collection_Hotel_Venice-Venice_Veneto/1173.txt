Rooms are small, that's standard for Venice, but the decoration in both rooms and the lobby, lounge are nothing short of spectacular. This all comes witht he commensurate price tag of course. Don't expect to be gushed over because you sprung for the digs, they have Johnny Depp and the like as guests, so they are not impressed by mere mortals, however the professionalism of the staff and attentiveness if you are a guest is stirling.  Will stay again, if my credit card can stand it.
