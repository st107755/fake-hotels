This is a beautiful historic property and I appreciate that we were upgraded to a suite using our Marriott Suite Night Awards. The hotel is in a great location with amazing reviews! The front desk staff are very nice but the concierges were rude and  always made us feel that we were asking a stupid question or bothering them. We had a slight hiccup after checkout when we realized there was a bar charge that wasnâ€™t ours. We called the hotel and they promptly took care of it right away.
