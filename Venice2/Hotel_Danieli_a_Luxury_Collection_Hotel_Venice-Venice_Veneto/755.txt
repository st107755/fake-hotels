We have been so very fortunate to stay at amazing hotels over the years, but, (although there are close seconds), for many reasons the Hotel Danieli is our favorite hotel in the world.  All together we have had four magical stays there beginning in 2004, and we are counting the days until we will return to celebrate our  wedding anniversary there next October.

Unbeknownst to us, our visit coincided with the 900th anniversary of the Arsenale and on our second night, to our great surprise and delight, the sky lit up with fabulous fireworks which we could view from our balcony.
