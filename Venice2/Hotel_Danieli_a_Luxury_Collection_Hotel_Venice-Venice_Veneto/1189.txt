My wife and I visited Venice for the first time and stayed at the Danieli Hotel. We transferred from Marco Polo airport by private water taxi, expensive but the only way to arrive if you want to arrive in style. Door to door. Check in smooth and receptionist showed us to our room. Try and get a room in the older part of the hotel. Terrace restaurant on 4th floor is where they serve breakfast and a definite Wow!. The view is worth making sure you breakfast on the terrace if the weather is fine We had dinner there one evening, expensive but great food, lovely wines and attentive staff. Well worth it if your budget allows.
