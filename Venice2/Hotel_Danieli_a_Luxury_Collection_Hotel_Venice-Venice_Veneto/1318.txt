From the moment we arrived we were made feel welcome and valued. Our suite over looking the Grand Canal was wonderful. If you can afford it I recommend upgrading to a suite with canal views. Opening the windows onto the Juliet balcony and hearing the sounds from the canal boats and people below.   We ended aperitif each evening downstairs in the lobby bar, highly reccomend a Bellini pre dinner.   Fantastic location within walking distance of all major sites.   I will definitely be back.
