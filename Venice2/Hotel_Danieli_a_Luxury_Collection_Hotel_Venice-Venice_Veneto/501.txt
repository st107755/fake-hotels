This was everything we read it would be, from the welcome you receive from the front of house staff right through to the old world charm of different floors, bars and rooms. The d√©cor is beautiful as befits a top range hotel. The views from the room of the Grand Canal take your breath away , but this means that the room can be noisy if staying at the front. If we go again and the budget allows we would look at one of the quieter months just so we could experience maybe some of the tranquillity that was missing.
