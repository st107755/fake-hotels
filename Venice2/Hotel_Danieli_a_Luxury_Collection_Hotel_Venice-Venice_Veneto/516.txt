We were guests for four nights! The booking was for the Dandolo Suite: The first morning we were awakened by construction at a neighboring building with pounding at 7:30am. The hotel confirmed the noise, and upgraded us to the Greta Garbot Suite. It was spectacular, gorgeous appointed, Large living room overlooking the Main Street and Grand Canal. Beautiful bedroom, bathroom, walk in closet with wonderful towels, soaps, double sinks and walkin shower and separate tub. Spectacular! The service in the hotel from the turndown, maids, concierge, and desk teams was superb. The follow up when asking for a service by phone was exceptional. The bar, breakfasts on the terrace too was excellent.  We would always choose to return, as the hotel facilities, staff, are truly World Class andâ€¦
