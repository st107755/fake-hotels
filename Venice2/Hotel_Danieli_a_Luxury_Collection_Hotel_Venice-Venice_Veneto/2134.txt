I only stayed here for 2 nights. It is a beautiful hotel. This is not a modern hotel. Do not expect a normal SPG experience, if you want that pick a newer hotel.  However this hotel fits the city perfectly. It has atmosphere and style. I loved it as did our clients.  Breakfast on the terrace is a fantastic experience. It was beautiful. The room I had was small but comfortable.
