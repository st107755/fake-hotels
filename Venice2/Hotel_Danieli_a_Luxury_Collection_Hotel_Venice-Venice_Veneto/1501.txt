Another year another wedding anniversary city break, this one No:10 (aye 10!), so we decided to go to Venice and stay at the Danieli (21st to 26th Sept) as the perfect way to celebrate this anniversay, and from the very start we were not disapointed.  After arriving we were warmly welcomed by Reception, who knew that it was our anniversary, and shown to an amazing room (365) with separate living area, bedroom and closet area (pics attached).  The hotel was stunning with all staff smiling and happy to greet you and talk to you.  Breakfasts were incredible, with a view to die for, great cooked and cold foods, breads, cooked eggs, fizz, coffee the lot.  Fantastic array of foods.  We didn't eat lunch or dinner there but made use of the outside terrace after spending a hectic dayâ€¦
