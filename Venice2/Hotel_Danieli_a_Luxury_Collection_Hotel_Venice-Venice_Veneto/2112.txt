Stayed here for two night pre cruise, booked through otel.com for an unbelievable rate of about 50%0ff which made my stay here even better value for money. Although Venice is a zoo during the day, to experience it at night and early morning from the hotel made up for it. Made up of a number of old palazzos dating anywhere from the 15th to the 18 century it is a very quirky hotel and would not suit those looking for a hilton or weston hotel experience but more with a sense of history and style. Breakfast on the roof top terrace was worth the entry price alone. Beautiful hotel, perfect location, exceptional staff who went the extra mile, all added up to a fabulous stay that preceeded a dream cruise.
