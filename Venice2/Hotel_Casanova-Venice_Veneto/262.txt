The only plus for this hotel is its  location. The service from the front lobby staff was very poor. They were most unhelpful, in fact rude when I referred to a sent email asking for a specific room within this hotel. One would think that for 300 Euro a night and 3 weeks notice this small request could be accomodated. But no. I stayed 3 nights. The room was clean, upstairs fronting the street. The bathroom facilites were not of a 3 star hotel. Antiquated hair dryer a trickling shower that you had to hold. Then there was breakfast. One cup of coffee was all that was allowed. No cereal just a yoghurt and croissants. The pillows were like hardened clay. We were there early September 2011 and the days were hot but the air conditioner did work.
