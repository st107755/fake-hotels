I booked this hotel at the last minute, despite the previous review, as I needed a room for 4 and the other options were the Lido or Maestre. Firstly, the staff is very pleasant and helpful, but this and the location are the only positives. The owner/s need to spend some money on this hotel. The room(335) and corridors smelt fusty .The room itself had: a dirty stained carpet, with no indication of the last time the edges and corners were hoovered; blood stained walls, from squashed insects; "utility" furniture; a shower that was like a hose and had to be hand-held because it slipped down the pole; dirty windows and frames and peeling paint on the shutters. The air-conditioning was only switched on between 6pm(approx) and sometime in the night, because it was always off at 7am.â€¦
