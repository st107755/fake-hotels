This hotel is a 5min walk from San Marco water taxi stop. The location could not be better, as you are close by San Marco square, restaurants, shops and the streets and canals that make up what Venice is famous for. At 153 Euros, including breakfast, it was very affordable. Our room was enormous, very comfortable and had a luxurious feel. Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The only downside, was there was no secure room to leave our suitcases on the last day of our stay while we had our last look around being leaving Venice.  However, we were able to leave our laptop bags in the office which we were happy to do.
