I really appreciated the location of that Hotel, very near the Piazza San Marco, and also near many good shopping! The Hotel has a nice lift and offers free wireless Internet in the lobby. The only bad thing i can say about that hotel, is about the shower in the bathroom, my room was located in the 4th floor (top floor) but the force of the water from the shower was very weak!
