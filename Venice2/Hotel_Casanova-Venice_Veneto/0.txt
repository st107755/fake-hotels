We stayed one night in the centre of Venice before moving to an apartment on one of the islands. As this was our first trip we were thrilled to be able to stay so close to the main sights.  The hotel is a stone's throw from St. Mark's Square and a short walk from the Rialto Bridge too. In fact, after taking the boat from the airport we popped to see both before we checked in.  The hotel had charm and was comfortable, the buffet breakfast (in a time of Covid, you point to what you want and the staff give it to you) was decent and the location was fabulous.  The only thing I'd change is that when we wanted to leave our bags for a few hours the next day after checkout, the only area we could leave it had no lock and was even out of sight of the reception desk- it would be nice if this was changed.  Apart from that, wonderful.â€¦
