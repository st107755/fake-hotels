The location is approx 100m from Piazza San Marks square. So very good for access to that sight, however it's over to one side of the city a better location for a stay is close to the ponte Do Rialto. The biggest issue was the entrance door closes with the biggest bang ever. I could feel the reverberations in my chest and kept waking us up during the night and early in the morning. Reported but not resolved. Room was a very generous size beautifully decorated, plenty of clothes space for a long weekend. Quite clean but a few dust bunnies in the less seen areas. Ensuite was also a good size and clean. Negative points, toilet roll holder already broken and had not been replaced. Shower fittings so loose I thought they would fall off at any time. Shower temperature very cool - coldâ€¦
