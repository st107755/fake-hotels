I have visited Venice on several ocassions. I normally stay close to Rialto bridge. On this particular vacation I was traveling with a party of 7 including people over 80 years old. I needed a hotel that was close to St. Marks Square and a water taxi bus stop. Short walking distances were important. The Casanova satisfied our requirements. The Casanova hotel is a very old hotel in a great location. The rooms are basic and small. The hotel is not sterile like typical hotels, but it has character.  Breakfast is a typical European continental breakfast. Free wifi is available in a room just off the lobby. There is an ATM located halfway between the Casanova hotel and the water bus stop which is only a two minute walk away. This ATM is positioned to provide extra safety to customers.
