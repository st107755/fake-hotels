Once we found the hotel after getting off the water taxi, we were greeted by a very friendly concierge. She allowed us to stow our bags while we went off to explore and wait for check in. We had no idea when we booked that we would be so close to Saint Mark's square! Only about 1 block and we exited into the massive open space with the spire, Saint Mark's Basilica and the palace right in front of us.  After checking in we went to the room to rest for a while. The halls and elevator are very small, but everything is small by necessity in Venice. The room was nice, though the shower head was disappointingly mounted so low you had to take the handle and hold it over your head to bathe. I don't take any points off for this though, as Europe just has no standardized bathroomâ€¦
