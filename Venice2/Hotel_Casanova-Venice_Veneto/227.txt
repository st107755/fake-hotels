Excellent location, close to San Macro and the pier by a short walk. Clean and tidy. A glimpse of the canal through the window.   Please be minded that the lift serves upto 4th floor. You need to take the stair for the 5th floor. Breakfast is bread basket with yogurt. I don't enjoy much but I guess it's quite common in Venice.
