Coming from New York City, my slightly snobby friends and I are very critical of hotels.  This hotel was a hit.  St. Mark's square (which houses almost every attraction in Venice) is 1.5 blocks away.  This was actually the closest hotel to the square that we saw.  Great price, very clean--- very nice bathroom.  A/C works well.  Very cozy--- liked this hotel a lot--- would def recommend to anyone going to Venice, and would stay there again without hesitation.    Not a 5 star (by the way some of the 3 stars are better than the 5 stars in Rome)--- but a great hotel in a great location--- highly recommend.
