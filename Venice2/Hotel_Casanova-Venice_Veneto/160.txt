My husband and I and our friends were here January 24 to 26th. Although the official website for Carnevale indicates that this is when it starts, most of the people in costumes aren't there until February. The hotel is near Harry's Bar and close to St. Mark's Square. The rooms were quite utilitarian and the breakfast was good. Our friends had a room that was difficult to reach and they were not very happy with the accommodation. We thought it was fine. The price was great. The location excellent.
