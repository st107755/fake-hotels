My daughter and I had a wonderful 7 night stay at the fabulously located Casanova Hotel. Staff polite, informative and courteous; twin room (2nd floor - lift, good size, air conditioned and very clean) looked down the Calle Vallaresso; breakfast OK but got a bit repetitive. Not a cheap option, but this is a prime location in Venice. I'd happily stay at the Casanova again.
