Superbly located within easy walking distance of St Marks Square, luxury shops, many restaurants & water taxis.  Excellent breakfast.  Spotlessly clean & comfortable rooms.  Regrettably, we had no hot water for showers for 4 full days. Management did not pro-actively keep residents informed, lack of communication very disappointing.
