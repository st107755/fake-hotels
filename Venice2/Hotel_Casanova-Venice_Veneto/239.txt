Ok... this was my second stay at this hotel...Great location and I decided to revisit because I had two friends with me and was concerned about trying anything new within easy walking distance of St Marks.  Love Venice and when I return will try one of the many small hotels around this area. Hotel Casanova is clean but rather "shabby"....and it deserves better attention and some TLC. We appreciate all the quirkiness and antiquity of Venice but the ambiance also has to be considered when you are settled in for a few days of glorious sightseeing.
