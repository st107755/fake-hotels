The location is great; being close to St marks every queue can be aced if you are up to early start. The breakfast is complete and fine selection of cold cuts, cheeses, eggs and bacon  for the really hungry. Plenty of non meat choices and really quite brilliant. Wd wonderful for an early riser to catch the first rays of sunrise over the eastern lagoon though one has to get about 1.5 km to the eastern end of the spit.  It was great to have a very empty Venice before the crowds appear after 10 am.  The rooms can be claustrophobic but we had a choice as we were relatively long stayers: so escaped the first offered for one on the upper floors with a sliver of a view of the canal.  Cleanses and maid service excellent and well worth the price for Venice.  Also close to the waterâ€¦
