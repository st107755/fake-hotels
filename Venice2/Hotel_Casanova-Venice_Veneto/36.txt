The location is great - very Close to St. Marc square which represents the touristic center of Venice. The room was nice and clean, the breakfast was fair. What I liked best is the easy accessibility to the hotel and the surrounding places. The staff are very friendly and they helped us getting a ride when leaving. Recommended for a good stay and affordable price.
