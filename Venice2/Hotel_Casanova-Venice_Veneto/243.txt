I spent 2 days at the Hotel Casanova. I have to say the service was great, good breakfast. Everyone was very cooperative and ready to help u anytime. Plus the directions given on internet to find the hotel were very good, it took me only 5 min to get to the hotel from San marco stop. 2 min walking from San Marco! I vivid suggest this hotel for staying in Venice. It was a great time!  Giovanna
