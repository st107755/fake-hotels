Best thing about this hotel is its location. Extremely convenient to get around with shops and restaurants within a stoneâ€™s throw away. The nearest station for boat ride is St Marco and the hotel is just around the corner within approximately 150m walk. The room is cosy and very basic. There is no kettle to boil water nor is there iron in the room. Breakfast is pretty satisfying with a decent spread. Do not expect any luxurious five star treatment. In my opinion, this is a value for money hotel with great convenience
