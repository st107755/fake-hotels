Perfectly located (right by the Piazza San Marco), clean, large and beautifully decorated rooms, comfortable beds, no noise, friendly staff, fast enough wifi. And all at a reasonable price.   Would have given Hotel Casanova 5 stars had it not been for the surprisingly uninspiring breakfast. Sure, you had the usual items, but they tasted nothing. Bread, cheese, cold cuts, eggs... No taste. I suggest swapping supplier and perhaps also the cook.  All in all, a very pleasant stay. Will come back for sure.
