Hotel Casanova has a fantastic location, right behind Piazza San Marco.  The rooms were remodeled and they are quite big rooms for Venice. We had a king size bed which was very comfortable and the shower was great.  Very good breakfast too, included in our stay. Nice and friendly staff. The view from the room was great! We could see the narrow and charming streets of Venice and we had a glance of the Cannal. We will definitely stay there again and we highly recommend!
