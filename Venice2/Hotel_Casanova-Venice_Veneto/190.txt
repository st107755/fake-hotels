We visited Venice in 2014 and a big part of the enjoyment of this great city was our stay at Hotel Casanova on San Marco.  The location is convenient to both city and beaches and the villa type rooms has an old world charm with all modern conveniences.  This made our 4 day stay in Venice more than a vacation.  The breakfasts were complete and the proximity to great restaurants and the water taxis was helpful.  I do not think one could do better if he wants a true Venetian experience.
