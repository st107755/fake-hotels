Stayed here just for one night at the end of a cruise.  It's a perfect location in the middle of San Marco.  We arrived early but they allowed us to leave luggage and go out to explore.  The older man at check in was a bit grumpy but Lucas was a lovely young man who helped take the luggage upstairs and was very chatty and friendly.  Rooms are a little dated with old fashioned furniture but clean and spacious and the bed was comfortable.  Air con wasn't brilliant which resulted in us needing the windows open and being woken a number of time by people shouting in the streets below.  Breakfast was really good with an excellent choice of both hot & cold food.  Lots of bread in different forms, fruit, meats, cheeses, yoghurts, nice coffee machine.  All self service so you could getâ€¦
