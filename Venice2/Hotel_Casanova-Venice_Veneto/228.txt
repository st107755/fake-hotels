For a stranger visiting Venice for the first time this is an excellent choice.  Located very close to Piazza San Marco and within walking distance of most of central Venice.  The rooms are clean and reasonably quiet.  The people at the front desk are friendly and helpful.  If anything is wrong in your room it is dealt with very quickly and courteously.  The breakfast, (included in the room rate) is adequate.
