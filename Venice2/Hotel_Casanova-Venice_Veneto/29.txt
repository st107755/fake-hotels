Positives: English speaking staff, American-type breakfast while not gourmet, it was passable and included with the room, location - the proximity to San Marco's Square and ease of getting around was perfect.    Things to consider when booking: A lot of brocade!  It is on the walls, the couch, the bed.  My concern was how clean can you really get the room.  Also we booked a double room, if you look at the picture, it is actually two beds, but they are pushed together and there was no room to separate them.  Fortunately there was a couch. As mentioned in other reviews, the hot water ran out very quickly, but I found that was an Italian thing.  Lastly, our room was stuffy and the air did not move around a lot.  When we opened a window, we were situated across from public bathroomsâ€¦
