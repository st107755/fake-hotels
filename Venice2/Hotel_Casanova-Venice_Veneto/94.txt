The hotel was just a few steps from St Mark's square and walking distance to many restaurants and main attractions in Venice. Our room was clean and beautifully decorated in Venetian style. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast provided was also very good. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to my friends.
