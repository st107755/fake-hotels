The only thing worth mentioning is the great location. Everything else, from the terrible room, to the staff (except for breakfast staff), and the hotel itself was not good. The front desk attendant was not helpful in offering any information on the city, which was surprising considering every other hotel in Italy & other parts of Europe automatically offered this at check-in. She barely showed us how to get to our room...
