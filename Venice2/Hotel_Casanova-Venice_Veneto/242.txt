This is a great little hotel, located about 50 metres from San Marco square.  Plus it is a very short walk, directly down one laneway to the vaporetto stop.  All of the staff are very friendly and helpful.  We had asked for nice rooms for a one-week stay and to celebrate a 90th birthday.  They very thoughtfully provided us with two great rooms - #319 and #560.  The latter is on the top level with a terrace from which you have excellent views of the rooftops in Venice.  This was a very convenient location and the rooms are spacious.  There are lots of shops and restaurants within a short walk, including directly across the laneway.  La Fenice opera house is a five minute walk from the hotel.  Rialto is a 10 minute walk (if you know where you are going).  Breakfast is included -â€¦
