The Casanova Hotel is placed seconds away from St Mark's Square so the location alone is reason enough to stay here. The hotel is a stones-throw from the dock at San Marco where you can easily get a private taxi/water shuttle to Marco Polo airport.  The hotel and rooms have been recently renovated to a very high standard and this is evident from how untouched everything looks. Our room was large and very comfortable and beautifully decorated - everything had a classic Italian feel to it. We also had a stunning view so I'd recommend a room that faces the square.  The breakfast was basic and had little choice - however there are plenty of alternative options as you have countless restaurants on your doorstep. Otherwise, I'm sure it would see you through to lunchtime.  I'd stayâ€¦
