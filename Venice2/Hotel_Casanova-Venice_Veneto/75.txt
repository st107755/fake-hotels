Very nice hotel!  Nice breakfast included. Just minutes from the San Marco water buses. 5 mins from St Mark's square and the Doges Palace. Room was red and gold matching the colors of Venice. The bathroom was very large for Venice standards. No view as it is hard to have views in such a narrow streeted place. I'd definitely stay there again
