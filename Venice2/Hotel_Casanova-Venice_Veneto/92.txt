The hotel is very close to St Mark's square and really convenient. It's near the ferry terminal and water taxis are easy to get to. The hotel had been completely revamped and the rooms were spotless and really well appointed.The Breakfast was also good and the whole hotel felt brand new.I would highly recommend The Casanova hotel it was convenient, spotless and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall we were pleasantly surprised as it surpassed all our expectations.That is a rare find!They had not got their bar up and running yet, so that would be somethingto look forward to next time to make our stay even more convenient
