Room was nice and clean. Staff were helpful. Brought a tray of breakfast and coffee to the room on 2 out of our 3 mornings here and waitresses didn't mind at all. Location was good for the main sightseeing points and nice restaurant with reasonable prices just facing the hotel. Be aware that there is no iron available at hotel whatsoever, which we found after asking reception. Bed was a little hard for me to get a good sleep in but my other half found it comfortable. All in all, we couldn't really complain about this place.
