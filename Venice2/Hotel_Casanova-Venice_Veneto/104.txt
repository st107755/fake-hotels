I was back in Venice after nearly 8 years! Having experienced the city previously, and since i was visiting primarily for the Biennale-- I knew that i had to stay around San Marco. I was travelling with friends and one of them picked this charming hotel for our stay due to it's proximity to St Mark's square. Location-wise, it is a fantastic choice. Getting there from the airport is a bit of an exercise-- a taxi/ Bus to Piazza Le Roma and then a vaporetto or water taxi to San Marco. But once you are there-- everything is a hop, skip and jump away. Rooms are quaint-- a trifle gaudy-- but very comfortable and the bathrooms are very well equipped. Breakfast is not bad... the breakfast room overlooks the tiny streets of San Marco. The staff is extremely helpful--we came in by easyâ€¦
