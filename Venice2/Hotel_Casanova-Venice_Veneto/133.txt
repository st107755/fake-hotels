It has been a great disappointment hotel . After 8 months reserved, 4 days before my check in , the hotel sent a mail through booking that they had not been able to check my credit card. I was traveling and had no internet access and they cancelled it. I'm still trying sending mails to the hotel why they could not check my card because I've never had a problem with it in any hotel. I write this review for you to take note and do not book a hotel that refuses to give an explanation to a guest that 3 days before had to book another hotel wich was very expensive.
