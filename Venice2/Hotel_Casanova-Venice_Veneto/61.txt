This is a great place to stay in Venice. The staff were very welcoming and professional, the breakfast included fruit, hams and cheeses, sweet cakes,breads and hot options of eggs, pancetta and sausage. The room was comfortable with a good sized powerful shower. My partner,pooch and I would come back, in a heart beat!
