We checked in here after booking another hotel which was awful! The hotel is quaint, beautiful and decorated in excellent style. We were a family and required a quadruple room! We ended up in the suite on the 5th floor with wooden beams, roof top balcony and kitchenette! It was like our own rooftop apartment! Absolutely beautiful and was so cheap after the bad experience at previous hotel! This is a 5 star room
