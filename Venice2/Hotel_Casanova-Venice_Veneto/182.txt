We had a family room on the first floor. There was plenty of space bearing in mind the hotel's location in the historic city centre. Furnishing were old but functional and clean. 1980's aircon worked surprisingly well (and quietly) during the 36c heat outside.  The breakfast room was better than the rest of the hotel and exceeded my expectations. Whilst the ground floor entrance of the hotel is quite small and crowded, the breakfast room was open plan and modern and looked like it has a lot of recent investment. The selection and quality of food was average but the coffee machine was above average.
