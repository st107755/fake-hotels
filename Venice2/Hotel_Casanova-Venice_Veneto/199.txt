Prior to staying at this hotel I read mixed reviews on TripAdvisor. Due to it's great location and reasonable cost I decided it was worth trying. Now, after staying at the hotel for 4 nights I found nothing to complain about. Everything was very clean, beds very comfortable and the continental breakfast was more than adequate. Choice of hot drinks plus juice, rolls, croissiants, butter, jam, cheese, yogurt. There was a choice to eat in the dining room or your own room.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Wi-fi in the pleasant lobby was good.  We had tea delivered to our room every afternoon, very quick service. The hotel was only 5 minutes at the most from getting off the water taxi. Our room #449.
