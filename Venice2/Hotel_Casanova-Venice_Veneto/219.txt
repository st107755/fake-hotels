This hotel is one block from St Marks square and close to everything - gondolas, water taxis and ferry stops. The only reason I didn't rate it better is the rooms are basic, think convent living with basic beds and bathroom but this is more than offset by reasonable value so close to St Marks square. Staff really helpful and breakfast was completely adequate
