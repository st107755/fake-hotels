So we travelled to Venice from Gatwick on the Orange carrier..... Tho delayed the flight is 1hr 40 mins. At Marco Polo you can catch a bus or in our case the water taxi..... €27 return this is the best way to see Venice.. Ticket office is in terminal building and a map and directions.... Allow yourself plenty of time and it's a must if the weather is fine....  So the hotel just off St Marks square.... Delightful narrow street reveals a rather large elegantly decorated beemed ceiling hotel..... Blink and you could walk straight past.... Easy check in, lifts to all floors, bedroom with usual facilities.... After a good night's sleep, pleasantly woken to the chimes of bells I headed for breakfast.... Located on 1st floor what a treat and what a choice.... Enough to set anyone up…
