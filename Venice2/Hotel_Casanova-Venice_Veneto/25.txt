Just checked-in today, the hotel is well located dowtown Venice, however the 2 front-office staff we’ve been in contact with since the arrival lack guest service completely. From the way the speak to you, try to assist you etc. Room is ok-ish yet for example lack slippers which should be a common thing in a 4-star property. Do not even dare to ask the front desk staff to get some, as they will not give you any and answer to you in a very inappropriate manner. It’s a pity how staff can ruin the hotel’s reputation....
