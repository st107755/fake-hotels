The stay at this hotel was not what we expected. We stayed at a different 3* hotel just before a weeks cruise which was much better and had the same kind of location. Even though we had an early check in booked, the room was not ready until 1pm. The bathroom was still dirty - there was soap all over the sink and someone's hair in the bath and sink. Someone forgot his/her pillow in the room and it smelled badly of men's perfume. We were quite disappointed and kind of disgusted. For the price one pays it was not worth it at all. The only good thing was the friendly night concierge and their breakfast. Otherwise I can't recommend this place.
