For the price, this is amazing.  We had a 1st floor double room, where not everything worked, but was OK.  Our daughter's family had a  5th floor room which was really a suite with a balcony.  The lift only goes to the 4th floor and there's  a quite steep staircase after that.  Breakfast was good and had a good selection for this level of hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful.
