We were here in mid-September when the weather was still quite hot and humid. Several good things about the hotel: 1) the location was excellent, just a short walk to St Mark's Square and the water bus stop (St Marco Vallaresso stop); 2) staff was friendly; I ordered tickets to Doges Palace and they printed them out for me free of charge. A couple of shortcomings to consider: 1) air conditioning is controlled from the front desk; 2) no coffee maker or kettle, which could be a problem during colder days. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay in a great location.
