Only the location of the hotel was good. The rest of the hotel was poor.  No WiFi in room. Even hotel lobby had very weak WiFi. And the hotel location had virtually no data or call coverage for TIM. Once we stepped into the hotel we basically lost connection to the Internet.  In the room there was only 1 power point which you basically had to choose between plugging in the TV or your phone charger.  The breakfast was really really basic with very little variety.
