Lovely hotel,spacious room, large bed, good shower. Excellent location and lovely and clean. Plenty of choice at breakfast. Would highly recommend- thank you. A stoneâ€™s throw from The square, great shops, bars and restaurants all within a quick walk. Close to the vaporetto too. Enough hanging and storage space. We stayed for 4 nights and would stay again.
