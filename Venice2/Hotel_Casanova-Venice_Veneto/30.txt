Hotel Casanova is in a good location near Piazza San Marco, however that’s the most positive thing I can say about it. The room was clean and nicely decorated, but how about 1 bottle of water - is that asking too much ? The staff were not engaging at all, the breakfast buffet was extremely poor, the ‘bar’ is manned by the miserable night porter, who really can’t be bothered to do anything. I’m not sure if this is just a ‘Venice thing’ because everywhere is so busy and just a tourist trap, but if I do go to Venice again (unlikely) I would not stay in Hotel Casanova.
