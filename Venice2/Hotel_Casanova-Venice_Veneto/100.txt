Perfect location: 2 min to San Marco Square. The hotel is newly repaired. We lived in standard room. It was really big,with spacious bathroom and canal view :-). The price is very reasonable for Venice. In front of the hotel there is a noce cosy restaurant. Try pasta with seafood :/) I would definitely recommend this hotel! You won't be disappointed!
