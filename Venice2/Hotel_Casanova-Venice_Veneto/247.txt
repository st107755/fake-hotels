Have just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Casanova. The hotel is situated in a superb location two minutes from St. Marks Square and is surrounded by designer shops and has a couple of restaurants opposite. The hotel is extremely clean and all the staff we met were pleasant. A continental style breakfast was served, consisting of fresh rolls and croissants, jams,cheese and yogurt, fruit juice and good coffee. Breakfast wasn't a sophisticated affair, but more than  adequate. Our room, number 231, was attractive and very clean . We had a bath with a hand held shower attachment, which was tricky when trying to wash your hair, but overall the bathroom was fitted well with lovely wall and floor tiles. We would certainly recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced shortâ€¦
