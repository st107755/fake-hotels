Basically arrived in the pouring rain off the airport boat at the San Marco pier & this was the first hotel was came across. 90 euro per night was steep for us however were expecting expensive anyway & did not want to trail around Venice in the rain looking for other places.  Clean, tidy, quiet & warm - average breakfast compared to rest of Italy however it filled the gap. Very central & close to get boat to train station when we left.  Reception men were very serious however no complaints at all.
