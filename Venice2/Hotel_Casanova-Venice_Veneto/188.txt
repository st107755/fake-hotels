Traveled in July to this old, rundown, small hotel ,very old furniture and bed,quite large room, LOCATION!! the best ! very close to piazza san marco and the city center ,very good value for money. bed sheets were old ,we could not replace them because the cleaning personal left in the afternoon and we found the dirt in the evening, we replaced it ourselves
