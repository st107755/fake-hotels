I stayed at the Hotel casa nova in August 2013. It was nice room size and affordable, very clean. I would certainly stay here again. Only issue to consider is if your room is above the street ( as our room was) the night noise from pedestrians is quite loud. Over all an excellent experience in fabulous Venice.
