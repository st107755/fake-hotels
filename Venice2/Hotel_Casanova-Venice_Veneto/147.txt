The hotel has the best location. Rest all is average!! We booked two rooms at the same price since a another family was there with us. On our disappointment the room we got was so tiny that we couldnt even keep the child stroller in the room and the other family got a huge room with balcony. the bathroom pipes were leaking and the water was all over the place.. The customer service was also average but cant complaint since the crowd for check in and check out was too much for him to handle. and other thing is the food was good.
