We stayed here for an anniversary weekend in Venice so a special occasion. The hotel room we had was clean, comfortable and a small balcony overlooking the narrow streets with a sea view. Breakfast was a small continental basket and more than satisfactory. The staff were helpful and spoke good English. You're paying for the location here which is excellent, San Marco is literally a moment away. This hotel is absolutely fine and we would stay again and would pay the â‚¬260 for the same experience.
