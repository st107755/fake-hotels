Location was great, pricing decent for level of services provided.  But could have done with a bit more cleaning (rugs needed shampoo, mildew growing in the barely functioning shower, molding lemons left in the non-functioning fridge in the room) and the staff use extrodinary amounts of highly scented air freshners on a frequent basis:  we had to leave on several occasions to prevent full scale allergy attacks.
