We spent 4 nights at Hotel Casanova & really enjoyed our stay here, Hotel had the authentic old fashioned feel which is what we wanted, room was not Huge but was really nice & comfortable. Only downfall was the shower was sometimes cold in the morning, when reporting to staff we were told itâ€™s not the Hotels fault (something to do with outside?) & told us to that the best time to have a shower is after midday! Not great! Breakfast was satisfactory & hotel was a in a great location, 2 minute walk to St Marks Square.  Would recommend a stay here.
