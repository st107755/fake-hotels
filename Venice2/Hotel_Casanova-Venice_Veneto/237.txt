The Casanova is a tiny little getaway in the heart of Venice, with steep steps and small rooms, and an abundance of charm.  Yes, it could use some TLC repairs and fresh paint, but its natural charm is enduring and appealing.  Price was quite reasonable too (booked on-line).  Location is great for couples traveling, but the tight and steep stairwells may be challenging for older travelers or those with athlete's knees.
