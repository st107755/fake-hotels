We recently stayed 3 nights at the Casanova Hotel and would not return.  It is in an excellent location - no question about it.  Rooms are clean but our shower had mold in the corners.  Yuck.  Beds were hard - pillows even worse.  The Hotel Violin D'Oro, right down the street, is 100 times nicer for the same price.  Most disappointing to us was the front desk staff (all men) who just weren't friendly.  We were treated as tourists - not special guests.  At $400+/night, I expected more.  The breakfast is weak compared to other hotels in this price range.  (no fresh fruit, for example).  Can't argue with being in the center of everything - and it wasn't at all loud - just not a warm, friendly place to stay.  Keep looking.
