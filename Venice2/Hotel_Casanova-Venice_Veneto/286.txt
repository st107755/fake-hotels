We stayed 4 nights at the 3* Hotel Casanova (not to be confused with Villa Casanova out on the Lido) in early March and found it very satisfactory. Our 4th-floor room was large, pleasant if a little plain, and quiet despite facing the narrow street. Amenities included minibar,safe, heated towel bars. The hotel has an elevator and main-floor breakfast room (no stairs to climb). Best of all, the location on Fressaria is just steps from St.Mark's Square and less than 5 minutes' walk from the airport water bus and vaparetto stops.
