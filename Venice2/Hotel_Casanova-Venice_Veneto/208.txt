That's the best Casanova Hotel has to offer. It is located behind San Marco square right in the heart of Venice. If you want to explore Venice by foot this is the best location at very affordable price.  Forget about the rest because this is an average hotel, basic rooms, basic clean up... the only thing that matters is... Venice! Enjoy.
