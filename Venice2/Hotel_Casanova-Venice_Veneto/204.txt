Stayed there during 19 Nov and 21 Nov 2014 with my wife and son.  excellent location, nicely done up, very very close to SM Square and water Bus station, lovely place .   Although we had visited when it was not peak season and weather was getting cool,  Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are comparable and comfortable and properly heated.  Very convenient and liked the place  and shall stay again.
