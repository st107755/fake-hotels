Hotel Casanova is very nicely located right behind San Marco square, making it easy for you to explore the city in any direction. It has a very nice and tastefully decorated lobby, but rooms suffer from the lack of character. Our room looked bland with white walls and white curtains, and didn't feel like Venice at all. The hotel could benefit strongly from at least a bit of extra color and local flavor. Brekfast is quite spartan. The staff, however, is extremely polite and helpful.
