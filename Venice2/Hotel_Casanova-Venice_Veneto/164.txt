The location is perfect, and the staff is ok, but that's about as far as the positives go. For as expensive as it is, you'd think you'd be getting something at least decent, but my friend and I were shocked. The room is very 1980's, including the furniture and mattress. The bathroom can also use some help. The wifi was free, but never connected. Luckily we were only there 2 nights. Walking distance to everything you want to see.
