The staff were helpful and very friendly.  My room was on the top floor had everything I required, the bed being very comfortable it was clean & very quiet.  5 minutes from St. Marks Square made accessing the water buses a breeze.  If you dont want to walk to far there are plenty of restaurants nearby.  I loved St. Marks Square in the evening its was so beautiful would stay again.
