Since we were only staying in Venice for 1 night we wanted to be in the middle of it all - this hotel has an excellent location, only minutes from St. Mark's square. The room was basic, and the bathroom was tiny. However it was very clean. The staff at the front desk was very nice and helpful. Even though the street where the hotel was located was very busy during the day it was very quiet at night.
