Venice is small and everything can be done by foot, but this hotel is basically in the heart of San Marco square just a few steps from it. The hotel was not the nicest though. The room was big but floor felt dirty, bathroom was tiny, and hotel staff were nice. WiFi only works down in their lobby which isn't the nicest area either. Breakfast was decent. Two minute walk to public boat taxi stand that takes you to train station (40 minutes with boat taxi). The Hallways had a terrible smell, but because of location I'd still consider staying here again. For the price, it isn't a terrible hotel!
