Initially I was worried about staying here as the hotel only has 3 1/2 star on TripAdvisor however the bad reviews were before it had been redorcorated.  Location is perfect, right behind st marks square. The hotel is in fairly busy area but we couldn't hear any noise in our rooms. The room is nicely decorated and relaxing. Break fast was ok, could be better.
