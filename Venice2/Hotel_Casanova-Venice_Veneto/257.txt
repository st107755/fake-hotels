I stayed here with my wife and daughter for 3 nights w.e.f. 3rd June 2012. Pleasant experience. Nothing much to complain about. But too small room, Broken bath shower, No Bidet as publicised in web site, Safe box is not bolted to cupboard and Inadequate breakfast compared to Rome/Florence hotels. 230 Euros per nght seems higher. Great staff members. Extremely cooperative any time. Carlos even packed some breafast for us while we checked out at 5.30 am. Great location.. Bhattacharya
