Because of its great location right at St Marco, this hotel truly gets away with murder! It's obvious that the owners have not spent a penny in its hardware for at least 3 or 4 decades...and frankly why should they!!! They're running a very high occupancy at rather exhorbitant rates (for what it is) and they will continue to do so for as long as they're allowed to. Wifi didn't work except in the lobby and neither did the AC in a 40 degree C climate!!! It is the tourism authority of Venice that is to blame. It is utterly shameful for such a beautiful city to settle for such low standards. It badly taints an otherwise great experience.
