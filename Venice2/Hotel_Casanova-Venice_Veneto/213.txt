This hotel is wonderfully 400 years old, and has kept its charm.   Four of us shared a room comfortably.  It is clean, breakfast simple but adequate.   It is close to San Marco waterbus station, and so also is in a great part of town.  We found the desk clerks most helpful and courteous.  Check out the tourist menu in the restaurant directly opposite this hotel.  It is surprisingly good and inexpensive.
