We had just arrived expecting to get into our room to refresh and enjoy the rest of our day in Venice. But when the very abrupt man at the reception of Casanova said we have no reservation for you we where shocked...as we had conformation of our booking from Thomas Cook. I am glad that we didn't stay at this hotel because the people weren't very nice. Their are plenty of hotels around but are hard to get rooms, try hotel Monaco they are very nice. Get room 414 it is special.
