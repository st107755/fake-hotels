The room was big and clean. But the recepsionist was not so nice. Speaking not so much,we didnt get any info just where is our room. Breakfest was average, nothing special. What was really surprise that we had to pay extra 25â‚¬ for one day parking even when the hotel on its website has the info that they have their privat parking. Yes they have but you should pay extra.
