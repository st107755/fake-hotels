From the moment we checked in; I had qualms. The woman at the front desk was tired-yeah well so were we - terse and emphatic that we have enough cash to pay the tax at the end of our stay. The room is beautiful; walls covered in opulent fabric, padded to reduce noise. Look around the room, no hotel information, no emergency info, no information at all.  Ok. Bed... to sleep. Alas no. This has got to be THE most uncomfortable bed. It’s hard, so hard it doesn’t give. Pillows are as hard, lumpy and uncomfortable as the bed.  My husband booked this hotel after looking at reviews giving it 4 stars; as I pointed out to him, they were reviews not the rating of the hotel. Bless.  Well it’s a 3 star hotel. But I give it 2 if that.  Sorry guys.
