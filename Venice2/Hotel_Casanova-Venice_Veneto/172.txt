No one could complain about the location, but, this is nothing more than a "2"* star place. We also nearly puke with the sewer-like smell on the ground floor. Also, as others have said  the staff don't seem very friendly,and why would they be. Venice is overrun with tourists and the locals all look like they are fed up with it. The hotel would not lend us umbrellas when it was raining, ever thought we asked every day. They just don't care about people, you are just another paying the price. Our shower was broken and it took until day 3 for them to move us to another room because the maintenance here is pathetic. The hotel is very run down and it looks like no money has been spent on it in decades. The tv is so small it made me laugh and laugh. I also find it hard to believe thatâ€¦
