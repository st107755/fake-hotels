Once you find the Casa Nova, you realise that it is very close to everything you want to see on your first trip to Venice. The Hotel is rated three star which is spot on. The staff are first class, helpful and friendly, the room and shower room perfectly adequate and clean, and breakfast is what it says, continental, primarily rolls and hot, strong, coffee.
