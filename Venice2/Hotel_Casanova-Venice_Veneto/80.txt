First of all, I would like to say the location of the hotel is unbeatable, its literally 50 meters away from  St Marks Square, you can't beat that. The hotel is a 3 stars hotel, freshly refurbished, my room was pretty decent, good quality linen and towels plus the room was a decent size room and very clean. Breakfast was ok, standard continental options, the coffee was not that good, they also had several gluten-free options for breakfast. The customer service was good, did not take the staff name but all of them were very professional. The best thing about the hotel is the location, it's literally in St Marks Square, and you have everything there: designer shops, souvenir shops, restaurants, coffee shops, the Rialto is a 7-minute walk from the hotel and the bus station is 25â€¦
