We stayed in this hotel for a family holiday. The hotel is very clean, central to San Marco and a great luxury for us. The two rooms on the top floors had a patio with the view of the San Marcos plaza and the other side view of  a narrow street going to the canal.  The hospitality is great and SÃ­lvia in the reception was the most kind and helpful to us. Her suggestion of  restaurants were perfect.   Will go back to this hotel again.
