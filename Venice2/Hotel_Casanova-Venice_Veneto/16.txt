We stayed here as part of our tour group and found it to be an exceptionally lovely hotel; one of the best on our tour. We did have to walk up a flight of stairs to our room as the elevator (small) did not go up all the way; but it was definitely worth it.  Our room was spacious, the decor fit the period and name of the hotel.  We found our room to be surprisingly quiet as the location of the hotel seemed to be on a busy street. We even had access to the outdoor patio on the roof from our room. The washroom was clean and modern.  Breakfast was very good with a lot of options to please everyone. Staff were friendly. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Venice!
