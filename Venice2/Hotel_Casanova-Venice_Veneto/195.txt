I stayed at this hotel on my visit to Venice. The hotel is ideally located, being around the corner from St. Mark's Square and making for easy access to the Vaporettos and main areas.  I had a single room, which was alright for the days that I spent but was in need of a touch up particularly for the amount paid. The hotel maintains an old fashioned decoration but there are some updates that could be done to improve the overall decor of the hotel.  The continental breakfast was a  disappointment, after the first day, I chose  to go the caf√©s nearby.
