This was a perfectly nice hotel to stay for two nights while meeting up with a friend. Our room was spacious and the bathroom was very clean (although the shower nozzle was broken). The front desk staff was helpful with restaurants and directions, and it's easy to get to the vaparetto and the water taxi to the airport. Venice is a beautiful city with wonderful places to explore. The next time I'm in Venice I will probably stay in a much less touristy location to avoid the crowds and the kitchy shops.
