Hotel location is excellent, room decor was lovely, average size, air conditioning not operational until summer. Food was average, coffee was terrible.  The biggest let down about our stay was the customer service, in particular the unhelpful male.  When we left the hotel my husband realised that he left his wallet in the safe in the room.  Our daughter contacted the hotel that afternoon, when we were on our flight home, to check if they had found it, and if not if they could check room number XX, she was told that the list of lost property had been brought down by the cleaning staff and the wallet was not listed.  She asked if they wouldn't mind double checking and was told no.  When we landed we cancelled all cards etc and thankfully nothing was taken.  We emailed the hotelâ€¦
