Came here as a birthday present from my girlfriend. It was a great stay! The hotel location is fantastic - it is only 2 min walk from San Marco Sq. The hotel is situated in an annex to the hotel. People have complained about this but i dont understand why? I was aware of this before booking and it is literally just across from the hotel only separated by a pedestrian ally - why this would be a problem for someone Im not sure?? You have access to all the facilities of the Bauer and breakfast is eaten in the Bauer on the gand canal. Breakfast was amazing. Gondolas were riding past and signing as I ate my breakfast and drank prosecco (included!).  The room was typical venetian style but was on two floors with a spiral staircase which was beautiful. They also left me a birthdayâ€¦
