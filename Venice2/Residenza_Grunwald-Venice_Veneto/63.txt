Went to venice for 3 nights originally booked the bauer casa nova annexed but on arrival was upgraded to the main hotel due to renovations in the causa nova, very impressed with room and view amazing from room 243 of the canal and gondola. Would definitely visit this hotel again and a special mention to Angelo from the bbar/canale bar who made our visit even better. Thanks once again.
