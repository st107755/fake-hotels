We enjoy 4-5 nights every year at Bauer Casa Nova . This is an excellent choice enjoying all the amenities of The Bauer Hotel  We were a group of 7 and our stay was enjoyed by everyone . Breakfast is outstanding and service flawless . The cleaners did a super job daily and we were toasted by the heat !  Many thanks to wonderful staff flawless efficient check in and check out .  We love Bauer .
