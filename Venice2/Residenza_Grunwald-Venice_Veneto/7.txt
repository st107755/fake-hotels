This is a beautiful town house, an annexe to the Bauer Palazzo and sharing all its amenities, a few hundred yards walk to San Marco Square. With antique furniture and fabric covered walls, it is quiet, very comfortable and beautifully equipped. Breakfast in the Palazzo restaurant is excellent, enhanced by the lovely views of the Grand Canal; in warmer weather, you can breakfast and dine in the open alongside the canal. I only wish I had booked to stay longer.
