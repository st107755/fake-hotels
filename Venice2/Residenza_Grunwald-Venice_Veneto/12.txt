We stayed in the Casa Nova suites after booking our trip through Easyjet Holidays, initially we thought we booked the Bauer Palazzo Hotel and clicked for a suite and discovered that the Bauer Palazzo is also Bauer Casa Nova and the buildings are next to each other. You still use the Palazzo hotel for amenities and breakfast but the suites were in the next building.  This hotel is stunning and very grand, upon arrival you enter a beautiful reception hall with plenty of friendly helpful staff. Your luggage is taken to your room for you and immediately you feel you are in a 5 star hotel. The staff on the Concierge desk know the island very well and were easy to ask for advice.   The breakfast is a great part of the hotel with silver service and fresh tasty foods and excellentâ€¦
