Don’t usually write reviews and have never written a negative review but feel I need to warn other travellers.  I booked a suite for 3 nights in the Bauer palazzo for my wife’s birthday. When I booked I was fully aware this would be in the annexe called Casa Nova but being part of the Bauer Palazzo I assumed it would be the same quality as the main hotel.  Upon check in we were took to the annexe which is around the corner from the main entrance in a small street, through a small door and up to our room. The annexe is very disappointing it is certainly not the same standard as the hotel which I have been in years previously it is more like there 3* sister hotel.  This however isn’t why I’m writing the review!  When we I arrived I couldn’t get the safe to work so as we were in a hurry to get out I put the £500 we had in my hand luggage bag and went out for the evening, something I have done many, many times in hotels all over the world. The next morning we went for breakfast and I noticed the door handle to the room was rattling but thought no more about it.  Over the course of the 4 days/3 nights we were there, apart from the maid we never seen 1 member of the hotel staff in the building and the door to the Casa Nova was left open 3-4 times even when we were coming in after midnight.  When we arrived home I emptied my hand luggage bag (which hadn’t been out of sight since leaving the room) to find the £500 gone. I immediately called the hotel to tell them about the loose door handle and general lack of security and my fears that the room had been broken into. They responded by email telling me there staff were trustworthy and that was that.   I’m very disappointed by the hotels response and want to warn other people that if you value security DO NOT stay in this so called 5* Casa Nova.…
