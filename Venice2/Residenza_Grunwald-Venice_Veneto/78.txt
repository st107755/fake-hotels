Superb base to explore Venice from. Staying at the Casa Nova annex, the only thing that disappointed me, was the sign that said the rooftop restaurant and terrace, were restricted to Palazzo guests. Sad, as when I looked there at mid day there was absolutely nobody there. However access to the other parts of the main hotel were unrestricted, the De Pisis restaurant being the perfect venue to eat, especially enjoyable when taking time over breakfast, while watching the gondolas float by on the Grand Canal. Taking the shuttle launch to the Palladio sister hotel across the bay was a pleasant divergence, allowing you the benefit of strolling through their delightful gardens.
