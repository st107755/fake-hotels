Upon arrival the staff was very helpful with taking our luggage quickly and starting the check in process immediately.  The room was nice with lots of old charm and some modern features. We did notice though that our tub was partially clogged as the water was not draining properly. I notified the front desk as we were leaving the hotel for a bite to eat and when we got back the tub was fixed which I felt was an Excellent response time. Also, we found it a bit noisy in the mornings so if you want to sleep in, you may want ear plugs.  We were not totally blown away at how nice it is for the money but it is a comfortable stay with a great location.
