My wife and I, along with some friends, recently spent 5 nights in two suites in the Bauer Casa Nova. The staff was fabulous, especially the Consierge staff--they were able to arrange a private boat to tour the Grand Canal, and to take us to the other islands. The breakfasts, both full and continental, were divine. For being about 50 yards away from San Marco Square, the place was amazingly quiet. One of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in!
