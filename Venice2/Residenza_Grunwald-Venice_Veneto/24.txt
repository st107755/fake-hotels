I initially booked the hotel thinking the room was in the main residence - I was very disappointed to find it was not but on checking the prices in the main hotel I saw that I would have had to have paid MUCH more for staying in the main hotel so I was ok with the annex - and it was not the hotels fault, it was a third party booking site which had been misleading. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms, even in the annex, are beautiful and very clean. The room service was amazing (they come twice a day) and staff were lovely at every point. The breakfast was good and had lots of choice - the views from breakfast were beautiful. I would definitely stay here again and was incredibly impressed by the hotel and staff and also the location which was perfect.
