We just returned yesterday from a weekend at the Bauer Casa Nova. We had stayed previously in the Bauer Hotel which was great, but we enjoyed the less formal atmosphere of the Casa Nova. We had a room on the top floor which was very large with a beautiful bathroom and great facilities. We used the main hotel restaurant for breakfast and the views were stunning. The staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for you. We would thoroughly recommend the Bauer Casa Nova to anyone and a trip to Venice is unforgettable. Fabulous!
