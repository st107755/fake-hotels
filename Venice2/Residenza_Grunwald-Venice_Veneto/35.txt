This hotel was very clean and comfortable. Although it was the annexe to the main hotel the decor was typical Venetian and it had lovely comfortable beds. The service was excellent and the maids came in every evening too to turn down the beds and close the blinds. The rooms were tidied again every evening. The service could not be faulted. The staff were very friendly and polite always with a smile. Marco on the reception desk was lovely and very helpful and the continental breakfast was exceptional, all good and plenty of it. The breakfast room overlooked the Grand Canal and the hotel was less than five minutes from St Mark's Square making it the ideal location. Will definitely be going back.
