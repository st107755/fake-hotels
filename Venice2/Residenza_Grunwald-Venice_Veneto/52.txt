Bauer Casanova, we stayed in the annex and honestly, it was very nice and cozy. Would definitely visit again. It would be nice to have a water view, but we were too busy exploring the city to care! The furnishings were very nice, the bed was comfortable after a long day walking. The location itself was a three minute walk to St Marks.
