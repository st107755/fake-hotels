We are world travellers and have experienced some of the best hotels in the world. We decided on a return visit to Venice having not been there since 1967. We decided on the Bauer booked up on a package deal which we were hoping all would go well. When we arrived at the Hotel just before midnight we was not disappointed in anyway, the staff were 100% on the ball excellent we was taken about 25 steps across a lane to the CasaNova. From the outside it is to anyone that studies History will realise it is an old building BUT. Step inside and be astounded by the fine decor truly exceptional if you take the time to really look properly and appreciate, plus the modern technology is as good as any modern hotel we have been in with modern access control, five star fire prevention controlâ€¦
