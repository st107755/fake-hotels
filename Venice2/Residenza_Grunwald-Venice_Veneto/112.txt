We stayed at the Casanova Suites attached to the Bauer Hotel. The suite consisted of a bedroom, a seperate small lounge or dining area, a bathroom and a small kitchenette area which was not switched on for safety reasons. It did not bother us as we did not prepare anything ourselves and we didn't use the bar fridge. The rooms were tastefully furnished and the marble bathroom was absolutely stunning. The suites have a seperate entrance and as a result there is very  Iittle traffic. We had breakfast at the main hotel every morning and it was delicious, with exquisite pastries and creamy cappuchinos. Thr setting was stunning, with the verandah overlooking on of the main churches and the Grand Canal. It is conveniently close to a major public transport terminal and St Marco Square.â€¦
