We shared a 'suite' in The Casa Nova with our adult daughter (June 2017) for a five day break.  Having read the one star reviews here we were a little wary of what to expect.   Some of the photos seem to be of the main Bauer hotel, of which the Casanova is an annexe - round the corner.  The rooms were spotless and well serviced but a little basic with no outlook.  Certainly don't expect a five star hotel.  It's position though - just off St Marks-  is ideal.  Excellent breakfasts were on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and just magical.  Staff all very helpful, friendly and professional.
