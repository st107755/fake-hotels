We're just back from the Bauer Casa Nova and I would add my view that this is a great 5 star option in central Venice.  There weren't many reviews on this site and I wasn't sure about my choice between this and the regular Bauer but I don't regret the decision.  Although the Casa Nova is marketed as an apartment / family alternative, we had a standard double room. We liked the small hotel feel with our separate entrance around the corner from the Bauer but it was a definite plus to have access to the reception / concierge from the main hotel.  The best thing though was to have breakfast on the terrace of the Palazzo included.  This is a beautiful location at the entrance to the Grand Canal. Make sure you get a rate with breakfast included as it's very expensive as an extra.
