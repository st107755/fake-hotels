We stayed at the Bauer Casanova Easter holidays 2013. The annex was very quiet and room very comfortable but no view. Housekeeping was immaculate with evening turn down. Breakfast taken at the Bauer next door was of good quality and choice. Hotel easy to find taking no.5 bus from the airport then transfer to no.1 water bus at Ple. Roma to St. Marco Vallaresso. It's in a great location with St Marks square only 3 minutes walk away. Bar and restaurant  prices were high even for Venice but there is a wide choice of restaurants close by. We would definitely stay again.
