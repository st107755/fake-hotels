The main Bauer is very impressive - but so in its own way is the Casanova - which, by the way is NOT a 2 minute walk away as one review suggests - it is perhaps 30 or 40 seconds.  The rooms are quirky, elegant, very, very spacious and possibly the most comfortable I have ever encountered - and I have slept in a lot of hotels.  Reception and concierge staff were friendly and attentive as were the bar and restaurant crew.  it is a brilliant location for all the key tourist sites and the private launch facility was a delight.
