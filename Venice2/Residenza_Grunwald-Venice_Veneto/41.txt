When booking this hotel, I knew that it was going to be in an annex behind the main hotel. Needless to say I was a bit concerned prior to arriving. I was so pleasantly surprised that the room was huge by Italian standards!  We were there the last week in June and it was very hot. Coming back to our darkened room that was cool, clean, and comfortable was a wonderful reprieve from the heat!!  I was with my daughter who is in her first trimester of pregnancy. Comfort while touring a different country is so important. These are unique rooms and may not be what you would expect, but I'm sure you will not be disappointed. These rooms do not have a view.  With that in mind, I would still recommend this hotel to anyone I know!
