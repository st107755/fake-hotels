My husband and I recently stayed at th Bauer Hotel in Venice for one night before boarding a cruise. We arrived by water taxi right to the front door to the Bauer, which was amazing. When we walked in we were thrilled, it was a bit modern, very clean, and the staff was very pleasant. Upon checking in we were directed to a different part of the hotel around the corner. Casa Nova. This was nothing like the main part of the hotel, and we were a bit diappointed. The suite was very clean, quite, and we had quaint balconies throughout the room. The bathroom was updated, and the shower was great. You definitely cannot beat the location. Literally a few steps from everything. Just know if you book Casa Nova know that this is a much older part of the hotel, and the pictures you see ofâ€¦
