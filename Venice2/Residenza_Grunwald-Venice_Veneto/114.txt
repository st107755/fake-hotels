Bauer Casa Nova is an annex to the great Bauer hotel... Which is a great thing as it offers additional intimacy that a typical chain hotel could not offer. Great decoration, classy Venetian... So do not expect sleaky modern interiors. Great size, great bathroom, great quality of sleep. Excellent service, invisible yet there to prepare your room for your sleep, respecting your privacy. Breakfast at the main hotel, great views, slightly disappointing breakfast... Recommendable.
