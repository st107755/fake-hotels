Just returned from a wonderful 3 night stay in Venice. We stayed in the Casa Nova which is in a separate building next door to the Bauer. We had a room right at the.top which was a bitnlike an attic room withmskylights rather than a amin window but was a very good size with a great walk in wardrobe, large bathroom and had a lovely cosy feel. Breakfast was taken in the main hotel and we sat outside on the waterfront every morning - good choice from a varied buffet with Prosecco on tap to start the day the Venetian way.  The hotel is right at the opening of the Grand Canal and a 2 minute walk (if that) to St Marks square so it couldn't have been in a better location. All hotels are expensive in Venice but we got a great deal via getaroom.com ( we couldn't have afforded itâ€¦
