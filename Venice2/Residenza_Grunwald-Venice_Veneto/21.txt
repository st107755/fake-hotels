This is a wonderful hotel in every way. It is situated just a stones throw from St Marks Square and the Doges Palace. Having breakfast over looking the Grand Canal was amazing. Breakfast itself  was superb .Our room was spacious and had its own sitting room. All the staff were so friendly and could not do enough for us. If you thinking of visiting Venice (and you must) then this hotel is a must. We shall be returning
