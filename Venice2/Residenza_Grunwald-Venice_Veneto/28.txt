This is a great hotel in a prime location in Venice close to the tourist area of San Marco. We stayed in the Casa Nova Annex which is only a few meters from the main hotel entrance, this afforded us some privacy as we did not always want to go through the main hotel lobby. The room was super and so was the room service. However, the AC was noisey and not very effective and we visited during the cooler month of September! Highlights were breakfast on the outside patio right on the Grand canal and the expensive but super roof terrace bar. We arrived and departed by water taxi from the airport and if you don't mind the cost 120 EU it was the way to go. The  water taxis were arranged by the concierge. If you want to see the Doges Palace and San Marco Basilica consider a pre-bookedâ€¦
