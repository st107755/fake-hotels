Stayed 3 night at the Bauer Casa Nova, and would do it again.  The Hotel, rooms, service, breakfast and all the staff are all excellent.  Had a lovely room (22) with a very comfortable king bed, beautiful marble bathroom and shower and plenty of room for a medium hotel stay.  We were lucky enough, (or not as may be) to witness the Aqua Alta (very high tide).  Great to watch the Venetians on their daily routine and the travellers wearing boots, bags, bin liners and other items on the feet.  Hotel even provided loan umbrella's for us.  Hotel provided also a kettle, cups and saucers with condiments in the room so we could make tea in the morning. We had a great few days away and would recommend a stay at this hotel as it is so central to all the main attractions that Venice has toâ€¦
