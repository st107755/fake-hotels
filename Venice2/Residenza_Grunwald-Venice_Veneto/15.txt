The Bauer Casa Nova is the annex part of the 5* Bauer Palazzo Hotel. The annex is literally 5 steps next to the main hotel. Room as very nice and very clean. When we checked in we asked about upgrading our $250/day room in the Casa Nova to the main hotel and was told it would be $150 a day more for a room without a view. Turned out it was not worth the upgrade. We were very happy with our accommodations. Room was large and very nice. You won't be disappointed. We did not get to see the rooms in the main hotel so we don't have much to compare. Location is great. It is a short 3 minute walk to St. Marks Square.   When we were there everything in town was flooded and we had to walk on planks except when the water was too high to even use the planks so we were stuck in the hotel forâ€¦
