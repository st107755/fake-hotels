This hotel is a secondary building (old Venetian) close to the main Bauer Hotel. There is only one bad thing I can say about it....you have to go out to the street to get into the main building for breakfast,reception.... Appart from that everything is wonderful.Room was superb in decoration and facilities.It is a 5star hotel and it proves it with details.E.g. when we arrive to the room after dinner someone had prepared the bed, turned on the heating... Breakfast is good with excellent views.And the best thing: just a few streets away from San Marcos square!
