Our first stop in Italy. Things were going well, the flight was on time, the car was waiting to take us to the water taxi, the front desk greeted us like old friends, even though it was 9am. They would have our room ready in an hour or so, stored our luggage. You can walk anywhere from the hotel, we felt like we got to know Venice from our home base. The room was great, breakfast is a joy. I'd recommend this property, and the tour guide who booked it.
