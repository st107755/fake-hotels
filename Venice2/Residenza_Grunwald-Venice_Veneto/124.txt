As an annex to the Bauer Hotel the Bauer Casa Nova is right across a little Passageway with your own private entrance. You are eligible to all the wonderful services of the Bauer, but have the Privacy of a rented appartement. We rented 3 rooms, all of them were very nicely  made up and had a wonderful marble bath. One of the rooms was a attic room and had a little balcony on the roof top, with a wonderful view of the tower on San Marco place. The breakfast is taken on the canal view side terrace and a wonderful start to a perfect day in Venice.
