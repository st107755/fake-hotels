Right in the heart of the city this hotel is a 5 star but you can get great bargains if you book in advance. Lovely staff, very helpful and a wonderful location. Near to St Markâ€™s it is one of the best places to explore the city. There are three annex buildings but they are all ok. Breakfast is by the Grand Canal in the main building.
