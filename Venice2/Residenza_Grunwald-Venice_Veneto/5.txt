Before travelling to Venice I had checked the reviews for this hotel and was a little dubious about some of the negative comments and wondered as most be do, have we made the right decision. Absolutely yes, the rooms are an annex of the main 5 star Bauer Hotel , however the service and quality we experienced was first class and same high standard as the main Bauer Hotel. Rooms and bathrooms spotless, very comfortable and AC works well It was actually more convenient having our own access to the street rather than going through the hotel as you come and go .  Best breakfast location in the city , right on the grand canal in the Bauer Hotel . Location wise , you are just a few minutes from San Marco sq and your water bus/taxi  Getting to and from Marco Polo airport was very simpleâ€¦
