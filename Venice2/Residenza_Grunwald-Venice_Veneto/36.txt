We stayed in Bauer casa nova this time and we loved it! The property was right in the heart of San Marco. Breakfast was great with a stunning view. Room was clean. We loved the decorations in the hotel and the staff were polite. We will definitely come back for our next visit in Venice and will try a different room type.
