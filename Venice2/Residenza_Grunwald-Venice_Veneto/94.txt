We stayed 3 nights at the Bauer Casa Nova in October 2013. Check-in was easy and the front desk attendant walked us to the room.  The room was spacious for Europe, with a large queen bed, and a bathroom which was definitely 5 star with a bathtub, fluffy towels, and fancy toiletries. It was quiet, though there was no view out the windows.  The location is steps from St. Mark's Square, which makes it easy to get to from the airport, as well as getting on vaparettos.  The included breakfast buffet at the hotel was great. It had everything from dozens of pastries, to bacon, eggs, sausage, to yogurt and cheeses, and your choice of beverage. If you get there early enough (around 7:30am), they even let you sit outside on the landing.  Overall, a great stay.
