We stayed 3 nigths in Casa Nova Suit, between the dates 30th of November  and 3rd of December, with my husband an my 13 years old daughter. The location, housekeeping service, breakfast, concierge were 10 out of 10. The price was very reasonable. Even I did not mention about my birthday, I found a bottle of champagne in our room., We tried all the restaurants the concierge recommended , they were really good. They answer all my questions on the map with patience. Thanks to each member of hotel personnel and the hotel manager for making us happy and our trip perfecto..
