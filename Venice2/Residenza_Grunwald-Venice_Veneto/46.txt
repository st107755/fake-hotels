Great place with great value-for-money. Good, clean rooms and super-convenient location in the heart of everything. They also have a fantastic breakfast areas.   Casa Nova is right behind the main Hotel Bauer building, so the views tend to be less impressive - but it offer a much cheaper room rate compared to the main building.   Will be staying here again on our next visit to Venice.
