Stayed at Bauer Casa Nova in August 2014. Location of hotel is good for all the shops and sightseeing.  Check in was smooth and the staff were all welcoming.  Our room was very nice to a high standard.  Breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal was superb.  Will definitely stay at this hotel again if visiting Venice.  Internet was extra charge but in some areas of hotel you could pick up Wi Fi. Take the free shuttle boat over to the Spa and Gardens of Bauer very relaxing walk in the gardens.
