The Bauer Casa Nova is a fantastic place to stay.  It is located next door to the main Bauer Hotel just off the Grand Canal and 2 mins from St Mark's Square, and offers a slightly more affordable way of enjoying this great hotel, without giving up any of the quality associated with the Bauer, or the wonderful location.  The staff are very friendly and you feel very much a part of the main hotel.  Highly recommended
