The Casa Nova is not the 5 star Bauer which is shown in all the main pictures, the price of my trip reflected this. It is 4 star and only 20 steps or so away from the main entrance. I had room 12 which was a mini suite and was lovely, little bit of early morning alley noise from presumably hotel employees arriving,  also very little daylight but I never went to Venice to stay in my room. The room was cleaned every day and there was a turn down service. The hotel staff even left a birthday note for my wife and at no point did I mention it was her birthday , I guess they noted it from her passport, it was a lovely touch. You get to use the main hotel facilities like every resident and the staff treated everyone the same and in my opinion the attentiveness was sublime. Breakfastâ€¦
