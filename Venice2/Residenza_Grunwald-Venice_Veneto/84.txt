The main hotel is beautiful with a great location we stayed in the annexe Casa Nova.  Loved having clean bedding and towels everyday and appreciated the robes and slippers, our room was small, clean and comfortable, unfortunately no view.  The breakfast choice is extremely good and enjoyed the lovely views on the terrace.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  We had problems with the Wi Fi more off than on.  The only disappointment, this was our honeymoon and the hotel management did not make any effort to make our stay special, a room upgrade or even a bottle of Prosecco, which other hotels offer.
