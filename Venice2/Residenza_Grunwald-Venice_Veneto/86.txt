We stayed in the Casa Nova for 4 nights in February and woudl definately recommend to anyone visting Venice. The location is perfect, just a two minute walk to Piazza San Marco. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed, and we found the rooms to be comfortable and welcoming. We stayed bed and breakfast, which is taken in the main hotel. This was great, really enjoyed looking out over the grand canal over breakfast.  We stayed the week before carnivale, and managed to get a fantastic rate on the room. Not sure if this is because of the timing, but it was a great time to go. We even go to see Venice in flood as it was high spring tide. This was magical, and added to the great experience we had.
