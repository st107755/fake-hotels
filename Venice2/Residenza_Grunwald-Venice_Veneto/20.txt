We stayed here in February half term 2017 with our teenage son and daughter. We chose to book the apartment in the Bauer Casa Nova as it provided the space we wanted for our family. Myself and my husband had a room downstairs, so did our daughter. Our son had his own room and bathroom upstairs where there was also a roof terrace to sit out. The main hotel is literally steps away, we used all the facilities there, had breakfast there and had amazing aperol spritz on the terrace overlooking the grand canal. If you visit with older children who want their own space and privacy the apartment is perfect ( perhaps not for little ones due to the stairs and roof terrace). For a romantic break for two Iâ€™d say stay in the main Bauer hotel in a room overlooking the grand canal.
