My husband and I stayed at the Bauer Hotel in the Casa Nova annex from Boxing Day 2014 for 4 nights. We had a lovely quiet room which also had a mezzanine level with a sofa and another television. The furnishings were very opulent and the maids very attentive to our needs twice a day. The Bauer is situated next to St Marks square and the shops. There was an excellent choice at breakfast in a lovely setting overlooking the Grand Canal.
