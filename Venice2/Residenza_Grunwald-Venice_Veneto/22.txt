Stayed at the Bauer Casa Nova, which is the four star annexe to the five star Bauer Palazzo Hotel. Still received five star service so worth the very short walk between the two buildings for breakfast. Clean and spacious room with a large bathroom, including bath and shower, and even a small dressing room. The staff were attentive and friendly, the breakfast excellent and the atmosphere luxurious. Arrived and departed by water taxi at the hotel’s own jetty - the only way to travel. Fabulous location on the Grand Canal very close to St Mark’s, Florians, Harry’s Bar and the vaporetto stop at San Marco. The views at breakfast were truly memorable. Would love to stay here again. My fourth trip to Venice and the best accommodation I have stayed in. Thank you, Bauer!
