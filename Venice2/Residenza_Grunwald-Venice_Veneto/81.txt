We've just returned from 8 days at the Bauer Casa Nova in Venice. The hotel is a real gem and we couldn't fault it in any way. The location is excellent, overlooking the Grand Canal where breakfast can be taken outside when the weather is dry. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble - a small problem with the bath plug one evening was resolved while we had dinner. The food is very good indeed - a great choice at breakfast including prosecco, and we had a lovely evening meal in the restaurant on one occasion. The room was wonderful, on the top floor with a small balcony overlooking the roof tops and beyond them the Campanile in St Mark's square, yet was very quiet. The room was very spacious and very well appointed, with a small kitchen areaâ€¦
