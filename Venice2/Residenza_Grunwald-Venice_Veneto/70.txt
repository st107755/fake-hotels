This annexe accommodation is sperate to the main hotel - around a corner in fact with no connecting doors etc to the hotel. Rooms are at best 3 star - definitely not worth the money - Venice has other options. Changed rooms due to paper thin walls and noise plus broken alarm in room. Breakfast and location was the saving grace here - but would not return. Staff could do with more hospitality training. Complained at front desk and asked for manager (two occasions) - who was no where to be seen, despite being on duty. The responses to other reviews by the manager are PR lip service - nothing has changed here and you could not rate the annex as 5 star nor any of the facilities. A glorified Holiday Inn with no view, dark and dingy would be an apt description.
