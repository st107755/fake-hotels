Had an amazing time ! Glorious as Venice is ,Bauer Casa nova is one of its many treasures.The rooms are breathtaking ! We stayed in two of the superior suites ,as we are a family of five ,with two grown up kids and a 9 year old ! The staff are extremely helpful and the service five star ,in the true meaning of the words. The location is so central and has the best spot on the banks of the grand canal .Breakfast every morning is one of the many highlights of the stay at the hotel . The Casa nova is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main building and feels much more private and relaxing .
