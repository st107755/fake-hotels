Don't be fooled, Bauer Casa Nova is not a hotel. It is a separate building in a side street next to hotel Bauer. There are no facilities in Bauer Casa Nova and most rooms look into a wall. The rooms are standard Italian upmarket with very nice bathrooms and the location is excellent. But you are not staying in a five star.
