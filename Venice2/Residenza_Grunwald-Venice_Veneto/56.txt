wonderful experience after reading quite alarming reviews. Rooms were exceptionally clean,but,a little dark.  Breakfast on the terrace with its amazing views were plenteous andBuck's Fizz too!!!! We had dinner at their hotel across canal which was also a fantastic experience and such lush grounds too.
