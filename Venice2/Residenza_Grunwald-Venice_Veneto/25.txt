Be careful when booking this as the advertising is very misleading. It shows you pictures of a wonderful hotel but it is actually the Bauer round the corner of which you can use its facilities. We paid a very price for what we thought was going to be luxury only to be escorted round the corner, outside to a completely separate annex. It was like something out of a movie going through dark corridors until we got taken into our room. There is no concierge or reception and you are left feeling vulnerable and cut off . On x2 occasions the front door was also left open. Once at night. Anyone could have come in. No security, just completely cut off and alone. Upon asking the main hotel why we were in there they were unhelpful and dismissive. They told us " that is what you booked".â€¦
