We booked through our travel agent who had placed travellers here before. He got us (what he thought) was an amazing rate and then a suite upgrade.   When we arrived the hotel was incredible. Right on the canal, 100m from St Mark's Square. We then found out our accommodation was around the corner in the Casa Nova which is a separate building. The suite was roomy and nice, the couch was uncomfortable due to it being used often as a sofa bed. The TV also vibrated on even normal volume (but these were small issues).  But the bathroom and bedroom were fantastic. The highlight, was our breakfast, included in the rate, in the Palazzo, outdoors over-looking the Grand Canal. What a fantastic place to watch Venetians go about their daily business.  We would much rather pay lower rates toâ€¦
