Full disclosure:  we booked our hotel "blind" on Hotwire--our criteria being 5 stars and neighborhood.  Our results were called "Bauer, L'Hotel."  When we checked in, we were walked out the door of the hotel (which has a very upscale newer lobby) and around the corner to an unmarked door and into a slightly confusing layout of rooms.  As others have said, you don't go to Venice to stay in your room, and the room itself was perfectly nice, and the ambiance in the annex was likely more "authentic" to the age and style of the city, BUT>>>>I feel if your reservation says BAUER, it should mean BAUER, not Casa Nova.  The room was compact, no view, good bed, well appointed small bathroom, breakfast was included and very nice.
