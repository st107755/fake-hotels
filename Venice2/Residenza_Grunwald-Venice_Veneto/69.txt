Excellent deal through Travel Republic for a room in casa nova.  The highlight was the delightful staff who were professional and courteous and could not have done enough to make our stay a special experience.  The environment was as you would expect from a 5 star hotel but special mention to the concierge who suggested some interesting trips including a complementary boat ride to a glass factory on Murano island.  The breakfast was very special as the restaurant and terrace overlook the Grand Canal
