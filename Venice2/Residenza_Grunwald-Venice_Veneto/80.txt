We stayed in the penthouse suite for 3 nights in July. It was great. This property is a 5 second walk from the front door of the Bauer Hotel and you have full access to all to the amenities and services of the hotel, but you get the benefit of being in a separate, more private and less bustling building. The suite is large, with two bathrooms and a private rooftop terrace, and was more than enough room for parents and three kids. Being in the separate building was quiet and great for a family. The location is also perfect - 2 minutes from San Marco, right in the middle of everything and a great place to base explorations of Venice because it is easy to get back to - you just find your way back to San Marco and you can find your way back to the hotel - that is by no means a givenâ€¦
