This was our second stay at the Casa Nova - my husband and I stayed there by ourselves in 2011 and we recently wtayed there with my parents.  This hotel is full of charm and it is is so close to St. Mark's Square and also the water taxi area that it makes getting to/from sites very easy.  We loved sitting in the square listening to music each evening and also loved that there was a restaurant directly across the street and a small shop around the corner that sold wine :)  If we go back we will definitely stay there again.
