The Casa Nova extension of the Bauer is like having your own home in Venice.  The room was beautifully decorated with all amenities, luxury linens, good lighting.  The bath had shower and tub in marble.  The location was perfection.  Easy access from the airport and near a vaporetto stop, too.  Close to Piazza San Marco, Prada, little cafes and museums.    Our view was onto a small street and our room was whisper quiet except when the enchanting bells rang in the neighborhood church tower.    Service in Casa Nova was the super, friendly staff, best canalside cafe for Grand Canal watching.  This was our first trip to Venice, and Casa Nova will always be our home there.  We stayed three nights before departing on a Seadreams Yachtclub cruise.
