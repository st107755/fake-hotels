I absolutely loved this hotel. Our room was seriously beautiful, had amazing views and was immaculately clean. We were worried at first as it wasnâ€™t in the main Bauer Pallazo building however I honestly think it was better!!   I thought the breakfast was a little lacking for vegetarians/vegans but the service was outstanding and we felt very spoilt.  Would 100% recommend this hotel for its atmosphere, service and location to all Venice has to offer.
