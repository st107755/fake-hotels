I booked the Bauer Casanova for our anniversary. The hotel was easy to find, and only a couple of hundred yards from St Marks. We has a suite in the annex. Exactly what was expected. The room was very clean and all the extras that you expect, including slippers and robes. Nightly turn down service with towels changed twice daily. Only item missing was tea/coffee facilities in the room. The breakfasts were superb, and being able to sit on the veranda adjacent to the canal was a bonus. As this is a 5 star hotel in Venice expect to pay 5 star prices. The staff were wonderful, very helpful indeed. The location of this hotel is also a big bonus.   We were so impressed with this hotel, we have already booked again for next May.
