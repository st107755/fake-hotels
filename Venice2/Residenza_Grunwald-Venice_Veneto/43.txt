This apartment is located around the corner from the main hotel, where breakfast is served. The room was very charming and the only negative aspect was that the bed for our son was a sofa 'chair' and rather uncomfortable to sleep on however had we only been 2 people the little room the chair was in would have been a bonus to our stay. Breakfasts were lovely and whilst we didn't have any, this is the only hotel we've witnessed the option to have prosecco at breakfast. The location is convenient for all the sights and the concierge staff were wonderfully helpful and kind. We had an amazing 3 night stay and would return to this hotel if visiting Venice again.
