The personnel was very very professional, kind and attentive to our smallest needs! The dishes were exquisite, both the lamb and the fish and i never thought or tasted such a tender cod, didn't even know it can be so tender! It's pity that it was raining, otherwise we would have eaten outside on the Terrace with the amazing view!!!! This restaurant is a must that one should try when in Venice!!!!
