We were transferred to the Bauer due to our hotel being full and no accommodation available for us. The staff were excellent on our arrival and throughout our stay. The location was a few minutes from St Mark's Square and we had a wonderful stay. The hotel breakfast offered a wide variety of different hot/cold dishes. We ate at the hotel right by the waterfront on our last evening - it was a really magical setting. We stayed in the Casa Nova and the room had a separate sitting room with microwave and refridgerator.   Our whole experience at the hotel could not be faulted in any way and we would recommend this hotel fully for a romantic and special experience. (It was my husband's 50th birthday treat) We hope to return to the hotel as soon as we can
