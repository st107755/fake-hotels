Just got back from a two night stay at the Bauer Casa Nova. We'd read varying reviews online, but our experience surpassed all expectations! Staff were really welcoming from the moment we arrived, and nothing was too much trouble. The Casa Nova is tucked round the side on a quiet street, which makes it more of a secret to those in the know and is an added bonus away from the throngs. I would echo all the positives on here - five star service and comfort. Breakfast on the terrace with so many options - much more than implied by the 'continental' we thought we qualified for. We hope to come back soon and possibly try the spa access that all guests at the hotel can use....
