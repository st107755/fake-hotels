Was a little worried after booking as I wasn't quite sure what to expect when described as annex building. However, very pleasantly surprised! On check in, we were welcomed by a lovely lady on reception who showed us to our room. There was literally only a side path that separated the Bauer Palazzo hotel and the Casa Nova. We were upgraded to a suite in the casanova as I emailed previously advising it was our honeymoon and I mentioned I was a travel agent. Thank you again! The room was huge, very spacious and the bathroom was immaculate. Towels were changed daily and bathrobe & slippers were placed in our room. The breakfast in the Bauer Palazzo was great, wide variety of choice and the room overlooked the Grand Canal - perfect! The location of this property was fantastic, few minutes walk from St Marks Square and not too far from the Rialto Bridge.  There is alot of designer shops that surround the hotel.  The gondolas stopped outside of the hotel costing 80 euros for two people for 20 minute ride.  We booked a water taxi direct from Hotel to airport that cost 130 euros. (expensive) We got the shared water taxi from the airport to St Marks Square that cost 15 euros per person but thought we would go back to the airport in style.  I would highly reccommend the Casa Nova to friends, family and my customers looking to visit Venice. You would not be disappointed staying here.â€¦
