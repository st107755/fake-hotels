We thought we had booked the Bauer Hotel through the cruise company but were escorted to this annex instead. Had my review been based on the reception and concierge service then it may have been better but based on the room and the breakfast experience, it was disappointing.   Our room was not one with a view,  so buying into a 5 star hotel on the Grand Canal made not a jot of difference.  In fact we faced walls of not more that a couple of metres away on both sides and 'enjoyed' the noise of very early morning bottle disposal activities every day!  You may say the decor is sumptuous and Venetian and with good lighting it would have been lovely. But in fact, we felt like we were living in a cave and pretty much had no idea whether it was day, night, sunny or not.   I'm sure teaâ€¦
