Having read some dire reviews regarding this hotel I was very anxious but I need not of worried - everything was excellent - spacious clean room, fab bathroom, building is security locked, two working lifts, staff extremely helpful - I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - plus amenities in the main Bauer hotel are first class
