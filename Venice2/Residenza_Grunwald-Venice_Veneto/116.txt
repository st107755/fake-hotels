This is our fourth time in Venice in the past 8 years and this was our best stay yet.  We've stayed in the fanciest of hotels and would come back here in a second.  We had room 45 in the Casa which was absolutely perfect for our family of three.  Lovely room.  Cute little balcony.  Cool and comfortable.  It's the on ein the picture on the website with the beams.  Absolute value for money at Â£250 per night including breakfast via expedia.  Breakfast is 50 euros otherwise.  Good service.  Great room.  Great location.  We seriously rate this stay higher than the Monaco next door, the pretentious Gritti Palace (even though we weren't paying) and the Londra Palace.  All in all deserving of it's excellent rating.
