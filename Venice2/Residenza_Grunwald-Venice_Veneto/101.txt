We had tried to book the Bauer L'Hotel but unfortunately did not get six rooms for our stay so we took in its sister hotel Bauer Casa nova.  We are currently staying in this hotel and will check out on the 28th of May. We have booked six rooms out of which 3 are suites.  We get mad as soon as we enter the building and we wonder why did Bauer even refurbish the Casanova and even if it did its not a very good job.  The Casanova building is a 2 minute walk from the Bauer but its nothing like the Bauer or any LHW hotel. I shall explain why it's not upto the mark.  Firstly during check in which was done at the main Bauer reception we were not even offered any welcome drinks we hoped to get some warm drinks . When we asked they said "they do not do it as it adds up to their cost" .  â€¦
