The hotel is brilliantly located and the food is divine.  The terrace has to be the best in Venice.  Our room no 26 was spectacular , extremely large and spacious - we loved it. Casa Nova is located in an annex to the main hotel but all meals etc are taken in the main building.  The prices for Casa Nova reflect this.  The second night we were there our stay was disrupted by an extrememly noisy group with childred screaming and shouting in the corridors into the early hours.  The reception asked them to tone it down to no avail.  The third night we were moved to a much smaller and less well appointed room to get away from the mayhem downstairs.  This was effectively a DOWNGRADE.  The hotel offered us no recompense or apology for the inconvenience - we felt very let down.
