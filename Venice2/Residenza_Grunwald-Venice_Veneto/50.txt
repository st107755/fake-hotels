We stayed at the Bauer as part of a package, the hotel actually have 3 buildings so don't be fooled in thinking your staying in the main one.. we found out from peoples reviews. The reception looks very grande, check in was actually quick and we stayed in the annex which was behind the hotel so we had to exit the building. We were worried as we weren't sure if the standard and quality was different from the main building but the room we got was good. The hotel itself is quite central, its next to really expensive stories like LV and Chanel etc. But for a 5-10 walking distance you can get to restaurants and after St Marks Square where nearby is lots of tourist stalls. Staff was very welcoming at check in in and throughout the stay everyone greeted us when we walked past andâ€¦
