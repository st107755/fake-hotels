Booked a last minute trip to Venice and a couple of rooms in the Bauer CasaNova annex.   The rooms are great (large, massive bed, great bathroom. lots of storage etc).  The hotel is not the cheapest (!!) but then you are right in the centre of Venice and can breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal and walk to San Marco in 2 minutes.
