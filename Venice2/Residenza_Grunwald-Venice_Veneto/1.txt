Arriving my private water taxi to the fabulous Hotel Casa Nova Bauer, very quaint with classical ally beautiful Italian decorated comfortable  rooms and immaculate 5 piece luxury bathrooms. Breakfast on the terrace veranda at the great Hotel Bauer Palazzo (which Casa Nova Bauer is an annex of the main hotel and just steps from the main Bauer) overlooking The Grand Canal, wonderful variety  of choice buffet breakfast.  The hotel is a within five minutes walk from St Mark‚Äôs Square, and five mins to the nearby San Marco vaporettas twenty minutes to Rialto Bridge.  We travelled by the hotels private boat to the sister Hotel Bauer Palladio & Spa in Giudecca with great gardens and well-being.
