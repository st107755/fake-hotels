Stayed here in a suite. Fully aware this is not the Bauer Palazzo but a building unmanned next door. Checked in efficiently in the main building with no line to wait in and taken next door to our room. Immaculate inside. Large with separate sitting room and small 2 ring hob with microwave and fridge,hidden behind doors. Large super comfortable bed. The walls are fabric lined trimmed with cord. The large marble bathroom was also immaculate. Deep bath to soak in after a hard day walking and sightseeing. Shower had good pressure. Nice toiletries locally made provided. Air conditioning/heating worked well. Didn’t hear any street noise but the church bells next door went off around 7.30 am which we actually liked to hear. However there was no great view to be had from our room.…
