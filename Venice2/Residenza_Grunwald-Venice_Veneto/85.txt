We had to stay in the Bauer Casa Nova because we had 5 people - 3 teenage kids.  It is in a great location, close to San Marco.  The hotel restaurant is right on the Grand Canal, which was nice during cocktail hour and breakfast.  Breakfast was lovely.  The staff helped with transportation and dinner reservations.  We had a great time in Venice.
