We were specifically looking for an authentic hotel in the center of Venice. We were not interested in any modern interpretation of great old houses. We were not looking for clear plastic chairs in our room. Bauer Casa Nova delivered. We had a suite of outsized proportions with a huge living room, gorgeous build in cabinets, ceilings with beams, Carrera marble bathroom, high end faucets, etc. I'm in construction business so I can see the high quality products. Furniture was antique, may not be several centuries old, but had a real nice old feel to it. If you are looking for glossy one you'd better book Hilton. We also somewhat enjoyed that Casa Nova has a separate entrance from the main hotel and had that real intimate feel to it. It's like you are being transported one centuryâ€¦
