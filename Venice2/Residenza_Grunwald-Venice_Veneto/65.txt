Very good value 5 stars hotel Casa nova is adjacent to main hotel Which seems frozen in the 70s don't expect state of the art TV and accessories in the room  Wifi is not free surprisingly Room spacious and confortable Staff was very friendly and helpful, concierge gave us some nice recommendations  Location next to the place san marco Taxi boat can get you to the hotel directly  They charge to have a kettle in the room?!  Overall I recommend
