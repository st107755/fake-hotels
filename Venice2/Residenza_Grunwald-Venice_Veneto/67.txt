We were very impressed with the elegance of the Bauer during check in, until when the reception brought us out of the hotel lobby to the back side of the hotel into another building beside Bauer and showed us our room. We were shocked at the state and condition of the room. The size were good but this hotel look haunted and extremely cold. The heater wasn't working imagine we've to wear the bath robe to bed. Do not book this hotel as everything about this hotel is old n run down. We were extremely disappointed n felt cheated with this booking. We checked in on the 14/12/2014-17/14/2014. We checked out one day earlier on the 16/12/2014 even though we paid till 17/12/2014. We've never felt more eerie than this. Your web site should state clearly it's Casa Nova instead of riddingâ€¦
