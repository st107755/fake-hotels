This annex of the main hotel is a delightful place to stay in Venice. It is situated within a couple of minutes walk of S Marco. We stayed in a room with a small sitting room, a luxurious bathroom with shower, bath, toiletries, bathrobes, slippers. The linen was changed daily and the standard of cleanliness very good. Turndown each evening. Breakfast is taken in the main hotel with an excellent range of hot and cold food. The staff, without exception, are friendly, helpful and nothing is too much bother. Would I stay again? Absolutely! Itâ€™s excellent value for money and we enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning soon.
