Stayed at the hotel for three nights in the later part of June, on the top floor. Had a very comfortable stay, spacious room and bathroom. Room is cleaned multiple times, the bed was always done when I came back to the room. The staff is helpful and the best part is the location, couldn't be more central than this. Could see the bell tower in St Mark's square from the window and walking is possible to most of the tourist spots. You have to walk to the main Bauer building for breakfast, that's the only con I can think of, otherwise does the job brilliantly.
