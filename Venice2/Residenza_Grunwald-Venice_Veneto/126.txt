Firstly, I need to mention that I am new to TripAdvisor, and, although I have traveled a fair amount, throughout the US, this was my first trip to Europe. I was invited to speak at a Conference in Naples, and was able to turn it into a week of pleasure/business, with my wife. Her only request was that we get to see Venice.   After a lot of recommendations, from friends, family and reviews, I decided to fly into Venice for a couple of days, followed by spending the remainder of the trip in Naples (taking day trips from there). My next job was to find a hotel, without spending the house. It became clear that Venice can be one of, if not, the most expensive city in Italy; also, that standards for hotels are VERY different in Europe, as compared to the US.   A strong recommendationâ€¦
