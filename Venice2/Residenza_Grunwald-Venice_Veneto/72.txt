Had the same experience as several of the reviewers below - thought that we booked in the main Bauer Hotel, only to be given a room in a building next door. To be fair, you still get access to the facilities in the main building, but they need to be clearer and make sure that their customers don't feel misled.  We also had a few problems, for example the shower drain in our room was blocked and mobile phones had no signal in the Casa Nova building. I don't think that's OK considering the price of the rooms.  I normally love old/ historic hotels, however Bauer felt a bit outdated and stuffy. However the location is superb. For me the best part was the view from the terrace on which they serve breakfast.
