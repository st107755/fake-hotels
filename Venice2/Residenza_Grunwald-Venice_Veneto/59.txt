3 days of relax and fun , breakfast was great , Consierge team are fantastic , alot of info and they helped us with baby sitter , location was amazing , staff were ok , people could do a lot to improve the service as the hotel is one of the icons in Venice , The suite i booked was so nice but to pay 2000 Euro for 3 nights and you charge me 5 Euro for the water kettle is really funny , we attend with my wife Jazz festival was amazing and so elegant, my wife had glass ring which was broken in the bathroom when we came back the room was cleaned and the glass was still on the floor , i need to understand the HK point of view to keep broken glass in the bathroom without clean it ,The sofa bed is the worst sofa you could ever sleep on , please go by your self and try it you willâ€¦
