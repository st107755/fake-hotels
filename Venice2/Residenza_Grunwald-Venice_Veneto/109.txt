You really can't beat the location of this Venice gem. Right off the Grand Canal, you get all of the premium benefits of staying at the Bauer, but a more secluded rooms of the Casa Nova.  We snagged a deal on Jetsetter and -- even with the discount -- the room price was steep, but on par with any 3+ star hotel in the area. As with most Venetian hotel rooms, they were relatively small, with poor natural light. But that's Venice. The rooms were clean, well appointed, and had great bathrooms.   We would definitely stay again!
