We had two adjoining rooms for our family of four. The Casanova annex is in a great location near St Mark’s square and just steps away from the main Bauer. We couldn’t have asked for more classically beautiful, comfortable rooms. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and such a treat to eat overlooking the Grand Canal. The Concierges were very helpful recommending restaurants, etc. The front desk kindly sent up an instant kettle because I needed to be able to heat water. The rooftop bar is pricey but my husband and son enjoyed a memorable time up there one evening. I would definitely stay here again.
