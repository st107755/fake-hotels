Not worth the money! Unprofessional band, presentation and playing like a schools-band for 9 Euros and minimum consumption of 9 Euros. If at least the drinks were good, but: bad wine for 10 Euros a glas. The only good things: Itâ€˜s looking elegant and they serve olives and nuts for free. But still: I can really not recommend it!
