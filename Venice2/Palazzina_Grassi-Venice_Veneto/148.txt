I picked this because it was a boutique hotel with great design.  It's a quiet location which suits but easy to walk about.  The hotel is funky.  Our bedroom though not cheap was quite small but well done.  No bath unfortunately which always adds a bit more decadence.  Friendly and very helpful staff.
