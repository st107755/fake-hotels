The hotel and the rooms are great. Wonderful decoration by Starck very well mix with Venice rococo. The staff is very friendly and the service is impeccable. The only downside of the hotel is that it has no view on the water and is 20 min walking distance from st Marco piazza which means that you will leave the hotel in the morning and return in the evening.   It is next to palazzo Grassi so in case you want to visit an exhibition then it is ideally located.
