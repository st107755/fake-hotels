This is a beautifully designed hotel with quirks everywhere you look. Our room was really quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable. The design is as you would expect from Starck - mirrors and polished chrome everywhere. Even the TV is behind one of the mirrors. The bed was comfortable. The only issue that we had with this hotel was that despite it being high season there was only a few other people in the bar downstairs. There was a total lack of atmosphere. The staff were very polite and helpful however I think that the design of the reception was a fault of the hotel. There is no standard reception desk and as a result if you want to speak to one of the staff you have to go and find them in a back office. (Not very 5*) All things considered we enjoyed our stay however forâ€¦
