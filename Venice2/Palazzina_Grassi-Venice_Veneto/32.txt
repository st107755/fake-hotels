Had a one night stay at this SPG participation Design Hotel and couldn't have been happier.  Received a nice upgrade and welcome amenity.   Checked in very late around midnight and decided to have some Jasmine tea in the bar area that was lovely.  Junior Suite was small but came with a lovely balcony.  Employees were surprisingly very helpful too.  Cannot wait to be back!
