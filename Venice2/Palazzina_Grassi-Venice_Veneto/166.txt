Stayed in June , a lovely boutique hotel in a great location, easy walking distance to all the major attractions .service was outstanding , nothing was too much trouble . Booked through voyager .com and got an excellent offer compared to other websites .We had an upgrade on our last night to a terrace suite which was beautiful and if returned would , with out a doubt stay in terrace suite again .Only one thing put a dampner on a fabulous stay in a beautiful city , upon check out they tried to charge us for a tiny stain on the carpet , when I had accidently tripped on our last night and spilled some red when , the price you pay per night in a 5 star hotel I don't expect to be charged for a spec of as stain , which I'm sure the cleaner would of got out ! As we told them ASAP ,â€¦
