The hotel is quite modern and cool looking. I thought it was a bit expensive for what it was. At that time you could get legendary hotels like the Bauer and Daniele for the same price. But it's to everyone's liking. It's quite well located, if you Danny want to waste money on the private taxi, the jetty stop is right there. It's about 10-15 min walk to Marcos square. The only thing was the breakfast, the dishes were nice but details like jams and other things were not quite there. And the breakfast is a la crate. So no trying to taste things here and there, gotta know exactly what you want.
