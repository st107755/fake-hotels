STRUCTURE: Venetian-style small house adjacent to the museum Grassi, from this the hotel name. Hotel entrance tucked away on a quiet street, entrance insignificant, with no sign, no particular value. LOBBYING: attractive modern design with true and his own sculptures in glass and mirrors. Front nonexistent except for a small corner with a desk and the machine to load credit cards. ROOMS: small, I would say the smaller room where I have never stayed in a luxury hotel, the only bathroom with tub, separate shower did not. Safe located in the floor of the cabinet, I do not want to use it too much but you really had to sit in the chamber floor. Panorama nonexistent, choking, the window was a blank wall in front of no more than a meter away. Virtually no one saw the light of heaven.â€¦
