We really enjoyed our trip to the Palazzina G From the start in the private water taxi from the airport we felt special! The staff are very helpful and friendly. The room was stunning. The location was very good and right in the middle of all the major sights to visit. Breakfast was very good. Yes would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering booking.
