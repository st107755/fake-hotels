we had an amazing room in this beautiful hotel. it was so clean and comfortable. lots of mirrors! the staff were very helpful.  especially the wait staff at brekky! the breakfast was amazing we stayed when they were renovation so didnt get to enjoy amazing views.. next time. it was so centrally located and we arrived on a  ferry just outside the hotel. i think the suits would be amazing! the toileteries they provided were the best ever! they also provided a bottle of water each evening and turned down our beds! what service!
