We booked PalazzinaG for our wedding reception and it was amazing. The staff was entirely helpful (even when I miscounted my guests and added five two days before the wedding), the venue itself is just wonderful, the location is amazing and the food was wonderful. I cannot say enough about Simona and her staff with all of the arrangements. The reception was perfect, and we will always have those memories. Thank you, PalazzinaG!!
