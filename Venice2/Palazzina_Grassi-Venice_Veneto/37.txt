The hotel room is nice but i had a problem with the staff, started when i arrived at the airport no one was there to pick me up and i payed for this service and was stuck in the airport for two hours waiting and goes on and on the staff is really under qualified and last but not least i payed to drop me to the train station and they are telling me to pay again while i have shown them the receipt. Simply do not recommend
