There's a lot to love about this hotel...but it's the little things that make it overpriced. You can't control your own room temperature (it's done centrally by hotel staff) and we lost hot water. Not the worst thing in the world, but at Â£420/night a hot shower is a must. To be fair, the hotel compensated us for the inconvinience...but the faults mounted to the point where I'd select somewhere else. The rooms are small and clad in mirrors (not for the shy!). It's in a quiet location, away from the bustle of Plaza San Marco, yet easily accessible to all the delights of Venice. The hotel is very chic and the decor is uber-cool...but Venice is not a city for lounging about in a boutique hotel. It's a very good hotel...just a touch pricey for what you get..
