This hotel is off the beaten path but offers a fantastic, convenient location that makes you feel somewhat like a local. It's hidden down an alley but walkable to just about everything and you are tucked away from the tourists. I love a Phillipe Stark designed hotel and wanted something more modern/trendy. The staff was particularly exceptional and welcoming, everyone from the restaurant at breakfast, the bar and upon check in. The woman who helped with restaurant recommendations was spot on in identifying non-touristy places that were perfect for us. You really can't beat the location, the charm and the sexiness of the rooms. A romantic, perfect place for a well traveled couple that loves Miami and NYC.
