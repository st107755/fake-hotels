This hotel was staffed with very gracious and welcoming people.   After checking in we were greeted by name by everyone.  We recieved a lovely complimentary welcome drink.  The bar was beautiful and quiet.  Excellent bartenders. Breakfast was good and beautifully served. All of the service staff were top notch from housekeeping to concierge and everyone in between.  Rooms were very quiet, beautifully appointed.  Beds were comfortable and we slept well.  Hotel is located in a quiet area of Venice close to transportation and easy walking to restaurants.
