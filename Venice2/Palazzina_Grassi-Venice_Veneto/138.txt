This is a great hotel, very stylish and just tucked away from the immediate hustle and bustle. We arrived by water taxi to be met by a member of staff to carry the bags the short walk to the entrance. We were then invited for a welcome drink while the formalities were taken care off. We were delighted to be upgraded to a suite which was superb. A room of mirrors and white linen feeling spacious with a nice bathroom .First night we ate on the terrace. The tasting menu. The food was delicious.  The hotel is a short walk from most things you need to see in Venice. Comfortable   shoes for walking  are a must in Venice as is a map. Its certainly the place to get lost. The staff are the most polite and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them always with a genuine smile andâ€¦
