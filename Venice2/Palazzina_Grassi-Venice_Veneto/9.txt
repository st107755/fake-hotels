A stunning boutique hotel in the middle of Venice. Super cool rooms with everything you could possibly need. It was quiet, contemporary and intimate. The staff were AMAZING and loved the long breakfasts, enjoyed the relaxing balconies and all of the superb finishing touches. We had a tremendous stay. Thank you so much.
