We booked the PalazzinaG as a venue for our Daughter and Son in law to spend part of their honeymoon in Italy. From the beginning to the end of the booking process we thought the service to be excellent. The front desk staff were very helpful in assisting is with our requirement and also assisted us in transfers and a bottle of prosecco in their room upon arrival. Feedback from our Daughter and Son in law was that the hotel was excellent, food beautiful and they were made to feel like royalty. The room was very opulent, immaculately presented and stylish. Location was excellent for all the major sites of Venice. We look forward  to staying at the PalazzinaG ourselves in the future.
