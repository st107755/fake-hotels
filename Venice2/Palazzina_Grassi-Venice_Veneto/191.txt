We have just spent two awesome nights at the Palazzina G Hotel. The rooms were beautiful, clean and modern. The beds and linen were very comfortable and always made up fresh and clean everyday. The breakfast and evening meal we ate there were all good, best croissants I've ever eaten!! We loved the location as it was away from thr crowds but close enough to walk tomall the major attractions. Overall it was a great stay and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Venice.
