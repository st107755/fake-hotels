This was great hotel with Phillip Starck signature design. Great location but once inside a little removed from the Venice vibe. We didn't have a room with a canal view but enjoyed the proximity to many sites. It was tricky to find. Its a short walk from Accademia or on the doorstep from S. Samuele stop.
