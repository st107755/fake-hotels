What a great hotel. Situated in the heart of Venice with short walks to Rialto Bridge and St Marc's Square.  The dining room/bar area is a class apart. Good friendly service as well.  Priced at upper levels you are paying for location and detail.  Our room was a spectacular mirrored bedroom. Small but the most made of it. Clean bathroom with shower (good power) only.  I would highly recommend.
