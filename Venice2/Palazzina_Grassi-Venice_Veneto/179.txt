My wife and 6 month old son stayed for a long weekend in february. We were kindly upgraded to the grand canal suite which was just awesome. The rooms are gorgeous and the view was amazing. they also threw a party that Saturday night that was attended by over 150 people so definitely also the place to be as far as a scene goes. The lobby and restaurant are really cool - can see pictures on sight, but most importantly, at least in our experience, the service was very strong. It seems they were taking particular effort to be as helpful as possible so here i would contrast a bit with some of the other reviewers. The thing to keep in mind is that it is a boutique hotel so it's not going to have all the resources another might. In addition the food was excellent and very reasonablyâ€¦
