A stunning hotel backing onto the Grand Canal - beautiful room full of Starck fittings (we had the Junior Suite Plus) with terrace overlooking the rooftops.  This place is ultra-cool especially the main bar and dining area with open kitchen, all with funky seating and beautiful pieces of Murano glassware dotted around the hotel.  Very friendly staff all made us feel very welcome (even with our 4 year old child in tow!!) Delicious breakfast - the eggs benedict was extremely tasty. Dinner was also great - starters of shrimps with potato cappuccino and the crab salad, both of which were stunning - the delicious smokiness of the potato cappuccino was incredible!! (That's not a sentence you hear often!!). My main was tagliolini with white truffle sauce - again delicious and worth theâ€¦
