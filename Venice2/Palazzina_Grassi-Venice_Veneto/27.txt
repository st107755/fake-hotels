It’s difficult to be more stylish than the Italians especially in Italy but staying at the lavishly appointed Palazzina makes you feel a little less left out. This is a wonderful use of space in tightly packed Venice and offers style, sophistication and luxury with the Starck signature. The staff are wonderful. Friendly, accommodating, always with a smile, they make the experience even more pleasurable. I highly recommend this very unique venue. Arrive by water taxi and be swept into a world of opulence and pleasure. If you’re going to do Venice, do Venice by Starck.
