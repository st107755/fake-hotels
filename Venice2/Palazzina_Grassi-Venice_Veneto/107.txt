Really lovely hotel tucked away so lovely and quiet. It is located very close to everything and we walked everywhere. Didn't use the vaparetto but we did take the hotel private transfer which was a lovely way to start and end the trip. The staff were all very friendly and we had dinner on the first evening in the restaurant and it was very good. The hairdryer wasn't the best and I went and bought one but that was the only negative and most people would be fine with the one provided. We will stay again!
