Pallazina G was a delight from the moment we stepped off our water taxi onto their landing stage. This is a small, stylish hotel with the emphasis on service and comfort. We found all staff to be welcoming and with excellent spoken English. Stayed in their Executive Plus room which was spacious and very nicely equipped with the bonus of a roof terrace. The hotel is wonderfully located with all highlights in easy walking distance. Food was expensive but superb. Do book the water taxi and car, a wonderful way to arrive and softened the blow of leaving.
