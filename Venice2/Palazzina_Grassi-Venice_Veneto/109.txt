We have only stayed one night on our way to Cortina. Wish we would stayed longer. Such a welcoming and nice staff.  If you are travelling from the airport - you simply MUST take the boat taxi the hotel arranges, it's a mini tour through the canals. The ordinary boat taxi is much cheaper, but hey ... You need to travel in style ðŸ˜‰. Both options will drop you off right outside the hotel.  Rooms really nicely done - tiny, modern but cosy.   Location was perfect, close to everything! We will be back!
