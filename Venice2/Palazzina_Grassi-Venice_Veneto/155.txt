This hotel is very pretty and in a nice location, but it wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped. The room itself was quite small, though the bathroom was spacious. The sheets were very rough, and the bed and pillows weren't that comfortable. The front desk staff was helpful but always seemed a bit harried. The directions (which are such a necessity in Venice) they gave were unclear. In addition, I always had to flag down a waiter for more coffee or water, so while the restaurant staff was pleasant, they weren't exactly attentive. I don't think I'd stay there again; for the cost, I didn't feel it was completely worth it.
