Normally go for Aman or Four Seasons style, but given the crazy prices in Venice and the lacklustre reviews of the top hotels thought something slightly more affordable more sensible. This was a sensible option. It was still pricey, despite the cheaper discounted winter rates, compared to the level of upkeep (here more a question of necessary capital expenditure than maintenance), finish and finesse one might get at similarly aimed hotels elsewhere in the world, but a very good compromise for Venice all-in-all. The rooms were spotless and the staff and management brilliant. More should be included, though, in the rates as every little thing was an added extra. That's not necessary in decent establishments where the base rates, even with discounts, are high.
