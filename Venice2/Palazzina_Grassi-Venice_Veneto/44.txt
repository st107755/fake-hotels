First impression: wow! First night: a nightmare First compliant: professionally handled, but unacceptably slow because receptionist was so shocked when we showed him at 11pm why we couldnâ€™t go to bed, but was unable to get access to house keeping store room to replace the linen Second impression: not everything that shines is gold. Second night: quiet, comfortable and friendly staff.  Conclusion: never again because not only linen was inacceptably dirty and complaint handling by far too slow: the management / owner reaction showed a serious lack of professionality and the room rates are significantly too high and rooms very small
