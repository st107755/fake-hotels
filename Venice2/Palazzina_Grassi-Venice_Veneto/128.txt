Nice enough from from a design perspective but sadly a lot of the design features let the product down. The sinks in the rooms were terrible. You could not use them to wash and if you turned the tap on too much you were covered in water. The rooms were small and poky for the price.No tea and coffee making facilities in the room. No iron available at all?!?  Staff were thin on the ground. The rooftop terrace was not staffed you had to call down for staff and there was often a wait. Very expensive bar 9Euro for a Peroni. The famous Krug bar was never open. We paid extra for continental breakfast which ended up being a rather meager offering of a bread roll and a pastry, no sliced meats fruits or cheese to be seen.
