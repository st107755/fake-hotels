Stayed one night in the JD suite as a family of four. The suite is spectacular!! Outstanding design, great layout for a family of four with one bedroom up, one bedroom down (but all contained in its own private flat), large living/dining room, views of the grand canal, design is amazing (the sofa in the upper living room is something else and has to be seen), and all works together, great sound system, quiet, well-stocked mini bar.  Likewise, public spaces in the hotel are very well designed. Service was generally friendly (porter, restaurant) and well delivered, e.g. front desk recommended and arranged an excellent restaurant, called me on the train 10 min prior to arrival to give me precise instructions on how to find the pre-booked water taxi. Fantastic location betweenâ€¦
