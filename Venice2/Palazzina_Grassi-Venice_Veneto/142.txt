Venice is a magical place and it's important to stay somewhere that matches the wonder of the city. This is an original Starck hotel, so is crammed with ornate glasswork, mirrors, quirky paintings and unusual artifacts. So the drama and style of the hotel more than lives up to the excitement of the city. This, combined with excellent front of house staff who genuinely want to help, makes this a great little hideaway. We have stayed a few times, and will be staying again. Just be aware that the rooms are quite small.
