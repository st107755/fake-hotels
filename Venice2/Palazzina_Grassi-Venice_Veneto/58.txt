I was lucky enough to have been given a boutique hotel voucher via Mr & Mrs Smith as a gift, and selected to stay at Palazzina G. I'd loved the idea that the hotel was super stylish and luxe, designed by Phillippe Starck. The location of the hotel was canal-facing but not from the main Piazza. As with much of Venice, PalazzinaG is tucked away in a labyrinth of serpentine streets and tricky to find by foot! I loved the location's quiet and calm, in the middle of winter near many art and antique stores. Perhaps for someone seeking to stay in the 'thick' of the Piazza this may not be for you. The luxury services were quite relaxed, the team were pleasant and courteous at all times. There was some lovely treats and Prosecco upon arrival (but I believe this was via Mr & Mrs Smith).â€¦
