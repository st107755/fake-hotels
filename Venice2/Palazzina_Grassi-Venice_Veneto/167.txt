Loved my stay at the Palazzina G a beautiful boutique hotel in a fantastic location. The rooms are small which is the norm in venice but they are beautifully designed using mirrors making them appear more spacious. The hotel staff were very polite and helpful in directing us around venice and ordering water taxis. Would definitely recommend.
