Just back from 5 days at this gem of a hotel. Fantastic secret location in San Samuele with very quiet environment yet only 10 mins walk or two minute boat ride from San Marco, Rialto, Zattere! Faultless, discrete, professional yet friendly staff with great breakfast. The superior room was spacious and so good to have a bathroom with window and endless clean towels and bedding. Spotlessly clean everywhere. Love the 'animal' stools in the Krug bar - and quirky decor, mirrors everywhere, well done to Phillipe Starck. Would definitely go there again.
