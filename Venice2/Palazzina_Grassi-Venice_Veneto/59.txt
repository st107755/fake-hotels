If you were my friend, I'd say pick a different hotel.   Here is why I say that.   Return trip to Venice, but first time at this hotel.   Palazzina G was a disappointment especially given the room rate. The hotel was recommended to us by Virtuoso Network and It could be OK depending what the client prioritizes. If the client cares more about DESIGN than COMFORT, could be fine.   Everything seemed like a challenge - room controls, A/C, crowded furniture.  Bathroom lights were actually complex to operate - how about simple buttons, or a card explaining how to turn on the light over the sink? In one part of hotel a staircase is hidden behind a glass wall; coffee cups are so funky looking they are actually not comfortable to hold. Room service would forget to arrive (yep!) or itâ€¦
