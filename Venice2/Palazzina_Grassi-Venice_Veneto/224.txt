Small Rooms.  Way to overpriced.  Virtaully no closet space.  Air Conditioning didnt work.  TV had a constant buzzing sound, and when asked, Staff said that was normal in all rooms . Front office staff very confused and lied about facilities.  Sheets had a grungy odor.  Location very far from heart of Venice.The service and amenities at the restaurant were hideous. The bread was hard and was obviously old.  No place mats.  One waiter coudnt understand a word we said when asking for water. All this under the umbrella of "Philip Stark", what a waste.
