A very stylish hotel with some fabulously quirky features - all very Phillipe Stark - but in parts was a bit scruffy. We had a junior suite on the second floor with its own private terrace. The room was a good size but in need of renovation as it had the feeling that it had been 'well used'. There were mirrors everywhere that take some getting used to and overall it felt a bit soulless, unlike the public areas. The dining room/bar was beautifully furnished with a mix of contemporary, vintage styled and traditional furniture, Merano glass lights and fittings, along with an abundance of Venetian mirrors. The staff were excellent and very attentive (they noted from my passport that it was my birthday and presented a cake) but the room we had was disappointing.
