We spent two nights here at the end of June. We loved the location, the free arrival coffee and pastries, the decor and the room. The rooms are well designed but a little on the small side.  Breakfast on the roof was great although I would have hoped really you wouldn't have to pay â‚¬7.50 for an omelette - nice but a tad expensive! Continental is included though.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The location perfect for being away from the tourists but not so far it's only 10 minutes to St Marks Square.  Hotels in Venice are all more expensive than elsewhere in Europe so we would recommend, especially if you like a lot of mirrors and white decor.
