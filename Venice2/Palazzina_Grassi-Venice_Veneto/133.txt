Not a 5 star hotel by no means. Palazzina G "baits and switches." They advertise with pictures that do not respect the room category. They use the best room category features from various rooms which is misrepresentation. When you check in, the room is not as advertised. The mattresses are of extremely poor quality and not comfortable. Mosquitos buzz in your ears and bite while trying to sleep. Room service selection awful. Staff condescending. Over priced, not worth it.
