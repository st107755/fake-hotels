the rooms were fairly large with a step up small lounge area. we had a balcony but it wasnt that private for we saw our neighbor in the hotel tanning through the thin bushes. service was ok, i had to ask a few times for things. the location is great for those who like to be a drop out of the busy streets but within walking distance of everything.
