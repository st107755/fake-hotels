Stayed at this hotel for a night after a cruise and would not stay there again, was definitely not value for money as the room charges were very high (even for Venice) but the room was extremely small.  No reception but checking in is done in the restaurant - first impressions were bad and also it was hard to find.  We have stayed in Venice a few times but this was the most expensive but the worst experience.
