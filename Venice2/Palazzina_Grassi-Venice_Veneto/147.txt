It is definitely one of the best places to stay during a nice, cosy (and by the way: romantic) weekend in Venice. Situated in the not overcrowded neighborhood around Palazzo Grassi (also worth to see!) you can find a harbourage designed by the grand master, the godfather Philippe Starck. "... and make every guest feel like 'temporarily Venetian. " -> to create this atmosphere was the goal and to be honest: Well done!  Kitchen and service (especially the breakfast) as (and by the times more) than you can expect from a 5* Boutique Hotel in Venice, right on the Canale. Definitely an honest suggestion ... the only "thing": Not the cheapest place on earth ;-)
