I don't have a bad word to say about this hotel.  I often find that 'it hotels' generate such high expectation that it's almost impossible for them to live up to, but Palazzina Grassi is in a league of its own.  It manages to be luxurious but 'homely', extremely stylish but with an air of understated discretion and surprisingly lacking unnecessary pretension. My room was ample in size with plenty of room for luggage.  It certainly 'wowed' on entry. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room silent.  With a large indulgent bathroom, the room was an oasis of style and tranquility in a beautiful city.  Unfortunately I only stayed for one night, but I would return without hesitation.  In a city possibly lacking some contemporary style, Palazzina Grassi is a beacon of modernâ€¦
