We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon and loved it! It is extremely stylish, posh and romantic. Our "superior room" was a delight; small but cosy with everything you would expect from a top hotel, arguably the best in Venice. We were fortunate enough to book the last two tickets for their New Years Eve party which turned out to be the funniest, best NYE party we have ever had. The food and drinks in the restaurant/bar are pricey, but excellent. In short, we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.
