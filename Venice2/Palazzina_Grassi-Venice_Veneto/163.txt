This hotel won't be to everyone's taste as it is funky and quirky, designed by Philip Starck however I loved it. Our room was lovely and had a separate sitting area and little balcony. Attached to the hotel is the Krug Lounge which is populated by stuffed animals which serve as seats which is great fun. The one disappointment was sometimes the staff felt disorganised especially at breakfast on the terrace which didn't always lend itself to the most relaxing start to the day. That said my husband and I have been to Venice on numerous occasions, with this being the first stay at this hotel and we will be booking here again next time we visit.
