i went, with four friends, for the new year eve at the dinner show in palazzina G.  The place, that's always amazing, was even more with great gold decorations made for the party called "the golden eve",  organized by "Madame EMA" a nice little woman . During the dinner there were all night round show, not conventional, sexy and funny.The food was great, the waiters and all the artistc stuff made a great and unique atmosphere. The place were to be! I suggest this place, not so cheap, but which is worth what you pay for. I will not miss next party signed  Madame EMA next carnival!!!
