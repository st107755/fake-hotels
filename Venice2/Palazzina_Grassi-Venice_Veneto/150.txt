Elegant Philippe Starck breath-of-fresh air for Venice by Emanuele Garosci. A light-appropriate cross between the Delano and a Mama Shelter (rooms similarly small, large lovely bathrooms, few baths, delightful designs). Thoughtful and exquisite chef specializes in whimsical touches. Lounge-bar-welcome-front-desk replacement-chill zone                                                one of the most romantic anywhere. If you can't stay, just enjoy a drink, far from the madding crowd.  A quiet corner off the tourist-track yet handy to the water.  Terrible phones.  Great staff...remember, don't go first time to Venice with your b'lovd, or you will find yourself falling in love with Venice instead....
