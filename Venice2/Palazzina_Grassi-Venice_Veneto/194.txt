The PallazinaG is fantastic, far enough away from the craziness of St Marks but close enough that it's a 10min walk.  We opted for a Junior Suite on the second floor, very typically Phillipe Starck, clean lines, minimal lots of mirrors and heavy on the design. I was very impressed with the room layout and while not huge there was everything you needed. Loads of funky toiletries, fluffy towels and bathrobes, we forgot a travel plug,one call to the concierge and 5 mins later a knock on the door with a smile and it was delivered.  On arriving we were taken to the bar area that doubles as a restaurant and reception, checked in over a complimentary drink while bags where whisked to our room.   The terrace area is great if the sun is shinning and the breakfast is more than enough,â€¦
