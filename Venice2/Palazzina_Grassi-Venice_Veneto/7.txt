I love visiting this hotel in Venice....its so classy and arty...always lovely service ..i havent stayed at the hotel itself as usually i go to Venice in summer and like to stay at The Excelsior ..but this hotel for a winter break is perfect ..i will definitely be booking soon..the fornasetti crockery is everywhere!!..
