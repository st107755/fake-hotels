We have been to the restaurant at the hotel twice already since we’ve been in Venice. The service is truly exemplary....attentive, informative and friendly. The food is also fabulous. We have tried the boneless ribs, ravioli, foam potato app and much more. Everyone has been beautifully prepared with fresh ingredients. I can’t imagine a better overall experience in the city. We will be trying their breakfast tomorrow. It’s truly a hidden gem worth the hunt!
