The most chic hotel I have stayed out!  We had a suite, overlooking the grand canal. Stunning! It was quiet, clean, so posh...we loved every minute.  The breakfast included was quite basic and there were only a few a la carte options. You had to spend â‚¬40/person to get a decent hot meal. Other than that, everything was perfect. Location was superb!  Water bus and water taxi stop around the corner. We will be back!
