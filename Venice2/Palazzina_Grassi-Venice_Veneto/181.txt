It was our 15th wedding anniversary. Being new to Venice it took absolutely ages to find this hotel! It is located in a side street with no sign posts and when you eventually arrive there is no name outside the hotel even though there is a house number! Very posh indeed but I'd rather have it easier than posh! Upon checking in we were offered a welcome drink in the nice plush bar/restaurant - no complaints there we were served what we asked for and on time with complimentary peanuts and cracked corn.   I then told them that it was our anniversary so would appreciate a nice room with a view if at all possible. Looked promising as the reception chap went away to "see what he could do". After 10 mins, we were told by the receptionist that the hotel was full and there was no chanceâ€¦
