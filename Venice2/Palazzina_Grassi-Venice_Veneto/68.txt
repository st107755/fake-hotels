My husband and I have just spent 5 nights at Palazzina G in Venice for our silver wedding anniversary. It was lovely. Our suite's windows opened onto the Grand Canal, the room beautifully decorated all in cream with plenty of mirrors, we arrived by water taxi arranged by the hotel and had breakfast in our room by the canal every day.  It is in a very good location - two minutes walk to the waterbus stop and 20 minutes walk to St Marks Square via a maze of lovely small streets. The concierge was very helpful booking a lovely visit to Murano and a glass factory. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night which was delicious. The whole experience was like staying in a personal house not a hotel. I would highly recommend it.
