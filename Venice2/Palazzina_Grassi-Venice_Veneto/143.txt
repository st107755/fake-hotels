We stayed at the Junior suite and on Sat the rate was Euro 973 and rest of the rest of the  week we were paying Euro 731. With that price the room and service was like a 3 stars hotel. The room 216 have no view only over looking at the roof top of the neighbours. The lobby of the hotel is very small with only 1 chair could sit and wait. The only area for breakfast and dining is dark and no window to see outside. The continental breakfast was included which they served only 2/3 glass of juice. We asked for another glass and price was 5 Euro and I asked for a glass of water to take my medication and it was charged 3 Euro. I only found out only during the check out and I strongly against it then they took it off the bill. Imagine you pay so much and they don't even have a gestureâ€¦
