Venice is a walking city.  The alleys od Venice is one big museum however narrow and the main ones are full of people this time of the year.  I finally found a perfect place to get away completely from the crowds. Palazzina Grassi tucked away in a small alley in Venice yet centrally located. The only hotel in Italy done by Philippe Starck  shush is also refreshing tomget away from the heavy Venetian decor of the big hotels in Venice.  Everything was just perfect. The staf are young efficient friendly and could not do enough to make our stay so pleasent. The rooms are adequate in size with frette linen sheets ! The breakfast incredible and so was the restaurant sot we ate all our dinners in the hotel. I know the Venetian restaurants so well. This I can say would be one of veniceâ€¦
