We have just returned from this property in Venice. We had a fantatsic stay which was really made by the professional service of the staff. Martina welcomed us, nothing to much trouble, very polite and approachable. Lucca the same, nothing too much trouble, very helpful and full of recomendations for restaurants etc Breakfast was fantastic, our room rate inc B&B. The breakfast service from Gloria was 5*.Excellent. The hotel is very stylish, modern and quirky, as one would expect from Stark. Rooms are decorated in the same way, although slighlty small, but saying that, it is quite normal for Venice as we have stayed in other 5* locations in Venice. Excellent location for all the sites, restaurants and shopping. For us it was the staff and the service which stood out at thisâ€¦
