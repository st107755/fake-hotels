The service at this hotel was very warm and friendly.  After a long journey to Italy it was a wonderful welcome and start to our vacation.  The rooms were clean and had enough space to move around.  Nice bathrooms that were not cramped.  The decor is Phillipe Stark so it has a modern edge to it.  The whole hotel has a family feel to it which makes it very welcoming.  It is well located and has a great lounge area.
