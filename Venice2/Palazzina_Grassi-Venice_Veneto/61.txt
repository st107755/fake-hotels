Nice sized bedroom with a decent sized bathroom, no bath with only a walk in shower. The double bed was very comfortable cotton sheet and light duvet. The hotel was close to most of the tourists spots, private water taxi drops you at hotel entrance. The continental breakfast was served to the table by efficient staff.
