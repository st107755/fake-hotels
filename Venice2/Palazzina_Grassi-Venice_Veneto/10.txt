This Philip Stark designed hotel is chic and sophisticated with a great attentive staff.  The hotel is small (35 room?) with a beautiful rooftop bar/restuarant and one that sits overlooking the Grand Canal.  The design is some of Stark's best work and shows a sophistication that comes with age and travel.  The staff is well trained and very helpful!
