I read a glowing review about the bar in this hotel only to be disappointed by a snooty barman. The nice receptionist showed us to the bar at which point we were refused service as the bar man claimed he was too busy serving dining guests .... 3 couples in a very quiet restaurant.  Needless to say we won't be returning.
