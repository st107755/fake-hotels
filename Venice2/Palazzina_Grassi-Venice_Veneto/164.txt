After booking this hotel with much excitement and experience of Philippe Starck hotels I have to be honest and say it wasn't anything special at all.  We had just been married at the Sanderson London (the best Philippe Starck Hotel in my opinion) so with this in mind we genuinely thought it would be of the same standard. Don't get me wrong the staff were lovely (Jack, Georgia and a lady in the restaurant forgive me I don't know her name) but it was our honeymoon, the hotel was not full at all there were never guests around when we were there. I asked for an upgrade and was told we had a bottle of prosecco instead, we don't even drink but just got on with it.  Our room was small and I wasn't expecting it to be that small and the lighting system was a joke. They kept switching offâ€¦
