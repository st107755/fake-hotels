My wife and I have just returned from this beautiful hotel which occupies its own island 10 minutes water shuttle from San Marco. As with most of not all hotels in Venice, the exterior of these building do not catch the eye, but do not be fooled, inside you will find beauty and refinement that is breathtaking. The San Clemente Kempinski is a magnificently spacious hotel and our Grand Deluxe room with both lagoon and garden views did not disappoint. Every member of staff you encounter is friendly welcoming and professional and nothing is too much trouble. All Covid 19 protocols are in place with mask wearing staff and all but a minority of guests observing the mask rule both indoors and outdoors. Of course you expect to pay for these services so the prices of food and drink are high - but well worth it in our opinion. The aforementioned courtesy private water shuttle runs to and from SAN Marco every 40 minutes and literally pops you across the water, to enjoy the sights of Venice city with its many many shops, literally at every turn. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back soon. â€¦
