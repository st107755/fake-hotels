I would have given this hotel 4.5 to 5 but for the absurd elevator/supermarket "music" playing in reception/public areas and all restaurant/bar areas (but fortunately not around the pool).  I just don't understand why quality hotels of this kind take care of all the senses intelligently, except the ears.  This was the worst kind of muzak; meaningless disco rhythms, punctuated by wailing saxophones and other freakish noises, and all presumably copyright free.  What a shame.  If you don't care about music you'll be fine.  This hotel in particular, given its wonderful setting, doesn't need muzak.  It's so frustrating for a natural ambiance to be ruined, deliberately.  Requests to turn down/off the music were accommodated to various degrees but it brings its own stress having to askâ€¦
