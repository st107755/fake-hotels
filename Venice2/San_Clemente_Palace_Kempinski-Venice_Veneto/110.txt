Every year for 13 years we have been going to this Hotel and its come a long way under Kempinskis ownership . Service around the pool is some much better than earlier years from other owners. Turin Hotels and StRegis. My only little gripe is that I first took my wife there 13years ago for a special birthday and we go the same time every year. This year a miss no acknowledgment of her birthday no upgrade no bottle of champagne or prosecco cake or flowers nothing niente. But we still love it .
