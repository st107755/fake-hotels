 It was an unforgettable experience . I have stayed at the end of October with my wife , how satisfied we are with the hospitality and wonderful experience in the hotel.   From the doorman, lady in reds, concierge  to the maids,  staff were all very special & friendly and  attentive to details in providing exceptional service  which contributed to us having a great time in Venice.   Beautiful location and grounds. Hotel itself is very impressive. Enjoy island & its silence after a busy day, it was awesome to getting back to the hotel from a crowded main land. Great place to relax and can’t be beat. Only 10 min to San Marco by boat shuttle which is complimentary.  The rooms are nice and perfectly clean. Wonderful well maintained garden and outdoor lounge . Breakfast was excellent…
