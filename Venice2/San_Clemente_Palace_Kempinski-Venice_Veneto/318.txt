This private island hotel is huge but has lots of quiet spaces so does not feel busy. The pool area is lovely and the restaurants serve excellent food with service to match. All staff were excellent. The complementary boat to Venice centre works really well and you can have the best of all worlds when you return from sightseeing to relax at the hotel.
