I was worried after making my reservation that not being on main island would be a disadvantage however I think that there is no nicer way to arrive in Piazza San Marco each day. The calm of the island, it's beautiful grounds and stunning church are a haven away from bustling tourists. Our room was beautiful with a stunning lagoon view. The rooms are simply elegant, spacious (which I had not experienced in other 5 star hotels in Venice) and well equipped. Staff, whether in corridors, at reception or in restaurants were friendly, warm and helpful. The building is incredible with wide corridors, tasteful d√©cor and a feeling of calm despite the number of guests.  I would recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning on my next Venice trip.
