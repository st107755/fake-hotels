Where do I start, what a beautiful place! From the second we arrived we fell in love with the place!   The staff are so welcoming and friendly. The hotel and grounds are just stunning. Its a great getaway after a long day in venice where it can be quite busy.  Would give more stars if I could, highly recommend
