Beautiful hotel and grounds, an oasis away from Venice's Summer crowds. The swimming pool area offers a great, peaceful way to end your day after braving S. Marco's overcrowded environs,  Impeccable hotel Staff and service. Spacious and luxurious bedroom suite, tastefully decorated. Over a five night stay, a wider variety of dining venues and options in the hotel would have been most welcome. Barring that, I could not fault it.
