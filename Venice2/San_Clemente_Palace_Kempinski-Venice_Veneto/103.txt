We stayed here for 5 days and have to say the service is so poor if I could give no stars I would!   On arrival we was greeted with no real welcome, just pointed to reception! At the arrival desk nobody asked how we was and why we had come to Venice!   We was shown to our room, which is a nice room! This is where it all went wrong.  Went to have a shower, and the whole shower was blocked allowing no water to go down the drain and flooded out bathroom floor!   We then asked for someone to come and sort the room out, got told oh yes we know the filters can get blocked!   We go to the pool and If you like to wait 1h for your drinks by the pool please stay here! We order food by the pool and get served cold food! 1 person working on his own trying to serve over 50+ guests.  Orderâ€¦
