We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my mother’s 60th birthday and had the most amazing time.   The hotel and grounds are stunning, very clean and decorated to a high standard. The concierge and porters give you a very warm welcome on arrival and whisk your bags away so you can enjoy the stroll up through the grounds to reception.  We arrived very early and so I wasn’t expecting to be able to check in at this time but the reception staff were brilliant and had us checked in within minutes, albeit only one of the two rooms booked was ready at this time but that wasn’t a problem as we were very early and I hadn’t expected our rooms to be ready at all. They were also dealing with a difficult customer next to me who was insisting on an upgrade and complaining rather aggressively…
