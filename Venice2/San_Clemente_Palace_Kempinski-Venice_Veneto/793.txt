This hotel really is wonderful. The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. The pool area was peaceful and very relaxing and this was definitely needed after exploring Venice in the summer heat (the hotel provides a complimentary shuttle over to the main square). The bar at sunset was picture perfect and we enjoyed many cocktails here. The restaurant was top class and the tasting menu exquisite!!!! We would recommend this option! The chef even came out to personally greet us. The service at the restaurant and bar was fantastic.  However, our trip and lasting perception of the hotel was slightly spoilt on the very last day and since. We expected more from a concierge service at a five star St. Regis resort We had called down for our luggageâ€¦
