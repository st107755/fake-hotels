The hotel is beautifully located, the building is amazing in its grandeur and proportions, the surrounding park is amazing. Nice large swimming pool. Rooms are spacious and quiet, probably because of the thick ancient walls of the building. Breakfast buffet is perfect. The shuttle boat to Venice every half hour reliable and a short and pleasant 10 minute ride. Staff is very friendly.  There were only two issues that we could not understand. The hotel management has chosen a rather complicated approach to providing wifi in the rooms. There is a free wifi net that basically is too slow to download anything. Then there is one where you can purchase a package. If you join the hotels loyalty program they waive the fee, however, all our devices kept switching back to the Free network,â€¦
