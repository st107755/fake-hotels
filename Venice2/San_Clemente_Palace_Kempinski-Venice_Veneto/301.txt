We stayed at the hotel for a family weekend trip and we couldnâ€™t have imagined how perfect everything was. The two connected rooms were large, beautifully decorated, extremely clean and the beds very comfortable. Also loved the Salvatore Ferragamo amenities. The property was so well kept and the heated pool the perfect treat. The food at the hotel was also delicious. Lastly the staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. We loved this place and will definitely return.
