We arrived from the rail station by private water taxi with our guide from VSOE. The trip was quick and we were taken through the centre of Venice - views from the start! On arrival at San Clemente, we were warmly greeted by staff and our bags whisked away. After check-in and orientation, we went to La Dolce for a casual dinner. We were not disappointed. The pizza and tomato salad were superb. Staff were attentive.  The same applied at the two breakfasts. Great customer service. Dinner in Acquerello was superb. The jazz entertainment, great waiting staff, food and wine (a better and a cheaper recommend by the Sommelier) made for a wonderful evening. A great place to visit (or perhaps not visit) Venice. Well done Team Kempinski!
