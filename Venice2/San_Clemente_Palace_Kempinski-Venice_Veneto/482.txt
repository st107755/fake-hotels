We stayed at San Clemente 2 years ago and were nervous about coming back with our children (ages 16,15 and 14) based on some of the recent reviews. All I can say is that our experience was terrific. Our upgraded room (a junior suite) was beautiful, freshly renovated and clean,  the pool a pleasure to sit by, the breakfast had many choices all - perfectly excecuted. From the moment we checked-in, we were greeted by helpful, smiling staff. The only suggestion I would have to make the experience better is to have the boats run every 15 minutes instead of 20, especially on weekends as they do get crowded. This is a great hotel and a lovely way to visit Venice and also have time to relax with family.
