This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel, and it's a real treat! Close to the centre of Venice and far away from the crowds, so you can relax and enjoy the nature and space on San Clemente.  The rooms are a good size, beautifully decorated, this hotel has everything you need to enjoy your holiday: spa, restaurants, gardens, and outside swimming pool. The staff is very efficient and super friendly.  One thing that was a bit disappointing, is the price for breakfast: 50 euro per person! Last time I visited the hotel (two years ago), breakfast was included in the price.  I would understand if it was 25 euro per person, but 50 euro is taking advantage of the location.  But otherwise, this hotel is a little paradise in the centre of Venice!
