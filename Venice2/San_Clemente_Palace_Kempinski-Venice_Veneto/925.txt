Wow.. everything I have imagined and more. It's so delightful to be amazed by a place that is beyond the postcard image I had in mind. Beauty comes at a price but was truly worth every penny. Venice and The St Regis definitely goes down as one of the best places we have ever stayed. Truly remarkable, no complaints and hope to visit again.
