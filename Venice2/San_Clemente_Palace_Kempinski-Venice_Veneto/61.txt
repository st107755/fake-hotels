I have stayed in Venice many many times and have not stayed anywhere as fantastic as this - on every level it was 10 out of 10.  Beautiful, immaculate rooms, and hallways and furniture. Gardens, music and pool. Wonderful staff too.  It ticks every box.  Highly recommend.  I will be always staying there from now on!
