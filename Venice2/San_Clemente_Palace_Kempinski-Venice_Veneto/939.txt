We visited here everyday last week whilst staying at the Danielli Hotel (sorry can't spell that) to use the swimming pool. The staff greeting us from the boat docking area were excellent and made us feel very welcome. I have no hestitation about recommending this hotel and would stay and visit again in the future.
