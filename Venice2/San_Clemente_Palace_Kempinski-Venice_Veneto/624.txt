A superb & efficiently run hotel offering almost every amenity in a delightful setting. Felt truly spoilt returning to the calm of the Kempinski in their own motor launch following each trip into the magical but bustling city of Venice. Beautifully appointed rooms and bathrooms, an excellent breakfast buffet, along with a well run swimming pool and delightful surrounding gardens.The hotel was originally a Monastery & consequently has long wide corridors, large rooms  and high ceilings. All the "front of house" staff and particularly the concierge service were helpful and courteous. The only mistake was not staying longer!
