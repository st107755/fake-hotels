The hotel is beautiful, immaculate and quiet.  The breakfast is excellent and the servers were so accommodating  We had the most memorable meal in Acquerello Restaurant while staying at the San Clemente.  It was absolutely outstanding- the beautiful evening outdoors on the terrace, the entire meal was delicious!  But the evening was made truly memorable by the excellent service provided by Marco and Stephanie B.  We will never forget them!  They both took such good care of us during our meal.  We felt truly pampered!  I told my husband it was the best dining experience I’ve ever had.
