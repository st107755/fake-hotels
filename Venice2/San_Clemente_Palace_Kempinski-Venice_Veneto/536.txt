We stayed here and booked a canal view Jr suite, our room was beautiful and spacious. It was wonderful to get back here from the crowded mainland. Dinner outside in the warm months was Lovely, If you are are there in warmer months the pool is a lovely addition and the grounds are tranquil and beautiful. I'm VERY picky and this hotel hit the mark in every way!!
