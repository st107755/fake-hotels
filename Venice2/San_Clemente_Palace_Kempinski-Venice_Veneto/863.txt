Beautiful location, luxury room and the grounds were incredible. Concierge were helpful sometimes service a bit slow but only just opened so clearly getting to grips with things! Amazing breakfast but never ate dinner in hotel (have been told by other guests that the food was awesome and so were the prices!). Had lunch on one day by pool - v good. Great private shuttle boat service (15mins to San Marco). All in all a 5 star stay and hope to return. Also the most delicious smelling place I have ever been to - whatever flora and fauna they have planted is great!
