The St Regis is in a lovely location…a small island just off Venice. That is the good part. It is very,very expensive which would be okay if it were very , very exceptional.We were there five days and kept hoping it would improve. Sadly , not.  They proudly introduce you to your "butler" when you first arrive. We called occasionally and the phone was never answered. There is a boat that ferries between Venice and the island. One evening they were late in picking up people and then had insufficient capacity to handle all the guests…so some people were left waiting 30 minutes for the next boat. We asked for newspapers…which came three of the five days and once only after we called. We asked the concierge to call for dinner reservations one morning…but he "forgot" so we ended up in…
