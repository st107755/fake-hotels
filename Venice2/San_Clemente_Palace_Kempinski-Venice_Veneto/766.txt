For over $1000 AU per night I don't think it is worth the money as the Euro was killing us. Nice place to escape the main city but everything is very expensive in this hotel. The food by the pool was probably the best if of the lot but still pricey. The casual dining next to the fine dining area was awful and probably the worst burger ever had. Breakfast was exceptional but at $48 euros it should be. Our mini bar was not restocked once during our stay and dirty glasses were left in our room and never collected. Nice place but wait for a better exchange rate
