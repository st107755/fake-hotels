The hotel is superb. On an island. I took the family there to celebrate the 40th birthday of my wife.  The stay was great. I was concerned about the commute to Venice but ut is very easy, short and practical. I did it with 2 kids aged 5 and 1 and two push chairs so...  It is a very relaxing and classy place. The staff when booking is charming, but the only point is that the concierge is not that friendly. Each question we asked seemed to bother him and a smile was a big option.  When we booked a water taxi to go to Airport, I noticed that a couple did the same (saw it on his dashboard) at the same time. I requested to check if we can offer them to share the cost . He didn’t like that. But the people were actually very happy as the cost of a water taxi is 140 euros if i remember…
