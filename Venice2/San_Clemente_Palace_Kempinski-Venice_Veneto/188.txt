Fabulous hotel at a comfortable lagoon’s length from the city with noble accommodation, lovely grounds, competent staff, an outrageously good breakfast, and an excellent water transfer to the sights. We chose the hotel for refuge and comfort while the city was gripped by exceptional tidal flooding and squally uncomfortable weather. We weren’t disappointed.
