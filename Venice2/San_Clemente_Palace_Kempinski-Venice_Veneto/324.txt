Direct booking at the Hotel offered the same rates like on internet. Very competent and friendly service. Concierge explained marvelous the way how to reach the Hotel and where to park the car (Garage with security). Water taxi 80€ - One night garage 72€ - thats Venice :-). From Piazza de Marco Hotel shuttle every 30 min - free of charge. Hotel tatatatata!!!! Fantastic. Service, Food, Bed, Bath ***** Stars! Anything not okay? NO!
