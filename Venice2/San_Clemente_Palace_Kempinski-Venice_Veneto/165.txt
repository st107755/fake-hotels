Positive: - The location - Even though the hotel is not on one of the main areas of Venice, they provide free shuttle service every 30 mins to San Marco. This shuttle service lets you see the San Marco and other attraction areas from the sea and lets you escape from the crowdedness of Venice. The hotel owns the island so it is very private - The spacious, modern and clean rooms with a huge bed.  - The hotel's pool that was heated. - Breakfast was buffet style with good amount of choices.   Negative: - Can't really think of anything.  As a couple we truly enjoyed the hotel and staff was very professional and helpful.
