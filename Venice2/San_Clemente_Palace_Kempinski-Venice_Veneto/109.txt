I have stayed between 05-07 July in San Clemente Palace Kempinski to celebrate my birthday & had fantastic time ... the hotel is a true oasis of luxury with very well appointed rooms, seamless service and awesome restaurant & bar. The swimming pool & gardens with lots of private corners provide a fantastic retreat after a busy day of sightseeing in beautiful Venice. The boat trip back to the hotel on sunset is a special treat in itself. Breakfast buffet is a dream with a great selection of Italian cheese & ham. All in all a true luxury!  P.S. try the one and only Turkish coffee of Venice in the hotel bar and donâ€™t miss to visit 11th century church just at the hotel dock which also hosts part of biennale.
