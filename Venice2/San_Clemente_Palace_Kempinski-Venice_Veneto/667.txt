It's not everyday that you stay at a hotel which occupies its own island.  When its a private shuttle boat ride from one of the world's most crowded tourist destinations, it's even more special to be able to escspe to tranquility every evening and to arrive right at St. Mark's Square every morning.  The hotel is a special place as well, with its own church and sculpture park.  Compared with the high standards you would expect, the only comments we had were that the rooms were a little small and sparse and the breakfast service a little limited given the price.  Small problems, but then the price does deserve perfection.
