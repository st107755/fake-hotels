This has to be one of the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in many.  Our room was absolutely enormous and the bed and gorgeous linen was to die for. The attention to detail is sublime.  It is the little things such as the linen feet mats beside the bed.   Loved lying in the bath and being able to look over the lagoon.  This hotel is on it's own island and to say you feel like you are in your own wonderland does not even touch sides with how we loved it.  I will certainly be coming back for special romantic occasions.
