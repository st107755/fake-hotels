The San Clemente was a welcome respite from the crowds on the mainland.  Convenient taxi launch, beautiful grounds and pool.  Our room was quite large and comfortable. The food was just right but we only had breakfast each of our 3 mornings here.  This was among one of the most unique properties we have ever stayed at and we will be back!
