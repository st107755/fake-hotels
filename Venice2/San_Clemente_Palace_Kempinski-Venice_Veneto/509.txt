We arrived on a misty morning by private water taxi to a warm greeting. The hotel is a lovely walk through the gardens to the main entrance. The building is very quaint, large proportions, lots of stone. We checked in quickly and shown to our room on the second floor with two large windows overlooking the lagoon. The room was deluxe, a good size, nicely appointed with high ceilings. The bathroom was on the small side with only one sink and a bit dark. lots of marble! Smallish wardrobe with only a few hangers. The air-condition wasn't working and the room temp was 25.00C. the hotel said that the city council would not let them put it on as the building is historic? strange. It took nearly two hours for our bags to arrive so following a complaint we were offered a free cocktailâ€¦
