Stayed here when it first opened its doors many years ago. Returned to see that it was still as beautiful and unspoilt as it was then. Think that it has improved by Kempinski and now offers a beautiful bar overlooking the lagoon. There is a large pool and beautiful grounds to wander around. Boat shuttle ran like clockwork every 30 minutes each way and was punctual so be late at your peril. We opted for a grande deluxe room which was very spacious with gorgeous Murano fittings. Staff were friendly and we were treated very well indeed. Look forward to returning.
