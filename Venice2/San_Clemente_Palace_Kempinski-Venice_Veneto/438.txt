Absolutely amazing! This hotel is set on its own private island giving you a real sense of being somewhere special. The buildings are old but well maintained. The grounds and garden are immaculate and there is space to go for a walk. There is a pool so you can laze around but the frequent hotel boat service will get you into Venice in 15 minutes with the added bonus of being able to enjoy the scenery with the trip. The hotel boat is great - I called it the "party boat" because you would leave the hotel as strangers but return as friends having enjoyed the charms of this wonderful city. Food and beverage service was good and the setting of the hotel in the evening is magical. Its a real couples place so if you want to impress - add it to your bucket list. You will not be sorry.
