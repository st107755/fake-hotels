Beautiful, quiet island and hotel. Away from the crowds of Venice but only 13 minutes by boat away.  The restaurants are wonderful, with amazing views. The bar & lounge areas very relaxing. The pool area perfect - much larger than most hotels, especially ‘city’ ones. The spa was nice. It was wonderful to walk around the gardens and to pop into the island church. Idyllic. Maybe a silly thing, but really enjoyed not having to take a lift/elevator to get to our room. Only 3 floors with a grand staircase in the middle so much better to walk! Friendly and helpful staff.
