San Clemente Palace Kempinski is a solid, logical choice for those stylish, worldly travelers wishing to visit Venice and avoid the constant crowds. The novelty of staying on a private island in a palace is somewhat fun as well. We’re members of Leading Hotels of the World. With such a mix of differently owned hotels, sometimes hotels are a miss and sometimes they are fantastic. San Clemente Palace is fantastic and very impressive, and I can highly recommend it.  The public areas are grand, luxurious and spotless. The hallways on each floor have got to be thirty feet wide! Just walking up the grand staircase, past the massive Murano chandelier to our room was a treat each time and never got old. Be sure to take some time and explore the hotel, there is so much to see both inside…
