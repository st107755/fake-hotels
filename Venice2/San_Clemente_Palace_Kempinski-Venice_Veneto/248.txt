lovely hotel in a beautiful spot, nice to have peace and quiet away from the crowds , set in beautiful grounds  but..  the hotel falls short on the small things...  1. drinks service around the pool is so poor or non existent and sunbed’s sit on muddy ground  2. non replenishment of bathroom goods inc toilet rolls was so annoying, having to use tissues from the bedroom was really not good!!   3. minibar never restocked  4. water not being left at nights, having to call to room service every night becomes galling  the complimentary boat service was excellent, ran on time and friendly captains  the restaurants were excellent with very good service and superb food  rooms are very nice , beds comfy and service around the hotel inc concierge was very good but these little things…
