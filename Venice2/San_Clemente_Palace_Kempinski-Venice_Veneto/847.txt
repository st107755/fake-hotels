The St.Regis Venice San Clemente Palace hotel is a spectacular building! It is gorgeous inside and out. We chose this when visiting Venice as we wanted somewhere that would be a sanctuary away for the hustle and bustle of Venice. It was an excellent choice, given that the hotel has its own Island, so it has good outdoor space, gardens and a lovely pool and pool restaurant. It is a very large hotel- easy to get lost in the first few days. But the accommodation and facilities are excellent.   What let the hotel down was the atrocious service in the restaurants. Elsewhere the service was good – front of house, concierge, the bar, the boat service, etc. all good. However anything to do with food was shocking! Service was super slow, lacking in care and attention. For breakfast there…
