Excellent experience for three nights!  Great accommodations in the junior suite which was large, spacious, well appointed, large bathroom, sitting area and king size bed overlooking a courtyard/garden.  Wonderful, helpful staff, great breakfast buffet - very high end, elegant!  The entire hotel experience was elegant. Very nice pool, pool restaurant/bar, gorgeous grounds, landscaping with a historical flair.  Highly recommend this property.  Water taxi service to San Marco was efficient and timely.  Helpful Concierge for things to see and do plus restaurant recommendations off property.
