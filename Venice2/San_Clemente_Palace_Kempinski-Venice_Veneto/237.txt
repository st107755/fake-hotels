We have been there in June 2016 and it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. Extra large rooms , lovely building and very attractive site . Previous name is Saint Regis San Clemente and it has been changed to Kempinski. Forget the name and enjoy the palace ! they have shuttle from hotel to San Marco every 30 Mins. and it is one of enjoyable part of your stay ! Breakfast yard is awesome and fantastic , they serve everything to enjoy :D
