loved this place and the staff at reception and kids club were very helpful and friendly..my daughter enjoyed the pool and kids club so much despite the intermittent rain...some service improvement is needed for the breakfast as well from the pool staff but that doesn't spoil a great experience and help from concierge ( excellent restaurant recommendations), kids club  and reception...
