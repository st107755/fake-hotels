I stayed here for 4 days in July 2017. I would definitely return here. The quality of service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly. The shuttle services to the main island were always on time and very pleasant, offering complimentary water on board each journey. The only downside to our stay was that there were no tea making facilities in the room. Besides this, our holiday was perfect!
