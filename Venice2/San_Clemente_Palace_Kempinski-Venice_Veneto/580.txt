We have been staying in the wonderful San Clemente Palace for 3 nights prior to our forthcoming cruise.   We had originally booked another 5 star hotel and then found this hotel and decided to change our booking - so delighted that we did!  The service at this hotel is superb, the room excellent and we have so enjoyed our stay.  The concierge arranged our private taxi from the airport which all worked like clockwork.  Arriving at the San Clemente is a fantastic feeling and we were quickly unpacking in our lagoon view room.  Highly recommended!
