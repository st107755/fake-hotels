I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  The hotel itself if so beautiful. I felt like we were staying in a historic mansion. The rooms are beautifully appointed (tho a bit small compared to US rooms). Staff was super friendly and always helpful in providing tips on where to go. Decorations and furniture in public spaces was luxurious. It was like a museum. The water shuttle back and forth was easy to use and the boat was actually very cool. Breakfast was incredible. I don't know what they do with their coffee but I drank so much I was on a caffeine high for the whole week. This is the only place I would stay in Venice and the only place I'd recommend to friends & family. You won't be disappointed.
