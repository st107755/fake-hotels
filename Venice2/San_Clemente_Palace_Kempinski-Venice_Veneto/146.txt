Myself and my partner visited this beautiful hotel in April for our anniversary.   The grounds were spotless and there was so much to be explored, from the hotels church ruins to the sporting facilities and spa.  If it is your first time in Venice and you want to spend every second exploring then this hotel may not be for you. Although accessible from / to St Marks Square you spend your day looking at the timetable to ensure you make the next boat otherwise it becomes tedious waiting. Although if you are celebrating or wanting more of a relaxed trip, this hotel couldn’t be more perfect.  The boats run consistently every 30 minutes or so throughout the day from 9am until around 0030. Not so good if you have a flight departing before 12pm as you will have to splash out €175 Euro…
