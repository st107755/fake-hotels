I just got married here!!!! It was truly breath taking and a dream come true. The staff was amazing, incredibly helpful and attentive. I especially want to thank the site coordinator, Lucia Giugliano and event director, Sergio Bruno. They made our destination wedding everything we envisioned. Communicating our vision all the way from California was not easy, so again thank you so very much to San Clemente Palace Kempinski for your patience, professionalism, accommodations, and  everything!!! I highly recommend this hotel for your stay. It is truly a story book location and stay. Andrew and I will forever hold this place in our hearts, and will continue to visit.
