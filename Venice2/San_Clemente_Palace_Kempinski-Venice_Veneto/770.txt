Ä±f you want to relax by the swimming pool and enjoy your drink with a beautiful view of the city, or have your coctail looking to the sunset and also have the sense of the mediieval times around that city, you should spend a couple of days of your your visit to Venice at st Regis, San Clemente Palace... The island is isolated from the crowd but still close to  the venues around. This place is definitely amazing for special events and celebrations.
