It's not often I can wholeheartedly recommend a luxury hotel for both quality and value but the San Clemente Palace gets top billing on all counts and more. Location is obviously amazing with a frequent private boat shuttle to and from the sights (and crowds) of Venice. The building is on a grand scale which extends even to the most basic rooms which have high ceilings, king-sized double beds and well appointed bathrooms. Customer service is attentive but not too stuffy with nothing too much trouble including late checkout and boat taxi to the airport. Restaurants - we ate in the bar and by the pool - were tasty and reasonable value, and the entire experience was wonderfully relaxing.  Drinks (especially wine) are expensive by uk standards but otherwise I'd highly recommendâ€¦
