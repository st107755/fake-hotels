Wow! What a beautiful hotel, brilliant service and memorable trip. The staff here truly go above and beyond for their guests - they were just perfect.  The staff really made our holiday even better than we could have hoped for. Firstly on arrival they welcomed us so warmly, and surprised us with a free upgrade from the standard room to a deluxe room with a beautiful view of the sea. We arrived at 12pm , when check in was at 3 they took us straight to our rooms too! What an incredible start.   The rooms were outstanding, very clean and the attention to detail was great, every day was as good as the last when we came back to our room in the evenings.  The restaurant, bar and pool service was fabulous, the staff again were always very helpful and very knowledgable about the foodâ€¦
