We loved our stay at San Clemente - we had a room upgrade on arrival which is always welcome. We were there on honeymoon and it felt very special - not somewhere we could afford regularly but as a special treat it was worth every penny.   The staff were amazing, so friendly yet discrete. We enjoyed making our way through the extensive cocktail menu.  Food, drinks, surroundings and staff were all fabulous.
