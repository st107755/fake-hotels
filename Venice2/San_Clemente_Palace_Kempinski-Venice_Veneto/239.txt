My partner and I have just got back from this splendid hotel. We loved the fact that we could escape the throngs of Venice to a place of tranquility and calm.   The rooms are beautiful, the pool fabulous, lounges and outside terraces lovely. It really is a gorgeous setting.   The points that lets this hotel down is the lack of efficient service. Breakfast felt chaotic. Different waiters seem to take different orders - and none seem to know what the others are doing. For example/ We ordered an omelette one morning and never got it. After waiting 40 mins and asking three waiters we left. Another morning our coffee took half an hour to arrive. Another morning we went to get some hot food from the buffet after eating our cereal to come back to our table a few mins later to find itâ€¦
