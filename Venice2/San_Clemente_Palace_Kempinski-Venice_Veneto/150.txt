We spent several days at this beautiful resort hotel. Situated on a beautiful garden island, we were well served by the staff in these luxury accommodations with frequent water taxi shuttle service to St. Marks Square, But, the highlight of our visit were several late night visits to the Clemente Bar, a classic, salon bar with attentive, efficient waiters. Waiter, Costi, a particularly talented young man, performed, baffling and sometimes jaw-dropping, card, slight of hand, and cell phone tricks to our delight and our friends. We kept going back for more. If you are there-seek him out, You wonâ€™t be disappointed.
