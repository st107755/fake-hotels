The Hotel:  Grand appearance matched by the excellent service throughout our stay, the staff did everything possible to make our stay a memorable one and fully succeeded. One of the most beautiful hotels you'll ever find with views of Venice from across the Lagoon.   Tip: Ask for a Lagoon view room.   Staff: They seem to hire extremely well, genuinely helpful staff at all times, Antonio the concierge was first class, as was Giorgio the reception desk supervisor and ALL the ladies at reception. We didn't have breakfast included but they kindly upgraded us free of charge, no fuss.   Helpful Tip: They provide a complimentary boat shuttle between the hotel and St Mark's Square every 30mins, it takes 10mins each way. Where you jump off the boat across the river there's a sister hotelâ€¦
