Great resort to stay and relax and at the same time close enough to explore Venice. Hotel has a private boat that transports you to Venice complimentary and it takes about 10-15 min. The staff is very helpful and give you top notch service. Will definitely stay here on my next trip to Venice.  Thank you St. Regis.
