Beautiful hotel a short water taxi away from the hustle and bustle of central Venice. Very luxurious surroundings and wonderful pool area. Only thing I was disappointed with was the fact that hotel does not supply tea/coffee facilities within the room which means room service every time you want a cuppa which runs expensive. Apart from that a fabulous hotel which helped make our holiday perfect.
