Beautiful location with reliable transport every half hour to and from St Marks Sq. Pool lovely and quiet allowing relaxing contrast with bustling centre of Venice. I had a couple of problems at the hotel and the management dealt with it swiftly and fairly. I would thoroughly recommend it. Decor modern but in keeping with Venice style.
