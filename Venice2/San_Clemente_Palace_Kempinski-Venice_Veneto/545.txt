Venice is beautiful city, but the hustle and traffic can wear you down very quickly. This hotel is perfectly situated close yet far enough to enjoy a peaceful sanctuary. Staff is wonderful and the privacy tours they offer directly from the hotel are truly worth it.   The oven brick pizza by poolside is outstanding as well. Our family, with kids at 4 and 7 ages, couldn't have been happier.   Highly recommend it. This  was our second visit and will be surely back for a third in the future.
