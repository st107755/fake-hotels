Nothing to fault. Perfection. Perfect sanctuary after busy day in Venice. The most relaxing retreat I have ever stayed in. The food is wonderful. Staff friendly. The grounds are kept to such a high standard. 10 minutes boat ride into st marks square which leave every 20 minutes. The only fault is I don't want to leave here. !!
