We have just returned from the most wonderful holiday. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The setting is perfect and the service impeccable.It is such a luxury to go into the bustle of the city and then escape back to the calm elegance of the hotel. The children loved the pool.We will be back.Thank you.
