We enjoyed the great venue of the San Clemente Island, calm and quite with an excellent service, but still very well connected to the Center of busy Venice by the complementary shuttle service. A special experience was the dinner at the Aquarello Restaurant that exceeded all our expectations, and was the best of all our 3 dinners in top end Venice restaurants
