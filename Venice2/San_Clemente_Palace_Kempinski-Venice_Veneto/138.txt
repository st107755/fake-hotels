Fantastic hotel away from the hectic bustle - an ideal haven after a day of exploring the city. Whilst the surroundings are beautiful and the beds extremely comfortable, it is the service that sets the hotel apart. Every member of staff goes beyond their way to ensure an enjoyable stay though we must thank Giovanni (who pilots one of the regular boat transfers) in particular for making our stay memorable.
