Wow a hotel on a private island! Whilst some of the rooms may have been quite a walk from reception they were very spacious and extremely comfortable!  The buffet breakfast is to die for,  An AMAZING array of everything you could possibly think of and a gorgeous outdoor in which  to wat it!  Highly recommended
