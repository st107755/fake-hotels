This is the third review of our July 2019 family trip. My wife and two children (11 and 13) traveled and stayed as follows:  Rome --> Hotel Santa Maria Florence --> Hotel Davanzati Venice --> San Clemente Palace Kempinski Athens --> AVA Hotel Athens Rome --> Singer Palace Hotel  This is a very fancy resort hotel, which we were able to stay at for quite reasonable prices: less than $500/night per room through American Express (we got two adjoining rooms with me and my wife in one and our kids in the other). There is a lot to recommend here: the breakfast is OUTSTANDING, the resort property and the rooms are spacious and lovely and comfortable, the pool and outdoor amenities are great, and the service is excellent. We had a very good time and for the money I wholeheartedlyâ€¦
