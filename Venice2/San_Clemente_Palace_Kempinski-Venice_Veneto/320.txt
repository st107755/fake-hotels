If we ever get to go back to Venice, we will most definitely want to stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski! Everything about it was memorable, even though when we stayed they had an unseasonable warm spell in April, and they hadn't turned on the air conditioner. Set on a beautiful island only minutes from the Basilica and Center of Venice, it is a place to relax and refresh after experiencing the wonders of Venice.  The complimentary boat ride on a wonderful wooden boat to go to and from the Square was something we'll always remember. I hope we can spend more time there next time!
