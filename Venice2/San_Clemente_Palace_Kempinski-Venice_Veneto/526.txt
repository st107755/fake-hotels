We visited on our honeymoon and again last year for our anniversary and the place is impeccable.  A lovely greeting and felt like royalty. We have loved it so much we are renewing our wedding vows here this July. We cannot wait. It's out to the way to be exclusive and private and a quick courtesy boat away from St Marks Square.
