San Clemente Palace is a great island resort 15 minutes from San Marco.  You stay here to beat the crowded and heat during the Venetian summer.  It's rooms and grounds are magnificent.  The money used for it's renovation (during st regis time?) was very well spent. The scale of the building hallways, stairs, ceilings,etc.. is wonderful and all extremely modern.  I can't find any fault with the rooms.  The breakfast courtyard and room were beautiful and food/service top notch. The pool and restaurant there provided fantastic food (best pizza on trip which is saying something) and drinks.   The overall hotel service (Claudia "in red", front desk, dock valet's, pool attendants) all went out of their way to help.  Housekeeping was a bit off (language issue?) but again service makesâ€¦
