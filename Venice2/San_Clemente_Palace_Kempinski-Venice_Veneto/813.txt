The hotel has a huge possibility to be one of the best hotels in Venice the property is amazing but unfortunately it just opens and is a new hotel so the service is not good the decoration needs to be well done so I can feel more cozy and the rooms are not all refreshed I had to change rooms a few times to find the refurnished room it was really nice and the swimming pool service it's terrible and the spa is not open yet
