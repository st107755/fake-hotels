This hotel was amazing and we loved our time here, just gutted we were only here for 2 days. The hotel is on its own private island which is about 10 minutes from Venice itself but there is a free water taxi which takes you to and from. The last one is at 00:40. There is a nice pool and outdoor bars for when it’s summer. We had a few drinks in the bar indoors which is beautiful decorated. The hotel seems enormous and we enjoyed walking about the huge corridors. Breakfast is fantastic with little novelties such as fresh butter sweet and salted. The staff were all fantastic can’t mention just one as they were all truly great. Lots of spaces to have a drink outside and enjoy the views.
