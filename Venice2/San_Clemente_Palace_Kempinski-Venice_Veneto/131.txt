Well what a place we were on a company trip and nothing for the hotel was too much trouble. Special mention to the amazing bar man magician what a legend and blew all our minds with his card tricks. The hotel is very high end with fantastic service in our opinion, its more an adult style hotel but has a paddeling area for small children near the pool. Would certainly come again.
