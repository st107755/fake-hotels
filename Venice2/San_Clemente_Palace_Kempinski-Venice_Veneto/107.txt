As soon as we first arrived at the San Clemente Hotel we knew we had made the right choice. Set on an island just a few minutes by complimentary boat from Venice, this hotel is quite unique. Beautiful gardens, a church, a magnificent swimming pool, tennis court and even a 3 hole golf course. The food at L'Acquerello restaurant is outstanding, as is the location at the water's edge. We would also recommend lunch at La Dolce Restaurant by the swimming pool. There are well stocked bars and even a choice of local draft beers. The service is 1st class and all the staff are so friendly. We have stayed at the San Clemente Palace on 3 occasions and our rooms have all been excellent with high ceilings, good air conditioning and fantastic views of the lagoon and gardens. It really doesn'tâ€¦
