We stayed here as a family of four for three nights and this hotel was the highlight of our trip.  Venice is picturesque as it is and this hotel is the icing on a yummy cake.  The hotel is secluded on a private island with great complimentary shuttle access provided by the hotel. This is a huge bonus as it allows an escape from the hustle and bustle of Venice.  Service is at its highest standards but the best part is the property. The pool is gorgeous and the restaurant by the church has delicious offerings.  The breakfast and the bars are above par for service and offerings.  I have stayed at a few St Regis properties and so far this is the best one.
