We stayed at the St Regis Venice San Clemente Palace for 3 nights, and wish we had planned for more time there.  It is a beautiful property - unbelievable setting, large, well-appointed rooms, great staff and wonderful food.  It was blistering hot in Venice, but when we stepped off of the transfer boat onto the property, it felt so good - expansive green lawn, trees, large swimming pool - it FELT cooler (even if it wasn't!!).  This was our third trip to Venice and thought it would be our last - but I cant wait to go back to the St Regis.
