Excellent hotel , with its location ,services , staff and all over . Breakfast is full of varieties, excellent taste, rooms are very comfortable blended by a fresh fragrance from Italy with the morning shower. Concierge is well knowledgeable and well connected. F&B in general is one of the best experience you can have in Italy.
