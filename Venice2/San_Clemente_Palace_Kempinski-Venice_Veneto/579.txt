If you know Venice already and you don't care maximizing the time spent between Piazza San Marco and the Rialto, then the San Clemente is a very good alternative.  It is located one of the laguna islands, 10-15 mins away from the motoscafi station in San Marco. It retains its charm (without being the Gritti!) but has bee fully refurbished and offers all modern amenities. The hotel is huge and during one of my two stays there, my room was literally 10 mins walk away from the Venice-facing bar and terrace.  The grounds surrounding the hotel are beautiful and the pool a heaven of calm.  I wouldn't recommend it for first-time visitors to Venice unless they are allergic to the tourist crowds and want to spend a large part of their time relaxing and indulging
