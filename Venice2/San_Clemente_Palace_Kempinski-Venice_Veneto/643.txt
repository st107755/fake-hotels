experience the fascination of Venice from a quiet island with 5 star quality and service and an unforgettable vacation. we spent a lovely family weekend enjoyed the fabulous outside pool, the bar was set up for the European football finals with great success. A frequent boat shuttle to San Marco Square makes it easy to hop into the crowds and retreat to peace whenever you want. A place well worth staying at and beats other top Venice hotels we have stayed at !!
