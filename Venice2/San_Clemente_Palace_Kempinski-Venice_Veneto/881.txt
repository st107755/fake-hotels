This hotel is a must  It's set on its own island 15mins complimentary boat taxi from Venice The staff are amazing I visited in April with my boyfriend for my birthday and we couldn't ask for a more beautiful place to relax from the hustle and bustle of Venice  Everything about this hotel is perfect,clean and comfortable and a great location the staff couldn't do enough for you I was even given a birthday cake compliments of the hotel  Hoping to go back next year ❤️
