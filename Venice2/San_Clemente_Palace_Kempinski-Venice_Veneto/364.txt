My husband and I stayed at San Clemente during last four days of September . At the arrival we have been upgraded free of charge to a better room which was a very nice welcome . The room was on the ground floor , very spacious and comfortable especially beds.  The hotel is a nice retreat  from overcrowded Venice center. The only ( little ) minus was the lack of possibility of warming up the room . There was an automatic heating controlled by the central system in the bathroom between 7pm and 10 pm but for some reason it was switched off one evening and it was too cold for me. I reported it to the reception and for the next night it was ok. May be on the first floor it was warmer the whole time.
