The property itself is fantastic and we enjoyed the room, hotel building and the grounds including the old church. Check-in was too slow. The water front restaurant staff were least interested when enquired about dining options (they almost looked offended as if we are not fit for their fine dining). Cold staff in general. Even the guests didn't look like they are enjoying themselves. There was one redeeming incident - two young ladies managing the kids club - they were phenomenal with our kids.
