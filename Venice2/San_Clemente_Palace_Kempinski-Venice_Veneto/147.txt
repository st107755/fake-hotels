The most beautiful, grand and ancient building, impeccably restored and situated on an island a ten minute boat journey from San Marco. The 1950â€™s free teak cruiser to and from the hotel every 20 mins is both stunning and exhilarating. Glamorous, lush and well appointed rooms. Incredible reception from staff, and friendliness of the Ladies in Red.
