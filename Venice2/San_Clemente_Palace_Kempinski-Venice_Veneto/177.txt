A fantastic property with swimming pool, tennis court, great fitness center.  The staff is exemplary.  The property is extraordinary.  The food and service excellent.  You are living in a palace that was converted into a hotel.  The property is a small island completely owned by the hotel.  It even has a 1000 year old church.  The ceilings are remarkable high; extra exercise just wandering the halls.
