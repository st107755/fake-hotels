We stayed here for my mums 60th birthday and the hotel was lovely, in the most stunning location too! The staff were excellent and even made her a happy birthday cake for breakfast one day! Good choice at breakfast and the pool restaurant is great if you want pizza/pasta instead of fine dining. Complimentary water taxis to Venice too are great and luxury. Will definitely try and go back!
