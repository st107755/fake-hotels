Disfruiting the  best WIFI High speed Internet and excellent Service. I enjoyed 5 days   of  " home office" on this magnificent Island  San Clemente working at the pool and in the sunset bar. We enjoyed delicious pasta and Cabernet  vine at the Aquarello. restaurant.  It was easy to go  San Marco for sightseeing and shopping  by the private Hotel boat. (goes every 30 min to and from  San Marco)  The staff is very friendly and attentive. I am looking forward to the opening of the new Spa and definitely come back to have another delicious San Clemente cocktail .Perfect for romance and Business and for kids.
