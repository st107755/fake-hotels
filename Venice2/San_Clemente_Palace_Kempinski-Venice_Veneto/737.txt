If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Venice then this is the hotel for you - situated on its own private island yet still with easy reach via the half hourly water taxi transfers provided by the hotel. We enjoyed a two night break using this hotel as our base. Large and comfortable rooms, swimming pool and tennis court!
