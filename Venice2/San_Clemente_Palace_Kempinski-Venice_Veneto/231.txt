The grounds are secluded and beautiful and the suite they upgraded us to was very nice. The breakfast buffet was among the best I've ever seen in all of my travels. The main restaurant overlooking the water was incredible and the service was sublime. We loved the pool but the service was slow and inattentive. And that was our main issue- lack of prompt service. We had called for an iron and ironing board and after an hour of no one showing up at our room we called back to the front desk to discover they had forgotten about us. And while having breakfast I asked our server, who was arguing with another employee, for a spoon and she told me to hold on. She was three feet away from me. And then she forgot to bring us our spoon.
