We recently returned from our third stay at the San Clemente.  After we booked, we found out that the hotel had changed hands and become part of the St Regis group.  Any concerns that we had about it not being the same were washed away from the moment we arrived.  All the staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble.  Previously they could be a little surly at times.  We had a lagoon view room that overlooked the water and the gardens and it was fantastic.  If we return to Venice, we will undoubtedly go back to the San Clemente and cannot recommend it highly enough.
