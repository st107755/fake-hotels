I just came back from a long weekend away with my parents and boyfriend. We had a lovely relaxing time. The hotel is situated on its own island about 10 minutes boat ride from Venice centre. When we arrived we were greated straight away by the friendly and welcoming hotel staff. The photos grounds are beautiful and there is a lovely pool area. The only downside of the hotel is that the pool temperature is a bit cold and heating it a bit more would make the hotel faultless.
