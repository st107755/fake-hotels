Exquisite setting , impeccable hospitality , and romantic experience .  The staff were top notch to insure our stay was comfortable and pleasurable. It is a definite place we will go back to. Loved the private island experience. You are just a 10 minute water taxi away from the city. Yet, when you get back you are in an escape to paradise. Sunsets are magnificent on this island resort!!
