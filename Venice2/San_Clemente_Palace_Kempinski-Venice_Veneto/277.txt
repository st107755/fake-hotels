We just loved this place❣️ The staff is so friendly and helpful and they really make you feel like royalty. The outside pool area is spacious and it like the whole island/hotel is very clean, everything just looks beautiful. 🌸 The breakfast is fantastic and the two restaurants serve great food. The Acquerello is just perfect for romantic dinner.❤️🥂 Must say that the head butler and sommelier Elio is absolutely a gem!!Grazie mille San Clemente!!! We recommend this very highly!
