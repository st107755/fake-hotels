We just finished our family vacation in Venice. San Clemente was a great choice. The hotel is located on an island of its own, some 15 min boat trip away from Piazza San Marco. The island is a resort with hotel, restaurants and bars, pool area, walking paths, restaurants, golf chipping area, kids club, etc. The boat shuttle runs every 30min and offers a nice cool down after wandering around Venice all day. The hotel offers a great historic atmosphere. Hotel service was friendly and very nice to small children, though sometimes a bit slow in some of the restaurants. The hotel is very big with many long hallways. Rooms were elegantly luxurious. A room with a lagoon view offers nice sight towards San Marco.  San Clemente offers a great opportunity to enjoy the all the excitingâ€¦
