My daughter and I had a four day visit to Venice. She is a teenager with little interest in historic buildings. The mix of a beautiful venue, swimming pool and visits to Venice was perfect for us. I like luxury and would rather stay for a shorter time in an expensive venue. It was lovely to come back from Venice a couple of evenings to be greeted by the staff offering a glass of Prosecco which I drank sitting looking out over the lagoon towards a perfect sunset.  The staff were kind and friendly. I highly recommend the hotel.  We had not booked breakfast but ended up having breakfast at the hotel as it was lovely. it was very expensive but it worked fo us. Next time i would book breakfast in advance.
