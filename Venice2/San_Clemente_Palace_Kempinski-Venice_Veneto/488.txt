I was actually very irritated when I found out I had accidentally booked our vacation hotel on an island only accessibly by water taxi.  But once landed, my kids didn't even want to go visit Venice it was such an idyllic location.  Really beautiful, rooms huge cool and lovely.  However, they need to improve their dining service.  It is such a beautiful location, what a disappointment when the service is poor.  Also, in the AM, no cafe for "just a cappuccino" if you are not a breakfast eater.
