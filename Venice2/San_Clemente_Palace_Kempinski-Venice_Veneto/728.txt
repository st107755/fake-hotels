This is the most beautiful hotel in the world. It is on it's own private island, and the hotel and grounds are both just perfection. Our room was huge and beautiful, the service was just impeccable. The concierge team was perfect and gave us wonderful recommendations for restaurants, logistics, and planning our adventures in Venice. Free boat taxi service to Venice. The bartender in the St. Regis bar, Rafello, suggested wonderful drinks for us each night. Restaurants were great, couldn't ask for a better place to stay. Would give it 10 starts if I could.
