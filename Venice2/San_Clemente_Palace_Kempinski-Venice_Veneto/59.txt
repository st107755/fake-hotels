Excellent hotel, except for the pool site restaurant where is has many young waiters with no management. They run in circles with the natural outcome of a terrible experience. The concierge told us many times that the hotel would take us to Murano for a visit. He was lying. He had an agreement with Venier, the boat is from Venier and if you visit Venier, like we did, you will get rob. It is unacceptable that Kempinski allows this to happen. We raised our dissatisfaction with the Concierge when we came back and he acted stupid Apart from the above, breakfast are great, service during breakfast is great and service in general is great.
