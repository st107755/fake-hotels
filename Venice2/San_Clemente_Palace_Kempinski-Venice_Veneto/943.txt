St. Regis Hotel is as close to perfection as one might find. We have been there with the perfect weather and had best time of our vacation.The hotel service (whether it be in the hotel or the excellent restaurant), the atmosphere and the whole experience deserves five star. The building and gardens are stunning, and have been renovated perfectly. There is an outstanding pool area in the garden for the relaxation. The rooms are clean and spacious, and everything that are needed is provided. Breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel's restaurants are divine, and all the staff are friendly and polite. We will definitely go back again.
