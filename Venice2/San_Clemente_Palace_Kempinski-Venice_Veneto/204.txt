Fabulous stay at the San Clemente Kempinski Hotel. The location is a 15 minute water taxi ride from San Marco Square in Venice. The rooms are large and well appointed. Make-up mirrors and hair dryers cap the beauty of the marble bathrooms. Large closets and luxurious linens are featured as well. The breakfast buffet is extensive and amazingly delicious. The Dolce restaurant near the pool offers both indoor and patio dining. The food at Dolce is wonderful. Their focaccia bread is the ultimate treat! The pizza is incredible, wood burning oven on site helps make delicious meats as well as pizza. Gourmet pasta dishes were wonderful as well. Our only complaint is the beds could be a bit softer, they really were like brick. That is just a personal choice though. Will be back as soonâ€¦
