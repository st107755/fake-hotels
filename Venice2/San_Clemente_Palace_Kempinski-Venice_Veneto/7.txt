A magnificent and luxurious destination on a private island just 15 minutes away from San Marco. A beautiful view from the rooms that will leave you speechless. High-quality food cooked in delicious dishes. A perfect ferry service going from place St.Marc to the hotel every 30 min. The concierge gave us precious restaurant recommendations and organized us a wonderful day-trip to Murano. The garden was well-maintained and profoundly relaxing. Covid  measures were well-respected, maybe excessively: no fitness center available only a small disposition of weights in the garden, the swimming pool was also closed and once we had to wait for the next ferry in order the respect the right amount of passengers on board. As a conclusion, an incredible stay in a first-class palace.
