A romantic and much needed break in Venice for 3 nights. We were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped onto the island from our airport taxi launch. Welcomed by smiling and very professional staff at reception.   Taken to our beautiful suite which included a huge and very comfy bed, a walk in wardrobe, extra large bathroom with walk in shower. Fabulous and relaxing bar hosted by 2 staff who worked so hard to please a busy room....but excelled in their service and maintained a smiling and courteous manner. The grounds are extensive and beautifully maintained. In the summer months the outdoor pool, bar and restaurant must be a dream to enjoy. Every half hour a fab launch takes you to the city....and to a prime position close to St Marks square. It was our anniversaryâ€¦
