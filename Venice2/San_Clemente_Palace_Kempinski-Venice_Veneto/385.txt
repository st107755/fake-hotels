My wife and I spent a magical five nights here on the occasion of our fifth anniversary. Fabulous rooms and service. Expensive for someone suffering the European backlash to Brexit and the diminishing pound but worth every Euro.   We will be back, we will take the boat transfers to and from the airport again, and we will relish the peace and quiet the island affords
