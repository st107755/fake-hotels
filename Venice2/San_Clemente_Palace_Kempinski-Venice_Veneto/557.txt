Beatiful hotel on the private island with a very well organized transport to the city center. Attention - they block your money in your account from the reservation even though you paid. So actually you are paying twice and you don't know when you return when and if the money unblocked.  The air conditioning is not working,in the room are remnants after past guests. The child has not the towel, apparently she has to dry itself. The reception staff is rude and unhelpful.  The wine and food in hotel is average, but the prices of luxury Overall disappointment
