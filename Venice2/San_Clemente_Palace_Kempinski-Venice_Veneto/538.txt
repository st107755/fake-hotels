The hotel is situated on its own little island and more importantly away from the crowds. The hotel provide a boatshuttle service as and when required. The bedrooms were spacious, clean and decorated laviously. Great bar with a wide range of drinks and cocktails.  Breakfast was really good and although we didn't stay for diner the food looked lovely.  The staff were all very polite and we were certainly looked after. A return visit will be booked!
