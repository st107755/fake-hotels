It is nice to have a quiet moment in this beautiful property. I had high expectations. We had a lagoon view room; the view was indeed fabulous but the room on the small side. Particularly the bathroom was small and did not feel luxurious enough compared with other St. Regis or Four Seasons. Too simple and plain, no place to hang wet hand towels. The room needed better lights as it was too dark to read or check maps. I would not go back if I ever go back to Venice. I would definitely choose the Gritti Palace.
