The only problem with this hotel is that it is SO spectacular you will not want to go explore Venice.  This resort could be a destination all by itself and I would be happy here for weeks.  A truly 5 star, unbelievable experience with 5 star staff, 5 star dining, and 5 star rooms.  The Medici family themselves would be very happy here.
