Most elegant and peaceful hotel I have ever been. Absolutely everything about this hotel is really beautiful - the rooms, hallway/corridors, the restaurant, their own church, the bar, the swimmimg pool area, the big amazing garden etc. All the decorations were also very tasteful and elegant. The hotel's boat transfeer was very comfortable. And ofcourse all the personnel were very helpful and very professional. Really high-class place. This was my second visit to this hotel and definately not the last.
