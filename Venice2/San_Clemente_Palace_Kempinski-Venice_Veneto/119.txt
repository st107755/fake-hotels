This hotel offers everything you could want out of the most romantic city in the world. With the water taxi shuttle running every half an hour straight to St Marks you can dip in and out of the tourist mayhem as often or as little as you please. The hotel has a great selection of food and beverage outlets, sensational sunset views for Aperitifs, relax by the pool, plat tennis, stroll through the grounds or head to the spa for some real R&R. Our children (9 & 5) Loved the kids club and the babysitters arranged by the hotel. The hotel really caters for all generations and is a true private sanctuary.
