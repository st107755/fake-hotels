I stayed here while attending the Venice Film Festival. I cannot day enough wonderful things about The hotel. The service was impeccable! The rooms for a European hotel were generous. They were decorated very elegant. The restaurants all had delicious fabulous food! The boat service to the other parts of Venice were prompt, comfortable and may I say drivers were handsome .  I felt very comfortable and welcomed ! I want to go back already after just leaving a week ago.
