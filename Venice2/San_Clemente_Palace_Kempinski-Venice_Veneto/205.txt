We arrived in the early evening by water taxi which was a great start to the holiday.  The concierge met us from the water taxi and showed us to the reception.  All staff were both friendly & helpful throughout our stay.  We had a pizza at the Dolce bar which was pricey but a pleasant atmosphere.  Breakfast had an excellent choice of food, relaxed atmosphere and very attentive staff.  We had a superior room which was large, airy & comfortable.  If I wanted to "picky" we missed the lack of tea, coffee facilities!  It was nice to be away from the busyness of Venice for just a few hours.  Fantastic views and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.
