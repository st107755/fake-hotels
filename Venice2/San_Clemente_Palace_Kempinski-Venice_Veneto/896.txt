An amazing retreat away from the hordes of Venice. A perfect base to explore and  then find sanctuary and serious luxury. The grounds and pool were exquisite. The rooms deeply comfortable , ours had a memorable view back to St Marks, marred only by the odd cruise ship. The launch service was perfect and all the staff brilliant. The Cipriani looked a bit cramped as we swept by!
