We have been lucky enough to stay in many fine hotels. But what makes greatness??  Location - yes. Buildings - yes. Grounds - yes. Facilities- yes but what makes this truly wonderful is the exceptional level of service. We were only there for 2 days (we'll be back!!) but the service was superb - anticipating needs and listening to wants and suggesting innovative solutions and ideas. Made for a wonderful short stay and has made us keen to stay at all the other Kempinki htels
