The location is great, a 10 - 15 minute comfortable boat ride from the maddening crowds to fantasy island.  Greeted at the dock by staff upon arrival and it continued to impress us afterwards.  The grounds were remarkable, remote, we like to run in the morning, something we would not be able to do in town.  The staff was attentive and very accommodating.  The bar staff (Ivan and Alosando) were fantastic!   First time at a St. Regis property so our expectations were certainly met and exceeded.  We will return.
