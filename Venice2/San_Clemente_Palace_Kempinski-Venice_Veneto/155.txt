Last time we were in Venice we stayed in town, but the prices at the Danieli et al were just too insane for me to tolerate so we decided to give this hotel a shot. I was worried about the inconvenience of being on an island outside of Venice, but it turned out to be the best possible choice. Boat shuttles run two or three times an hour, and after the crowds of Venice, the gorgeous sanctuary was a pleasure. The rooms are a wee bit dated but perfectly lovely for the price. Other than that, the pool is magnificent, the green spaces glorious, and relaxing at the dockside bar was magical. Breakfast was fantastic and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely come back.
