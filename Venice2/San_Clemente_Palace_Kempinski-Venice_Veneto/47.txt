We travelled here for our 20th wedding anniversary as Venice has always been on our ‘must see’ list.  I was slightly concerned that it wouldn’t live up to the image I had built in my mind, however i needn’t have worried!! The hotel is our new favourite place in the world!! We absolutely loved every second we were there, from the welcome at check-in to the champagne and truffles in our room, to watching the amazing sunset by the water, the hotel is just magical.  The boat to St Marks Square is fantastic, you can be in the hustle and bustle of Venice one minute and in the peace and quiet of the hotel the next.  It truly felt like a piece of paradise on its own island, we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and we will definitely be back!
