We stayed here for 2 nights before we joined our cruise. Which also coincided with our 1 year anniversary. From the moment we  got there till we left we were in heaven. They had put champagne & chocolates in our room. It was so lovely to see that. We then took the free boat to Venice it self, beautiful city but so busy. Was lovely to come back to the hotel to get away from all the crowds  Lovely hotel. Would stay again
