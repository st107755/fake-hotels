This hotel is the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in my entire life!!! This hotel blew my mind! The best food/service/bed ever. The only thing we didn't have from the room was a view, but when you walk out of your door, the hotel is on it's own island, one of the outdoor seating areas is AMAZING!!! Their was a wedding here and it made me want to have future wedding here! It's breathtaking!!!
