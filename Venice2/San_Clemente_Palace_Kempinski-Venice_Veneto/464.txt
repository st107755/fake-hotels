Truly beautiful place and perfect location for visiting Venice especially during summer months with the best pool in the area . The food and selection must be improved even though most of us seem to put up with it because the ambience and surroundings are so perfect Complimentary water around the pool is a must or at least a cooler  Will come back soon and would not stay anywhere else Service impeccable
