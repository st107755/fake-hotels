My Wife and i came to this hotel for the first time and were both amazed by the resort. The private island is a welcomed retreat from the hustle and bustle you experience in Venice. The accommodations are truly exceptional, the art and views are all breathtaking.   The staff are all extremely friendly with the drinks service excellent. When we were looking for info or help the Concierge was really helpful too. We were welcomed with a complimentary bottle of champagne and strawberry's as they were aware we were newlyweds. Soft Drinks in the mini bar are initially complimentary which is a nice small treat.   Constructive feedback i would give is try and handle the basic requests quicker without the need for follow up. We requested an ironing board on our second day. We left a noteâ€¦
