What a superb to stay for a great relaxing holiday and yet so close to the hustle and bustle of Venice. Everyone in the hotel is so so friendly and went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible. The view of the lagoon, the grounds and gardens are magnificent. So easy to get to the St Marks Square via the private taxi and if you want to to to Murano. just speak to the concierge, they'll arrange a private taxi for you courtesy of the hotel.
