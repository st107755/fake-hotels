Magnificent hotel on its own private island.Service from start to finish was exemplary.Lovely room with comfy bed,good breakfast Although food and drink prices are high,for once in my life I didn’t begrudge paying it ( much). Will definitely return to this very special hotel....even if it’s just to see Michaels outstanding moustache again.
