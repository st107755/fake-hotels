This is a great property which is also being run very expertly as the service is also great. The San Clemente island provides a tranquil escape from the busy and tourist filled streets of Venice but it is only minutes away. So you can enjoy as much of Venice as you wish but also have this haven when you need peace and quiet. The restaurants are also great.
