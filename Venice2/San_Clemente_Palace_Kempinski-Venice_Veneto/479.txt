This place is incredible! So beautiful and the staff are so accommodating! Always asking if you're ok and saying hello. The room is lovely with great thick curtains so the room wasn't light in the morning. The only reason it didn't receive 5 stars was the food. Breakfast was a bit poor, bread was hard and poor choice of pastrys. Food on site is crazy expensive and not great if you're a vegetarian! The pizzas by the pool are amazing, but that is the only place you can get a vegetarian meal - the actual restaurant offered none which was a shame and as the hotel is on a island it was a faff to leave the island for a meal. Overall good hotel but probably wouldn't go back
