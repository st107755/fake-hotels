One week stat in October. Superb relaxing island setting away from the Venice crowds. Exceptional/friendly staff. Excellent food, though breakfast very pricey. Shuttle to/from St Marks Square very efficient (every 30 minutes from 09:00 to gone midnight). View from room across the lagoon to Venice more than offset the somewhat small room size. Already planning our next visit.
