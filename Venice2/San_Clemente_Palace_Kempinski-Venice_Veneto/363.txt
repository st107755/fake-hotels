Great hotel to stay in to escape the crowds. Regular courtesy water-taxis. Staff were very helpful. Because this is an old building they can only provided heating or air-con and not both. They did provide us with a fan.   Pool and restaurants were all excellent with comfortable sun beds.   Would suggest that complementary bottled water is provided in the bedrooms and that there is a happy hour in the bar between 5pm and 7pm with a 50% discount on a couple of cocktails. Bar staff were good but not very engaging with clients and kept disappearing.  This hotel could benefit from an executive lounge with complimentary drinks and chicetti for an hour or two each evening. Also maybe include a glass of Prosecco on the water taxi from the airport. It’s the small touches that really do…
