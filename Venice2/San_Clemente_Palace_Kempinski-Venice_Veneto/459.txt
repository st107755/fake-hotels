We cannot speak too highly of the San Clemente Palace a truly wonderful place to stay and experience Venice. The friendliness and attentiveness of the staff made all the difference. It was exceptional and this was demonstrated all down the line.  We felt very special and facilities wonderful as was the daily ride into Venice. I hope to return one day in the future and would highly recommend it.
