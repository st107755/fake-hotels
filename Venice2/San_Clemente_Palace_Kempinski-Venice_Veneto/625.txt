Our third visit to this beautifully located hotel in Venice   However, previously owned by Regis and the service was far superior  Breakfast was overcrowded and I waited 30 minutes for porridge .....  Attracting a waiters attention for pre dinner drinks was a huge challenge - probably quicker to arrange an audience with the Pope   Service over dinner was equally disappointing
