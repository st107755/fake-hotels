If you are looking for luxury, top-notch service, and great food the St. Regis Venice San Clemente is for you.  A pure retreat to the heat and crowds of Venice which includes a pool and lounge area to none other.  Georgio V at the front desk made our stay memorable to want to return year after year. Don't listen to any negative reviews as this the 1 place to stay when visiting Venice.
