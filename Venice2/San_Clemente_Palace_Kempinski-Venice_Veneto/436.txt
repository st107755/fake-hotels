I booked this stay through Luxury Escapes as a special package deal. We stayed for 3 nights, one of which was my birthday. The 5 star experience started the moment we were aboard the complimentary hotel water taxi & whisked across to the island. There we were greeted by friendly helpful staff & check-in was quick & uncomplicated. The hotel itself is beautiful luxury. Our room was tastefully appointed & had everything we needed. The only one small issue was a lack of lighting in the bedroom, but otherwise was perfect. The grounds are well kept with lovely gardens & a fantastic swimming pool with plenty of pool chairs & bungalows. We dined in both La Dolce Restaurant & Acquerello Restaurant & had wonderfully tasty meals in both & good service. The concierge was extremely helpfulâ€¦
