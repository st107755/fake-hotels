I am a travel agent and have been so for 45 years, having visited Venice before, this was a new experience for me.... the hotel is located on a private island only 5 mins by boat from san marcos, away from the hussle and bustle.... the hotel and staff were amazing, the breakfast was so very good, for clients wanting something special this is truly the place...
