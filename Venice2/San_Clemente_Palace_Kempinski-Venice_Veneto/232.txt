Exzellent Accomodation ! Short vacation-Trip. Very clean area in a beautiful atmosphere. TOP Service! The pool area invites you to linger! Everything was very satisfactory from the check-in to the check-out. The staff are very friendly and definitely take the concierge aside, he gives you the best tips! We've been to Venice ten times and discovered regions that even we did not know. I can highly recommend!
