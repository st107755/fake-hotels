There are nicer places to stay in and around Venice ! It’s 4:30 and I’m sitting outside my room because I can’t go in there because once again after being out all day the maid is only just cleaning it so we cannot shower etc to get ready to go out again ! We are constantly asking for the tea to be replenished for the kettle in our room only to be advised by the reception this is not automatically done and we need to ask !! That is a 1 star service not 5 star !!  Location lovely hotel beautiful shame they let themselves down with the room service considering the price I expect more , will not be returning . If u want to relax by the pool that’s impossible as that is very noisy !! Management ? Will just say the usual !!
