We stayed here for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our room overlooked the lagoon towards St Marks Square and was very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and professional   Nothing was too much trouble and they ensured all our plans ran smoothly. All in all a lovely break in a beautiful position.
