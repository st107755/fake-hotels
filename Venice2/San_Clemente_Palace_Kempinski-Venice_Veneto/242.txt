We stayed for 2 nights and found the staff to be overall very nice. The process getting to the hotel for the first time was a bit confusing; perhaps the 15:00 Check In 16:00 Getting ready (detail shots, a few candids) 17:15 First look with Madeleine and dad 17:25 First look with Madeleine & Paul and couples photos 18:00 Guests arrive and welcome 18.15: wedding near the swimming pool 18.30- 20:00 aperitif under the tent & group photos 19:00 or 19:30 (depending on lighting)- a few more couples photos 20.00: first dance, father/daughter dance, cake cutting (informal, just M&P, can be refrigerated after until after dinner) 20:15 dinner outside in front of the villa 21.30: open bar and dancing inside the villa well once you get the hang of it, and is always on time. It was lovelyâ€¦
