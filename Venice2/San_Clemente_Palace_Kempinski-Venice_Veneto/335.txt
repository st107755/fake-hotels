For us this hotel had pluses and minuses. We generally love Kempinski but after a not so great visit to mall of the emirates we were hoping for an improved experience. We stayed for 2 nights in March as a couple. We preordered the airport pick up as were not landing till after 8pm but to be honest at 280 Euro it really wasn’t worth it and in hindsight we should have done a water taxi which would have been around 140 Euro, but it was a stylish way to arrive. I’d booked directly and ordered quite a few extras like champagne to the room, set menu but for some reason this converted to two set menu’s so there was a bit of a mess around before check in over many emails that started to get actually annoying, like what time are you arriving? Errmm you should know we’ve booked a transfer…
