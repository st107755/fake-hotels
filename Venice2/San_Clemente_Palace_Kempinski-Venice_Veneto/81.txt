The minute you arrive at the hotel you can tell itâ€™s a beautiful, yet peaceful place away from the madness of Venice. We were warmly welcomed and provided a very welcome room upgrade to a junior suite. The rooms are large and well equipped, accessed through large wide corridors with beautiful views.  The pool is lovely as is the breakfast, I would definitely recommend the St Clemente and will be returning!
