We stayed at the St Regis San Clemente Palace the last three nights. Our room is on the third floor facing the lagoon. The view of Venice City is wonderful. Since this hotel opened only last month we can easily forgive staff confusion. Staff was enthusiastic and helpful. We had breakfast in the dining room. Tables are inside and outside. All of our other meals were at other nearby places. The grounds are beautifully kept. The bathroom was small but manageable. One issue we had was that getting hot water took a few minutes and the water temperature was not consistent. Speedtest.net said internet speed was 15 Mbps up and 15 Mbps down.
