This’s isn’t a five star hotel. Restaurant service at pool incredibly slow,  check in and check out also slow. No service at pool.  No water distributed or help with towels and chairs.  Just self serve. Took 40 minutes to check out even after asking bill to be sent to our room one hour before check out. It was never delivered. One of the shuttle boats had no AC or fan despite 90+ weather. Felt like sailing in an oven Lovely grounds but needs more and better trained staff.
