My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights during our mini-moon to Italy.  We loved the hotel and grounds; the complimentary shuttle to Piazza San Marco every 30 minutes; and dining in Acquarello restaurant.  Service was excellent in the hotel bar and restaurant and, whilst it is hard to find anything to criticise, we didn't really feel like they went out of their way to make our stay special.  Still, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to see Venice in luxury.
