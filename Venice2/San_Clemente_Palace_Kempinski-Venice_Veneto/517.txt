Could not believe the peace and tranquility on this island but only minutes away by their private launch to the hustle and bustle of St Marks.  Every member of staff spoke to us and made us feel very welcome. Can recommend the oven baked pizzas served by the pool.  Will definitely stay again if visiting Venice.
