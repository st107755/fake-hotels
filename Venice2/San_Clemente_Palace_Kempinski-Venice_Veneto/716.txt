What a beautiful calm peaceful oasis this hotel is.  This property is stunningly beautiful and it is such a relief to return to after being in the hustle and bustle of the Venetian streets.  I would stay here again, just because it is so peaceful and so beautiful.  It has a great pool area with a lovely little outdoor restaurant.  The staff are extremely friendly and try hard but the service is a bit "clumsy".  Dinner on the terrace at Acquerello restaurant was lovely but again service was a bit clumsy and awkward.  Breakfast was fabulous!  Our room was really lovely and well equipped.   This is a gorgeous property,  beautiful grounds, lovely rooms and with a relaxed yet sophisticated elegant vibe.   I would definitely return and hope to do so one day!
