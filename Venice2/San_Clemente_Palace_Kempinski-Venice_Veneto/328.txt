I have never stayed at such a beautiful place in my entire life. The palace was gigantic! My husband and I had a room with a lagoon view. It was very large with a beautiful bathroom and a very comfortable bed. I loved the fact that the windows opened up to feel the wonderful breeze. The customer service was superb and the breakfast buffet that was included was out of this world. There was a boat that would take you to the main land of Venice that was extremely easy and accessible. I thorough enjoyed to ride.The staff was extremely friendly and it was nice to see some of the same staff over the course of our 3 night stay. We spent an afternoon by the pool which was really nice. My only complaint was that the water was freezing - too cold for me to get in. But I guess that is whatâ€¦
