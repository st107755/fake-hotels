Stayed at the St. Regis for four nights in May.  The location (on its own island) was a big plus and a little minus.  Minus-hard to get up the energy to go back to Venice for dinner, so we ate on island twice. If we had stayed in Venice, we would have gone out more at night but that was a tradeoff we made.  Room service was very good and having a drink overlooking the lagoon was fantastic.  Big plus - so nice to come home to after a long, crowded day in Venice.  Having a drink outside overlooking the lagoon was fantastic.  Had no problems with the shuttle service.
