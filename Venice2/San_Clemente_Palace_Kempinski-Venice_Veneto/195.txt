Just returned from this wonderful hotel, on its own private island, absolutely stunning, if you want a quiet paradise after the hustle and bustle of Venice this is definitely the place to go, just 10 minutes by the hotels free water taxi from St Marks Square, which runs frequently throughout the day, rooms are beautiful, breakfast was perfect with plenty to choose from, the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay, the grounds are stunning with lovey seating areas dotted around some overlooking the water, loved everything about this hotel, I would definitely return  Lynne Richards (Highworth Travel)
