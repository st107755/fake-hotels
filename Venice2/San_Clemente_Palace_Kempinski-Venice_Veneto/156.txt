The hotel is truly lovely and the island is very well taken care of - a little escape from the crowd in Venice.  The hallways and rooms are beautifully decorated and you can feel the history when stepping into the island's own church! I have been eating in all outlets and the food & drinks were very delicious. The Team of the hotel cosists of true hoteliers - taking care, anticipating needs - you name it.  A very BIG thank you for making our stay such a memorable one!
