As always the hotel is lovely! From very clean, luxurious rooms to great delicious wide variety of food in breakfast. You wake up everyday there feeling as if youâ€™re in your own palace because of the lovely atmosphere. Very warm welcoming & friendly staff.   Was so happy to find that the concierge still remembers what I asked him about last year and advices me for more places to visit.   One of my favorite hotels...
