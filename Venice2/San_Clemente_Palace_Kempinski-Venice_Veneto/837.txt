This is one of the most unique hotels I've stayed in.  It is on an island about a ten minute boat ride from st marks or a $120 Euro/25 minute water taxi ride from the airport.  The hotel is completely private, nothing else is on the island.  This place is old world romantic and luxurious.  Part of the AMEX Platinum travel package so you will see mostly american tourists at the hotel.    On the upside the scenery is amazing, the food and drink are excellent and reasonably priced as far as 5 star resorts go.  The breakfast is pretty good, not as good as some places in europe.  The service is impeccable.  The shuttle to and from st marks is free and runs from 9am to 1am or so.  The only real downside we had was this hotel does not have an iron, so you get a touch gouged on pressingâ€¦
