Your own private island in the heart of Venice! We were lucky to be one of the first guests of this new hotel..We were amazed by the heavenly gardens and the swimming pool area..A perfect getaway and relaxation after a tour of the crowded streets of Venice.. The rooms are very nicely decorated, great size and equipped with St Regis Beds. The St. Regis butler service is exceptional, attending to every detail..They have a luxury boat service to San Marco Square which only takes 8 mins..The Acquerello restaurant, by the historic church and the views to San Marco is lovely.. The fine dining experince with italian dishes was excellent..We go to Venice every year and this was definetely our best experience so far..We will be back for the Film Festival!
