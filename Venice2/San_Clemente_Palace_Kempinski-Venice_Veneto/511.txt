This hotel is stunning full of history beautifully decorated and well equipped.Staff are very helpful and curteous ,we found they could not do enough for you to help make your stay extra special from the transfers the concierge booked to eating out by the pool.The half hour tranfers they provide between the island and Venice are great with chilled bottle water ready for you at all times.We loved walking round the grounds and taking in the wonderful views.We loved the peace and tranquility it was like stepping into heaven after the bustle of Venice.We found the food good at all the restaurants and just having a bar meal was lovely.Do watch out for the 8 euro charge for room service.beautiful loved it.
