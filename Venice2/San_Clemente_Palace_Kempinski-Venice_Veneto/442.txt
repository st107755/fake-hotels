If you are in Venice for a certain amount of time, but you can't sleep in the Kempinsky, I advice that at list you go and see the island. The building is very classic, feels like living in a Princess Sissi's movie.  The small island is very green and it's interesting to see how they grow their own vegetables. Also interesting the abandoned church, that even so emanate an halo of spirituality.
