The location is beautiful & peaceful with stunning grounds. You are only a ten minute boat ride from the hustle & bustle of Piazza San Marco. The hotel is a former monastery on a private island with well appointed rooms with divine bedding (my wife's quote). The Concierge and complimentary boat teams are really on the ball. Those are the positive points, however, there are some negative ones as well. On arrival we were dropped off at the restaurant jetty, no one informed us of a second jetty where our bags would be taken care of, as it was l had to carry our bags to reception. During our stay we saw other guests arrive in the same fashion. At the reception l was informed that l had not booked one room but two, this was a little awkward as we were a couple.
