We have stayed at this hotel I think 4 times over recent years, this time, in late September.   The hotel I do like a lot, it is a large hotel set in spacious gardens on a island, it's always pretty quiet, and a nice contrast from the busy hustle and bustle of Venice.  The hotel is a quick and pleasant 7 - 10 minute hotel water taxi ride from St Marks Square, which is free, and a nice interlude between Venice and the hotel.  As before, the hotel staff greeting us were very polite and helpful, the reception staff were very good to us too, and even dealt patiently and professionally with an obnoxious young woman guest who, fortunately, was leaving.  We were shown to our room, and our bags were delivered to the room, pretty promptly.  The gardens are very pleasant to walk around,â€¦
