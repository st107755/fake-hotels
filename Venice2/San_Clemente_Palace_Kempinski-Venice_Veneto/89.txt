My husband and I visited Venice and stayed at the San Clemente Palace. We wanted a nice hotel with space to relax. We didn't get to do any relaxing, as we ended up site seeing all days. But the hotel was lovely, good service and a great breakfast. Bed and the pillows were a bit too hard for my comfort. And the shower partition didn't stop water from pouring on the floor.  But the hotel is excellent and we would definitely return.
