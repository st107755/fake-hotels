There are many things to like about San Clemente. Its location is fantastic, an easy boat  ride  from hectic Venice and the pool and grounds are very relaxing (though I wouldn't want to stay here in winter). The ferry is reliable and its captains are charming.   Breakfasts are very good and the staff were delightful.   Our room was a deluxe double. It was  nothing special, with poor lighting. The view was over a rooftop but anyway obscured by annoying net curtains. Wifi is said to be free, in fact after 5mb you have to pay 30 euros per day.   My main problem with this hotel concerned security. We left  one day around 10am and returned around 6pm to find our door wide open. The maids had been and were probably responsible. Our valuables were in the safe and nothing had been takenâ€¦
