Everything from the island, the decoration and the food to the staff, the organisation and the history of this hotel is perfect.  I was lucky enough to be there for a conference and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I wholeheartedly recommend it for family vacation and business event as well as short breaks and long stays.
