It is definitely nice to be on an island away from all this crowd. Nevertheless, for such a hotel you expect that wen you book in advance for 2 person especially through the director that you have at least two bath robes and the room not full of mosquitoes. We slept hardly 2 hours the first night. They didn't find my membership   Account and i am still not Sure whether they were able to merge my two accounts. Also the turndown service did not work which is definitely a shame for ST. Regis. I am not impressed and eventually the local management should spend some time in the St. regis location in Asia where i have spent some overnights in various locations.
