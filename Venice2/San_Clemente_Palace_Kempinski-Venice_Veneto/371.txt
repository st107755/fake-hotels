The hotel looks as you expect. Very big.beautiful gardens and building, and very nice staff. The problem is that you might find sleeping hard.  In September the AC is off, but the rooms are very warm, so the only option is opening the windows. On the windows there is a warning, that if you open them mosquitoes will come, and they came. Leaving terrible bites that are still itching 3 days after.  Reminded me of the times when I traveled through hotels in the amazon rain forest. But not the sleeping experience you expect from a 5 stars hotel (a 3 stars hotel with AC in the room would have been better). Also, if you knew about the mosquitoes, why put a sign, instead of installing mosquito grids?
