So glad we booked our stay here away from the hotels on the “mainland” of Venice! This private island provided a quiet getaway after touring the often crowded streets/piazzas of the surrounding islands. It was kinda cool taking a private water taxi to the resort. The staff was attentive and friendly. Nice wide and long hallways. The rooms were fairly large, clean and very comfortable.  We enjoyed the buffet style breakfast that had a variety of options including vegan/vegetarian. The grounds were well kept and manicured and made for a peaceful and scenic morning or evening stroll. We also loved learning about the history of the San Clemente Church and walking in the gardens.   If you want to spend a little extra for privacy and a luxurious feel, I’d recommend that you stay here.…
