This is a dream palazzo on its own stunning island.  The grounds are beautiful. Great amenities: pool, tennis, marina , several restaurants , spa and 24 hour fitness. The service is first class. The 'Lady in red' at the reception helped my husband out with his  laptop whenever required! This hotel is beautifully refurbished and so comfortable. Definitely  a terrific treat. You can shuttle every half hour on the free  hotel speedboat- 10 minutes to San Marco. Then return to the blissful peace of the hotel.
