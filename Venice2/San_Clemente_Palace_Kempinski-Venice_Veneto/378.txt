We stayed  four nights in San Clemente Palace. I was looking for a relaxing stay and the hotel is the perfect location as it was away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. The shuttle service to San Marco goes every half hour and is already quite an experience itself. Hotel grounds are superb, great swimming pool area and lovely bar. I tried both restaurants both enjoyed great atmosphere and the food was nice, however for the Acquerello restaurant it had higher expectations. Breakfast service was excellent. We had a large room beautiful decorated with all comfort, I missed a  bit a balcony to enjoy the views. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Overall perfect stay.
