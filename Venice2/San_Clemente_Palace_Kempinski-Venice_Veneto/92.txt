Stayed here for five nights and enjoyed every minute! The hotel is amazing - very elegant atmosphere surrounded by a beautiful garden with a stunnig view over Venice bay. Perfect to relax after a lively day in Venice. In the evening you can enjoy great food in differnt places - they even offer a private dinner on their sunset hill! #perfect spot for #proposal Entire hotel crew is very friendly and professional. All demands have been fullfilled in no time. The 10-15 minutes drive on a typical Venicien wooden boat from the center of Venice to the island is well organized and is such a nice extra feature. I highly recommend to choose this hotel for a perfect stay in Venice.
