Its truly a paradise, nothing less. I love the place. The room is amazing and with just the perfect amount of space, walk in, great bathroom. The food and overall service is PERFECT. The outdoor venues is incredible, very beautiful, like nothing you have ever seen before. The island is very calm, quiet and serene. It fits perfect for the romantic getaway (honestly the most romantic place I've ever been to, and I travel 200 days a year) and fits great with babies and kids too. Nothing bad can be said. Very well done, I'm really satisfied.. Thank you, San Clemente!
