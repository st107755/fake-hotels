The San Clemente is our favorite stay in Venice. As we have become regulars, we even learned to appreciate the typical qualities of the hotel more-and-more over the years. Sailing back from the crowds in Venice to the peace and quiet of the hotel and its pool: one can easily adjust to that.  The hotel rooms are large and the housekeeping is very swift and friendly. It helps to speak Italian to all Italians and this will be rewarded.  What could be improved is the price/food equation. Yes, this is Venice and yes, this is a five star hotel but the price for a pizza of nealry 30 euros is a bit too much in the pricing grid.  Please, come and see for yourself and you will be convinced to return!
