My wife and I were celebrating our 35th anniversary and the hotel kindly upgraded our room and left us a welcoming bottle of wine - a lovely gesture.  The hotel is spectacular on its own tranquil island - an oasis of calm after the bustle of Venice.  We love the atmosphere of Venice but it is so good to retreat to San Clemente.  I hope we can return again one day.
