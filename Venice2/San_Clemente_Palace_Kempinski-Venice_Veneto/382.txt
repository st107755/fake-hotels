We stayed at San Clemente Palace to have some isolation from the bustle of Venice. We were not disappointed! The island is beautifully landscaped and definitely gives you a nice calm from the busy tourist sections of Venice. We loved the Clemente Bar which has a very large patio out to the water (perfect for a sunset cocktail with views of San Marco). The snack tray they bring you with any order was a meal in itself! The room was elegant and masterfully decorated. The staff were very friendly and personable. We were walked to our room by the lady who checked us in (a nice touch). A nice tip is that the island doesn't have an ATM nor do they exchange onsite. So make sure you have enough Euro on hand. We were short for our airport water taxi and they only take cash. Thankfullyâ€¦
