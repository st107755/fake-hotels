Lovely hotel on beautiful little island 10 minutes boat ride from Venice. Was nice to be able to escape the hustle of the city and retreat back to the quiet island. Stayed in a junior suit which was very spacious, with views overlooking the lagoon. The complementary boat shuttle that runs every 30 mins provides stunning views of Venice and the grand canal and was a real treat every time. The staff was always helpful and we were very impressed by the overall service.
