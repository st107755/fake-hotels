This hotel is located at the most exclusive and secluded  part of too crowded and touristic Venice. San Clemente island is just 10 minutes boat drive from the center of Venice. Free Luxury boats from and to Venice every 15 minutes throughout the day make transportation to the hotel a fun.  The hotel has every amenity you would expect such as great pool, spa and nice restaurants. Service is good but it can get better. The rooms are very spacious with nice views. We stayed at the Marco Polo suit which I recommend too highly if the price is no problem.
