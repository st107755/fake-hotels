Indeed, one is actually in Venice and yet away from the overcrowded Venice. San Clemente is on an peaceful island, a bit of Clemency after visiting the sublime city under the hot July sun. The grounds are fabulous, the hotel staff very professional, nicely dressed, very helpful all the way.We absolutely loved the shuttle trip into San Marco's, the danty breakfast courtyard, having dinner out overlooking the lagoon. I have stayed there with my ten year old grandson,he obviously liked Venice but he loved San Clemente.
