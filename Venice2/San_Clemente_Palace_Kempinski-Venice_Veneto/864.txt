Worth every penny, this St. Regis is heaven on earth. Venice and not Venice at the same time. On its own island,an old palace turned hotel, the perfectly trained staff here creates a welcoming environment like none you have ever known. The surprise is that it is not pretentious or stiff but rather is full of very comfortable, kind and helpful people. We felt at home and were able to completely decompress and relax in one of the most beautiful places we have ever been. The grounds are immaculate, filled with interesting sculpture, specimen plants and gorgeous landscaping. The rooms are beautiful and beds are fabulous. The pool is wonderful. The food in the restaurant is exquisite and the across the water view of Venice inspiring. This was the perfect experience. Spend the moneyâ€¦
