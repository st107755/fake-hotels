historical place; hotel set on a private island in the Venice lagoon. The St. Regis brand brings up high expectations: and most are met very well: biggest plus is the food. The dining experience at the fine dining restaurant is just unique. The Chefs menu is worth a star or 2, amazing. Ask for a table by the waterfront. Also the Pool restaurant is very nice and serves much more than your ordinary burger.   The suite we stayed in was very nice, and overall amenities were up to par. Only drawback was possibly the service, which slipped at some moments.
