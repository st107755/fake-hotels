One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in! Considering the amount of rooms the service was excellen and the staff were charming! The whole place is so peaceful and the location wonderful, well worth the boat trip. Just on the downside, we appreciate that the hotel is 5 star, but the food and drink prices are expensive even for Venice. But overall experience excellent!!!
