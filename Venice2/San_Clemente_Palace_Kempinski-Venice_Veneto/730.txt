Spent 2 nights there. Flawless service. Nice bedroom. Staying in a island 15min by boat to Venice makes you live more the Venezian life.   Raffaelo the barman prepares perfect cocktails. One of the best barman I've seen. Don't miss the Negroni or the Dirty Martini. Must have a drink in the bar before heading to the city for dinner.
