It is great to be away from the hubbub of the Grand Canal in Venice. The boat service from San Clemete to San Marco is often enough to accommodate all needs. The hotel is an old monastery and still has a beautiful chapel on the property. It is very idyllic to sit at the many locations around the property and watch the traffic on water and the sunsets are incredible.
