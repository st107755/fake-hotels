My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days and really enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is on its own island so you're not in the hustle bustle of the city. They have their own taxi boat that is on a reasonable time schedule allowing you to go in to the city.   The property is very large and offers so much. They have a tennis court, the pool was great, a breakfast area and a really nice restaurant with a great a view.  My boyfriend and I stayed at the pool in the morning and went in to the city in the afternoon which allowed us to both relax and explore.  The service was great, we were upgraded to a different category room and everyone was so helpful.   We would stay here again!
