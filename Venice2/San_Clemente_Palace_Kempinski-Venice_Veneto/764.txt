We have stayed at this hotel three times and each time have come away wishing we were staying longer!  It is an oasis of calm away from the beautiful, amazing but busy centre of Venice.  The hotel itself is beautiful,  the service is exemplary and the staff are always courteous and helpful.  We spent a little time around the pool this visit and must give a mention to Dario who looked after us extremely well each day .. nothing was too much trouble.  Prices are a little on the high side for food and drink but no more than you expect to pay for this style of hotel.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and really cannot wait to visit again.
