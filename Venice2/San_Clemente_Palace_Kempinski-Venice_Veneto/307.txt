I took my 16 year old daughter to Venice for three days. During the days and evenings we explored Venice and then returned to San Clemente, a former Monastery turned five star hotel. The setting is spectacular, al fresco dining on the terrace overlooking the lagoon and San Marco in the distance. We loved the tranquility, the comfortable beds, the friendly staff. The spa looked professional but the beauty treatment was soso, but who wants to be in a spa when visiting Venice anyway. The hotel boutique had great stuff, no need to go into town... even for a 16 year old. Service at breakfast the first day (May1) was slow and messy, but the second and third days a delight with helpful waiters and everything you would wish for, including a great terrace
