I had 4 wonderful nights at Kempinksi. Hotel comfort and the taste of the meals were wonderful. But there was much more than that. Hotel has a wonderful and large garden where you can take your time in beautiful nature after spending time in Venice historical places. And the church in the garden.. !! Such a sacred, peaceful and facinating place! I spent a long time to watch Mother Marry statue s, which still I use photo of one them as my phone wallpaper. Venice is a historical heaven, San Clemente Palace is anothrr heaven in heaven.
