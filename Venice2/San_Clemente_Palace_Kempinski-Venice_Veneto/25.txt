I had the opportunity to stay at Kempinski Hotel and it was amazing. A totally zen atmosphere, a good place to relax. Comfortable room, friendly staff and an awesome breakfast buffet. Despite the fact it is not located in the main isle (Piazza San Marco), the hotel provides boats to take us there and bring us back all the time. I definitely recommend.
