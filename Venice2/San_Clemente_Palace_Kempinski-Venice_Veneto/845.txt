We booked to stay at this hotel For 5 nights and definitely made the right choice. The rooms were large, spacious and clean. The breakfast was 5 star with too much to choose from. Pool area was set in beautiful gardens, tennis court and great poolside bar. Fantastic gourmet restaurant set on the edge of the water, very romantic and fabulous food although quite fussy. A great hotel to spend relaxing before the hustle and bustle of Venice.  The only negative to this hotel, in my opinion was the 'pool side service'. Sometimes we had to ask for towels and put our own sun beds out on the morning. The pool attendant didn't really want to be working in the beautiful weather!!   Quite pricey aswell, cheapest bottle of wine 60 euros.
