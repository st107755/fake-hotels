I loveeddd this hotel! The staff were super friendly and really helpful with everything we needed, overall 5*!   Hotel: We had 2 rooms, both of which were spacious with good views, on the first floor. Air conditioning was really good, and great to come back to after a hot day. The breakfast was fairly similar each day, but was very yummy, and if you wanted you could ask the chefs to make you something like fried eggs.   Lovely islands with beautiful views, was lovely to be away from the mainland and then get the boat each day to view the sights. The boat is really regular and runs throughout the whole day.   Hotel food: Super expensive, I mean I guess expected with such an expensive hotel, and it was nice, but I hadn't quite expected it to be so much i.e. a diet coke is 4.50â€¦
