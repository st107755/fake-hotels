Truly a great hotel. Enjoyed to spend the day at there large pool side for active swimming while my lady enjoys sightseeing of Venice and it's Attractions. A very frequent both schedule gets you to San Marco within 20 min. The chef and the cuisine is of very high level. Breakfast buffet one of the best I enjoyed in Italy. The historic church which is part of the hotel complex gives an impressive arrival experience when coming back late night. Was a daily must visit. Certainly a hotel to go back to.
