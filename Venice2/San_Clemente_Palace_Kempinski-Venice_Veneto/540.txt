What a wonderful hotel  the San Clemente Palace Kempinski hotel is, it is  Luxury all the way. The  service was excellent and the rooms were fantastic -  try and book a room with a view of the lagoon. We were upgraded to a s very large room  with beautiful high ceilings, a sitting room, a separate dressing room and bath room We had  week to explore this great city and we loved every minute of it . The Hotel was our base for  4 days of exploring the city of Venice  . It proved to be a great  move to stay at as we arrived on a water taxi from the airport late in the evening, to the splendour of the San Clemente Palace Kempinski, we  retired to the hotel after our days sightseeing we just enjoyed  the tranquility and  luxury of the  stylish Bar and rooms at the San Clemente Palaceâ€¦
