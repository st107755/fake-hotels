The St Regis San Clemente grounds are spectacular, the service outstanding, concierge totally at your service, food first class. The complimentary shuttle service to San Marco plaza, complimentary trip/tour to Murano island, and the water taxi arranged to take us to the airport at 4:30 am all appreciated. Great way to spend 4 days after our Mediterranean cruise
