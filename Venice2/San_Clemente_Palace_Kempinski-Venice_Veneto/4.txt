We loved this old monastery now turned into a hotel.  In the midst of a pandemic it offered exactly what we wanted - space indoors and outdoors. The hotel is on a small island 10 minutes in a boat from St Mark's Square. It has lovely gardens, a swimming pool and beautiful views of the Venice skyline. Rooms are larger than in hotels in the city and having lovely outdoor places to sit and relax was a huge boon. The staff were all really friendly and helpful, suggesting excellent local restaurants and interesting trips to take.
