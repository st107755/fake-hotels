We stayed at San Clemente Palace Kempinski for 4 nights for our honeymoon. Its situated on its own island 10 mins away from Venice, the hotel provides a free boat service to San Marco (the main square) in Venice. The staff is extremely helpful, Alessandro at the concierge is a genie who can organise / book anything & additionally he has a vast knowledge of Venice. The restaurants are pretty good as well. We would certainly come back !
