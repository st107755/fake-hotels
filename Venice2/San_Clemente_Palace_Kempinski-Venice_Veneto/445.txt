Nice peace fully hotel, on island staff are great and helpful.Love the Decor. Good to experience as a couple or family if you need a break as there is nothing surrounded apart from water. The closest hotel is JW Marriott need a water taxi to go to this hotel. Hotel have got a free water taxi to go to San Marco where all the main attractions or lively areas plus the main station is at San Marco. It is easy to roam on water taxi. Hotel restaurant is over priced. Would recommend for friends and family. Will definitely go again for my big birthday.
