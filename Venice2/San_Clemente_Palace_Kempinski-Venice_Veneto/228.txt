Room was very spacious. Bed comfortable. The grounds are large so you can wander around without feeling cramped onto island The hotel occupies the whole island so it is very private. pool area with bar was very relaxing Excellent service from all staff especially the concierge who gave very good recommendations for restaurants in Venice  Room has an amazing view back over Venice.  Only negative is thet the first courtesy boat doesnt leave until 0850.
