I arrived early am from New York with my daughter and 2 grandchildren!  All of the services, especially front desk, and concierge were superb.  We all think that it was the BEST bed, sheets and pillows of any hotel we have ever stayed at!  Breakfast was divine-it was wonderful to be away from busy Venice!!  --and we loved the boat back and forth!!
