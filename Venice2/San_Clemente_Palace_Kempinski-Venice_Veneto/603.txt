Visiting Venice in the summer might not be the smartest thing to do, it is VERY busy, therefore it was such a welcome change to get to our hotel, the San Clemente Palace, a short 10 or so minutes shuttle across the water from San Marco.  The tranquil, beautiful hotel and gardens was exactly what we needed after 'battling' the crowds around Venice.  The staff were lovely and attentive, our room, a junior suite was lovely and spacious - the food was fine (breakfast tip: order from the waiter, some time the buffet looks a bit 'tired'). We only had breakfast and lunch during our stay and thus cannot therefore say anything about dinner there.  We would definitely stay there again.
