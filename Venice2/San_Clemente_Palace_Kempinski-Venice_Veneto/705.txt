Stayed for two days just last week and was so sorry to have to check out and go home! Our last hotel from being on a two week European vacation and so glad we saved one of the best for last..Ground of the hotel are magnificent, service impeccable, room upgrade to suite was wonderful.. Only about a 6 minute boat taxi to town and runs every half hour until midnight..Service was very friendly with helpful concierge staff to guide you..Have a drink in the gorgeous bar!
