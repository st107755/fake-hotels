Stayed at the end of May for 2 nights with my husband. This hotel was recommended to us through the Andrew Harper travel agent. Part of booking through Andrew Harper was to hopefully get an upgrade if available. Unfortunately that did not happen. We were told that the hotel was at 95% occupancy. The hotel and the grounds are absolutely lovely. I loved that with just a short 10 minute water taxi you are in Venice. However after long days touring Venice you can escape to a much quieter resort and relax at the pool which was lovely. The pool area is very nice. The lounge chairs are very high end but the side tables are cheap plastic. I assume they are in the process of replacing them. There is also 1 grass tennis court. My husband and I were able to easily hit some balls for a bit.â€¦
