Where to start???  1/ The hotel is located on a small island +- 15 minutes from Venice, 30 minutes from the airport. Let the concierge upfront book for you a boot (water taxi) from the airport to the hotel. All is well explained. No hustle afterwards with prices. The holiday already starts in the boat. Somebody at the hotel knows you are coming and picks up your bags when you arrive at the island of Kempinski. = TOP service A special word to the concierge people. They help you out with EVERYTHING (boat, hotel, pick up luggage, resto, ...ask it, they solve it... without asking for a tip ... ) By the way, never in the hotel you get a paper where you can fill in a tip. They don't want or beg for tips... all done with the smile. Of course, a tip for a perfect service is alwaysâ€¦
