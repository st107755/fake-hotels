We stayed for 10 days when it was under management from the St. Regis.  The hotel itself, the property - is EXQUISITE.  We had a room with a view of Venice, a private butler who wanted to unpack us (I refused) and access to Venice via private boat anytime we wanted.  We went during the Biennale which is a great time to be in town, and staying on your own private island has a way of palliating the maddening crowds.  Highly recommend this hotel, the breakfast is absolutely amazing as was the restaurant which we greatly enjoyed.  It's just one of those places in life that you must stay if you have the ability to, the building was a convent and is absolutely stunning and grand.
