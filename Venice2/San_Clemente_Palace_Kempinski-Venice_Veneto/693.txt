I visited this hotel when it was under St. Regis. It is an interesting building with an E shape. Originally it was a monastery converted into a female mad house and recently (20 years) into an hotel. Why am I explaining it? Because from that you can understand that the structure of the hotel is not easy, often happen to lose direction and we have to ask few times where the breakfast room was located. The room size are not so small as usually are in Venice, however I would not consider them up to the 5 star luxury level. The location in a way is positive, you are at 15 to 20 minutes by shuttle boat from San Marco square (the hotel declare 10 minutes. Not true) which brings you out of the touristic and chaotic world of Venice.  Why am I assigning only 3 points out of 5? Becauseâ€¦
