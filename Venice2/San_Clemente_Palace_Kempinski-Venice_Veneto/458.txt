The location and the facilities are perfect, the hotel is improving since it was taken over by Kempinsky. But it is still far of the mark in terms of service, especially in the area of food and beverage. No capability to have decent current food, it is either the luxury hotel, at ludicrous prices or a sandwich. A lot of little services failures, with a global feeling of unfriendly staff, makes you feel uncomfortable. It feels like all the staff are unhappy and they make you pay for it. Unacceptable. We stayed for a whole week, with some serious incidents, and didn't even have a little attention from the hotel management. A lot of efforts ahead to bring the hotel to a 5* level.
