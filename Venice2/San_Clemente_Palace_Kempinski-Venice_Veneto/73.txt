We absolutely loved the San Clemente and will certainly be staying here again on our next trip to Venice.   From the moment of arrival on the property, the stay exceeded expectations: the staff were great at check-in, the room was sizable, the air conditioning worked well (in the middle of the recent heat wave no less), the grounds were well-maintained, and the views were beautiful. As we continued our stay, the level of perfection the hotel strives for became increasingly evident whether in terms of the always on-time boat shuttle into Venice, the fitness center and spa, the pool, the breakfast (definitely get), or other food and drink. We did not use the Kids Club but this hotel was exceptionally kid friendly and our daughter had a great stay as well. We would highly recommendâ€¦
