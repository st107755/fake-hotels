Beautiful luxurious hotel , spacious rooms and beautiful gardens. Staff were excellent and friendly, This is a fabulous place to stay when visiting Venice as they have regular shuttles going in to the city and at the end of the day when you get away from the crowds it feels like heaven !! Would definitely recommend this hotel .
