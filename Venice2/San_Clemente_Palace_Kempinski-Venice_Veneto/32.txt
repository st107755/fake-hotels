Had been looking to staying here for months as a holiday to celebrate our engagement. Beautiful grounds and building and on arrival we were upgraded!   However, taken up to our room which is boiling hot, then jokingly told the air con isn’t working because ‘the system is ancient and not very good’. Attempted to cool down in the bar, no barman working, outside restaurant closed, pool closed - was like the place had closed down for the season!   We requested to move room, it took an hour to organise this and their suggestion was we waited in our boiling room while they sorted it!! We were then laughed at when we explained our situation on the way to the new room. This also had no air con, and opening the windows meant the noise was very loud from passing boats.
