The hotel is a gem in Venice. A short boat ride from Airport and the St Marks, it provides a haven of luxury and tranquility for those visiting the great City   Its  a classic Italian hotel, all traditional frills and silver service so a question of taste and maybe not for the younger guest looking for a cooler contemporary vibe and certainly not for the family   The pool and pool bar are just great to chill out and read a good book  When ready, take the launch into St Marks and get sight seeing, eating and drinking. Peggy Guggenheim Museum and Burano (as opposed to Murano) a must  Would always go back here given the opportunity
