We stayed at the San Clemente with our three children and grandparents.  It was a beautiful escape.  You are on your own private island, it is beautiful and serene. Everyone was so helpful and seemed happy to be working at the hotel.  I felt like I was on a retreat.  The private boat was lovely  and my children loved the experience.  We wished we could have stayed longer.  Breakfast was superb.  The rooms were nice, our room did have a smell which was the smell of Venice but we got used to it.  The hotel is unique and you feel like you are in a palace.  We loved it and highly recommend it for luxury travelers.
