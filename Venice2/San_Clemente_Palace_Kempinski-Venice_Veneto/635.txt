This stunning hotel is set on its own island about 10 mins complimentary launch ride from the dock to St Marks. It runs every 1/2 hour until after midnight. This is a five star hotel but without the common stuffiness of the staff. They were really attentive and helpful. It was my wifes birthday and they really could not have done any more to make it special including cake, card from the "ladies in red", complimentary bubbly with dinner and a special chefs desert. I managed to mess up the extra bed in the childrens room and so they upgraded their room to a suite and ours to a deluxe. Venice in July is HOT and crowded. It is really great to just be able to go in and out as you choose and have a cool pool and space to relax in. There is a tennis court and a 3 hole pitch and puttâ€¦
