Stayed here for 4 nights during my honeymoon in early October, 2015. The grounds and views breathtaking! The staff was so friendly and helpful. One man in particular I would like to recognize worked in concierge gave me absolute precise directions to a store on the island of San Marco that sold hair straighteners after mine decided to stop working.   We had breakfast everyday in a beautifully decorated room; it was so romantic. And the food was absolutely incredible. The ricotta cake was the best I've ever had in my life. One huge plus to this hotel is the boat service they provide that runs all day and night to and from San Marco. It was so nice to be on a tranquil private island after a long day wandering the busy alleyways of Venice. I would definitely recommend anyoneâ€¦
