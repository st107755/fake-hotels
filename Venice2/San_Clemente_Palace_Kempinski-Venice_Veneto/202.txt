This resort was a welcome surprise. The grounds are fab & the hotel is kept very nice. We had fab cocktails on patio. They have a buzzer service that keeps you from waiting an hour between drinks. Fantastic views while you drink & eat. We didn’t have reservations for main restaurant but they fit us in. Very accommodating even though my luggage didn’t make it & I was wearing shorts. Wear nice/decent clothing for that evening.  Let’s talk about the beautiful chapel right where you eat & have cocktails. Truly gorgeous inside & you can go in anytime. Made my damn year bc I love things like that. Hotel gift shop has something for every price range. I enjoyed this place immensely.  You can also have a day besidetbeir gorgeous pool & eat at yummy restaurant they have there too. Food…
