Rooms are large and luxurious, and very quiet.  The service is outstanding, and the food excellent.  Breakfasts are extensive and great.  Venice is a crowed (though beautiful and interesting place) - a population of 50,000 and 25 million tourists a year.  That is 500 visitors for every resident every year, so you will not find restaurants without tourists and will find a retreat like the San Clemente Palace a very pleasant way to experience Venice.   The house car is a boat, of course, and the ride to San Marco short and very pleasant.
