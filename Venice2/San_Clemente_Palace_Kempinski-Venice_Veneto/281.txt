An amazing hotel! The grounds are beautiful and the hotel itself is impressive. Staff are on hand to provide a genuinely warm welcome and nothing appeared to be too much trouble to help us enjoy our stay. The complimentary water taxi service to Venice city is reliable and quick so you never feel too far away from the action. Can't wait to return to this hotel!
