This amazing Hotel located on an Island about 10min by boat from san marco and all the  hectic part of venice. This shuttle will take you evry 20 and 50 min for free from at to the hotel. The room we had was spacious with great water and park view. the size of the hotel is gigantic but it feels like a  small boutique hotel in the good way. the breakfast is perfect with a fresh bouffet and a nice court garden with tables all around. The stuff are kind and professional and the boat "drivers" are extremely nice and useful. We came for the Bianale in June and it was perfect ! away from the crowded tourist traps, with its great swimming pool with the nice bar for a great launch.
