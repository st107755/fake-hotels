The San Clemente is an amazing location- an enormous private island, just 10 minutes from San Marco by boat. Really peaceful and quiet but so close to all the action! The hotel building is extraordinary, a converted monastery complete with chapel it has been beautifully restored. What struck us particularly was the service- nothing was too much trouble and the attention to detail was excellent. The concierge service is incredible- the wonderful Michael knew everything we needed to know and guided us with restaurant bookings etc to suit us and our two children. Highly recommended.
