The newly opened Kempinski proofed to be a great choice! What a warm welcome by the staff ! Our rooms are luxurious with great views of Venice. We are very picky as far the quality of the beds(matrasses ) is concerned - let us tell you that you can't beat San Clemente Kempinski in that respect! Very well kept huge garden wih heated swimming pool. We tried out the Tennis court which is in a top condition as well. Completely new and top quality tennis equipment provided by the hotel You must have dinner at least once in the hotel restaurant- innovative meals- great food  The tiny and pieceful Island is a great place to return to from the busy City of Venice It takes only 10 minutes for the Hotel shuttle boat to arrive at San Marco. Last shuttle after midnight so you can enjoyâ€¦
