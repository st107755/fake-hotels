I am a big fan of other St Regis properties and was really looking forward to this visit on a private island. The exterior spaces are beautiful and hotel is too -- but the property is missing the finishing touches it needs. For instance I was upgraded two beautiful Lagoon view room â€“ with a flat screen TV plopped inelegantly on a table. Really? Also hotel has an empty feel. Service is mixed. Our room was not ready until 5 PM on day if arrival and the pool closes at six even in the height of summer.  Save your money and stay in the city.
