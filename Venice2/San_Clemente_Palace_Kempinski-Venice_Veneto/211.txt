I have just celebrated a special birthday at this superb hotel located on an island away from the hubbub of the city but with an excellent water taxi service so that we were still able to enjoy all the delights that Venice has to offer. However, considering the cost of the hotel we felt that the service at the pool was not first class standard and we had a few plumbing issues in our bathroom - I have to admit that these were sorted out as soon as we reported them. Also my husband's chair almost collapsed at breakfast and my husband is skinny!! Some of the breakfast staff were not as friendly as one would expect at a 5 star hotel. But our room was lovely with a magnificent view of Venice.
