I stayed here with my husband for his birthday, it truly was the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in.  The decor and architecture absolutely incredible, the history fascinating.  The staff were amazing, the service second to none and the room incredible.  We stayed in a suite and were upgraded due to my husbands birthday being a special one.  We arrived at the island by a private speedboat from the airport to be greeted by conciege, our luggage was on the end of the bed when we entered the room.  The hotel has it's own water taxi to St Marks sqaure so nothing was too far to walk to once we arrived at the square.  San Clemente Island was very special, the grounds, the hotel, the spa treatments, the restaurants, everything.  It was such a shame that it closed the week afterâ€¦
