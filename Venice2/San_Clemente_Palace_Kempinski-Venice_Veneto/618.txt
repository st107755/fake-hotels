I booked this hotel to celebrate the birthday of my son who had Venice high on his wish list and I can recommend it to everyone. The hotel offered a birthday cake and a beautiful card which was a great and much appreciated attention. A big thank you to the hotel management who made my son feel special that day! The hotel is located on one of the lagoon islands and it is a relief to enjoy the tranquility after visiting a very busy but beautiful city. The rooms are great, service is of extremely high level and the personnel is very friendly and helpful.  You can enjoy a nice swimming pool and whenever we came back from Venice city we had no issue in finding a bed and enjoy a relaxing swim.  The hotel disposes of a shuttle boat to Venice and back with a very convenient timeâ€¦
