The hotel is very enjoyable because you can press a in the lobby and crew send you up to your room! There is a tennis court, pool, soccer field, golf, spa and even a outside bar! They have there own boats to Venice from the hotel! The whole hotel is in the water on a island! In Venice there is NO cars only boats and water taxis, police and garbage trucks! Come now! P.S the medataraiden sea flooded Venice so now there is water everywhere!!!
