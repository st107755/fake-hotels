Beautiful hotel, set on a secluded island... We were married in Florence and spent our honeymoon in Rome, but then to our surprise, our daughter had paid for 5 days in this hotel too. Like a lot of the others say, it is a wonderful place, and we felt like royalty.  It's very reasonable to stop here, even though it looks expensive. The rooms are elegant and hallways nicely decorated. The grounds are kept very well, and staff always helpful.  The shuttle speed boat is very handy and goes to St Marks Square often.   We actually stopped here in 2009, but I never did a review at the time.   Would love to stop here again soon.
