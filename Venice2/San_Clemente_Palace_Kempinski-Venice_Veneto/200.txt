Gorgeous hotel out of the way of the overridden tourist areas. Great customer service from the concierge and reception teams who gave a complimentary upgrade for our five year anniversary and also booked a taxi to collect us from the airport at short notice. Didn't eat at the hotel but had drinks at the pool bar which was wonderful.  Lots of greenery to enjoy and historic artefacts to explore. The shuttle service to San Marco was reliable, comfortable and a great convenience. Rooms were luxurious and spacious. Bed was uber comfy and we slept like babies. Worth a visit if you want to treat yourself to a bit of luxury.
