Was looking forward to staying at another Kempinski hotel but left disappointed and doubtful I will ever stay at another.  First off, the exclusivity of the private island seemed like a draw but turned out to be isolating and an inconvenience.  During the first or second shuttle ride, you think "wow this is great."  After that, it's an annoyance.  Further, the shuttle didn't consistently run on schedule almost causing me to miss dinner reservations and trains on the main island.  There really wasn't an excuse for the shuttle to run late except that the captain had no sense of urgency nor was he mindful of keeping the time.  The shuttle also stops for an hour at 1:00 which was inconvenient.  Worse off, you're at the merci of the shuttle schedule -- the first one isn't until 9:00â€¦
