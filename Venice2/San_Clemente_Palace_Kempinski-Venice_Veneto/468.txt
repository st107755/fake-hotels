We recently visited with a view to having our wedding anniversary party here next year for 20 friends! Food at the pool bar was very good but the service was very lacking! We were ignored by the staff and had to go and fetch our bottles of champagne and water from an adjacent table and pour ourselves! Annoying when the waiters are hovering about doing nothing!! Disappointed!
