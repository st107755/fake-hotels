This is the most fantastic hotel, a haven of tranquility away from the crowds of central Venice. From the moment you step off the water taxi you are welcomed into luxury on a beautifully manicured island. As a receptionist said it is more of a resort than a hotel. All the staff are friendly and helpful and will greet you in passing. The ladies in red are excellent, we were there for a wedding anniversary and they arranged for a bottle of prosecco, chocolates and a charming card to greet us in our room. We were upgraded to a Grand Deluxe room which was lovely. Breakfast buffet is excellent with a wide range to choose from though occasionally the coffee can take a little while to come out. The pool area is great for relaxing when you need a break from central Venice and the barâ€¦
