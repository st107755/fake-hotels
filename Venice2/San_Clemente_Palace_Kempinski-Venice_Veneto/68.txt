My boyfriend and I visited here last week and little did I know he was planning to propose! He booked dinner on the sunset hill at the front of the hotel  which was a stunning location looking out to the waters of Venice with our own butler service and it was there he proposed much to my surprise - we cannot fault the service provided by Shiama Devi the lady in red who helped my boyfriend coordinate it all before arrived  - it is a truly stunning romantic secluded location and we would highly recommend it to any couples looking for that special something on their trip to Venice! The hotel is breathtaking and the breakfast was outstanding!  Thank you for an unforgettable stay!
