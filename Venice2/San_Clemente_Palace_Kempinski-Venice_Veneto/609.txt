Visited the San Clemente palace for 6 days last week, it's was a truly lovely hotel away from the very busy Central Venice. Situated on its own island approx 12mins away from St Marc's sq,with a free, regular boat shuttle to & from hotel, it was so nice to return to peace and quite, well for most of the time anyway. I loved this place apart from two things, the very expensive food and drink, I've stayed in many, many 5* hotels and this was by far one of the most expensive, you are at their mercy as the hotel is the only place on the island, the hotel doesn't even have a shop! I'm still getting over the cost of the drinks round the pool. Now the pool is lovely, quite large and more than enough comfortable sunbeds & umbrella's, the downfall is there is no children's pool soâ€¦
