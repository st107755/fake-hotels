From the moment we stepped of the boat, a feeling of tranquil took over. This hotel is heaven on its own island. Nothing is too much trouble, all staff, from reception, the ladies in red, concierge, housekeeping and waiting staff are wonderful, even addressing us by name (we were only there two nights)! All in all I cannot recommend this hotel enough, when you are tired from the hustle of bustle of the streets of Venice to escape back to San Clemente Palace and relax by the waters edge, with its wonderful grounds and peaceful ambience was just what the doctor ordered. In addition I accidently left my wallet in the room, only discovered this at the airport by which time it was too late to collect it, however it was sent by express delivery received 48 hours later! A big thank youâ€¦
