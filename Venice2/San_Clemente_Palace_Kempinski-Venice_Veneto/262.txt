It was truly a perfect stay for a couple. My husband and I stayed 4 days on the San Clemente hotel. The location is perfect because you are close to the center but have a small place to escape from the busy touristy streets.  We had a beautiful and spacious room overlooking the water. The restaurant for breakfast was excellent and the seating outside perfect.  The concierge service was excellent. I would truly recommend asking for their recommendations for restaurant bookings.  The spa could however be improved a bit.  Otherwise all perfect!
