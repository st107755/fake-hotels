A beautiful hotel on a private island. The staff is so friendly and polite, the food at the Aquerello Restaurant is really good - I recommend the lobster tagliatelle! and a Pizza for lunch at the place next to the pool. The SPA offers a range of great treatments and even a facial with gold. Would definitely go back!
