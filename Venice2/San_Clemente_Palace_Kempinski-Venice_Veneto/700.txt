Best view of the venitian lagoon and location... luxury resort quiet surrounded by spectaculare gardens...the staff is compound and kind. Not for noisy family with children...is to bad I've lost the photos I took but here below there is one of me and my girlfriend on the water taxi free service of the resort crossing the stunning lagoon of Venice taking guest to this wondeful 5 stars hotel. actually for lovers of the fine style living.
