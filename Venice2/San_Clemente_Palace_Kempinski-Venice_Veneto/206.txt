Venice is truly one of the world’s most amazing cities.  As a result, it can get quite crowded with tourists.  As a result, we decided to look for a hotel that is a little out of the hub-bub.  We found the perfect place in the San Clemente Palace on San Clemente Island.  The hotel is located on an island out in the Venice lagoon. It has its own fleet of really cool power boats that run back and forth between the Island and Venice’s San Marco square every half hour or so.  The Island is a spectacular property ripe with history, beauty and wonderfully helpful people.  The rooms are large and fantastic.  After a day of touring in crowded Venice, coming home to “our island” was so relaxing.   We could not have picked a better place to stay to see Venice.  Thanks Kempinski!
