My husband and I just returned from a 3 day trip to Venice and were fortunate enough to spend 2 nights at this magical hotel.  We are both seasoned travelers and also working in the hospitality industry, but this hotel took our breath away.  From the lush gardens to the stunning views onto Venice island and the forthcoming and very, very friendly staff, this hotel is very special. You can still feel its history and old soul, combined with the modern day necessities, it did not disappoint in making us feel very special and have an incredible time in this wonderful city. We loved coming back to this perfect, relaxing place after a day of hustle and bustle in the city. Whenever we will be back in Venice, there will only be one hotel choice for us.
