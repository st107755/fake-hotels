We visited for our 1st wedding anniversary and found the hotel and grounds to be very beautiful the staff were very attentive and the pool area was very nice  My only small gripe was the size of the room as felt for the money  it could have been a little bigger although this was only a slight concern  I would gladly stay again and would highly recommend this beautiful hotel as it allows you to escape the crazy ness of Venice
