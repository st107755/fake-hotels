This is a beautiful hotel that sits on an island all by itself.  The grounds are beautifully manicured and maintained.  The pool is inviting.  Apparently the property used to be a hospital.  The corridors are very wide and palatial.  There is lots of wonderful art on the walls.  There's a church on the property, a catholic sanctuary that dates back to 1131.  It's really breathtaking.  The rooms are smallish, as is typical of european hotels, but very comfortable.  My room overlooked a courtyard.  It was quiet and very comfortable.  Room service was pretty good as well.  Have the burger.  They've got a different take on bacon that's not to be denied!  The front desk staff was very helpful and the dining room (especially breakfast) was outstanding.  It's probably pricey most ofâ€¦
