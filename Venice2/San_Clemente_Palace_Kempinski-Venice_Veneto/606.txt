The hotel grounds are amazing. The staff and the concierge are fantastic. The food is good. The hotel is not in the center of Venice which is nice and is only a 10 minute shuttle away. I stay in 5 star hotels often and the San Clemente is great. I would definitely stay there again next time in Venice.
