Place is amazing, all areas are really nice and you can easily get relax here. Please be aware that shuttle is usually late from hotel to city center ... from 6 times using that was 5 lates... some over 10 minutes and no delays experienced on route to hotel. Back to rate, why 3 and why unprofessional staff. Last night cant manage to sleep by simple fact, in outside restaurant was small party, 4-5 people which create such a noise, that it was impossible to sleep. 3 calls to reception was unsuccessful, front desk promises that party will be closed was not true. When we went to ask how it possible, why there is no reaction on complains, we realized that front desk staff even not understand, what is the problem. I made several videos on this noise party. Will think to publish!â€¦
