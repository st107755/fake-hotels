We visited San Clemente Palace Kempinski during the Easter season. The exclusive island was much bigger than we expected!It is a massive building which is beautifully decorated round every corner and it also has a monastery which is more like the size of a church and is stunning on the inside. The gardens are vast and maintained and we spotted loads of lizards which was nice! The pool was supposedly heated however all the guests found it very cold, but we still enjoyed a swim, as did everybody else. The dining option by the pool was very good, we were the first ones to try the new pizza oven which was very italian and tasty. The service too, and all over the hotel was very good and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We also had dinner, which was very nice butâ€¦
