This is a very well run, beautiful and tranquil hotel. It's the only building on an island, set in well manicured gardens. The shuttle boat runs every half hour and delivers you to within a minute of St. Marks Sq.  The hotel itself is spacious.  Our room was large and very comfortable, with plenty of storage space. The bathroom, with separate shower and toilet, was well equipped and the housekeeping was immaculate. Special mention for Michael, the concierge, who was a fountain of knowledge and always willing to help. The beautiful pool provided welcome respite after a day touring.
