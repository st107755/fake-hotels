WOW , fantastic unique hotel.  Beautiful reception area and the halls are decked with amazing art. Set on its own private island , with a great shuttle service to San Marco , this hotel is very , very good.  We had an easy check in, very friendly people working there in every department. Indeed everyone involved with the hotel is a credit to there employers. Breakfast is very good also. The standard room we booked was a bit small , but perfectly clean The beautiful church is a must see Nice large pool area to relax. Definitely recommended
