This is a charming hotel with very friendly and attentive staff. However, they just don't quite have what it takes to award five stars. Perhaps I am too picky, but when I see bar staff getting openly flustered, and when the breakfast team can't find a pepper mill I am inclined to hold back on that final half a star. Yes, I'd stay there again, because it's brilliant being away from the centre of Venice and you get well looked after. Be aware it's closing now with a reopen in 2016 under the Kempinski badge. Finally, really worth a mention is the restaurant - now that is five star food and service, the wine waiter deserves a particular mention for his excellent suggestions.
