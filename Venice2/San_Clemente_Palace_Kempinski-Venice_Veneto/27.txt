Great Hotel to escape to after a busy day sightseeing in Venice, Lovely grounds , restaurants and Bars as well as a spa which we didn`t use. As you are a captive audience as you would expect the food/ drinks are expensive and there were no Tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The Staff /Concierge / Ladies in Red are all extremely helpful and can help plan your stay to make it as enjoyable as possible
