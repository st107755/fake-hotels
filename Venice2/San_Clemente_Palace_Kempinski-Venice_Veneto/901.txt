Several items are just not acceptable at such a beautiful resort.  Some details: - pick-up from airport is organized via car to the train station and then by boat for over EUR 200.  That is a waste of money and time.  Go to the pier and take a taxi, it costs half! - rooms on the ground floor smell of rot and damp.  We were upgraded to one of those suites but had to change rooms as the smell was terrible.  There have been numerous complaints - There seem to be bouncers at the piers.  The most unfriendly and rude people I have ever met.  We had friends who picked us up by boat and were twice, extremely rudely, told to go away.  We told them that we were guests but they did not care.  They should be fired - Dinner at the hotel is a joke.  Food is actually good, service is hopeless.â€¦
