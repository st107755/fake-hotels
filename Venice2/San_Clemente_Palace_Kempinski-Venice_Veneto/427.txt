Title sums it up really. The island and the hotel is beautiful. However, service is decent four, bit definitely not five star.   A few examples from our 3 night stay.   1.  Our flight into Venice was delayed. Had booked water taxi through concierge. Had to wait 20 minutes at airport for taxi to arrive.   2. Pool bar : Ordered a beer and a coke. Never arrived. Walked over after 20 minutes to find that the order was never registered  3. Pool bar : Ordered frozen margarita. Something very different arrived (though they managed to make one in the end)  4. Their gourmet restaurant : My son ordered a coke with his dinner.  Did not arrive until after we reminded them after he had finished his meal.  Not getting your drink with your meal at a restaurant that charges 30 Euro for a pastaâ€¦
