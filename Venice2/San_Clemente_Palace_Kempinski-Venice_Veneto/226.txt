First of all, I would like to thank the "Ladies in Red" for helping to plan out a romantic surprise, which was totally mind blowing. The hotel is really beautiful and well kept. Breakfast is a must try at the hotel, nothing ever seem to much for the staff, they are very attentive and happy to be at your service.Thanks to the staff at the Aquerello restaurant, the dinner set was totally amazing and the food was exceptional. Would like to give a special mention to Sharma (lady in red) and Antonio (concierge). We stayed for 3 nights and wished we had stayed for a week, without a doubt will be returning for that week of serenity.
