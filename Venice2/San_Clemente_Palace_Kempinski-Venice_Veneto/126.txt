I was excited to go to the Kempinski.  I liked the idea for my second visit to Venice in as many years to be on one of the islands.  Well the experience was not as hoped. Lets start with breakfast, yes its included, no they really don't speak very good english and no after 6 nights they still could not remember our exact same order.  The Grand deluxe canal view room is great if you stand at the window, as the windows are too high to see out of if you are sitting or in bed.  The shower was small and did not drain well until 2 visits by maintenance. Speaking to the folks at the front desk seemed like a chore.  The best part of hotel were the concierge's who were really outstanding.  In particular Michael worked very hard to try to fix a train issue and went as far as personallyâ€¦
