I went to this hotel with my daughter on our last leg of our Italian tour and it was such a treat to stay at this hotel. It is on a private island away from the crowds of Venice. They had a boat shuttle that brought us back and forth that left every half hour. The entire staff was so very friendly.  The pool was beautiful as was the entire hotel. The breakfast spread was my absolutely delicious!  I would highly recommend this gorgeous 5 Star hotel.
