This hotel has nice open rooms with a nice view of Venice.  However, the hotel is on its own island.  Free shuttles come back and forth to the hotel.  This is unreliable since the shuttle has certain timetables and takes 15 minutes.  Also, this hotel is gigantic so it could take quite a long time to even get to your own room.  This hotel feature history since it was a convent long ago.  Also, the hotel has a nice breakfast buffet serving pastries, cereals, fruits, and more.  A restaurant, La Dolce, serves lunch and dinner.  The hotel requires tons of walking so if your handicap, this hotel is a no no.
