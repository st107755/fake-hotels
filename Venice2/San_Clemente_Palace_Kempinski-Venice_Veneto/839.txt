We recently stayed during the last week of June, it's very difficult to find a fault with this place. The rooms are spotless and very spacious, the grounds are lovely and the bars serve a good variety of drinks.  We found the food in Venice to be quite so so, we ate at the hotel one night and it was delicious, easily the best meal we had during our stay.  Make good use out of the concierge, they do a great job. There's also a trip out to a Merano glass factory that the hotel arranged for us, it's worth the visit.  All in all we had a great stay here, Thank you St Regis.
