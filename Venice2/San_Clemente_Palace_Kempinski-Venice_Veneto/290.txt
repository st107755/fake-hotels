A truly magical experience and location.  We return year on year and it just gets better.  The manager and his team seem have a formula that is second to none.  From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave it is perfection.  San Clemente Palace is a truly must visit place and needs to be on every bodies bucket list.  I can not praise the hotel, the staff and the island enough.  The island and hotel work  if you are a family, a couple or single.  EXCEPTIONAL!
