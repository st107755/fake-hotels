After a slightly rocky start with the check-in the remainder of the stay was excellent.  It was the perfect base for exploring Venice and then relaxing by the pool at the end of the day.  There was a boat running every 20 minutes to and from the hotel. The room was stunning and very spacious, we even had a complimentary welcome mini bar.  Housekeeping also provided a turn down service with slippers and water bottles.  We only ate at the poolside restaurant on the last day for lunch which was good.   They also offered a waiter service around the pool area.  I didn't quite manage the gym so not sure what that was like.  We did sit and have pre-dinner drinks at one of the other bars overlooking the water, it was magical.  Would definitely return for another stay.
