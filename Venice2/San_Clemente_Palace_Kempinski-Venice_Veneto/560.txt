Our stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski was excellent The hotel , food and grounds were first class  The staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble  The only downside was that as the hotel is on its own island there was no popping back to the hotel , you have to get a private water taxi or the free hotel shuttle boat that goes to Venice twice every hour but it all added to the adventure and  it was easily forgiven  as the whole experience of the hotel was something never to be forgotten for all the right reasons
