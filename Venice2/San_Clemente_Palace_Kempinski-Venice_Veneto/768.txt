Visited in height of hot August summer tourist season. San Marco was packed with throngs of people, but just a short private boat ride away is the St Regis. Gentle breeze almost everywhere on the island was much more pleasant than Venice. Excellent food, great bar, big rooms - but mostly serenity. Loved it.
