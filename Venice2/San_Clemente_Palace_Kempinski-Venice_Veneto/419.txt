We loved the restaurant the morning buffet the room services / cleaning ladies etc. The stuff at the pool was inexperienced for the level of the hotel and the pricing. The food experience was very good and romantic. The room for 400 euro per night was not as fancy as expected. Though the general idea is lovely
