Unfortunately when we checked in we noticed a sign that was clearly for the staff but visible to the guests which read as follows "Upsell August! Target 5000 euro per day" This was not the I expect from this type of hotel! The prices for everything was very high even for a supposedly 5 star hotel we therefore did not eat here for the fear of been disappointed or "Upsold". The location and quality of the hotel property was very good. Big disappointment Kempinski and although I won't discount you I will certainly favour other 5 star hotel groups in future.
