The entire property is gorgeousâ€”but you already know that. What you might not know is that there's a charming bartender named Costi at the hotel bar who also doubles as a magician and will endlessly entertain you. The bar is quiet - we showed up around 11:30pm after dinner and ended up staying there until 1:30am because he was not only making great drinks but also entertaining the entire group of 15 we had with his tricks. He even stayed open later because we were having an excellent time.
