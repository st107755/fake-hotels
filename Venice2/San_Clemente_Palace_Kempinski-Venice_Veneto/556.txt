We had a very nice visit to the San Clemente palace. Rooms are huge, restaurant is nice, and the grounds are stunning. It was very nice after a busy day in Venice to come back to you own secluded island. Shuttle service runs pretty frequently from the docks of the hotel to downtown. The concierge was also very friendly and useful in deciding what activities to do on our visit.
