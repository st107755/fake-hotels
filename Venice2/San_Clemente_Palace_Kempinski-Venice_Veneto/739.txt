Beautiful hotel away from the hustle & bustle of Venice.  Rooms good size and beds very comfy.  Housekeeping very good with turn down service.  Nice clean linen.  the hotel is filled with wonderful scented Lillies throughout.  Nice to sit by the pool after a day out, but temperature of water was a little chilly. One downside is that breakfast can be a bit chaotic, but the staff try hard to keep everything moving.  Would definitely recommend.
