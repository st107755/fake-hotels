The hotel made from an old monastery with a beautiful 15th. Century church inside, is located on a private island only 10 minutes away from San Marco. There are complimentary boats every half an hour. The rooms are big and nicely decorated. Magnificent service. We have eaten in two of the restaurants, both of which were good but Acquerello was exceptional... The breakfast offers so many delicious alternatives that it can satisfy every taste... Strongly recommended
