The San Clemente Palace is on an island a 10-15 minute boat ride from San Marco.  It is a lovely way to experience Venice as one can take the (free) boat shuttle to San Marco into Venice - brave the crowds and return to this beautiful, calm oasis that has no relation to the crowds of Venice.  The property is beautiful, with a swimming pool and lovely grounds.  Children are welcome but somehow did not disturb the calm of the property.  A delightful interlude....
