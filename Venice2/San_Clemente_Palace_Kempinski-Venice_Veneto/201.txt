This is superb place to stay in Venice, especially in the summer months when the crowds make the city centre so frustrating.  One comes home to this haven of tranquility and extraordinary elegance. The staff is so accommodating and Damiano the Maitre'D is a whirling dervish to attention. Don't miss out on a truly splendid opportunity to enjoy  La Serenissima..
