Picked up a really good package here with British Airways. Slightly further from St Mark's but there's a wonderful, complimentary boat shuttle which we used extensively and which made travelling around very easy.  The property itself is outstanding.  Rooms, gardens, pool etc all beautiful and we were fortunate in having some great weather to explore.  It was also so nice escaping St Mark's Square and coming back to the tranquillity of our own island!  We didn't have any full meals at San Clemente except for breakfast which was excellent.  The bar too, was lively and fun although marred for a couple of nights by a large (and loud) conference group.  Our only grumbles would be that service at meal times was sometimes chaotic....ie you were asked repeatedly for the same things orâ€¦
