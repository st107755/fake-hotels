We absolutely adore the uniqueness of Venice but also loved the ability to get away from the masses of people and go back to San Clemente Palace Kempinski and laze by the pool looking at the beautiful old building and gardens while our batteries recharged ready to go into Venice at night which was a very short boat ride on their private shuttle. Whilst the building is grand, the staff are wonderfully friendly and our children were welcomed. A great experience all round.
