We enjoyed the hotel, our room, and experience at San Clemente Palace and Venice. Although the room charge included the cost to and from Venice throughout the day, the cost to the airport  was not included at over 100 euro one way.  The rooms are very nice, a comfortable size, and the service is exceptional. It was nice to be on a separate island as we still had excellent access to the Venice while still having peace and quiet while at the hotel.
