You couldn't believe that within crowded Venice exists such vast and comfortable hotel with the most beautiful gardens, pool, and amazing rooms. 10 min water shuttle available during any time of the day. Things to improve Pool restaurant service is a little slow and wifi needs to re login every 8 hours. Beside that excepcional!!!
