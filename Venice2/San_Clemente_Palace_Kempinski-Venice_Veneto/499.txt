We won a voucher for two nights in this hotel and decided to stay an extra night. It was really worth it. We are in the two restaurants and had drinks at the bar and by the pool. It is a really huge place and you can definitely relax and enjoy time on the island.   The concierge was very helpful to us for what to visit in Venice and where to eat.   The shuttle to San Marco square is very practical as you can get anywhere from there.   The staff is friendly and well organized.   When it is very busy they don't forget about you it may just take a few more minutes until your order arrives.   Totally worth the money and my wife and I will go back when we go to Venice.
