While there are a number of wonderful and well-known hotels in Venice, San Clemente Palace offers a beautiful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the mainland. It is located on an island which is 5-8 minutes by boat from Venice.  You travel to and from the island by hotel-owned and operated launches (the famous Venetian wooden boats). The hotel is lovely and the rooms are very large and elegant. The bar is a fabulous gathering place, the restaurants are very good and the spa is wonderful. You feel as though you are on a private retreat w/ the excitement of Venice at your fingertips. And just to add to the experience, the staff is excellent!
