My daughter and I have just returned from a 4 day trip to the San Clemente to celebrate her 21st birthday. Arriving at the hotel by boat away from the madness of Venice is a treat and the smell of Jasmin as you step off the boat is beautiful. Service from start to finish was superb and thoughtful. A previous review talked about the "muzak" - I have no idea what he was talking about as we found the hotel very tranquil in all areas. My only criticism is that the pool staff put reserved signs on two of the loungers one day and the guests hadn't  appeared by the time we left the pool at 15.00. The pool was busy that day so rather frustrating. Surely it should be a case of first come first served. But in their defense though they did put out extra loungers as needed but not in primeâ€¦
