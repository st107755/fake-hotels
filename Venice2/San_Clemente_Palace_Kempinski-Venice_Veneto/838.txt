Nice location, beautiful garden but the rest is quite disappointing. My room was in a small building behind the church. The path to the building is in a bad shape and dirty with electric cables hanging from the walls. In the small lobby of the building there was a mattress against a wall, walls in desperate need for a painter and the elevator smelled of humidity. Food and service are below average. This hotel does not meet the St Regis quality standards. I am a Starwood Platinum member and I filled out the Starwood review after departure complaining for the quality of the room and I never got a reply back from the hotel management (I always do!). A very disappointing experience.
