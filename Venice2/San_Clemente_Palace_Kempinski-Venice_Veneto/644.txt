The hotel is fantastic for the following reason ;   1. Room was spacious, beautifully decorated with all that a traveller needed 2. The staff in all departments made you feel special  3. The front desk and red ladies were excellent - Waldorf in Rome look out !  4. The head waiter in the breakfast restaurant was the best head waiter in a hotel I have ever seen in action-  ! 5. The hotel was sooooo clean even the pool room after a full days use  6. The little boat that takes you to Venice in 8 mins is sooo good and cool 7. Housekeeping were also excellent no chasing to get the room done !   The staff seemed pleased to be working at the hotel and looking after you  It did not matter if you were the best dressed or causal quest  they really treated you the same   Keep going you areâ€¦
