Today is the last day of our trip to Venice, and so far it has been the most memorable stay for us in the past 10 years of traveling around the world. We have stayed previously at top resorts including the Ritz Carlton, the Four Seasons, the Peninsula, and the Park Hyatt etc. and San Clemente Palace Kempinksi is definitely ranked the top among all the hotels we have experienced. The general manager Alper, Guest Manager Claudia and all the hotel staff have been amazing and making sure our stay is truly memorable.   The property is located on a beautiful island only 10 minute away from Venice by water shuttle (free service by the hotel). The breakfast and dinner we had at the hotel were amazing. This hotel has far exceeded our expectation and it alone has made our trip to Veniceâ€¦
