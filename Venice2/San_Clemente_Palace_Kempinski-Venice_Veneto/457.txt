We enjoyed our stay at St Clemente Kempinski overall. Beautiful hotel situated on a private island with convenient shuttle boat that's available twice every hour. Friendly reception staff and really authentic decor.   We felt however our room was a bit small and the room service was a bit hit and miss. Some days we'd get a turn down service, other days not. We paid for the buffet breakfast, but it really wasn't anything special. In fact, on the last day we were there we were only allowed to sit outside and the staff all seemed too busy to look after you. We felt it was all a bit strange.  We'd probably stay again, but would like to see some improvements in certain areas, so will be keeping a close eye on future reviews
