went to this hotel over the easter period. The hotel is perfect for a wonderful and tranquill holiday. the staff were excellent and the facilities first class.There is a shuttle service every 20 mins to transport you to St Marks square where the whole of Venice seems to be waiting for you!! I reccomend this hotel to every type of holiday maker
