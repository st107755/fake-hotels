What a beautiful hotel in every way and far (15mins) from the madding crowds of Venice in the summer. lovely pool area great gardens great food in the restaurants. service typically Italian, just accept it. Prices of all food and beverage make Dubai look cheap, 500ml beer 14 euro, pizza margarhita 19 euros etc. Special venue.
