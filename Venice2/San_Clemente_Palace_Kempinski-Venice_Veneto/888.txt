Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, we had a lovely time. The location is perfect and a real contrast to the hustle and bustle of San Marco, it is the perfect oasis of tranquillity. The staff are very polite, helpful and attentive to your every need, always seemed willing to do whatever was required to make our stay go smoothly. The room was immaculate, very tastefully decorated and furnished to a high standard. The island is beautiful, it even has its own church which is beautiful and nice to explore while you're waiting on the shuttle. We had a free room upgrade on arrival to a deluxe room with a view.  Breakfast was a little pricey but there was a fantastic spread with the most amazing pastries. I'm already planning my next stay here, can't wait to go back.
