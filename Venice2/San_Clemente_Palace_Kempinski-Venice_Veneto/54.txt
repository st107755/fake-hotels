Visited on a company leadership offsite. The hotel is great, friendly service and beautiful pool area.  Food in the restaurant was sub-standard. Almost no knowledge of Vegan, and what was offered was Pasta with Tomato Sauce! At a 5 star hotel! To make matters worse, the pasta was extremely overcooked and splitting apart. I avoided dining the rest of my stay as I would have thought Italian’s would have known how to make interesting vegan food, and be able to cook the pasta ‘al dente’.  The highlight: Costi the barman who does the most incredible magic tricks I have ever experienced! He is incredible and should definitely be performing on stage!
