Amazing hotel on its own island with transport to St Marks Square every 20 mins. The place is stunning with great gardens and a out door pool. The spa facilities are very cramped,  the treatments were excellence but  expensive. Alcohol is over priced. Dinner was poor with food cold and one plate sent back and the other steak was over cooked. Great place but eat in the bar   Breakfast  fantastic so get up and enjoy.
