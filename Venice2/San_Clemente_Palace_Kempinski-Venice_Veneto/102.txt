What a wonderful time we had as a family at this magnificent property. We were a family of 6 with 3 rooms, everything about each room was wonderful. The service is attentive and the reception staff were a pleasure. the setting of the hotel with its stunning views made for the perfect escape from the Venice crowds. The complimentary shuttle boat was a joy and made our stay. We will be back! Thank you San Clemente.... you truly are something extremely special.
