Spent four nights in an interconnecting room arranged by Carrier for a family of four including two 12 and 10 year old girls.  Seamless transfer by water taxi from Venice airport direct to the hotel via the canals.  Everything about the Hotel is stunning from the corridors, interconnecting rooms, outdoor pool, gardens and restaurants. Very pricey as one would expect but worth the money.   Great place to stay as feels like an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the centre of Venice yet only 15 mins away using the courtesy water boat.   Would definitely return.
