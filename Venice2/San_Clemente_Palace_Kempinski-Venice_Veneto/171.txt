Beautiful resort in the middle of an island! The property has all the facilities , private super boats to transport you to and from Venice city centre. Breakfast spread is good.. They have a great Italian restaurant with wood-fired pizzas! Overall excellent stay here for 5 nights. We had a junior suite which was big
