If you like space away from the hustle and bustle of the Venice crowds then this may be what you are looking for. This island hotel has beautiful gardens and is an oasis from the crowds and the water just a boat trip way. We had a speedboat taxi arranged to and from the airport which makes travel stress free.  The hotel is a grand old monastery with fantastic historic features, chapel, courtyards and gardens and a delightful pool area.  It has a good choice of rooms to suit all wallets. The main restaurant is very good, excellent food, obviously more expensive than many other fine restaurants of Venice main but it has a spectacular view out across the water. The second restaurant near the pool was not so good, the food was so good, it's prices were far too high for the foodâ€¦
