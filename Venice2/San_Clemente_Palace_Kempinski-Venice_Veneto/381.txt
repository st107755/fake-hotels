We have just returned from a five day stay at San Clemente and it was fantastic. The hotel is fantastic and the staff are fabulous and couldn't do enough for us.  The setting is stunning and it's nice to get out of the city at the end of a busy day and relax in the hotel.  There is a complementary water taxi every 20 minutes all day and evening.   We ate in the pool side restaurant and the food was pricey but very good. Pizzas were delicious as was the lobster ravioli !  If we return to Venice I will definitely be booking San Clemente again and highly recommend it.
