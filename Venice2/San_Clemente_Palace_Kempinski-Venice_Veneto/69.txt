We are  a family of eight and had decided to celebrate our Golden Wedding Anniversary lunch  with all the family at the San Clemente Palace which we had previously visited. We had a beautiful circular table in the shade in the gardens. Everyone enjoyed their meal and were delighted with the ice cream cake for sweet which was given to us at the end of the meal.A lovely celebration with good service.  We had drinks in the hotel bar to cool down before our return journey to Venice as it was such a hot day.  We enjoyed the trips to and from San Clemente on the private boat.
