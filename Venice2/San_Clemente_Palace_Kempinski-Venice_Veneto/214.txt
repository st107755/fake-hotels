Incredibly helpful, polite and friendly staff.  A beautiful hotel in a stunning location on a private island, just perfect in every way... The shuttle boat to and from St Marks Square was every half hour and therefore you never had to wait that long either way, it was just so well organised and efficient. Definitely would love to return.
