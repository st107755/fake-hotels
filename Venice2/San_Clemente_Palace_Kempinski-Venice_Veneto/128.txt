We recently stayed at the hotel for four nights for a work incentive trip in the middle of June. Good hotel with nice food and situated in a nice location which is a short distance to the main part of Venice. The staff were very nice especially Costi who ensured we were very well looked after while showing of some very fun magic trips that were quite Cooperfeld esque I might add. Very cool stuff.
