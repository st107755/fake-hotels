We expected 5 star everything, but got 1 star service. The accomodations are outdated and need renovations. The ambience is nice because they have a large sprawling property that overlooks Venice across the water. But the staff are not friendly, not trained well in service, and it shows. The water taxis take forever even when they call them for a specific time, so their shuttle seems better, although it is not that frequent either. Definitely do NOT go here. A waste of your money and you will be angry at their horrific, arrogant, rude service.
