My family and I stayed here for 2 nights after taking a cruise. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. The halls smell of a delicious scent Ii cant even describe. The staff was super accommodating and helpful. The grounds and rooms are wonderful. Its a 10 min ride to San Marco - but its nice and located out of the busy hustle and bustle located on this  little island. The restaurants where closed on one of the evenings and the head chef made us a delectable meal of antipasto , pasta and rib eye.   It was a treat to stay here and will go back whenever in Venice!
