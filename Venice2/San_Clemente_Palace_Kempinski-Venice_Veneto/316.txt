Just a short boat ride away from St. Mark's Square's commotion, is the beautiful setting of the Kempinski Hotel on Isola Di San Clemente.  After staying at the hotel under previous ownership, we were anxious to see how Kempinski would handle this jewel in the lagoon.  The experience could not be more pleasant and enjoyable from arrival, to the dining experiences, to the beautifully appointment room.  The buffet breakfast choices were exceptional, especially when comparing the variety to other hotels worldwide.  It is even better on a warm day when sitting in the courtyard along side a 1000 year-old church.  Dinner is available outdoors, looking out into the lagoon, at a Michelin Star restaurant, or a beautiful pool side restaurant.  The pool area is exquisite as are the viewsâ€¦
