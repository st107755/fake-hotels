The St. Regis San Clemente Palace is such a beautiful, peaceful break from the crowded streets of Venice. We had a fabulous stay at the hotel enjoying the pool as well as the restaurants. Every room has to have a wonderful view as it's on an island and surrounded by gardens. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful in such a kind, sincere way. We traveled with our 6 year old son who was thrilled to have a place to run around and be silly in addition to playing in the pool.
