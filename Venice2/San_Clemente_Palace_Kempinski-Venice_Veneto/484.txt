A wonderful hotel in its own private island and just 10 minutes from Venice, via private water transportation. Everything first class. Excellent quality and service in every aspect. Highly recommended, if you are looking for unique experience. Thanks to their wonderful staff, specially to the Ladies in Red. Carlotta made our stay extremely special.
