Great hotel and on its own island so hotel's own water taxi to San Marco every day which is great and runs all day every 20 mins. Hotel is an old palace with huge corridors and amazing rooms. Great breakfast and grounds which also had artworks displayed as left over from the Bienale. The Ladies in Red left us bubbly and strawberries for our anniversary which was a nice touch. Concierge great at booking restaurants. Great staff. Only minor gripe would be music played outside on terrace & the bar during the day and in background at breakfast which is unnecessary.
