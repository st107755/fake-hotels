Excellent and unassuming restoration of this old monastery with beautiful gardens. It is the only building on the island. Once on the island you literally forget that you are less than 3 miles from the bustling noise of Venice. You may of course visit downtown Venice with a 5 min boat ride offered by the hotel or you may spend a day relaxing on the island enjoying beautiful views and excellent amenities.
