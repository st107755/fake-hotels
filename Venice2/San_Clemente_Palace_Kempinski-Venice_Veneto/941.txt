We stayed five days at The St. Regis Venice San Clemente and had a wonderful experience.  From the upscale facilities to the extremely professional and attentive personnel our vacation was wonderful.  The transportation service to Venice was excellent, the food at the restaurant was lovely, the excellent service provided by the professional staff and the beautiful facility made our holiday enchanting.  We cannot wait to go back again!
