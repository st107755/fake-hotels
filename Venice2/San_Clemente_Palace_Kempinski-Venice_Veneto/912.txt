We spent our 1st wedding anniversary here last weekend of September. Have not anything to complain about only positives, we loved it, several times amazed about the property, the service, the rooms, everything really. Just wandering around the island, going into the church, looking at the decoration and architecture is amazing and having a drink by the water of course. Amazing place, secluded but also very near by shuttle boat to the tourist trap that is Venezia.
