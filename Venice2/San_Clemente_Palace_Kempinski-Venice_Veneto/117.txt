From the airport arrival to the day of leaving everything was smooth and clean. The hotel is a fantastic building with many amenities, the staff were very polite and helpful the choice of breakfast was great. The restaurants and bars were very nice cannot think of a bad moment or food. Would recommend and visit again one day.
