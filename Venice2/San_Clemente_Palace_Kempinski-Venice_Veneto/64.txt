Superb! 5+! Very nice hotel on private island, excellent breakfast, big room, amazing stuff! My favorite hotel in Venice. Location is 10 min by boat from San Marco. Every 30 min you have hotel free of charge transfer. We had garden view room, it was very big, 45 sqm. Green and beautiful territory. Restaurants for dinner was superb, risotto ðŸ‘Œ. Breakfast with huge choices of food-fish, a lot of fruits, soups, even dim sums:). From now and on only Kempinski!
