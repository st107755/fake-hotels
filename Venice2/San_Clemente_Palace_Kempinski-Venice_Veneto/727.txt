Property - Its a beautiful island which use to be a monastery. Rooms are big  and so are the bathrooms. Nicely decorated through out the property. The fragrance  in the lobby is welcoming. The beds are comfortable. For St Regis I simply cannot understand how there is no clock in the room nor a coffee machine. You have to purchase coffee for euro 9 from the bar. There is nothing complimentary for breakfast either. In my years of travelling I have never come across this issue. All 5 star properties have complimentary coffee in lobby if not in room.  Service - We had booked 2 rooms and we arrived at roughly 12:00 pm. 1 room was ready and the other was being cleaned. Anna our butler informed us that as soon as it was ready she would come back with the room key. I GUESS her shiftâ€¦
