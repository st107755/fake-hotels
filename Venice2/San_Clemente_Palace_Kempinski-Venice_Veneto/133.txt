Amazing hotel, by far the best in Venice. Something special about being on your own island. with frequent water taxi service, Beautiful grounds, fantastic food, facilities and staff so helpful couldnâ€™t do enough for you. Especially Costi in the terrace bar who even treated us all to some mind blowing magic tricks, a very talented young man, worth a visit there for that and a drink alone.  Would 100% go back
