It may well be lovely hotel now, but I'm afraid the notion that it's a converted monastery is a myth encouraged by the management. There has been no monastic connection for San Clemente for a very long time. The building you see now was built as a psychiatric hospital in the 1840s, initially for women. It closed in the early 1980s and stood empty for years thereafter (I visited as a researcher before 2017).  There are some famous B&W photos by Raymond Depardon of the asylum and its inmates, if you google 'san clemente venice asylum'.
