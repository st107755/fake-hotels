Away from the hustle and bustle of the city this hotel on an island is a wonderful haven to return to. An elegant interior with well manicured grounds including pool, tennis and pitch and putt as well as pleasant walks. Far better positioned than the much vaunted Cipriani. Attractive bar and outside eating and sitting areas. Excellent staff. A couple of small niggles did not detract from an excellent venue to stay in. See separate review of hotel's Acquerello restaurant.
