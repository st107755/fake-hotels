A five star accommodation through and through. An oasis from the bustle. So peaceful and quiet. From beginning to end, the service was impeccable without pretention. Very international crowd. From old money Euro aristo-types to the provincial German and French bourgeoisie.   The shuttles were these gorgeous wooden vessels and the crew were always consistent and timely (every 30 minutes, only 10 minutes ride). The drop off/pick up point was very conveniently located right on San Marco pier. The rooms were spacious and decadent, if a bit dated but that was part of the charm. The grounds perfectly kept with surprising delights peppered throughout the island, like the private church dating back to 1137. The concierges were super helpful and kind. They helped arrange for our luggageâ€¦
