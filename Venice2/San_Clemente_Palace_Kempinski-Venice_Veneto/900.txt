If you are going to Venice, I can suggest ST. Regis, Venice. It was an amazing experince. At first I really enjoyed to walk over the island. The rooms were big and I was feeling strange in a good mood with the view. The breakfast was really good and the service was great. Also the food and service of Aquarello was great and very romantic. Everbody should taste it. We stayed there 5 days and everyday we were going to centre, in half an hour there were shuttles to the center. It was not a problem to reach the shuttle. At first we hesitated what would happen if we couldn't reach last shuttle even it was late at night. They said no problem, just call us and we will come and pick you up. Ä± have never seen such a nice welcoming. Hope to go there once more.
