Venice was the start of our 12 day trip to Italy. The St. Regis San Clemente Palace was an amazing and unforgettable start! We felt like modern royalty when we were greeted by the hotel's private boat shuttle at St. Mark's Square (classic wooden Chris Craft) for a 10 minute ride crossing the Venice lagoon to the resort. As you approach the island from the lagoon you are immediately taken in. When we arrived at the dock we were immediately greeted warmly by a member of the butler team. As we walked from the dock to the resorts main entrance we felt we had immediately stepped back in time to the 17th century! The courtyards, the grounds and the Palace itself are all simply breathtaking! Our room was beautifully decorated and much larger than expected with a very royal feelâ€¦
