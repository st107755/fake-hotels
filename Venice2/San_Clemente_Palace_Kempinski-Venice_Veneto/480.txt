An excellent hotel in almost every single way. Some small niggles (fine dining always booked and very expensive indeed, informal dining also very expensive -- for Brits thanks to Brexit -- but not enough variety for a 7 day stay. But basically this was a really wonderful hotel, run in an outstanding manner and it ticked each and every box.
