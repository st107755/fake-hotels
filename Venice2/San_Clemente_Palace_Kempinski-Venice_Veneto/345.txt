Quality hotel located on private island about 10 minutes from Venice. Accommodation is set up in a converted 13th century monastery. Rooms a spacious and of quality.   High standard of food and beverages. Plenty of space to walk around. Splendid gardens. An old 11th century church to explore.  Great location way from the hustle of Venice. The hotel provides regular shuttle service every 30 minutes to San Marco via a private launch which very useful. A really peaceful and restful place to stay for a few days.
