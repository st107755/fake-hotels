We booked for a night at this really wonderful, quit and charming place and we like it really, Wonderful garden, nice rooms, sundowner in the garden. Really good, But the prices are incredible high for this time of season in October. The pool was closed, the spa was closed, only the breakfast-room (the same room is also the dining-room) was opened. the service friendly but still in training. For our opinion, at this time they could do much better at this price-level.
