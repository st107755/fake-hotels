Fantastic hotel . Tranquil and peaceful but within a fifteen minute delightful boat ride you are in the centre of St Marks square . Staff were all very helpful. I was concerned about a few reviews I had read about the pool being small and cold but did not find either of these to be a concern for us.we have been to 3 other 5 star properties in Venice and would definitely return to this one .
