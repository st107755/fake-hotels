I had a lovely time at the San Clemente and I would definitely recommend it to all that want to stay in Venice! The island and hotel grounds/rooms are amazing and they upgraded us to a wonderful room with a view of the lagoon. Staff were polite and helpful but service through breakfast could be better.  The breakfast could also have had a wider selection for a five star but it was very pleasant. The evening restaurant was also very good! I would definitely be back!
