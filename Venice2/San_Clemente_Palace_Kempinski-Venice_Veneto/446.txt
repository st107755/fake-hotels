I can't for a minute say this hotel is cheap, it isn't, however, for someone of limited means the experience I encountered at this hotel was truly memorable. The place is just amazing and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. It is not your everyday hotel, it is somewhere to put on a bucket list. The staff were lovely and were helpful in every manner.
