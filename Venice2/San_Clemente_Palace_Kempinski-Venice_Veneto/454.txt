I'd read reviews before coming here, and noted that it was expensive (really? Five star hotel in its own island in the Venetian lagoon? No kidding!) but after our experience, what you pay for is what you get.. we arrived off the train from Milan tired and hot, traipsed through the magic of Venice, arrived in st marks square even hotter and tireder but happy.. if you have to pull suitcases in 32 degree heat then let it be in Venice! The hotel boat was easy to find (thanks to the reviews) and arrived quickly, bringing us to an oasis of peace in the middle of one of the busiest tourist cities in the world. I'd love to know more about this former monastery, but given that we were pretty much the only people around the pool a) swimming and b) then reading books maybe I'm mistakingâ€¦
