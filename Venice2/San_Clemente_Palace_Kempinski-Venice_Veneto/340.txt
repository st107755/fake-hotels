Stayed here in October so it wasn't at the height of the tourist season. Senior management needs to be much more in control.  When we got to our room we found the room was not set up properly, dirty glasses from previous occupants, half eaten jars of nibbles and the toilet brush was filthy. There is obviously no quality control done by housekeeping. It also took 30 minutes for luggage to make a five minute journey from reception to our room.  Breakfast was extremely poor. Although the buffet looked good, items that ran out were often not replaced. However the real problem was with 'hot' items. Sausage, bacon, hash browns, baked beans, scrambled eggs all put in warming trays which obviously did not work. All these items were cold. Anything ordered from the kitchen was served onâ€¦
