We stayed at this hotel in September when it was St Regis property. It was luxurious, elegant, and you felt like living in your own palace! It's a great place to not be in central Venice! We didn't particular like Venice but hotel definitely saved the trip! It's not cheap but worth every penny if you're looking for some quiet, luxurious time away. The breakfast buffet was outstanding too!
