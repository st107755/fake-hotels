The first issue began on the first day with our room. You could hear a loud sharp tapping that would happen eratically all throughout the 4 nights we spent in the hotel. When I told the manager she simply shrugged her shoulders and said "thats strange, I'll look into it". No offer to change rooms. Nothing.  It was the food services provided that was the most irksome however. We would sit down for breakfast and it would take almost an hour for us to be served and when we were served we were almost always (a good 80% of the time) given the wrong food with the wrong dietary requirements (we dont eat meat), my sister was given pork, I was given the wrong dish etc etc when breakfast takes over two hours to complete the hotel doesnt deserves to call themselves 5 stars.  Pleaseâ€¦
