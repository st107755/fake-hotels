Had a wonderful time at this hotel, peacefully located away from the crowds. Genuinely warm and welcoming staff (my thanks to Alessia, Michael and team), great food and service, spacious and well-appointed room, convenient shuttle boat to San Marco. Best of all: thanks to a generous room upgrade, I got to enjoy fabulous lagoon views, making for a truly memorable stay. Canâ€™t wait to come back!
