An interesting property located on St Clemente island. This exquisite property is well put together with fine touches and makes for a fine destination.  The property and rooms are well kept and luxuriously furnished. There is an air of tranquility which gives a welcoming respite from the crowds in Venice. Truly lives up to its historical significance as a sanctuary. The grounds are well kept and is a pleasant evening stroll. The outdoor pool is beautiful in the moonlight. Dinner at the much acclaimed Acquerello was average at best. Beautiful sunset views overlooking Plazza San Marco and excellent service was however not matched by the food.  Still, it is a choice destination and well worth a stay. Special mention must be made of the Head Conceirge who is extremely knowledgeableâ€¦
