The building and grounds of this imposing hotel are truly beautiful. Our approach in our water taxi was breathtaking and the staff who greeted us and checked us in, welcoming, friendly and efficient. The hotel is enormous with high ceilings and wide corridors, decorated simply and elegantly with gorgeous chandeliers and interesting glass cabinets lining the corridors showcasing various items. The setting on a private island is a peaceful, calm haven from a day spent in the hustle and bustle of Venice. I would really really love to give this hotel a 5* but due to a few little niggles and the fact I'm unable to give 4.5* I've had to plump for a 4*. So the good points (of which there are many) as follows; interesting building, beautifully and traditionally decorated. Fantasticâ€¦
