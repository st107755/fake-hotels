This hotel impressed us at every turn. It is located on its own private island with boats to take to to Venice proper. The food offered is some of the best we ate while on our trip. The breakfast buffet is impressive and the food at the restaurant by the pool is incredible - I had the best lobster ravioli ever. I simply can't overstate how good the food was. Our room had high ceilings and incredible floors befitting a castle which it is. If you want to stay in an exclusive, beautiful, hotel that is easily among the finest hotels in the world then this is the place. It is one of the more expensive hotels in Venice but the location away from the crush of tourists provides relief, quiet and privacy most others can't match. Having stayed at other so-called 5 star hotels I think itâ€¦
