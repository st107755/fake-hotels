Verdant and cool, the San Clemente Palace proved the perfect hotel for us - the hotel motor launch delivers and collects guest to and from Venice every half hour (it's only a ten minute ride), the poolside restaurant serves great food amidst the lovely gardens, and the ambiance is grand and yet still welcoming, and sophisticated and altogether quite lovely.  The staff were attentive but not intrusive; the concierge is second to none.   Venice is a wonderful city - but hot and crowded in July, and so returning to the San Clemente Palace in the afternoons was a very welcome respite.  I'd stay again, and again and again and again.  I loved it - and I hope you do, too
