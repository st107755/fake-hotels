situated on an island, they offer a courtesy boat every half hour to San Marco. The venue is magnificent: such a peaceful atmosphere, very friendly staff and wonderful rooms. Breakfast buffet is more than complete. Rooms are spacious with king size beds, courtesy bottled water, newspapers, turndown service... There is vast pool area on the island with comfortable beds.Concierges are very helpful and propose courtesy boats to Murano/Burano. Stroll along the island and find hidden places to relax, read, admire the sunset. Don't miss the church! We had a room with laguna view, worth it!
