I can not describe how beautiful this place is, no pictures can translate the magical feeling you get when you pull up in your water boat to this stunning hotel, we had the most fantastic time ever and every single member of staff were polite, helpful, knowledgable and immaculate, the food was out of this world and every attention to detail was noted.  I was so upset to leave...I could live here forever   Thank you again for a splendid and pleasant stay.  Mrs gain
