Exclusive location:  San Clemente is an island of peace just 10 minutes ride by shuttle boat service from the crowds in renowned San Marco square. Lush gardens adjacent to rinascimental San Clemente church is all so fascinating.  Rooms : The silence of an antique monastery, furnished with good taste (rinascimental venetian style). High roofs and spacious rooms. Courtesy bathroom set by Ferragamo added that extra touch.   Seaview swimming pool with state of the art sunbeds, wellness club, a choice between 3 restaurants and laguna view bars renders it a perfect romantic setting in probably the most romantic of all cities  (Venice)
