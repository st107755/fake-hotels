We stayed for 3 nights in San Clemente Palace Kempinski.. We have stayed in various 5 star resorts, but typically there would be a few shortcomings... I struggled to find major shortcomings during our stay. If I really have to pick something, it would probably be the lack of gym facility - the one on site was too small, but obviously I totally understand that gym would be the last thing anyone would do in Venice!! The island is amazing - located out of the hustle and bustle of St Mark's square. The shuttle to the private island takes about 10 minutes, but my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the shuttle experience - the view is absolutely breathtaking. Service in the hotel was first class, the European design of the room was charming and the walk to the bedroom was like goingâ€¦
