After many years I come back to Venice just to remind me of the beauty of this incredible city. But, unlike the first time, I decide to book an hotel not in the city center. The choice could not be better, the San Clemente palace is located on a private island only 10 min away by boat from piazza San Marco, well connected by complimentary boats running all the day. The hotel, now run by Kempisky is amazing, the staff is helpful, friendly and well trained. The room was spacious and comfortable, bathroom with marble all around looked new and well cleaned, every detail was perfect. Last but not the least, the property features a 3 holes golf course, tennis courts, kids club and a pool with a bar where you can chill out after a long day spent visiting museums and galleries.
