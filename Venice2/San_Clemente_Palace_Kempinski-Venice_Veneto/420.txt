We stayed in a lovely room overlooking the river , champagne greeted us when we arrived , bathroom amenities and everything you could think of , bed very comfortable , breakfast was lovely outside and so was the dinner , the hotel had a private taxi to take us to the main Venice , would definitely be back couldn't fault the hotel service and staff very good ,
