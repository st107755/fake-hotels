We stayed for one night at the San Clemente; their final night before closing for the winter.  The St. Regis is the only property on the island of San Clemente, and is a 15 minute water taxi ride south of the main islands.  The hotel is unique to Venice - its really specious and has wonderful views of the lagoon; we had great rooms with great views.  There are extensive grounds and a really nice out-door pool.  The St. Regis runs a free boat service to the main islands every 30 minutes - so access is easy.  The rooms are spacious, and the staff very attentive.  We had a lovely (albeit expensive) lunch by the pool, and breakfast was also great.  If you fancy visiting Venice, but want to stay somewhere away from the hustle and bustle - San Clemente is perfect.  If you stay thereâ€¦
