San Clemente is beautiful, the staff is friendly and eager to please.  The only exception is the waitstaff and Captain for outdoor lunch and drinks around the pool.  They are extremely confused and unprofessional. When we questioned what happened to our order after 20 minutes we were told it was mistakenly delivered to another group of people.  The boat to & from Piazza San Marco runs on an irregular schedule every 30-40 minutes and the trip takes about  15 minutes. Missing a boat in either direction easily causes nearly an hour wasted  Unless you will be staying an extended time and making a lot of use of this beautiful hotel's facilities, the island location isn't worth the time wasted traveling back and forth
