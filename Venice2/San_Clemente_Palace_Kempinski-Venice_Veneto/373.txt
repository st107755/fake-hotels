From the moment we stepped onto the complementary boat everything was amazing. Loved the pool and my husband loved the gym. Our room was amazing and breakfast was lovely. We also eat at the pool bar and hotel restaurant which was splendid. Boat was never full and ran on time. After the hustle and busker of Venice great to go back to the hotel. Could not fault anything and would return. Hotel grounds are lovely with lots of outdoor seating to soak in all the 369 degree views. Would highly recommend. We visited for 3 nights in September. Did not have time fir Soa treatments but looked loveky. Hotel gave my husband a great birthday cake and organised bubbles for Anniversary.
