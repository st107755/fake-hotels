An amazing stay in a private island , just  10 minutes away from Venice.  Very happy to be away from the crowd of Venice but still to enjoy  the city in a very luxury way. Perfect service, great food, clean rooms, excellent bar, very enjoyable stay... I would highly recommend this gem to everyone who would like to enjoy this fabulous city in a very special atmosphere. Special thanks to the General manager of the hotel who made our stay unforgetable
