We are staying for 3 days in the San Clemente Palace. They upgraded us to the Marco Polo Suite a very large Suite with waterviews from all the windows. Nice large bathroom and large bedroom.Very nice very large Breakfast buffet ! We arrived late at night and had a beautiful ride from the airport without any traffic. Very nice Pool area nice Restaurant next to the Pool ! Unfortunately we did not manage to get a Reservation at the Aquarello Restaurant. Easy Ride by boat to San Marco, Murano or anywhere by Taxi.
