The hotel was beautiful, so relaxing to come back to after exploring venice. It is on a small Island 15 minutes on a complimentary shuttle boat to St. Marco square. All the staff were so friendly, the room was comfortable, service impeccable.The poolside is so relaxing with bar service and small restaraunt. The food and drinks are very expensive- although I suppose you are staying in a 5 star hotel. There are no tea/coffee facilities in your room so a captive audience as coffee is about 9 Euros , the water in the mini bar about 7 euros!! However it felt like pure luxury and there are so many more economical restaurants in central venice. There is a water taxi service to visit murano Island which is well worth a visit. Water taxis generally can be more expensive or the vaperttosâ€¦
