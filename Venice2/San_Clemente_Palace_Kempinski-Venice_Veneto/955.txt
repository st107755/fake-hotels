We also had a nice bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with the complements of the management - a nice touch! The rooms were spotlessly clean and the room service unobtrusive. Massively wide hotel corridors with chandeliers and elegant tapestry’s  on the walls. The location is ideal on its own island with a courtesy shuttle boat every 20 mins during the day from Piazza St Marco. The journey only takes 15 mins and is a very relaxing way to travel back to your room after…
