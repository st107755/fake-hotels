The hotel is situated on an island about 8 minutes by launch from San Marcos Square  in the heart of Venice.  The shuttle operates every 30 minutes between the hotel and Venice' main island.  The hotel is elegant and superbly staffed.  The food is great.  The hotel is fairly large with large rooms and magnificent corridors that lead to beautifully landscape grounds and gardens. Venice is crowded most of the year with cruise ships dropping of thousands of visitors weekly.  San Clemente Island is not crowed but quiet and secluded yet the action is only just a few minutes away by hotel yacht.
