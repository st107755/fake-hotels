I stayed here for 4 nights. The property has one of the best settings in the World. The facility has been recently renovated and it has everything what needed to become an outstanding luxury hotel. Except the management and the service. In the restaurant they fail to bring what you ask for, the waitress yells at you and the staff does not speak in English. The concierge rips you off (more and far more obviously than he should) and forgets to do what you ask for, the famous Kempinski breakfast is just not served. The waiter brings you bread hard like stone (literally), coffee instead of tea, sausage when you asked for egg. If it does not happen to me I do not believe it! The management pretends they care but finally you have the impression that they do not really do. For me neverâ€¦
