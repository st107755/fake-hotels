The property is excellent and service impeccable.  But the place is a tad bit out of the way and inconvenient to easily enjoy Venice, reasons you came there for.  Stayed there only for a night, thank God, and moved to a hotel closed to San Marco.  The island where the hotel is located does not have any kind of activities to enjoy the area at all.  If you want to stay away from Downtown Venice, you may as well stay in Lido and enjoy the beach and other activities.  Think St Regis, as going in a upscale place of isolation.
