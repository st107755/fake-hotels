The location looks very nice but if you are expecting a good service, please pass your way. Boat transfer is the best point of this hotel as always on time. Room decoration is minimum, not elegant. Service is very amateur. Food quality is very low. The little church at the entry is very nice just because Kempinski do not have the autorisation to change anything.
