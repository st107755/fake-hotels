We stayed here in August 2018. We got a great deal online and it was obvious this impacted our service throughout our stay. We were put in a room that was at the far end of the upper floor which was quite a walk away from anything including the elevators.  The door to our room was at the top of the service stairs which had a loud door at the bottom of it. We were woken up every morning at 5am with loud banging as the door was open and shut. After mentioning this to the front desk, instead of them moving our room, they closed the fire doors that led to our hallways which didn't help at all. Instead we spent our much needed vacation being woken up every 5 minutes from 5am and on. The staff hardly seemed to care at all. The one thing they said they'd do would do is comp our drinksâ€¦
