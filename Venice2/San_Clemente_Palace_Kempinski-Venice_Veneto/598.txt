Ok I admit it. I am addicted to Venice. I love the hedonistic existence of great food, great wines, and great views! The only problem is the crowds. St Marks Square is probably one of the most beautiful spots in the world; were it not for the throngs of tourists dumped off by the multitude of cruise ships that arrive around 7am and depart at the end of the day or worse, stay over night.  I have stayed at all the top hotels in Venice and finally found the best..The San Clemente. Imagine, being whisked away from the insanity of the crowds in a high speed boat and arriving at a lush quiet island with manicured grounds and nothing but the sound of birds and the water lapping on the docks.  Everything at the San Clemente is perfect, the service,the food the rooms. But where to start?â€¦
