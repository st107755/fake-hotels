Great gorgeous spot to avoid summer crowds. Our room was upgraded from a grand deluxe to a junior suite. Beautiful grounds. Recommend the breakfast package - everything any one could imagine for breakfast - even champagne. Boats run very often to San Marco. Boat docks at the San Zacarria stop. Delicious food, superior service. Beautiful pool and walking paths.
