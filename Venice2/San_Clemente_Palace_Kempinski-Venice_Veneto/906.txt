We stay on our Honeymoon trip, Fabulous property on it's own private island. What an incredible setting, with easy boat service to San Marco every 30 minutes all day long. After taking the public water taxi from Santa Lucia train station we exited at San Marco and the St Regis boat service was only one bridge away. Arriving to the Resort and being greeted by Alexsandra was easy and a delight. The grounds are beautiful, the pool was quite and relaxing, with an attached bar, Antonio, the Barman, was attentive our every need. We even played tennis on their private courts. The entire island is for St. Regis guest only. And with the ease of transportation to Venice it left us believing this property has the potential to be one of World's Great Resorts. It is however a new propertyâ€¦
