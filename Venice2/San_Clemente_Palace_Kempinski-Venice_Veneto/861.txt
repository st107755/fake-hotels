This is not a St. Regis.  Plenty of staff that for the most part stand around and do nothing.  Concierge staff--Ok   Housekeeping staff some of the poorest I have ever seen.  We had 5 rooms for our family and none of them were cleaned properly.  Old glasses left in the room for 2 days and also the smell of raw sewage in the first floor rooms.   Restaurant very good for breakfast but that is all.  The exclusive restaurant on the property serves food that has very little appeal.  Kids 8-18 hated it.  Adults found the food a bit too difficult to handle (pasta with rabbit sauce)???  Give me a break, this is Italy and the menu should have some traditional meals prepared in the traditional manner.  I guess this is why even the concierge staff do not recommend the restaurant and whyâ€¦
