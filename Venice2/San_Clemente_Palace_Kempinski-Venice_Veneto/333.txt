We have to admit, that this place is just plain creepy.  It has a lovely grounds where you can do some running and exercise, but the place can't escape it's past as a mental institution and place for people with the plague.  That withstanding, it has great service and meals, an impressive grounds, pool and escape from the hustle and bustle of the main island of Venice.
