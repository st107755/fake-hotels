A great place to get away from crowded Venice and still have access. The hum of the locusts and the lush lawns with enormous trees makes it a truly magical place. The grounds are impeccable. Great large rooms with comfortable beds.   Kids loved the lovely pool but mostly adults....yet totally kid friendly.
