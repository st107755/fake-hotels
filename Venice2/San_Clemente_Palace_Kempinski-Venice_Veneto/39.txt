This palace is incredible. It's big, very big, and extremely comfortable. The grounds are incredible and we enjoyed just wandering around the property and in the chapel. The water transport to Venice is included and they move on a 30 minute schedule. Very convenient. If you have an early departure to the airport you will need a direct water taxi as the service to Venice does not start until 9:40AM and then you still need 70 minutes on the water taxi to the airport. To make our flight we had to travel direct to the airport at a cost of 115 Euros. That seemed a little expensive to me as the water taxi is only 13 Euros. The dining room is expensive but the quality of the food is very, very good. Hey, it's a palace so of course the food is expensive. We had a wonderful diningâ€¦
