We loved the pool area, which is so rare in Venice. The ease of the shuttle to St. Mark's Square could not be beat! Whether couples are looking for a romantic getaway or families looking for more space, this is the an amazing resort. So much history, yet all the modern conveniences, like air condition, large bathrooms, good closet size. The service was genuine.
