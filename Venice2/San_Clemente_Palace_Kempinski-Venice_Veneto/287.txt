This is a fine hotel and the quality and service was extremely high, as you might expect. The grounds and pool area are kept immaculately. I would definitely recommend this place and the reviews and website speak for themselves, so here are my tips:  Generally, room sizes in European cities are small. The rooms here are bigger than average (but not large) and lots of  them have a water/lagoon view. We upgraded to a better room with a view and we weren’t sorry.   The hotel is on its own island. This gives exclusivity but can have some drawbacks.  There are excellent complementary shuttle boats to and from San Marco approx every 30 min for guests. This is a very efficient service however there is an hour at lunchtime and teatime where the boats stop. The hotel do provide schedules…
