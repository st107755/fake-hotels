Venice is a feast for the eyes but the throngs of tourists are overwhelming. One of my favorite ways to travel is to be within easy striking distance of the attraction but have a serene and relaxing refuge to escape to when desired. The entire San Clemente island is the palace and it fills that prescription with grace and style.   If I were in Venice for a quick romantic overnighter, I would choose the Danieli for its overwhelming charm but for a longer stay I really appreciate the palace.
