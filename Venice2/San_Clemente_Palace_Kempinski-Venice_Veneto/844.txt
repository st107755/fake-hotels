When and how does the St. Regis decide which hotel or resort is allowed to be a St. Regis??  San Clemente is a miss. Beautiful property, pool , garden, lobby but then we went to our room, walking by the "electrical , machine and what else"  section our room is nex to it. No need to describe cramped, noisy and  housekeeping dirty sheets piled up by the elevator for who knows how long. Lunch by the pool restaurant was , am sorry to say, disgusting and so was the service. A screaming concierge upon check in and check out,  honestly could not wait to leave.
