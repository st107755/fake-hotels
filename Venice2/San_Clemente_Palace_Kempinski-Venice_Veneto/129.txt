We had a great stay, good concierge recommendations and enjoyed it immensely  Then we left a bag on departure. We called and got no response to our fast same day request to check our room for the lost bag. We have called from our current hotel, we have emailed multiple times to multiple email addresses and had no response. So our high end items are still at the hotel and we are unable to get them back. This is such incredibly poor service at any hotel let alone one with a strong brand
