The San Clémente Palace Kempinski is a fantastic resort a about 15 minutes away from Piazza San Marco. The hotel offers complimentary boat transfers about every 20 minutes. The whole island is the hotel, fantastic historical Landmark, superb park, beautiful pool area, a great place for a romantic escape to one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Fine dining also available.  I’ve seen people jogging in the Park in the morning.  The hotel is a grandiose palace and has amazingly long and wide hallways. There is a separate building for meeting spaces.  I unfortunately didn’t manage to enjoy…
