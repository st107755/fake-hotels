We had the pleasure of visiting this great landmark an absolute  jewel  it was an old monastery converted to a hotel with magnificent sunsets there are several restuarant's on the island ,the breakfast are good the rooms are spacious definitely one of the better hotels in the area ,staff are friendly grounds are huge pool area is lovely the bar / restaurant is great for snacks their pizza's are divine ,service good .There is complementary  boat from the hotel to St Marks Square I loved this hotel I would definitely come back .Word of advice if you are going to eat at the hotel book restaurants in advance
