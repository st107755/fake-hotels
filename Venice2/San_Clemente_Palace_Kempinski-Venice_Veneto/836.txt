I'm giving this hotel 4 stars but it could easily be 5 with some attention to detail.  First why should you want to be in a hotel on its own island that you have to take a 15 minute boat ride to get to St Mark's Square? Maybe you don't but it was well worth it for us.  There were about 10 hotels on our list for Venice as we planned our trip last minute but all were booked for a family of four. We went back and forth on the location of the St Regis and finally a friend's mother said she had stayed there and it was a great respite from the heat and crowds of Venice in July so we booked it.  We are so glad we did.  You really don't want to go to Venice in July.  It's incredibly humid and there are endless waves of tourists.  But we wanted to go to Italy and for so many with kids itâ€¦
