My husband took me on a surprise 50th birthday break to Venice & booked this hotel for our 4 night stay. The hotel is stunning, all the staff were polite & very helpful & our room was lovely. It wasnâ€™t warm enough to use the outside pool when we were there but we did have lunch at the Dolce restaurant on arrival which is next to it. The pool area was lovely and I would imagine in the summer is very popular. We also ate in the main restaurant one evening and the food and service was 5*.   The complimentary boat service into Venice ran every 30 minutes and was no hassle.   I would definitely recommend a stay in this hotel.
