The St. Regis brand is somewhat overrated.  This property is no different.  It is physically imposing and certifiably beautiful.  Wide hallways and beautiful decorating.  The grounds are equally nice, with a beautiful pool area.  The flaws are in the rooms. When we checked into this fairly new property the AC was not working properly, the safe did not close, there are virtually no drawers to store clothing, and lastly the shower water pressure is weak and the water temperature neve remains constant.  Lastly, the service people are either very friendly or totally standoffish.  The Fitness Room is just that.  A small room with virtually no machines and the TV on my treadmill did not work.  The property is beautiful, just flawed.
