We stayed at the San Clemente Palace for four nights and booked two connecting rooms. The rooms have nice decor and are spacious. The beds are quite big with a grand en suite bathroom. The rooms were definitely not a disappointment.  The facilities around the hotel were good. The pool is large and there is lots of space around the outside of the pool. However, there did not seem to be enough beds when the pool was very busy which was a little but irritating. In addition, whilst the staff were very friendly, there were no actual pool attendants to cater for the guest. Whilst there were a few lifeguards who were happy to help when called upon, there were no designated people to help with the moving of beds or to offer drinks.   The staff were very helpful and friendly throughoutâ€¦
