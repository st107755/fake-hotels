Spent three nights, wish it had been longer! Obviously a very high end hotel....... but never felt stuffy and pretentious..... staff all extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Rooms were spacious.......and quiet, which for a very light sleeper, as myself was a absolute godsend... Thanks to all the staff for being so professional in sometimes the most 'difficult' guest situations.... And a personal thank you to Alice......sommelier! who looked after us on our last. night and looked after us and made sure our last night was very special....... Steve n Barbs
