To whom it may concern,  Here are some pointers for the GM of this hotel who seems to have no control over what is going on (or wrong) in this so called exclusive establishment.  1. Make sure to hire people who have a sense and understanding of what customer service actually is, especially in the hospitality sector. Do not hire staff who offer no help whatsoever with loading baggage onto the boat from San Marco.. people had to load their prams and multiple bags and suitcases onto the boat themselves without the staff on the boat lifting as much as a finger.  2. Opening just one of several restaurants for dinner during peak season in summer is short-sighted to put it mildly, especially when it is then overbooked and there aren't any tables left to accommodate all of the hotelâ€¦
