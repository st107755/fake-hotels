The hotel were very kind as they spelt mine and my sisters name in icing and sweets and of course SHORTBREAD! I was expecting the room to be small but no it was HUGE so huge I felt like I was in a suite! The food was ðŸ‘Œ. Best hotel in Venice by FAR! My favourite thing is that it is on its own island and is massive I absolutely love it! I was a tiny bit upset that the pool closed in autumn as we just arrived in the first week of autumn! Sleep comfort was probably the best out of every hotel Iâ€™ve been to and trust me Iâ€™ve been to lots! We had just come of from the Orient express and was very easy to get to! This was an unforgettable experience that I will never forget!
