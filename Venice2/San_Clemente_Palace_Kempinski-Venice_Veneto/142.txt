Absolutely beautiful hotel, stunning gardens, upscale attention to detail and away from the crowds.  San Clemente will take care of your needs, arrange a taxi transport from the airport or train station.  The free boat to and from the island is easy and specific to guests.  Once in Venice the masses of people are overwhelming, with 4 cruise ships in port during our stay.  I couldnâ€™t imagine attempting to carry luggage through the people, over stone walkways, and canal bridges.  The breakfast had many options for all as we were a family of two sets of grandparents and one teenager.  The room was an upgrade for us, large two room suite with beautiful views and a huge closet and bathroom.   Luxurious and quiet!   I highly recommend this option for a stay in Venice!
