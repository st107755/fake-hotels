My wife and I spent one week at the San Clemente Palace and had a wonderful experience.  The hotel is grand, the rooms spacious and comfortable, and the staff very friendly and helpful.  The setting is spectacular, and the grounds are beautiful.  It was magical to take the hotel launch to the city and back.  Venice is spectacular, but it was great to retreat to this wonderful island hotel after a dayâ€™s sightseeing.  I would love to return to this hotel.
