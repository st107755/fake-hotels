Some surprises at arrival; the spa, the heated pool and the casual restaurant nearby the pool (where they say you could have gotten the best pizza in Venice) were closed from our day of arrival (November 1st) on. The rooms including bathroom (at least our room) were only heated in the morning and the evening. Not nice when you already arrive with a cold. Apart from that a very well led hotel, very kind and helpful staff that knows its business, excellent restaurant, excellent roomservice, superb breakfast, nice room, very neat hotel.
