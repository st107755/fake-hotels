We have just returned from this lovely Hotel.  We picked it for our 35 wedding Anniversary, when we arrived there was a lovely bottle of wine and fruit in our room with a card from the staff and  on the morning of our anniversary the hotel delivered a plate of lovely biscuits and truffles to our table.  How ever we have stayed in a lot of top quality hotels in Italy and have mostly taken half board because  generally the food is of a very high standard. And we like quality food.  On this occasion we were sadly disappointed by the food.  The hotel did everything they could to make it right, as it was quite obvious when a piece odd fillet steak is full of grizzle and a medium burger is rare. But generally the food was not of the standard we usually expect from a hotel of thisâ€¦
