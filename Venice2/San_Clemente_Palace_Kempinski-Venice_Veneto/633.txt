This was one of the most incredible places I've stayed - and the perfect place to retreat to after the hustle and bustle of Venice (or to spend a day relaxing by the pool!). Just a ten minute boat ride from San Marco (via the regular, complimentary hotel boat), San Clemente Palace Kempinski is gorgeous. Our room had views over the landscaped gardens and lagoon, and was beautifully decorated and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent (we loved starting the day by the herb garden) and we also enjoyed pasta for lunch at the casual La Dolce restaurant. We had dinner one evening at Acquerello (the hotel's fine dining restaurant) and I would be surprised if it doesn't receive a Michelin star in the coming year. I would recommend staying at San Clemente to anyone visiting Veniceâ€¦
