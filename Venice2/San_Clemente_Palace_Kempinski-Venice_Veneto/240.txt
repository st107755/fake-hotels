I will happily rewrite this review if our break gets better but it’s not been the greatest of starts.....  We arrived yesterday for our anniversary combined with birthday treat upon arrival a pre authorised payment was taken as reception claimed I hadn’t already paid for the hotel. After scrambling through online statements I reassured myself and then back to reception to explain we had already paid. First night and the air con made a loud banging noise every time it reached optimum. when it turned off or on again the noise was horrendous so a terrible first nights sleep. They are due to fix it today so fingers crossed!!  Thunderstorms last night we went to eat by the pool and was told by the main waiter we have NO space ! No apology or advice on where the other restaurants are…
