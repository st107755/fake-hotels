Stayed for 4 nights and this hotel delivers the wow factor from the moment you arrive , we decided on a private water transfer and arranged this beforehand with the hotel. The  hotel and grounds are beautiful and there is a relaxing pool area , staff are very friendly and attentive. Breakfast has an excellent choice and everything from a full breakfast to fruit and cereal. The hotel is ideal as you can visit the hustle and bustle of Venice then 10 minutes by the hotel shuttle boat and you have peace and quiet.  Nothing bad to say , yes drinks and food are expensive but thatâ€™s life these days... Italy is not cheap  Would highly recommend
