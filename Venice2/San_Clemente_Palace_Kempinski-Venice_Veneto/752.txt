The hotel is a 10/15min boat ride from Piazza St Marco, on an island about 2km south of the main part of Venice. A free boat shuttle is provided every 30min from 9AM... However, during our stay, there was a wedding event at the hotel, and the shuttle was filled up as lots of guests were returning at the same time - we therefore had to take a water taxi (60EUR) back to the hotel. The 10-15min boat ride in itself is pleasant, but can get a bit tiring after a few days - so if you decide to go there, please keep in mind you will be isolated from the rest of town.  Upon arrival, the hotel staff offered to carry my luggage - I had a small carry on and a laptop bag. I said I would take care of my bag - as I generally do not like to have the staff carry it so as not to wait in the roomâ€¦
