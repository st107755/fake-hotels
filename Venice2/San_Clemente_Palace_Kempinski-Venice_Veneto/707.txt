After reading a lot of reviews we did enjoy our stay at the St Regis.  You do have to take a boat in and out of town which at times can be full.  The dock manager at the St Regis worked very hard to keep things moving on time.  The hotel is lovely, clean and newly renovated.  The service can be a little slow, however, we will return.
