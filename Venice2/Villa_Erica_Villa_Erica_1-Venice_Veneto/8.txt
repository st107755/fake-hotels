Exceptional value for money. The rooms in this hostel/hotel are super clean, very tasteful and modern. Itâ€™s less than a 10 min bus ride into Venice and the bus stop is right outside. Very friendly and helpful staff - nothing too much trouble. There are a couple of decent restaurants nearby and be sure to buy a 3 day bus/boat pass from the local tobacconist.
