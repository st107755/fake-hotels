My wife and I stayed 3 nights in this truly exceptional villa. Entering the building the smell of Jasmine is the first thing one notices. It follows a very modern, tastefully designed building, rooms and dinning area. The quality of the equipments and consumables are very high and cleanliness is just perfect. We were warmley welcomed by Lucia and provided with everything necessary for our stay. The parking is ample, gated and free believe or not. 5km from airport and 6 km from Venice just perfect. Quiet with plenty of good authentic restaurants around. In our book the villa and service is 10 out of 10.
