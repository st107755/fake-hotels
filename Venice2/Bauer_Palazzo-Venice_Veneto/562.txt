A Beautifull hotel, which is central to most things. Staff here are very courteous & friendly. Loved our spacious room, almost looking over the Grand Canal, the furnishings all co-ordinating. Lovely comfortable bed. Breakfast was great, couldn't have been nicer. Soya Milk included, which pleased my husband. As this was our first visit to Venice , we did a lot of sightseeing,, but would have loved To have had a bit more chill out time in the Baeur. Allways next time !!!  We reality loved our stay here, and will be back.
