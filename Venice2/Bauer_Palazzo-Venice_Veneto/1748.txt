Il palazzo bauer is in desperate need of a makeover starting with the staff and including the rooms!  The hotel is not worthy of "the Leading Hotel of the World" status, do not eat at the hotel restaurant which is suggested by the concierge, whom has the personalty of a doormat.  For a hotel which charges $1,700.00 euros per night, you expect certain amenities (and clean rooms)!!!!  On the plus side (the only one) the location is superb!
