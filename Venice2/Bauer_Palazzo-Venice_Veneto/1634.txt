This was our second time at the hotel and we appreciate the location and privacy.The 7th floor breakfast room offers excellent buffet and terrific views of the Canal.. The room was spacious but the rugs should be replaced and the housekeeping department could do a better job. All in all a good place to stay, but could use a good cleaning.
