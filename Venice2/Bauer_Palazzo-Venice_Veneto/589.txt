This is a nice hotel, very antique, I expected a better room for a five star hotel, we were set at a buiding on the side of the main buiding were the lobby is. The bathroom was nice and confortable, ir also had a walking closet, and good complemental amenities. The decoration was old and to crowded. Anyway the hotel is well located and with very good service. Its a good option for Venezia
