We travelled to Venice to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary and boked this hotel for its location and quality, on both fronts we were not disappointed.    The reception staff, concierge were all very polite and accommodating.  The room is lovely - décor was classy, well maintained and clean.  The room size could have been bigger but smaller rooms are a common pattern in Europe.  The breakfast is pretty decent.  You are offered a good variety of options to choose from.  Once again staff were great.  I only had one issue during my stay that baffled me.  I had asked for an iron and board only to be told 'due to health and safety and fire' we cannot offer you one and to use the laundry service.  I found this I little ridiculous, having stayed at various exclusive 5 star hotels…
