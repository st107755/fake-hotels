This review is very late - I didn't even feel like writing anything after the horrible bad experience.    We stayed here for 2 nights during August 2013 before shifting to the Gritti Palace.  It was meant to be a special birthday trip and based on the reviews on Trip Adviser and even a travel magazine, how wrong can one go right ?  Well, we were certainly wrong !  We arrived from Florence late at night and checked into this hotel.  It was rather strange as they put us into a really small room and the toilets had splotches of white stuff all over.  We complained and the excuse given was that the room had a nice view and we could choose a bigger room but without a view.  We felt there must be something wrong as we paid a lot for the room and the room looked like a 3star hotelâ€¦
