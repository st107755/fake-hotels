I booked the Bauer il Palazzo because it was rated well in our travel book.  For the money, we booked a great hotel but the cheapest room they offered.  The room included a fantastic daily breakfast on the roof deck.  Our room was spectacularly beautiful and large but lacked a shower and just had a tub.  My husband is not a small man- it was a challenge for him in 90 degree weather to feel clean.
