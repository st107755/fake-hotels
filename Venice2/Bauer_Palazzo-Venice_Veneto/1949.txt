I booked my stay in the Bauer Hotel because of its being used for the interior shots in Nicholas Rhodes wonderfully creepy "Don't Look Now"... I mean, that Julie Christie scene - oh sorry about that... that's a completely different review... So, I didn't really care what the hotel had to offer... well, I thought I didn't... BUT - the place, the room, the location, the staff... EVERYTHING shined so brightly that I fell in love with the place... even if it had never been a movie set!  I was initially disappointed in my room's location, feeling it must be over the kitchen or something, because of all those weird bumping noises I kept hearing... AND, I was supposed to have a canal view room... Well - idiot that I am!  The bumping noise was Gondolas tapping against their moorings...â€¦
