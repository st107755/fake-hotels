Perfect location! Perfect service! Perfect everything! Pricy but you pay for perfection-:) Thanks to the concierges (all of them) for being the heart and soul of this amazing palazzo!  Be careful not to book the Bauer which is attached to the Palazzo but not Venezian style (very modern but nice). The breakfast is all you could dream of! You can even have prosecco!  Thanks for being true !
