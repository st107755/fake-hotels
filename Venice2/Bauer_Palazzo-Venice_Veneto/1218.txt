After trying several different hotels in Venice, we decided for this one. Breakfast is quite good, but the rooms are very, very nice for the price, good space for 3. Staff is ok, helpful and concierge knowledgeable. Access and location is perfect, it compensates the Venice channels view, if you decide to choose a room without it. We will keep on returning.
