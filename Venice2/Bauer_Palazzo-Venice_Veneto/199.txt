The only place to stay if you want to be dropped off by speedboat from the airport at the door - great experience. The hotel is well decorated with very comfortable rooms, there is a spa available via a short trip in the hotels water taxis though on this occasion we did not visit. Breakfast buffet very good and you can eat on the terrace (spectacular views) if the weather is fine. The outside bar is also great for views though drinks are what you might expect for a 5 star hotel. I would also recommend a visit to the 7th floor as there is also a rooftop terrace with some of the best views in Venice - I got the feeling the hotel was not exploiting this area as much as they could as I felt very few people knew of its existence.
