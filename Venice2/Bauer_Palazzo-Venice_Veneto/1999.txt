After 2 weeks traveling Italy at 3* & 4* hotels this was a much needed 5 *accomodation. The accomodations & service of this hotel on the Grand Canal were fantastic. We arrived probably looked a little worn from our trip from Florence but you wouldn't know if from the friendliness of the reception staff. Our baggage was promptly removed from our possesion and taken over by the helpful staff of the Bauer as soon as we arrived and delivered to our upgraded room in the Palazzo promptly.  We found luxurious bedding, fluffy terry robes and slippers upon arrival as well as a well furnished room with large bath and yes a real honest to goodness HAIRDRYER!!! The only one I found decent enough in Italy to dry my heavy mane. The bed like most in Italian hotels was 2 singles pushed togetherâ€¦
