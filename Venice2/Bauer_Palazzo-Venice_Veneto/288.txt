So we're walking back to Campo di Santo Stefano and our hotel from a visit to St. Mark's Basilica, and when we get to the Church of Saint Moses (just gorgeous), our companions ask if we want a late lunch or early dinner at the terrace restaurant of the top-ranked Bauer hotel, right where the Grand Canal opens into the Basin near St. Mark's Square. Sure, we say, even though we were dressed very casually. It was about 2:30pm, and the staff treated us as if we were royalty (as they did the couple at the next table, whose shirt (his) and blouse (hers) probably cost more than our monthly mortgage payment). It cost us 60 euros to have one salad, one antipasto, a glass of wine, a shared dessert and coffees - and we thought this budget buster was worth every penny. Impeccable service,â€¦
