The Bauer Palazzo Hotel made our trip to Venice. After arriving from an overnight flight, the staff was completely accommodating. They took care of everything and made us immediately comfortable. Every time we walked into the hotel, my friend and I were treated by name. No matter what a staff member was doing, they dropped it to see if there was anything we needed. The food was great, the room was beautiful, and the location was perfect. We highly recommend the Bauer.
