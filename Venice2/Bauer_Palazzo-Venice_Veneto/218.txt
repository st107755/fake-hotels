Staying at this hotel is a special experience. It never disappoints on any level. The breakfast is served by professional waiting staff who understand the concept of hospitality and treat guests to fantastic service. The coffee was wonderful, eggs cooked to perfection. Cocktails are amazing, and a great selection of gins.  The views of The Grand Canal are in my opinion the best in Venice. This is truly a magical setting to enjoy a drink whilst watching the gondolas pass by. I will always make this my number 1 choice of hotels to stay/visit in Venice.
