Stayed here for honeymoon and was fantastic. They upgraded us to a room overlooking the square in front of the hotel. Room was great, one of the ones pictured on their web site.   Location is excellent, close to San Marcos and good walking distance. It was very memorable to have breakfast on resturant patio overlooking the canal. Breakfast buffet is very good, recommend getting this included with your room.   When we return to Venice we will stay at the Bauer. Service is excellent. Staff speaks very good English and helps every step of the way.   You will not be making a mistake staying here. It is one of the top hotels I've stayed in and worth it.
