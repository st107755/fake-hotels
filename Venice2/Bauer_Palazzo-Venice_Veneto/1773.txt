Had to go out the door of cocktail lounge to alley to enter building to the Venuzzio rooms (old convent) or out front door around the corner to an unlit alley.  View from window was roof tiles and alley. The unmanned lobby was  hot pink cloth wallpaper with carnival ( varied color) of chandelier lights giving the overall effect of what one would imagine a brothel to look like...Wallpaper, bedspread, headboard, part of ceiling all beige print cloth wallpaper had identical pattern which felt claustrophobic. Had to move furniture in order to sit in a chair to watch television. Advertisements show a restaurant rooftop with views of San Marcos which i was told was only for Bauer palazzo clients.  After theatre, I thought I would have drink in the lounge but was told the empty couchesâ€¦
