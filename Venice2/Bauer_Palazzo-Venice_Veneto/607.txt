We stayed here for 4 days and had a truly wonderful time. From the service at Reception on checking -in, the view from the bedroom, to the cheerfulness of the Housekeeping, the great service for breakfast and lastly for the fantastic views from the terrace at breakfast/dinner and the roof-top bar at night, our stay was delightful. To add to the pleasure the weather was lovely as well. Will definitely be back.
