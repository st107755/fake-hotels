What 5 star hotel do you stay where you are expected to pay additional charges for 1. Internet (Euro 20) 2. Gym (Euro 10) 3 Jacuzzi/Steam room must be pre-booked and only opens at specific times (Eighth floor and no lift access) 4. No kettle or complementary refreshments in the room (Coffee Euro 12) 5. No Iron in room or available at main desk (Costs to have one garment pressed min Euro 15). 6. Extortionate prices for drinks (Be aware of a guy asking politely to hang up your jacket then only when leaving asking for a euro as payment) In addition the rooms are very small with no full length mirrors and there is little hanging space for clothes Normally when one stays in a 5 star hotel you expect all of the above to be included as a minimum in the price you are paying to stayâ€¦
