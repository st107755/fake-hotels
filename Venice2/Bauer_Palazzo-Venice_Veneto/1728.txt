This hotel was simply superb. I picked it based on the great rate I got through the Leading Hotels website and was somewhat hesitant due to the reviews on this site. Now, to be fair, my room got upgraded because I am a member of leader's club.  I understand that there is an older wing where maybe the rooms are not as nice. I had a room in the renovated portion with a view of a side canal. The room itself was beautiful and the bathroom a pleasure after having just spent 7 nights on a cruise ship. The location was perfect and only a short walk to St. Marks and La Fenice. Concierge was very helpful and service prompt. The only issue I had was when I wanted to check in early and they said the room would not be ready until after check in time due to "high occupancy". Now, I was thereâ€¦
