My wife and I have stayed at the Bauer three times in the same room overlooking Campo San Moise.  We sit on the balcony in the early morning watching Venice come to life.  Supplies being delivered, people coming to work, and gondoliers preparing their boats for the day.  In the afternoons, with wine in hand, we watch the throngs of tourists in the Campo.  We recommfend this experience set in a beautiful hotel to anyone.  You are very short walk to San Marco and a bit longer to the Accademia.  Location couldn't be better.   Breakfsst buffets on the roof top or on the Grand Canal are unforgettable.  An extremely nice hotel.
