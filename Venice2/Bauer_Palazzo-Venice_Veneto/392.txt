This remains the hotel that I walk into and say 'aaaaah' and finally relax.  There's nowhere like it in Venice and very few places, if any, like this worldwide.   The hotel would never say that their guestrooms are amazing (the furnishings are generally quite old fashioned, but the lobby, the bar, their function rooms, the staircase, the view from the terrace; all of these add up to the wonder that is Bauer.   After the frenetic, hot and crowded streets of Venice, this art-Deco masterpiece takes you to another planet.
