We stayed three nights at this high end and therefore very expensive hotel. It was certainly worth it. A beautiful and opulent room with a view of the grand canal ( given to us with no fuss after a very slight mix-up with our reservation) with well appointed bathroom. Breakfast again overlooking the canal was very good buffet style with all that could be wished for. The hotel itself has magnificent public spaces with some wonderful Art Deco furniture in among the more traditional offerings. The hotel was very quiet which was a shame as there was less atmosphere in the bar for instance then one would have wished for, but that did not detract from the overall effect.  Worthy of very special mention is the friendly staff who all seemed to have the highest customer service skills Iâ€¦
