The variations were the same.  When friends found out I was taking my first trip to Venice, I was inundated with hotel suggestions:  The Cipriani! The Daneli!   Thankfully I did not take their advice.  For me, there is only one hotel that should availed of in Venice: The Bauer Il Palazzo.  Much has been written about the location and I would be remiss not to remark upon it. Walk out the back door of the Hotel Bauer (though linked, the Palazzo is a separate building on the Grand Canal) and within minutes you can have a coffee in San Marco square.  That alone is worth the price of any stay.  What made the Palazzo special was its attention to detail.  We were picked up at the train station by our own private water taxi (of course the Palazzo has its own dock) and whisked awayâ€¦
