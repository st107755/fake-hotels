Four couples from Texas recently stayed at the Bauer Palazzo and found the location unbeatable.  Some of our rooms proved nicer than others, but we were all comfortable.  The included breakfast was good, and we loved the morning views from the terrace.  Four of us responded to the hotel's 3-course meal special offer and ate on the terrace our first night.  While the food was expensive from our point of view, the offer definitely made it more affordable.  All in all, it made for a very pleasant evening. We'd arranged for several tours during our 3-night stay, and we were never more than a 5-minute walk from the start of any of the tours.  We found a number of restaurants within a 5-minute walk, so we were quite pleased. I can't say enough about the manager and staff of the hotel.â€¦
