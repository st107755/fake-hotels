We stayed here just 3 short days but they were memorable.  The hotel is perfectly situated, just a short walk to San Marco Square.  Our superior room, no upgrade, was spacious and spotless.  We had our own personal terrace, a wonderful surprise.  Our room number was 238.  I would most happily return.
