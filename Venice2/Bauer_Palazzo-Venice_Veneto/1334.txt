I had read mixed reviews on the Bauer so I was concerned when Holland America booked a post cruise stay here.  We really enjoyed it.  Terrific location only a minute walk to St. Mark Square.  The restaurant deck is on the grand canal which is very enjoyable during breakfast.  The breakfast buffet was very good.  Our room had a window that opened over a canal where the gondolas dock.  We had a walk-in closet with a mini bar/fridge.  The bathroom was beautiful marble but had no curtain over the bathroom window (tape and newspaper solved that problem). Our room shared an atrium with another room which kept our room from opening directly into the hallway.  The bed was comfortable and the room size was fine for two people.  We tremendously enjoyed our stay and would return to theâ€¦
