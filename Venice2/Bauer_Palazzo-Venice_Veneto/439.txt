While I feel you can't go wrong with anywhere you stay in Venice, we made a great choice with the Bauer hotel for or first trip to Venice. It is true that the Bauer has an amazing side terrace on the grand canal with lots of seating where you can sit and sip an Aperol spritz while enjoying the beautiful view. The hotel has a nice and large lobby and right outside is a gondola stand where the line was never too long. The hotel is nicely settled in front of a church/mini square and to the right, just across the bridge is the main strip to all the high end shops and just beyond that you will find a plethora of local boutiques and a very short walk to the Saint Marks square. The B bar at the hotel was a favorite of ours for an aperitivo or afternoon espresso. The rooftop is charmingâ€¦
