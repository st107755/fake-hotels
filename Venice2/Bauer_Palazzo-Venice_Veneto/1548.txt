The Bauer Hotel was simply wonderful! We travelled from the airport in a water taxi directly to the hotel which commands an impressive position on the Grand Canal.Location was perfect for us as being on the waterfront you are away from the crowds. 5 to 10 min walk to San Marc's Square.The staff was very helpful and our room was very large with a view of the canal.  The terrace of the hotel fronts the Grand Canal and is opposite San Salute church. This has to be the best terrace in all of Venice
