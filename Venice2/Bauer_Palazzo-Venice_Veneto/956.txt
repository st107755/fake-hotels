This is a fantastic hotel within a stones throw of St Marks Square, so extremely well positioned. The outside bar area is right on the Grand Canal with a smaller canal down the side, perfect to watch and listen to the Gondoliers entertain their guests. The drinks are expensive, so we found ordering a bottle of wine each evening better value than shorts. Although the bar staff were all friendly and welcoming, they do just leave you to it once you have ordered your drink. Not that I am precious and expect to have my drinks topped up by the waiters, but we were never offered another drink when our glasses were empty which I found strange and a bit disappointing for a 5 Star hotel. However it's worth noting that this was common behaviour in virtually every restaurant/bar in Veniceâ€¦
