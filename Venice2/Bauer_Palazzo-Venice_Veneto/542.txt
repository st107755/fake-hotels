First, a heads up. The Bauer is really two parts - a refurbished palazzo on the Grand Canal, with a modern 5 star hotel appended on the back. Unless you're paying an enormous fee, expect to be in the hotel, which is very modern and up to date.  Probably a bit on the smaller side, but remember this is Venice, where space is really at a premium.    This is definitely a 5 star hotel,with a very friendly and helpful staff, gorgeous lobby, and fabulous breakfast buffet, the best I've seen in Italy. Location is about 2 minutes from the San Marco vaporetto stop, about 5 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. Short walk to all the major tourist sights; we only took the vaporetto to get to the train station and back    Very quiet rooms.  And perhaps the most eclectic collection of TV stationsâ€¦
