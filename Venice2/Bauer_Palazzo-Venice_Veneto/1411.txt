I stayed at the Hotel Bauer for 3 days in August.  The view of the Grand Canal was great but the room was really small and the concierge attendants were very rude, except for one person.  Most of the front desk staff couldn't be bothered with giving directions or any other kind of assistance and referred me to the concierge who referred me back to the front desk.  I would not both with this hotel again.
