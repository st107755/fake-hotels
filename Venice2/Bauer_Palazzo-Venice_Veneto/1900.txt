While service was good, it was too stiff.   The room was small, somewhat shabby.  I had been led to believe from the reviews on this website and many others that this is a world class hotel, the best in  Venice certainly.  That was not the case.  In hindsight, I would have tried the Gritti Palace despite it's uneven reviews or the Bauer.  This is a good hotel, but not great, and certainly not near perfect.
