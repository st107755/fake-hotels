Our trip to Italy was very busy and hectic until we arrived in Venice. We were finally able to relax and sleep in at this beautiful hotel! What a wonderful place to stay. Top notch rooms, views and service. The richest experience I have ever received. The bathroom in our room was all marble with heated towel racks. The view from our room was spectacular as well as a wonderful breakfast wit a roof top breathtaking view of Venice. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. An experience we will never forget!
