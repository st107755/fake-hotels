We stayed at The Bauer for a long weekend (Fri-Mon) this week, first the location - fabulous, literally stumbled upon it off the ferry from the airport, just a short stroll through the narrow streets to St Marks Square, right next to the water and Gondolas. Upon check in my partner had advised it was our Anniversary, Elena on reception was delightful and told us she had upgraded our room to mark our special occasion. When we got to the room we found we had actually been upgraded to an amazing suite, absolutely stunning with breathtaking views, we were blown away by the hospitality from beginning to end of our stay. We decided to take a trip to Murano and Burano and must make a special mention, and thanks to Carlos on concierge, again couldn't do enough for us and arranged a taxiâ€¦
