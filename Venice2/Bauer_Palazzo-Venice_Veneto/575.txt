We checked into the Bauer and loved the general level of service including the concierge, staff, and food staff.  Strange that even though we booked a large suite they wouldn't allow us to buy drinks at the bar and return to our room.  Not sure what the reason other than to force us to pay even more and take more time...  Two demerits
