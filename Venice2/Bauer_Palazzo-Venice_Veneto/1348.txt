We were in Bauer hotel 6 years ago and now again. Then it was suburb and very very good.  Now, we booked again the same room, through our travel agency but get another rather more dirty and small suite. After the bed the mirrors were not so nice. The windows and carpets... Pfff.  Breakfast: no salmon, bread was very hard, an egg: extra charge...   @management: Renovate and we will be back.
