Stayed here in mid May with family .  Absolutely beautiful views from the terrace where you have breakfast , great service, lovely rooms a real old world hotel.  Venice is beautiful with fantastic views at every turn we took a private water taxi over to molano avoid the excursions to factory shops and go alone it's much cheaper.
