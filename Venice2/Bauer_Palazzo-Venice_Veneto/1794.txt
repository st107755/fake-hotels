This was the beginning of our 25th wedding anniversary trip. We were leaving after a few days for a cruise. We arrived by water taxi, that we arranged on our own at a lower cost, from the airport. The hotel itself is not spectacular, but our room overlooking the side canal was. It was actually a suite, not the typical American hotel room. We were charmed by the decorating, the doorbell to our room, and the view, opening our windows in the morning to watch the gondoliers getting ready for the day.  Our bed was perfect, with soft sheets and great pillows. Robes and slippers are already in your closet. The location is perfect because its not right in the midst of everything, just down the street. Close enough but not too close.  It allowed us to go out early in the morning beforeâ€¦
