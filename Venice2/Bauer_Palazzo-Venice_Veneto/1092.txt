Had been there few days back v disappointed the hotel was booked by a prestigious company n we paid extra for the view of the grand canal from the room but as usual how they have duped previously others they did the same with us too after showing them the confirmations letter . After making us wait till 3 pm which is there usual checkin time they told us they are overbooked so we didn't have any choice . It's a total ripoff I would say in big capital letters
