Very nice hotel, Exquisite architecture of the reception and very grand. The location is 20 mins from the train station in a water-taxi but it has its private Gandola station and very close to St. Mark's square..!! The staff is quite helpful, especially people on the concierge desk, if I remember - Marco was fantastic. The stay was quite an experience. The most memorable moment was the breakfast when a seagull stole a bacon from our plate...!!! :) my son was awed..!!  If there is few things that they can enhance, would be great.  1 - In room-dining options are not great 2- The restaurant can be open till 11
