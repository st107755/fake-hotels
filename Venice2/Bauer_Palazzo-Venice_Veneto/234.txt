We stopped in here to dry off and warm up from a very rainy day in Venice. The bar was empty. The bar staff were very nice and polite considering we were dripping wet. They served us coffees. The bar has some very old pictures of famous visitors which were fun to see. Really, the hotel staff were so gracious and friendly.
