I stayed here in early January 2008. The location is excellent for both sights and shops and is much better located than the Danieli. The hotel faces the Grand Canal and the breakfast room has wonderful views. The breakfast is however very poor for a 5 star hotel and I certainly would not pay EUR 44 per person for that breakfast. Having said that, we had lunch in the same restaurant which was excellent. The bar at the front of the hotel had a pianist on 2 of the 3 nights and was a little busier than other bars in Venice which early in the year are mainly deserted. The room was a standard double with no view but had practically all that was required and all queries (softer pillows, malfunctioning television etc) were addressed immediately by friendly staff members. All in all itâ€¦
