As I always do before booking any hotel in the world I read the TripAdvisor reviews of The Bauer.  It is fair to say that they are mixed but I was prepared to keep an open mind - this is a five star hotel after all surely it must be better than many say?  Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed.  The only thing that is 5 star about The Bauer is the view of the Grand Canal from the restaurant where we ate a decidedly two star breakfast and some of the (very very expensive) rooms. I booked a 'superior room' which turned out to be a very small room overlooking an internal courtyard painted in an eye-watering bright green.  There was very little natural light in the room in fact to see the sky I had to lean right out of the window and crane my neck upwards. The bathroom is all marbleâ€¦
