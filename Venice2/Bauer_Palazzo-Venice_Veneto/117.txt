Great location.  Service efficient but not friendly-pretty stuffy actually.  Expensive and just a ho hum experience- this hotel could have been in any city and I think it would be the same experience.  Italy and, yes Venice, should be experienced. Btw, agree on the noise complaint. The music went until early in the morning!
