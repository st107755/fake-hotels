We ventured into this hotel today for a light lunch to escape the crouds outside. We chose salads accompanied by a very agreeable Chardonnay and had a really nice experience overlooking the Grand Canal and also a side canal with its constant flow of vociferous gondoliers which added a great deal of atmosphere even if the protagonists are unlikely to be elevated to the operatic stage! Quite  expensive but worth it and most enjoyable.
