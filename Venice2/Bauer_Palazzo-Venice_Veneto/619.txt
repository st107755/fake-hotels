Just returned from a 3 day break at this great located hotel. We celebrated our 30th anniversary whilst we were there, so wanted to have a great place to base ourselves. The Palazzo part of the Bauer is more plush and ornate to get the full Venetian experience and it delivers on all fronts. We were lucky enough to have room 308 which has views over the Grand Canal and can recommend it to anyone, with the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in, the bathroom is all marble as expected with a small walk in wardrobe with a safe for convenience. We had breakfast each morning on the 7th floor terrace with views across the Venice skyline, you can go to the main dining room which has a bigger selection, but the terrace served us fine. We booked an evening meal at the De Pisisâ€¦
