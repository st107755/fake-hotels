LOVE LOVE LOVE this Hotel!!!! Wished we could have stayed longer!!! We will for sure come back here over and over again and recommend to all our friends and family and business acquintances. Anyone reading this, if you plan to visit Venice, huge mistake if you don't book this hotel. From the breakfast, the rooms, location, concierge service, the bellman were all superb! Overall this is a great hotel and a beautiful hotel overlooking the Grand Canal. Thank you Bauer Hotel for making our Venezia experience unforgettable.
