Hotel Bauer Palazzo is a beautiful hotel situated on the grand canal.  The location of this hotel is perfect, the view you have of the grand canal from the restaurant is divine.  There is nowhere else in Venice that you should stay in my opinion than on the grand canal.  The rooms were grand, the service we received was excellent and the price paid was more than fair.  Overall 5/5, can't fault this place.
