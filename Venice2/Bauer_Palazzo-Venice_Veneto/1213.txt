I have stayed in different hotels in Venice,  but Bauer hotel made my stay in Venice an exceptional experience,  the location couldn't be better,  my room was nice and I had a view of little canal beside hotel full of Gondolas riding, a beautiful restaurant area that gives you the opportunity of eating your breakfast or afternoon drink while watching grand canal..! What a beautiful morning.! On the other hand as a tour manager, I need  my hotel concierge staff to be really helpful and patient,  they were excellent.! I really had a wonderful time there.  And for sure stay in this hotel again and again.
