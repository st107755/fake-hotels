A very comfortable if somewhat dated hotel.  The staff very helpful and courteous. An excellent location with wonderful views of the Canal and gondolas.  Congratulations to the front of House Manager.  Quite expensive and the prices of the desserts very and unnecessarily high .  The visit to the sister hotel opposite a great visit with its super natural gardens and air of tranquility.  Transfer by the Hotel own speedboat.
