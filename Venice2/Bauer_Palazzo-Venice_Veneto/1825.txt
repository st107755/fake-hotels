My husband and I recently stayed at the Bauer for two nights in Venice and loved it!  Knowing that many european hotels are small, I expected the smaller room given, and the management allowed me to look at a larger room! We kept our smaller room as it had a lovely balcony with sweeping views of the city and water.  The temperature in Italy at the end of June was really quite hot and coming from Texas we really love our A/C.  This room was heaven after being in the heat all day - thank goodness there wasnt a limit on how cool we could make our room.  Sheets and showers are also very important to me and high ratings for both!!(with the weather so hot, showers were needed several times a day!)  It was also beautifully decorated!  They have a lovely terrace with panoramic views atâ€¦
