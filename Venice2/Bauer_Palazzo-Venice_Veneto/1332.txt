We had a great stay at the Hotel Bauer in Venice.  Our room was lovely, resembling a bed chamber from a 1940 Hollywood film.  Warm and comfortable. Our bathroom was glistening clean with marble everywhere.  Mechanical shutters descend from the tall windows at the touch of a button.  Very private and quiet for a good sleep.  The only confusion is that there are two hotels in one.  The Bauer Palazzo and the Hotel Bauer.  The staff seemed a bit confused when we asked to see the view from the Palazzo terrace.  One big, ol' gruff fellow practically admonished us for asking, saying that terrace was for Palazzo guests only.  Other staff members quickly sailed to our rescue and we had a delightful photo op from on high.  Mille Grazie, Maurizio!  Will return to The Bauer!
