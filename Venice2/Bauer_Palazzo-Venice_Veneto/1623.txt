The Bauer Il Palazzo met and even exceeded my expectations. While not inexpensive, this lovely hotel is well worth the money. The location is excellent, just a short walk from Piazza San Marco. My room had a great view of the Grand Canal and was beautifully appointed. As a solo female traveller, I really appreciated the attentive service.
