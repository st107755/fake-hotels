The hotel was beautiful, the breakfast buffet offered a wonderful variety and the food was fabulous. The staff were incredible especially the concierge who personally recovered my lost luggage from the pier. Having evening drinks on the patio overlooking the canal and city was spectacular. My only negative feedback is that WiFi should have been included with the stay. This is a five star hotel after all and felt like they were nickel and diming me with the extra WiFi charges.
