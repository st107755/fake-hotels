We stayed for 2 nights in April in a Deluxe room. The hotel is in a fabulous location - easy to walk to all major sites and right on the Grand Canal. The room we had was lovely (large/clean/comfortable) - with a small balcony overlooking the little square (Campo San Moise) and the side canal. The staff and concierge were great - assisting us with all of our requirements. Definitely recommend for a Venice stay.
