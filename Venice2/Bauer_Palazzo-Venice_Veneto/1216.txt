Venice is already an amazing destination. But to experience Venice from this hotel was absolute paradise. Location, Staff, Room, View in no particular order unbelievable! To wake up in my room - with that view and in that bed was amazing. Room 509! Any of those three rooms.. 509, 508 and 506 FANTASTIC... view of the grand canal..  Breakfast on the seventh floor with Roberta and her cronies a joy. The view while superb made better by the best the breakfast buffet I have ever experienced... The quality as opposed to the quantity is marvelous. Scrambled eggs usually for a buffet are yucky...Not at the Bauer Palace.  The reception staff were lovely in fact all the staff of the Palace were adorable... The only comment I would say is that bar breakfast the food generally was not onâ€¦
