I'm writing this review on our last night here sitting on the stunning roof top terrace in the sun drinking  procecco overlooking the grand canal and most of Venice (stayed for a week should have stayed for 2 ) We opted for a suite and I can recommend suite 353  In the front of the hotel bauer il palazzo For a view directly facing the grand canal and for a stunningly gorgeous large room with a large marble bathroom and sofa TV walk in wardrobe etc  And an enormous comfortable king size bed (we can open the curtains in the morning and look at the grand without even getting up !)  We have a small quaint balcony  So you can watch and listen to the gondolas go by  Some with singers and arcordian players onboard  Our suite came with a buffet breakfast included .Inc endless  proceccoâ€¦
