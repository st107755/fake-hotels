The hotel is located in the middle of high end shopping. The rooms for the cost was not up to par in my opinion. I was somewhat upset the rooms were not ready to be occupied at official check in time, we had to wait 1 hr. We had two connecting rooms facing the grand canal. I was surprised to have had the opportunity to witness the redemption fireworks (front row seat from the room - major plus) The bed was lumpy and the room not that comfortable. The hotel staff was nice and accommodating.
