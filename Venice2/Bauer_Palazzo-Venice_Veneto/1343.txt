Very comfortable hotel, well serviced and a warm friendly atmosphere. Location is perfect - a stone's throw from San Marco, and a short walk to the Accademia and the Rialto. Overall a lovely stay.  Breakfast was good, with a fabulous view over the Salute church, and San Giorgio. Otherwise, we didn't eat in the restaurant as €600 per person for the New Year's Eve gourmet event was a bit rich, even for us British troughers... But with dozens of restaurants nearby, there really is no need to eat in the hotel.  Our only niggle...the Wi-Fi costs €20 per stay, but was incredibly unreliable. We tried three different portable routers in the room to try and boost the very poor signal, but it was still erratic. Certainly something that should be fixed. The €20 charge was still on the bill…
