This is a very cool, smart hotel. The staff are courteous and polite, eager to please. Our room was a good size with a wonderful view over the Grand Canal. We had a walk-in closet and a sumptuous bathroom. Sofa and armchairs, a flat screen TV and DVD player. The restaurant was very good. I had one of the best starters I've ever eaten, and the wine list was extensive. All in all this is a very desirable place to stay. Particularly as it is so close to St Mark's Square. Recommended!
