The Bauer Hotel is well situated with an easy 2 minute walk to St. Mark's Square - helpful if you're trying to beat the crowds.  In reality the hotel is just well-situated full stop.  The feel of the place is slightly old-fashioned, but none the worse for that.  The bedroom was large, airy and quiet - we had one on the side - with a good bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable.  But the real joy is the dining.  The outside terrace space, under an awning to keep the sun off, looks directly out over the Grand Canal and is quite wonderful.  Both dinner and breakfast were excellent.  Staff were helpful and friendly.  I wouldn't choose anywhere else to stay.  We were very happy.
