When booking through Leading Hotels of the World, impossible to know in which part of the hotel you will arrive. Before a difference was made between the Bauer HOTEL "the new part" with dusty carpets and dark rooms, a the Bauer PALAZZO, the more glamourous historical part. In spite of booking at the Palazzo, i got a room in the dusty part, with an old but correct bathroom , a "partial Canal view" ( i could hardly see the Canale ) an old dusty carpet ( being allergic to carpets a big problem ). The biggest problem was the bed with worn-out mattress what was extremely unconfortable and unacceptable ( the hotel was fully booked no way to change rooms ) and the airconditionning that could not be regulated ( only on and off, all other stands didn't function ) As a result I got sick.â€¦
