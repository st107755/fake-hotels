Probably one of the best place to stay in Venice. I recommend rooms at the fifth floor with short access to the terrace to enjoy the view dirinking a coffee or having breakfast. The location is the most ideal location possible. Two minutes from San Marco and short walk to Academia Bridge. Our suite was spacious with two bathrooms.
