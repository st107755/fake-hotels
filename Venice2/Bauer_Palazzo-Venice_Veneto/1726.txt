I’m a new member of trip advisor and I owe everything to this site for it gave me the best idea where I should stay whenever I travel.  And yes, I was never failed to choose Bauer Hotel as my lovely haven for the Christmas season. I booked this hotel based on the reviews I read and was never disappointed for it was fantastic and superb. Such a romantic getaway for me and my partner.  For 4 days and 3 nights, a suite room was given to me. It was expensive, a lot expensive as I wish to say, but the time I stepped into my room, I was just overwhelmed. It’s worth every penny or Euros indeed. The price is high but it’s fairly competitive.  Excellent location. Just a few steps to St. Marks, La Fenice and shopping boutiques as well. The breakfast was my favorite ---truly the best thing…
