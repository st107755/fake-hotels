Perhaps my expectations of hotels have been pushed too high through my extensive travels across the Middle East where service and room/property stardards have excelled in recent years.  I find I have to adjust those expectations when travelling in Europe and prepare myself for the indifference of the conceirge, with hand held out, and aloof receptionist applying discretionary charges as a matter of course.  The Bauer Il Palazzo is a complete exception and a perfect delight to find.  From collection on the platform at Venice's train station to drop off at the airport, the experience was first class and arguably the best value for money from any of our hotels on this trip.  Yes, its quirkily fitted into an 18th Century building - not unusual for Venice.. and yes, there's a priceâ€¦
