We just spent our 10 year anniversary in Venice and spent a lot of time in advance researching hotels and speaking with friends who have spent time in Venice.  We booked the Bauer and could not have been happier with our decision!  The location is the most ideal location possible.  Minutes from San Marco and short walk to Academia Bridge, but on a tiny square that doesn't feel busy.  This location is much better than the Danieli, which is located further down on the Grand Canal where all the tourist boats come in and out and those hotels do not sit directly on the Grand Canal.  The Bauer sits directly on the canal with a beautiful view of the Santa Maria della Salute church where you can sit outside on a beautiful terrace just steps from the canal and enjoy a bottle of wineâ€¦
