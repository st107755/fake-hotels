This was our first stop on our three week vacation through Italy and a wonderful first stop it was. The location was wonderful sitting right on the canal and you are greeted right off the water taxi. This hotel is right down from St. Marks Square.   I found it quaint the hotel still uses real keys. The room size is pretty typical. The bed was comfy and we slept well. The window opened to the canal and you could listen to the those performing on the gondolas.   The breakfast every morning was lovely. Many options to fill up on prior to setting out of the days adventures. The staff were very attentive and happy to provide whatever assistance is needed.
