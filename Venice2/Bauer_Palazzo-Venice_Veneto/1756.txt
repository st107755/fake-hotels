We satyed at the Bauer il Palazzo for 5 nights it was just perfect a very unasuming 5 star hotel, very well positioned If you want marble, gold,and glitz stay next door at the sister hotel. Breakfast is on the top floor fatastic views cant fault it The concierge Paolo is a gem booked retaurats concerts made sure we were trated well everwhere he booked is a tabel. The view we had from our room was the best good size and the bathroom large and very well equiped, separtae shower. Expensive but worth it
