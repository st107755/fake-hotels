The Bauer hotel has the best location - it has itâ€™s own dock, and is just a few minutes away from Piazza San Marcos. The room we stayed were spacious and clean, and services regularly throughout the day. The breakfast area was a terrace next to the canal with very nice view, and we enjoyed the continental breakfast there.
