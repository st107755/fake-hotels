We have stayed in many hotels in Venice, but this was by far the best one ever. I must repeat what the other reviewers have already said, that the staff is exceptional; they treated us as if  we were old and treasured clients even if it was our first stay. Our room was beautifully decorated with a view over the rooftops and S. Maria della Salute. The dinner on the terrace (with gas heaters so that we could sit outside in october!) was delicious. And yes! they have fresh blood orange juice for breakfast, a rarity even in the finest hotels. We are looking forward to staying there again on our next trip to Venice.
