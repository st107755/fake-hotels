We stayed two nights at the Bauer and were very pleased with our experience. The hotel is well situated near San Marco square and fabulous shops to browse. We had a nice, but small room (ok, it's Venice) overlooking a canal. Our room was well apportioned and comfortable. We visited during a hot weekend, and the room was adequately cool throughout our stay. Our reception and concierge experiences were very favorable. We actually previewed a number of rooms before selecting one, which is always nice. For dinner reservations and entertainment recommendations, concierge staff were attentive and helpful. Breakfast each morning on the terrace was lovely. The buffet is very nice and the view fantastic. We would highly recommend a stay at this property when visiting Venice.
