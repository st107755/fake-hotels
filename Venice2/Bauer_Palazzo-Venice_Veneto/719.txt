If you are worn out from shopping, stop by the Bauer, walk through the lobby, to the bar, which has a wonderful outdoor eating area, with a great view of the Grand Canal, and St. Georgio Church.  The drinks are a little pricey, but you have a wonderful tray of nuts, and olives, and one of the most Beautiful views in Venice.   The waiter is very nice, attentive, great service.  Super place to relax, and have some quiet time, away from the hustle, and bustle of Venice.
