Travelling with my teenage daughter we couldn't have picked a better hotel or location. The room was very spacious and staff very pleasant. Good variety at breakfast and fantastic view over the grand canal while you drink your morning coffee or glass of wine in the evening. Literally around the corner from St Marks Square and close to all the best shops - what more could you want !
