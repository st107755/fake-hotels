We booked the Bauer Hotel for 2 nights for our 28th wedding anniversary. The hotel was fabulous and the highlight for us was eating breakfast on the decking overlooking the Grand Canal each morning. When we returned to our room in the evening after a long day of walking it was a nice surprise to find the bed turned down with slippers left at the side of the bed. The hotel is ideally located not far from St Mark's square and a short walk from the Trinitia pier the pre booked water taxi dropped us at upon our arrival. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, in particular the reception staff and Andreas the concierge who was extremely helpful in helping us plan our return route to the bus station on foot due to the water taxi's being suspended due to the annual water regatta.â€¦
