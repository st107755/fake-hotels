During the Biennale it is hard to find a hotel and prices are sky high but at a five star you expect at least a decent room and to access your room when you want to. At the Bauer , they let anybody access your key but don't let you get to your room when they have a very noisy private event. No water for night drinking. lights cannot be extinguished in the bathroom and complaints are ignored. A view over the canal means you have to sleep with earplugs until 5am. No umbrellas when it rains. No separate WCs from the bathroom and rates exceed €1200 a night. NEVER again... to be fair, breakfast is very good and served on a roof terrace ( nothing to do with the Danieli whichvis fantastic). location means gondola traffic jams instead of getting around. Go somewhere else... anything is…
