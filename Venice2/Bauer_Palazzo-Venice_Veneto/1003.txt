The location is good, the room was clean and comfortable but the price is too high.  If you pay this money for 4 nights, you can stay better quality hotels with views.  Delivery charge for a kettle is 5 Euro. The breakfast staff are friendly and smiling especially the concierge staff are very helpful and friendly.  But the front desk staff are not so friendly and helpful.
