This hotel is gorgeous. We arrived by water taxi and were enchanted by its incredible location and presentation. It is a show-stopper. The service was warm and welcoming. The room was comfortable and spacious although there was sometimes a musty scent upon opening the door. Nothing too bothersome. Breakfast on the terrace was magical. Lots of choice and lovely service. It was wonderful to spend our time in Venice in this charming location.
