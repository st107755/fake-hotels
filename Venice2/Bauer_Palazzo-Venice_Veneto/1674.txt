This hotel is really fantastic, the rooms are sumptuous without being stuffy. Stunning location just of the Grand Canal. We had breakfast on the terrace every morning just amazing. Will be back to Venice again but will try somewhere else but if  its a first time visit I would recommend this Hotel very highly.
