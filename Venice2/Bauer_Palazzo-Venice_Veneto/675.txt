We searched many Hotels in Venice for our Anniversary stay and so glad that we have decided to stay in Bauer . Perfect location for any route you would like to take in Venice, very convenient for the water taxi too . The rooms are beautiful with amazing views ( ask for the Canal view rooms ) , service excellent , very attentive and helpful. They have access to the best Restaurant booking even those that require advanced booking. I thought it was more for just couples but after staying at Bauer we decided to bring our kids on our next trip to Venice and stay in this Hotel. Big thumbs up !
