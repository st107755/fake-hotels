The service is excellent, as well as the ambiance and the setting of the hotel right in the heart of Venice. We stayed in a city-view room with view over a canal and a good city overview. There were other rooms we didn't see with inside courtyard view which would not find satisfactory for the quite high price the hotel is asking for stays.  Nevertheless, we came back later that year in the Bauer Palladio with its gardens that just opened and we had a wonderful time. This year we will return to the Palazzo. Great recommendation for a romantic weekend, although the price is a bit steep.
