stayed here for a grand price last minute on expedia Â£115 per night incl breakfast. Lovely roof top views, private jaccuzzi was being repaired when we were there. Even though off pea, Venice was still busy ish. Gonadelas a must, but expensive.   Rooms are moderate size in general, but probably big for Venice, hotel staff very helpful and helped booked things in advace. Breakfast was fine, rooms clean. good Tv with English movie channel.   Definite 5 star and reccmonended
