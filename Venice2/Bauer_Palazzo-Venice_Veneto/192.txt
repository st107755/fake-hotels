I recently booked the Bauer Hotel through a third party agency but on arrival was told the booking was for their next door property the Casa Nova. I was not impressed as this was located on a quiet and deserted laneway with no staff located  in the reception of the building. As a solo female traveller I was nervous arriving in to the building.  Breakfast was served in the main hotel, and while the staff were nice, the issue with the pigeons landing on tables and helping themselves to breakfast was like a scene from Hitchcock’s The Birds. I’d suggest setting up some of the tables inside to provide an alternative.   I would say the room in the Casa Nova wasn’t anything special and I wouldn’t have rated it as five star accommodation.
