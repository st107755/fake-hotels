Visited Bauer hotel as part of a large group.  The hotel is situated on the grand hotel, accessible by water taxis. The hotel itself was beautiful and the decor inside was breathtaking. The staff were friendly and helpful. The double rooms are very spacious and really do get a great nights sleep. It is central and only 5 minuets walk to saint marks square
