The hotel's location is superb  - very close to St Marks Square, the hub of tourist activity in Venice.  It is also ideally located near the water taxi station (Vallereso).  The staff are very helpful and cooperative.  I stayed there for two days - one for business and one for leisure.  The rooms are not very big but of standard size.  The TV looked like a very old model.  Being a mid-high end hotel they should have had flat screen LCD or LED TVs.  There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  Prices for items on the room service list were very high.  Concierge was very helpful in suggesting places to visit or restaurants to go for dinner/lunch.  I was surprised when they told my wife that use of fitness centre will attract a charge of Euro 20.  Lifts were very small.â€¦
