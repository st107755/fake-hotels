Years ago in the '80's we stayed here off season. The room was wonderful with oriental rugs and old world splendor. Now the lobby's changed to Hercule Poirot deco, again very lovely.  I'd read jazz was hard to find in Venice and not always happening much to everyone's chagrin. So I jumped at the BBar's offering in the Bauer with their $10 ticket, one drink minimum. There are two show times. No room for excuses unless your totally touristed out.   There are so many types of jazz so I didn't consider the female singers renditions exactly my kind of jazz exactly but then they call Billy Joel's "Just the Way Your Are" jazz in Warsaw. Go figure. So nibble away at the potato chips and  enjoy the venue... you're at the toney Bauer. No bah humbug here.
