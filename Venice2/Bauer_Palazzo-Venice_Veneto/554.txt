We stayed one exceptional evening at the Bauer Hotel in Venice. The concierge was extremely helpful in obtaining dinner reservations and guiding us through the area. The room was lovely and breakfast exceptional. After checking out and making our way through the crowds to the boat, we hear someone calling our name... it was a Bauer Hotel employee that had been looking for us. We inadvertently left our passports in our room for "safe keeping" and forgotten them when we checked out. (Rookie move!) Housekeeping found them and immediately contacted the front desk who initiated the search to find us. That teamwork equals five star service. Thanks for the save, Hotel Bauer!!!
