From the guy on reception (sorry that I did not get his name, he wears glasses) right through to every member of the concierge staff (Marco particularly helpful) the Bauer people are fabulous. The hotel is superbly located for striking out across Venice.  The room was very comfortable and breakfast was excellent.  But it is the staff that make the difference.  We were there for four nights and everyone made us feel that we were their very special guests. When we return to Venice it will always be to The Bauer. Well Done and thank you.
