OMG, Unbelievable step back in time. We had a wonderful room in a Palace, a little Bordello looking, but wonderful. Room was clean, large, red, gold and very comfortable. The location was on the Canal and very Central. The Breakfast Terrace was so worth the price. Our breakfast was included in the room and what a wonderful experience and view!!!! The staff at breakfast, as was all through the Palace, was so accommodating and helpful. The breakfast spread was unsurpassed. Check out the website and you will want to stay here too!
