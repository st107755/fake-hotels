We stayed here from 13th May to 20th May 2014. It was a special holiday as it was my husband's 75th birthday & our 50th wedding anniversary. We were greeted by smiling staff, our luggage was taken to our room & a bottle of Prosecco greeted us in an ice bucket! There was another bottle left on my husband's birthday. The room a deluxe double was huge & so comfortable. The bed was king size & the room contained a chest of drawers, writing table, arm chair & 2 ordinary chairs, also a big cabinet containing TV, a fridge & nibbles.The bathroom was also big & we found dressing gowns & slippers wrapped in cellophane & bathroom goodies.The bedroom was soundproof & had a hallway which also kept it very quiet.The sheets & towels were changed every day & were spotless & of high quality. â€¦
