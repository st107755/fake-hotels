We had a wonderful stay at Bauer Palazzo with wonderful views of the Grand Canal and so close to San Marco. The buffet breakfast was 1st class and the room we stayed in was fantastic. All the staff were very friendly and helpful which made for a truly  memorable trip in Venice. If you want to treat someone special this is the place to come.
