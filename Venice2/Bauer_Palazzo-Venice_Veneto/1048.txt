We stayed at the hotel for one night prior to a cruise. A great location which is very convenient for the main tourist attractions and the breakfast terrace provides delightful views over the Grand Canal.   Our internal facing room was however dark, small and in need of a refurb. After complaining we were moved to a slightly better room on the 5th floor.   When booking be careful to ask if the room comes with a view!
