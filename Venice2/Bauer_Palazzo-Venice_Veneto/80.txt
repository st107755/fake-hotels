We felt the hotel the was really nice place but the restaurant staff was really rude and did not want to accommodate us; as simple as a glass of ice or to take a desert to go. The restaurant manager said insulting remarks and was rude for no reason beside I want a desert to go. The room staff entered our room and would not leave until I used verbal force to make him leave. We got rip off by the taxi boat that the door staff set up. The check in staff we great!
