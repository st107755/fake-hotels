We were made to feel very welcome in this beautiful friendly hotel.  A surprise Christmas gift for my wife more than surpassed my expectations.  It's not cheap!  Our room and bathroom were opulent but paled into insignificance with the magnificence of the view down the Grand Canal and across to the Lido.  Breakfast is in an exclusive 7th floor terrace presided over by two lovely ladies who went out of their way to chat to guests and make sure they had everything they needed.  It was like being welcomed home by a proud Italian mother.
