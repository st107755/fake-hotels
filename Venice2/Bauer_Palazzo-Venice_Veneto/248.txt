There are some places where you just don't want to scrimp on being in the right place, and Venice is one of those places.   The Bauer Palazzo commands the prime spot in Venice.  A bit off St. Mark's plaza, right off the Grand Canal.  A small side canal along one side, so you literally pull up in a water taxi and go through a 'water only' entrance and right into the lobby to check in.  This hotel has it all.  Our comfortable room had a nice little balcony to sit on with a grand view of the canal.  The room is well appointed and comfortable.  The hotel has a superb patio off the rear, right on the canal.  A perfect spot for an afternoon drink or breakfast in the morning.  It is perfection.  The concierge did a fantastic job setting us up for dinners, for a private boat to take usâ€¦
