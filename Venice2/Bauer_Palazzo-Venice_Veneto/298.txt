For some reason, my wife and I were upgraded to a suite on the canal side of the hotel. It was in some sort of VIP section separated from the regular rooms, with a separate elevator, so I guess we just got lucky. Anyhow, we loved our stay in this delightful old-but-charming property. Breakfasts on the patio overlooking the canal were wonderful, as were dinners at the canal-side restaurant. Would stay here again, especially if we got the upgrade!
