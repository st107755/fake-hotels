This is a really upmarket hotel located in central Venice a stones throw from St. Marks Square with wonderful views of the canal. It has its own private jetty and staff are very friendly and welcoming.  It has all the facilities you would want however be aware the spa is across the other side of the canal in the "sister" hotel/complex and it wasn't open when we were there - apparently only opens from Mid-March!!! If I could afford it I would stay here again no problem and whilst the rest of this review points out some minor items for readers information its a wonderful hotel and worth the money. There is a mini-bar in the room but no complimentary water provided - so buy some in shop as mini-bar is expensive. There was no tea/coffee making facility in the room - there was plentyâ€¦
