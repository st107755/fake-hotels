Kudos to the Bauer hotel for a wonderful three night stay last week! Everything about the hotel was top-notch and luxurious! Staff including front desk, bell man, concierge and housekeeping staff were excellent.  Many, many thanks for the lovely upgraded room as well! We will definitely stay again on our next trip to Venice! Thanks again
