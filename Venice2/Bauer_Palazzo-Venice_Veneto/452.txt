Perfect location, just metres away from San Marco Square and the famous Harry's Bar is just around the corner if you fancy splashing out on a Bellini like Ernest Hemingway used to!!  Staff are fabulous, very helpful.  Terrace overlooks the Grand Canal and is beautiful. Our room was excellent - we got a free upgrade, and it was huge!
