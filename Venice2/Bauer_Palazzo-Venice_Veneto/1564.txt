We enjoyed an outstanding dinner on 7th August. It was spoilt by only one thing. The menu clearly states that the prices "include service and vat". However when presenting the bill our waiter said that service was NOT included and a tip was expected. I queried this with the duty manager who tried to tell me that although service is included it went to the hotel and not the staff. A clearly most unacceptable situation and I await a comment from the General Manager.
