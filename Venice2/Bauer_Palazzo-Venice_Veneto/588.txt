Stayed there 4 nights (we had 2 rooms) during our Grand Tour.  The concierges went above and beyond the call of duty--needed a dr. prescription and the concierge arranged for an MD to visit my room in less than an hour!  They also made last-minute dinner reservations at some very exclusive restaurants.  Rooms luxurious--our views could've been better but we at least could see some water off in the distance. Breakfast buffet was excellent.
