From the moment we walked in our room you wanted to cry because the view was so incredible. Our view was of the Grand Canal and a small canal that connect to other sites. They have a private dock which is convent to get to. The staff was so friendly and very helpful; internet connection was also helpful right in the room. The hotel is so beautiful and close to Saint Marks Square.
