The Bauer Hotel is the perfect venetian experience... Everything about it is absolutely perfect...  All the main touristic attractions are extremely close, you have a Vaporetto station really nearby, and you can enjoy walking around Piazza San Marco at night or early morning, when it is completely empty  (it is literally one minute from the hotel)  It is impossible to find a better view of the Canale Grande, we spent two hours having breakfast at the terrace every morning because we were completely astonished by the view of Santa Maria de la Sallute.   But the hotel is much more than a good view... it is decorated with the traditional venetian style, high ceilings, great art, specially the sculptures and overall, the design is awesome, bringing you back to the 15th century.
