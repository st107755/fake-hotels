We spent 2 nights here at the end of our Italy trip and what a great way to end our vacation.  Pulling up to this hotel in our water taxi you could tell it was going to be a great experience.  A wonderful location right on the canal and so close to St. Marks Square.  Beautiful and spacious rooms and so quiet!  We were right by the elevator but heard nothing at all.  We had an inner door which may have helped but the room was very soundproof.  Comfortable room, with great bed & pillows.  It was so close to everything, including shops & restaurants, and steps from St. Mark's square.   The breakfast was plentiful and you sit out on the patio right on the canal with the beautiful views & breezes.  Staff was very helpful and attentive.  Would love to return!
