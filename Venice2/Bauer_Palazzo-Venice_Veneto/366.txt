Stayed a few nights after a Croatian cruise. Great location just a few steps from Piazza San Marco with 2 water taxi stations at hotel. Elegant lobby and rooms.Room was clean and comfortable.  The canal bar and De Pisis restaurant afforded great views with excellent food and service. Overall Service was outstanding. The concierge staff was excellent especially Roberto who was extremely helpful and had great advice.would return on a flash.
