This review is for a dinner we had on the Terrace. We ate their on Wednesday July 16th and had such a wonderful dining experience. We were seated right along the canal and from the moment we arrived the service was nothing but first class. We felt like we were waited on hand and foot and really enjoyed the experience. The food was also very good. It was a wonderful first dining experience in Venice and we would go back again.
