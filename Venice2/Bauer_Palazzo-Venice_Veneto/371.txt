Pros * Perfect location close to San Marco square * Vaporetto stops only a short walk * View of canal from room was great * Service from all staff was excellent * Breakfast buffet had good range and terrace location is a great start to the day * Roof top terrace is excellent for evening drinks as sun sets * Gondola stop just outside Cons * Room was a little on the small side for 5* * No shower screen so floor got soaked  * Pigeons at breakfast were a little disconcerting but they can't really help it * Wifi in room not good but lobby ok
