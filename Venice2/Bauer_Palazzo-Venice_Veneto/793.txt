We had a lovely stay at this hotel Valentines weekend. The hotel is beautiful, clean and all you would want for a weekend away. The staff were friendly and the food was fantastic. The only thing I would say is that although I felt the food was reasonably priced, the drinks were expensive. I also liked the location of the hotel as its right by St Matins Square so felt central to everything. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
