We went to the second hotel, outside the palazzo (access through a side door), but the breakfast (for instance) was inside the palazzo, with a great view of the basilica. Maybe we didn't have a view, but the prices were great, the bathroom exquisite, directly accessible from the vaporetto line 2, inside San Marco. Nothing to regret, only to enjoy.
