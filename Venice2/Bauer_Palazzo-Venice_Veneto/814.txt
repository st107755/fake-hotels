One of the best hotels I stayed in. First the location is perfect, right next to San Marco Plaza, overlooking the Grand Canal. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. The breakfast was also very good. We stayed in a room in the old part of the hotel and had a terrace with an amazing view. Highly recommended!
