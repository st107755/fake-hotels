Superb room, with large bathroom. Excellent service. Free breakfast included, a feast! Dinner overlooking the Grand Canal was very good. Free boat shuttle ride to sister hotel Paladdio.  Had dinner there last night. Great garden, very quiet, away from Noise of San Marco. The dinner was creative, excellent all around. Highly recommend the Bauer
