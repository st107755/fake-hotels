My husband, son and I stayed at this hotel for 5 days, it was superb. It's not a big hotel but it is so welcoming to its guests, nothing is too much trouble, the staff were wonderful, the rooms were very venetian and beautifully designed, and the cleanliness was outstanding. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting Venice, though it does'nt come cheap but you certainly get what you pay for. We're looking forward to our next visit.
