from the moment we arrived brought  by the private boat belonging to the hotel to the moment we left we fould everything about this hotel to be delightful. we arrive late in teh afternoon after flying from the united states were greeted by the manager and led a beautiful room with a large terrace overlooking Venice with a side view of the lagoon. the room as absolutely beautiful with walls covered in blue silk. the  soaps and lotions  in the bath were exceptional..  the room was serviced beautifully  with great attention to detail.. the restaurant had delicious food. all in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to vencie
