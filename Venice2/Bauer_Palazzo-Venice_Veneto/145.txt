We arrived by water taxi as part of a large group during the fourth highest tide in history. The porters did a great job getting us into the hotel safely. All of Venice was flooded, but we bought the local overboots from the concierge, and ventured out into the flood.  It was a unique experience, and the water was due to fall whilst we were out. In fact the wind was so strong that it pushed water back in, and we ended up returning to the Bauer with the water over the top of our boots.  We climbed back in to the beautiful Bauer, stripping off our wet shoes and socks.  The lovely Valentina rushed over to reception, got two pairs of the hotel slippers for us to keep us cosy until we reached our room.  Typical of the service we received.  The turn down was excellent, we never didâ€¦
