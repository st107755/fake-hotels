Booked Hotel through BA and upgraded to a Suite which we discovered was in an adjacent building to the main Hotel. Every window  in the suite had a view of the neighbouring brick wall!!!! 1 positive thing about the annex is that it felt like you had hired an self catering apartment, if that is what you are looking for. The room furnishes were a little worm in places and there were not even facilties to make a cup of tea or coffee, which left a feeling of "fur coat no knickers". Although we were informed that we could have room service at anytime. But with a charge of 10 euros for the tea and 5 euros for the pleasure of room service = 15 euros for 1 cup of tea ( £11.60), i felt this was a little steep. Plus you can have this service in most 2* Hotels in the UK, let alone a 5*…
