What can I say about this hotel. Luxury at its best.   We have just returned from our 6th stay at the hotel and it gets better everytime.   We were greeted by Linda at reception who god us we had been upgraded, a fabulous start to my birthday celebrations. The rooms are gorgeous, truly Venetian with an amazing bathroom and huge bed.   On my birthday I was went back to the room to find a bottle of Prosecco wishing me a happy birthday from Linda and the team.   We got to experience the roof terrace for the first time as we normally visit in March and it was fabulous, a completely new view of Venice.   You truly feel like you are in complete luxury at the Bauer and I wouldnâ€™t stay anywhere else. See you in March!!
