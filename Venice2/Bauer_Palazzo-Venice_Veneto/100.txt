This is the finest hotel we visited in Italy. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The bath was decorated in marble. The tub was large (quite unusual for Italy!) and the water pressure was perfect.   The WiFi worked well. The breakfast which was included was delicious.  the service was impeccable. The concierge arranged water taxi gondola ride and dinner reservations. We were steps to San Marco Square in a perfect location We will recommend to our friend and canâ€™t wait to return!
