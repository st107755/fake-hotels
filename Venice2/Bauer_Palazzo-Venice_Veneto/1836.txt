I was a little concerned before I travelled as I had read several negative reviews, but our experience was great. We took a private taxi transfer from the airport straight to the hotels private dock. We couldn't have been better greeted, all staff were very polite and we had been upgraded to a suite which was wonderful.  The hotel is definately 5star, it's a modern quite contemporary hotel. The negative is it is very expensive, we had a meal for 2, and it cost 250 Euros. The location is great too.
