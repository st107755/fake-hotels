This hotel has a great location. We stayed there for 3 days prior to going on a cruise. We found the service overall a bit underwhelming and our room was very dark. The only window looked out onto a wall . We went out for all our meals because you get so much better value at little restaurants and cafes. We did have drinks on the terrace overlooking the canal and that was lovely.  Very pricey but I think to be in the center of Venice you have to pay! Probably try somewhere else next time.
