One of the reasons we choose this hotel out of the many you view on the website, was the prompt reply to our enquiry and the locaton. On arrival we were 30 minutes too early for check-in but was asked to wait a short while which they gave us complimentry drinks/snacks.They upgraded our daughters room to a suite (which included a spa)  and this was  a nice surprise. The hotel staff that we dealt with all spoke English, extremely well groomed and presented themselves with a friendly attitude even when they were busy.
