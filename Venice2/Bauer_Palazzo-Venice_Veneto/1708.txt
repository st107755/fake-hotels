Beautiful waterfront, exquisite buffet presentation!  The Hotel Bauer is an older high-class hotel kept in excellent condition.  Very courteous and friendly staff.    We had a beautiful spacious room, seperate entry way, walk-in closet, marble bathroom with dual sinks, tub, and shower.  Extended tv channels (Bloomberg).  The bed however, was not so comfortable- though I'm biased.. I love 'heavenly beds'   ;)  Loved this hotel!  Loved Venice!  Just make sure not to take the gondola rides just out side of the hotel.  The ones by the Hard Rock are a better value.
