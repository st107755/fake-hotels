Arrived at this wonderful hotel for a three nights and four days holiday. When expressed my dissatisfaction with the room, I was referred to Massimo who immediately changed my room to a fantastic value alternative. The new room was about 50 sqm in size, fantastic tall ceiling, and everything about it was spacious and grand. Facilities (particularly Gym) were excellent in comparison to other grand lux hotels in Venice and breakfast was just superb and served on a beautiful terrace overlooking the canale grande.
