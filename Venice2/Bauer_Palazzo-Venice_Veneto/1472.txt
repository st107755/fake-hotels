My wife and I stayed here for a few nights a while back & we have always said that we would love to return to the Bauer again. Beautiful hotel, amazing location, great staff & a stunning room. Breakfast on the terrace is a must. Sit back & relax & watch the cruise liners go by & watch the Gondoliers get ready for their days work. Loved it!!!
