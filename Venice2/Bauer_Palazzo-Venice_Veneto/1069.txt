We had 3 nights in the Bauer. It's perfectly located if you want to be at the centre of things - only 2 minutes walk from St Mark's Sqare, and fronting the Grand Canal.  We had asked for a quiet room, as we always do, but ours was overbooking the very busy square San Moise, which had a church where bells rang (not all night fortunately), and a Prada shop undergoing major construction works from early morning every day including Sunday. The room itself was big and very characterful with a large bathroom with jaccuzzi bath but not a walk-in shower.  Good buffet breakfast but the dinner we had on our last night was disappointing and pricey. Helpful staff and generally up-market atmosphere.
