I stayed 2 days at this hotel recently. This hotel could not have been in a better location. It was right on the canal and hundreds of gondalas were passing by with singers and tourists, it was a very fun exciting location especially when having breakfast on their terrace, it doesn't get better then this. This hotel was right around the corner from St Mark square and great shopping and many restaurants. I had a superior room with a side view of a canal, it was very nice.  Just a couple of minor issues, when checking in there was no one at the check in desk and when they were bringing up the luggage to our 3 rooms all the luggage was being sent to wrong room so I carried my own luggage in no big deal.  When checking out it was early in the morning and I had a water taxi waiting.â€¦
