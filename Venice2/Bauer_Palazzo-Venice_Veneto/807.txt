We spent 4 nights here last week. Booked through BA holidays. We were shown to a room in the annexe which was huge. There were 3 of us. Me and my 2 grown up children so my son had the sofa bed which he said was very comfortable.  Breakfast was wonderful. Plenty of choice although we did arrive later one morning (about 9.40) and there was no bacon left and the cakes were thin on the ground.   Service was excellent. I quite enjoyed being in the annexe as it was quiet.
