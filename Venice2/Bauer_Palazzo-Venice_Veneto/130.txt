Our rooms were part of a package and we couldn't have been more happy. Not only was the location just amazing but the entire staff was so wonderful and helpful. Cold air-conditioning on hot August days didn't disappoint when we needed a break and the bathroom and room were very spacious. The highlight was starting each day sitting on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal for breakfast. Ending days there with a cocktail was equally as enjoyable. Will return if ever in Venice!
