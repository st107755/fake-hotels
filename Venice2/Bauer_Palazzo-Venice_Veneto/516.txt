We were upgraded to a suite on our arrival at the Bauer Hotel. This was our first visit to Venice and this hotel surpassed all our expectations.  Everything was exceptionally Clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever had in a hotel and the turn down each night was special. All the staff were friendly and efficient.The hotel was very close to St Mark's Square with its own dock for taxis and gondolas. The boat trip to Murano organised by the Concierge was something special. This was the start of a fantastic trip to Venice
