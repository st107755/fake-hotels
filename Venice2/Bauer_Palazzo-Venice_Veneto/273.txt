My friends and I booked this via Expedia.com early last year; I kept looking at the website and wondering what on earth was going to go wrong - it looked too nice for the money we had laid out; my nerves really set in when we arrived because first impressions once in the foyer were - OMG!!!, how can this be the right place?! - we are going to find out that there has been a mistake....but No....we were booked in and we were greeted and treated, in fine style by all members of staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful; the concierge team could not have been more forthcoming from general information, to supplying a courtesy boat to Murano and then a water taxi from the hotel towards home - charming the lot of them; reception were equally lovely.  Our rooms were just wonderful -â€¦
