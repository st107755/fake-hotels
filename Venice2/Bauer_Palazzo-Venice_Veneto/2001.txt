We stayed at this "5*" hotel in June 2003 for 250 Euros per night. The hotel is located right on the Grand Canal, 2 minutes from a vaporetto station, and less than 5 minutes from St. Mark's Square! In terms of location, it can hardly be beat! However, the front desk service was terrible. We arrived at 8:00am to leave our luggage behind and to our astonishment it was just left out in the open in a corner. The front desk staffperson, who was not friendly at all, told us that a room would be ready at 1:00pm. We came back at 1:10pm and the same fellow had to call the "Chief Housekeeper" to ensure that the room was ready, all the time giving us dirty looks and checking out the clock for the time. I later saw this same man at the reception telling someone who was inquiring about roomsâ€¦
