Stayed here for two nights after our cruise and wish we had stayed longer.  Beautiful hotel just off Piazza San Marco.  Had a great room overlooking the side canal where we got to watch the gondoleers from our balconey.   Staff were friendly and professional, has an excellent concierge desk.  Rooms were clean and the linens great. Has an outdoor terrace just off the Grand canal and ferry service to a sister location on an island not far away.
