Arrive by water taxi and soak in the grand hotel ombiance. From check in through stay, staff is delightful and attentive. Got upgraded to an 8th floor room that offered a city view which made the stay even more enjoyable.  Breakfast buffet is well appointed and the Grand Canal patio offers a beautiful setting for starting the day. Food selection is broad and all fresh.  Overall, great service and a nice stay.
