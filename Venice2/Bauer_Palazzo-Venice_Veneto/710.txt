This hotel knows how to do luxury. From the service, to the food, the views, and hospitality. All amazing. On our arrival our room was not ready as it was 11:00 am, so we had an early lunch on their amazing restaurant terrace (Psis). You are right on the Grand Canal. It was absolutely breath taking and the food was awesome.  We choose a Junior Suite Room, with partial canal view--- it was perfect. Tons of space, with a small outdoor terrace to enjoy Gondolier's songs and the canal breeze. In fact, 4 months before we arrived as we were booking the room through their website directly, we had wonderful service .... they emailed us pictures of the decor of all the rooms we were interested in and picked us out one specific to our tastes. That's service! Highly recommend this hotel toâ€¦
