Normally I don't write scathing reviews. I wouldn't be writing this one if the management had had the courtesy to reply to my letter, sent over two months ago. Afternoon tea here was supposed to be a treat. Instead, for the equivalent of £23, we were served (by unsmiling waiters) four miniscule cakes ( the brownie the size of a Thornton's bite-size) and had to queue for coffee. The only smile we received was on the way out. Perhaps they thought our U3a party was lowering the tone of the place. All the more galling when we were missing a free afternoon tea (with better cake) at the lovely Montecarlo Hotel (see my review).
