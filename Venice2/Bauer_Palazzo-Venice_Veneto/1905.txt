Having just returned home after a 3 night stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo, my husband and myself are rather confused.  This hotel adjoins its sister hotel, The Bauer (rated 5 star), whilst the Il Palazzo is rated 5 star luxury.

Of course there is a huge increase in the room rates for the Il Palazzo. For the cost of our rather unimpressive dingly room in the Il Palazzo, we could have had a superior suite in the Bauer!!  The Bauer has a very grand and impressive foyer, whilst the supposedly grander Il Palazo has a very dark, and unimpressiveâ€¦
