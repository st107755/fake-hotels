I think most reviewers mention the breakfast - it is a spectacular setting, that is for sure. We hired a private boat to go back to the airport, and that was a wonderful experience to walk out of the hotel onto a boat. These were the highlights of our stay. The room did not live up to the price tag.  There are a few things to take into account. Apparently the refurbished rooms in the hotel are amazing. Ours was a bit underwhelming for the price. A bit shabby. There are two parts to the hotel, the old traditional Venetian part which I believe has recently been restored, and the modern 1940s part which is where we stayed. We were sold the room with the bonus that it had a terrace, which sounded good. I suppose if I had been less tired after a long journey I would have gone backâ€¦
