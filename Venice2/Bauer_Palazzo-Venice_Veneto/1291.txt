My father always said take the worse room in the best hotel, well in the case it was a big mistake.Lets start from my arrival in a five star hotel you expect a door man or at least someone to welcome you not at this establishment. The foyer was large and impressive but completely soulless just full of large groups of American tourists waiting for their guide .Behind the reception were 8 people but only two could check you in.I asked for an early check in but even at 2pm one was not available,I was told to wait on the terrace and someone would come and get me this never happened but I did get my room just before 3pm when I returned to the reception.Yes 1 had booked on line the cheapest room but boy what a mistake.I was shown into a small box room with no natural light it facedâ€¦
