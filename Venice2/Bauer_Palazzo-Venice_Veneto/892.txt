Celebrating our wedding anniversary, we were very happy to have selected this hotel. It's a traditional 5* hotel, with old-world charm and luxury touches - beautiful linen & furnishings and even some special romantic touches for us -such as a heart of rose petals on the bed! Also, the room was wonderfully private (double-doors and carpeted corridors -great!)  and really quiet.
