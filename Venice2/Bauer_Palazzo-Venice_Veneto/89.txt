We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo for two nights prior to a cruise.  The hotel is perfectly located right on the Grand Canal and just a two minute walk from San Marco Square.  The shopping around the hotel is fantastic.  Gondola's line up beside the hotel and if you sit on the beautiful patio you can hear them singing and passing by.  The views from the patio are amazing.    The rooms are very well maintained.  They are spacious, extremely clean and they have a mini bar.  The beds are comfortable.  We found the staff at the hotel to be friendly and welcoming.  The morning breakfast was included and it was delicious. This is just a fantastic property and I highly recommend it.
