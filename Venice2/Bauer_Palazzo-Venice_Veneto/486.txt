WOW...historic beauty full of old world charm and grace. Elegant pleasure that can only bring you back. We travelled as a family...luxuriously appointed suite good enough for royal occupancy. Beautiful surrounds and amazing views. Venice is as beautiful and enchantic as any romantic destination. Having this experience complimented by the Bauer is like the bubbles in a lovely French champagne...tingling to say the least.
