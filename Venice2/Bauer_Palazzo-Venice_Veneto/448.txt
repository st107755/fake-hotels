I don't understand how this hotel is rated 5 stars. We love Venice. We've been here 8 times always staying in a 5 star hotel. Cipriani and Daniele are magnificent and true 5 star hotels. We like the experience. We also like being close to Saint Marks. I read the reviews and made the reservation. I specifically requested a queen size bed. I also said we were celebrating my wife's birthday. When we came to check in the front desk had 2 inexperienced people working. One had been working for a month, the other was a trainee, seriously. You don't expect this in a 5 star property. I asked for an upgrade for my wife's birthday. That drove the poor people into a situation. They had to find a manager. The manager told me they were completely booked and only had the Royal Suite. No, thankâ€¦
