This is my favorite hotel in Venice ,located in a quite plaza 2 blocks away from San Marco square ,if you have money to burn hotel Danielli is a more expensive option and equally good,but the Bauer location and terrace over looking the grand canal while having breakfast is just priceless,the gondola station is right next to the hotel ,just one piece of advise :do not listen to the concierge advise about restaurants ,they will send you to the WORSE tourist trap in Italy :trattoria  DU FORNO which is  not only very expensive but the food has terrible flavors ,this is the worse mistake u can made in Venice ,this is the only reason I don't give this hotel 5 stars.If possible visit Venice in weekdays before the cruise ships arrive on friday.NOT matter what ,do not book a hotel inâ€¦
