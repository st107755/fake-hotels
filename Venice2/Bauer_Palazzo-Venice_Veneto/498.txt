We reviewed The Bauer Hotel on TripAdvisor before going and chose to spend less money and stay in the Casa Nova.  We are not ones to spend much time in the hotel so we were ok without a view.  The entrance to the Casa Nova is right next to the main hotel, and the large church.  Our room was clean, bathroom was marble, our window overlooked an alley, but we expected it and were fine, we were in our rooms to sleep.  We were in Venice for only 2 nights so this hotel was perfect since it was right in the middle of everything.  San Marco square was 2 minutes away.  The main entrance to the hotel was steps away from our entrance, we had drinks outside on the Grand Canal, we ate breakfast there everyday.  The concierge was very helpful guiding us on touring Venice.  It is a beautiful 5â€¦
