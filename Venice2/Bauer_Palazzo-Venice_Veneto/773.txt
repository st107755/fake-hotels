Very very luxury hotel in the central Venice, you can get anywhere from the hotel, the room is amazing and clean, this hotel had guests such as big names of Hollywood actors and famous politics. Not really for low budget holiday seekers. The staff are amazing and very helpful, if you need a help on where to go for dinner just ask the concierge and he will suggest you the very best restaurant in town
