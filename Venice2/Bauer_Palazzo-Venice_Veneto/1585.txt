The Bauer hotel is about 5 minutes away from San Marco. Noise is never an issue in Venice as the whole town is pretty much deserted at night. We had a huge corner room and the bathroom was as big as the entire room. It was massive, with a tub and marble everywhere! The decor is typical elegant and ornate (not my style but pretty nonetheless). Our room didn't have much of a view, rooftop of neighboring buildings, but I didn't mind. Breakfast was typical hotel fare, with perfect cappuccino, cold cuts, breads and pastries. The service was non-intrusive and friendly.
