If you are looking for a wonderful hotel in Venice, be it your first trip or a return trip, you must stay at the Hotel Bauer.  The location is great, steps from San Marco, and steps from American Express office (which everyone in Venice will need). The hotel is a 5 Star with incredibly reasonable rates. Check online sites. The staff at the hotel is the best as well. I was robbed on the train from Florence to Venice and the hotel staff just made everything work; made all the calls for me, upgraded my room, got me new tickets, etc. The rooms are incredibly comfy, especially the beds. Bathrooms are top rate as well. The breakfast, included in room rate is unbelievable!! The best I have had in all of Italy. And don't miss the piano bar in the evenings or the outside deck on theâ€¦
