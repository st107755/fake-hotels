We fully enjoyed our trip to  Venice.  The hotel is in a good location 5 minutes walk from Saint Marks square looking onto the Grande Canal.  We stayed in a superior suite which was expensive, but worth the money. The room has a super king size bed, with follow on lounge area, separate writing area and marble jacuzzi bathroom. There were 2 separate dressing closets, an lcd tv (English chanels were Sky movies, World news, english cartoons, CNN) dvd payer and cd / radio player (cds and dvds are available from reception free of charge).  The room was a large and airy corner room with 4 double french doors looking out onto a square and canal.  After reading reviews I was looking forward to the american breakfast, but I was disappointed. It was not as extensive as I would have liked,â€¦
