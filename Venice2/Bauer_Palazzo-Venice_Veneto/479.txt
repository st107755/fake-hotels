The Bauer Palazzo Hotel was one of the accommodations included in our Insight Gold tour. We were booked in 5-star hotels in different cities of Italy and surely, The Bauer Hotel is one of the very best.   Service is very good.

I could not afford the shopping but at least, the hotel opens into a big open courtyard with a Catholic church beside it. It is walking distance to St Mark Square and very safe even late at night. The streets leading to the hotel are well lit.   The rooms are big and pleasant. One of the  things I like about this hotel is they have airâ€¦
