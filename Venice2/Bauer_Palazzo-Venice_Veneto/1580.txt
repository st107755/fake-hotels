This is a true 5-star hotel and everything you would expect from one is in place. The room we stayed in was not a big one, but the quallity was excellent and it had had everything we needed, including a small balcony. The best thing in the hotel is it's location. The best evidence of this is the first morning when you enter the breakfast restaurant for a champagne breakfast: the view is stunning. At least it took my breath away. Highly recommend this hotel.
