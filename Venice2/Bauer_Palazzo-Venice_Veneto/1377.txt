We were given one of the few rooms (533) with a walk-in shower, which also was also high enough for a nice view and sunlight; and was the largest superior in the hotel. We had a "European" king (two twins stuck together) with interesting lumps. The rooms were serviced twice a day, breakfast was included in our rate. The staff were wonderful, providing help and information cheerfully.  Their English language ability ranged from good to excellent, so communication was not a problem. The concierge desk was staffed by people with a range of local knowledge - with Carlo and Massimo the two most helpful.  Prices within the hotel, and the shops nearby, are off-the-charts expensive. Don't eat at the hotel unless you are desperate. Protect your wallet when walking by the major labelâ€¦
