Its Venice, you have to pay for location!!!! Nothing cheap in Venice trust me been may times. Is this the most fab 5 star hotel you have ever been to?? ... prob not! Cipriani great but  you have to take launch, fine in high season with its pools ect, but outwith July, Aug. Would stay in bauer, for location, location, location ..without cashing in kids college fund!
