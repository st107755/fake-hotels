First of all, I loved the location near Piazza San Marco.  And I've been so impressed their service. Hotel's staff are lovely and helpful !!!  We took a little chihuahua with us, they rent us small bed for dog. Even as if the Hotel was not full-booked, they up graded our room. Very good memory we have had! We really thank them.
