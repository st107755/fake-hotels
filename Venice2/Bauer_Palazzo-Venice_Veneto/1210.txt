Return visit to this hotel which is ideally located next door to San Marco. Nothing in Venice is cheap (not even for the locals) and this hotel is in the top levels. We cannot commend the all members of staff highly enough (Reception, Concierge, House keeping, Bar and Restaurant, not forgetting the good gentlemen who offer the expert help transferring from motor launch to jetty). The staff are the public face of any establishment and this group of professionals set the tone of the clients' stay.  Special recommendation for the kind attention of the waiter in the restaurant who provided a very nice hook for my walking stick. Everything about this hotel shows attention to detail and the selection of fist class/luxury products. Quiet comfortable rooms and beds. Wonderful bathroomsâ€¦
