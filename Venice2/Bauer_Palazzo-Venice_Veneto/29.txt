The Bauer is old elegance in Venice with amazing views of the canal and great service.  We had a jr suite and it was a huge room(s) with a living room and 2 separate all marble bathrooms.  The Bauer is one of my favorite hotels in Venice and the location cannot be beaten!  Service is impeccable!  The included breakfast is tops as well and I love sitting in the bar and people watching! There are only a couple of items where the hotel could improve.  More luxe sheets and towels and definitely better amenities in the bathrooms.
