If you value excellent customer service in a stylish independent hotel, then everything about the Bauer will delight you. It is a beautiful 40's building with beautiful Art Deco furniture, bedecked in glorious Venetian fabrics, and lit by Murano chandeliers. Rooms are well designed, and extremely comfortable - bathrooms are marble-lined, spacious and luxurious with wonderful locally-made toiletries.  Breakfasts are magnificent, and served, oh the rapture, in the dining room or terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. The location is perfect, with all sites easily walkable, Saint Marks square is so near, yet the hotel retains a quiet air of peace.  The Vaporetti - the canal water bus - stops are near, for trips to the other Venetian islands of Murano, Burano etc., or just for a tripâ€¦
