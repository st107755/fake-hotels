We stayed at the Bauer Il Palazzo on May 1-May 3, 2015.  We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary with a month in Italy, and started with the Bauer.  When we arrived, it was too early for check-in, but the front desk made us comfortable in the foyer while we waited.  They knew we were celebrating our anniversary, and gave us a fabulous room with a view of the Grand Canal.  Picture 25' ceilings, silk covered walls, a marble bath with dual sinks, a jetted tub and separate shower.  Plus, there were remote controlled complete blackout shutters when we wanted to sleep in. The desk suggested we go to the 7th floor for breakfast, which we did.  There we found a delicious and amazing buffet, a choice of being seated indoors (with a view) or for hardier souls, on the terraceâ€¦
