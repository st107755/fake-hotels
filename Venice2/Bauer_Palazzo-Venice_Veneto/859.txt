Attention to detail- check!  The desire on the part of all staff to be helpful- check!  A well organized, comfortable, spacious room- check!  Perfectly located (steps from St. Mark's but quiet)- check!  And my favorite of all, a delicious and expansive buffet breakfast, served in the Bauer's beautiful dining room overlooking the Grand Canal- bliss!
