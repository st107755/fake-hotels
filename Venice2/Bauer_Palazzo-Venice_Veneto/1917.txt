4 nights in a suite overlooking a side canal of the Grand Canal was perfect. The evening Gondoliers' serenades wafted up to our room on the fourth floor. Breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal was breathtaking and the service was first rate. The only negative was the offhand receptionist- he found other things to do whilst in the middle of serving me!! Great location to walk to everywhere, and even better, not surrounded by hordes of tourists as the Danieli and Londra Palace are.
