This really is a beautiful hotel. lobby was grand, bar is in a fantastic location overseeing the canal, views from breakfast are fantastic. we stayed in a suite and the room was beautifully appointed. we ate at the restaurant which was great (see separate review). We had a bad experience with room service - given the high prices I would expect high quality food however for a 25 Euro margarita pizza we were given a take away pizza in its original brown take away box. we ordered French fries and at 20 euros a portion were not even proper French fries. we did not eat any of the food after tasting it - we did not complain at the time as it was late and we just wanted to sleep. Maybe the poor quality was due to the late time of order (around 10pm) Hotel restaurant and bar whilst onâ€¦
