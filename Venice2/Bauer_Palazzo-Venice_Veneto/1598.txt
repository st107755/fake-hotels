We spent 2 days in May in  this fantastic Hotel. The staff was very helpful  The breakfast  is served on the outside terrace overlooking the La Salute Basilica and the Gran Canal. .On other trips to Venice I'd stayed in more elegant hotels, but the Bauer is my new favorite because I felt I was in the center of the city with an easy walk almost anywhere. . The food  in Venice is wonderful, and there are good restaurants close to the hotel......
