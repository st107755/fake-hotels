The location is without any doubt excellent, but in the 21st century one would expect to be able to connect to the Internet, especially at a five star hotel. and not to be cut off from the world! The Internet most of the time was not working, and the staff was rather unresponsive to address this issue. It caused me great inconvenience and disappointment to see this at a hotel where one would like to leave with good memories.  The concierge was very helpful and courteous.
