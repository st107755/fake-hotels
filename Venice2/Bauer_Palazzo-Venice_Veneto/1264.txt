The hotel rooms were roomy and nice.  The staff friendly and helpful.  The patio outside had a great view of the canal with a small canal that the gondola's would come down.  As you admired your view of Venice, you would hear beautiful singing from a singer from the Gondola as they passed within 3 feet of the patio.  The breakfast buffet had a variety of food, very fresh fruit and vegetables.  Something for everyone.  When I go back to Venice, I will always stay at the Bauer Hotel.
