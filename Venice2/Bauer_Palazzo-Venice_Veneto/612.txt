I guess we were in the main building and it was amazing. Very modern and so beautifully decorated.  they came in once to clean room then at night came in again and turned down the outside shade and made bed - great service. Buffet breakfast was delicious.  Only complaint 5 euros for bottle water in refig when down the walk a small restaurant charge 1 euro for same water to go -  Great shuttle across canal every 30 min. - Fabulous grounds - truly amazing.
