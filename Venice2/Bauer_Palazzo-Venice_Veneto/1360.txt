The location is perfect- it is a 5 minute walk to St. Mark's square. The room for European standards was nice, but I don't think it was a $550.00 room(yes that was our nightly rate). We had no view at all, and it was approximately 250 square feet. The bathroom was large, but the design of the shower was poor- no shower doors or curtain so you have to be strategic to avoid water on the bathroom floor. I read many reviews of happy customers who had great views, but I felt we were slighted on our room for the price we paid. The pros: the common outdoor space for the outdoor bar and restaurant are terrific with great views. Fortunately, the 2 days of rain finally stopped, and we were able to enjoy their outdoor space- lovely- the breakfast room was very nice and good selections onâ€¦
