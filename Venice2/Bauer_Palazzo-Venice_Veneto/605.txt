Beautiful historic luxury hotel right on the Grand Canal with stunning views to the Salute church opposite. A stones throw from St. Mark's Square so location wise it's pretty perfect. Lovely terrace by the canal for drinks or dinner. It also has a nice roof terrace for even better views.   Excellent service though not as friendly as you'd experience in the top hotels of Asia. Wifi was free but the room had no free water or coffee making facilities. A little poor for a 5 star hotel these days. Perhaps this is standard in Venice but why not go beyond standard? 8 euro for a small bottle of water from the mini bar was a bit steep.   Overall it's a fabulous place to stay and I'd certainly return here on a future trip.
