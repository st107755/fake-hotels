This wonderful hotel was recommended to me by friends who had stayed there...beautiful centrally located property 1 minute away from St. Marks Square.  We stayed there after arriving via cruise ship.  The ship delivered our luggage and we had a great stay for three days.  The hotel arranged a water taxi to deliver us to the airport and things couldn't have gone more smoothly.
