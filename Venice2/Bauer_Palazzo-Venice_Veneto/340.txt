Great hotel in a great location. We found our room quiet dark so we're moved to a room with more windows. Staff seemed very accommodating. Fantastic setting for breakfast with views over the river. Slightly disappointed with the breakfast as not as good as other hotels we have stayed in. If you wanted any fresh omelettes etc this came at an extra cost. Fantastic lobby and decoration and great views. There did seem to be a lack of outside space to sit, but did use the roof terrace a couple of times which was nice. Drinks seemed very expensive but overall a great hotel. The concierge arranged a boat to take us over to Murano which was fantastic and would certainly recommend it. If you're looking for one of the top hotels in Venice I don't think you'll go far wrong with this one.
