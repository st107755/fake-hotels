When I first booked this room, I was more than disappointed as I found out through a miscommunication that we would be in an annexed room.....I tried to communicate w/the staff that I did not intend to get this room, but there was no changing it, so I hoped for the best.....When we got there, we were greeted by the most pleasant staff. They showed us to our 'annexed room' and we fell in love with it!!!  We were amazed by our room!  It was large and it was beautiful!.....It did not have a view, but we weren't in it enough to really care, plus it was so quiet we had no trouble sleeping!  We had a king bed, a huge bathroom with a separate tub and shower, and a living room - plus the all important AC and we had Wifi! It was also spotless! It was like having our own little apartmentâ€¦
