Ten years ago, when I was a student, I stayed once at the Bauer, not the Palazzo Bauer, so I was expecting so much about this gorgious palazzo ... My husband booked the stay for my birthday. I was happy ! ... And then ! I got the same bedroom than I had ten years ago in the Bauer ! May be smaller ! Because, some suites are located in the palazzo but the regular or deluxe rooms are in the main building, the modern one.  The service is really poor : 3 hours to get our luggage ... one of our coat lost ! No really overpriced and overestimated !   Don't go overthere ! It's just pretentious and expensive ! Prefer the Danieli or the Gritti !
