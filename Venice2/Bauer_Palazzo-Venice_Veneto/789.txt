Spent two nights here with a group of colleagues, and had an excellent stay. Fabulous location, next to everything, yet quiet and not crazy. Nice lobby, very good staff and comfortable and light rooms. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, but that was only shortcoming. All else was great. I would definitely return.
