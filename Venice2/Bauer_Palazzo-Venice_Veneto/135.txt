We absolutely loved this hotel!  The location is absolutely perfect and the staff was universally helpful and kind.  We booked an upper level Palazzo room which allowed us to have breakfast on the top floor with the most beautiful views of Venice.  We had drinks and light lunches several times in the Canal Bar and loved the quiet retreat from the busy Square with excellent food and drinks.  We had a lovely small terrace off of our room overlooking a canal with gondolas passing by.  Our room itself was extremely lovely and comfortable and housekeeping was wonderful.  We dream of returning and would recommend this hotel to anyone for a luxurious but unpretentious stay in beautiful Venice.
