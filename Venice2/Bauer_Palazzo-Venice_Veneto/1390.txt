Excellent location for a hotel right on the Grand Canal overlooking the lagoon as well as near Piazza San Marco.  Starting the day on the 7th floor terrace for breakfast was wonderful.  Panoramic view while eating delicious food!  Staff at the hotel were most gracious at all times:  starting with the front desk, dining staff for all meals, room staff.  Antique furnishings in the large rooms, comfortable bedding, well-appointed bathrooms, bottled water in the rooms.....what more can you ask for to help you enjoy and explore a magical city like Venice.  Stayed for six days enjoying meals on the terraces.  View out of room was limited but other spaces in the hotel made up for it!  Expensive but well-worth it.
