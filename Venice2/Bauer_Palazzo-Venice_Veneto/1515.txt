I had an amazing time in Venice for my Birthday. We booked this hotel because it was 5 stars and we wanted a "Superior" double. We were put into room 248. A nice enough room but not superior. The room was very small and the bathroom sink was/is broken with a bad repair job. Unlike a lot of reviews on here the service we received was outstanding. Yes the hotel is very expensive but you expect that from a five star hotel in a city that charges 120 euros for 1hr on a gondola!  One other negative - beside the room was breakfast. Breakfast signs direct you to a breakfast room. Unfortunately we followed the signs to the wrong one! The hotel accommodates 2/3 hotels, all of a different star rating. It was only then we realised we were not paying for the 5 star part! After realising thisâ€¦
