Excellent hotel. Full service breakfast included. Nice patio out back along the Grand Canal and a smaller side canal that the gondola's come down. Every once in a while there would be a signing gondola passing by, which added to the atmosphere. Drinks are at a price (10 euros for a glass of wine). It's a few minutes walk to St Mark's Square, but far enough away that the bells do not bother you.  Our rooms were on a side street, and the morning the trash is collected, it's noisy.  Ask for a quite room. I booked thru Hotel.com and the price changed several times when logging on. The concierge recommend several restaurants, one of which was full of tourists, which we specifically said we did not want, but the other was great.
