A Fantastic and luxurious hotel situated just a few steps from the main square yet very quiet. Our was amazing and not a bad size for the Venice standards (which are small in general) very finely and carefully furnished in the Venice style with great attention to all those many small details that make the difference when it comes to accommodation and what you would expect to find from in a hotel like the Bauer.  The location is one of the most important advantages of this property as you are just a steps away from most of what Venice has to offer a water bus stop is also close by and great for exploring quickly more distant parts of the Area. The breakfast was Good (considering the Italian standards) although if you are used to large rich buffets you may be a bit disappointingâ€¦
