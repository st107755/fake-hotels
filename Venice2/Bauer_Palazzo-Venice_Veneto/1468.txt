It's been many years since I returned to Venice, fantastic city, where every corner is no trace of its great history.Bauer hotel near s. marco square  was the perfect location, perfect hotel, just perfect. The staff were very helpful, full of information which was always spot on.The breakfast was plentiful, the waiters very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms maybe slightly on the small side, but beautifully decorated every one individual, and very romantic, always spotlessly clean and well replenished. We walked in S.Marco square every day and explored many areas not on the tourist map. This is always going to be our first choice when in Venice
