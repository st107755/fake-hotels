Long weekend in Venice. Bauer hotel organized everything for us, from private airport transfer as well as a private city tour guide. Location of hotel just a few steps from San Marco square is great. The room we booked was not up to what we expected. It was quite big, but totally dark and looking into a very strange very small and dark inner court yard. After a few discussions with front desk we were given another smaller but very bright room with a nice view. This was great. The roof-top terrace and bar of the Bauer is an oasis of tranquility and great views. Not to be missed.
