We stayed here for 2 nights as part of an Insight tour so it was not a hotel we chose ourselves. Mostly the accommodation on the tour was good (not 5 star as we had expected but generally a good standard). This hotel has a lot going for it in terms of location but our room was bad - dark and dingy with run down bath room and only a view of the light well. We could see directly into the rooms (and bathrooms !) of other hotel guests. The terrace, restaurant and bar area were good - nice place fro a drink or coffee overlooking the canal - but expensive. Staff seemed a bit remote and not particularly helpful. There are some good points - next to a gondola ride and the water taxis pull up to the side door - but overall a disappointing experience as we had expected a lot more fromâ€¦
