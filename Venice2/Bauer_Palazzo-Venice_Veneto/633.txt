This our second year in a row back at the Bauer. I can honestly say we love it there. We would never stay anywhere else. The service is great and the breakfast on the canal is incredible. I literally wake up excited to go sit on the canal every morning and watch the boats and city while enjoying my cappuccino and eggs.    The location is just perfect, right outside your door are all the high end designer stores from Louis Vuitton to Prada and Channel. Plus it's just a 3 minute walk to St Mark's Square.  We also find the concierge to be amazingly helpful with everything!!!  It's always nice if your room faces the canal to see and hear the gondoliers.  We will be back for sure. Thank you Bauer Hotel!!!
