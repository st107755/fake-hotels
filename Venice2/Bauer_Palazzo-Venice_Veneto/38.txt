The hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location. It’s only a 5 minute walk to San Marco. The hotel staff is extremely professional. The room was amazing. Very large King bed and a sitting area with a huge bathroom. The B BAR on the roof is very expensive ($40 for 2 drinks) but the view is worth it for one drink. The hotel is located right on the Grand Canal and the rooftop view overlooks the beautiful La Salute Church. The room comes with a terrific breakfast as well. You can’t go wrong with this hotel choice!
