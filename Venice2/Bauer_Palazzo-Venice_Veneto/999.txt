I booked this hotel as it is a leading hotel of the world....or at least ir should be. It is simply not nice! the rooms are begging for refurbishment, the mattress is old and i am not a fussy sleeper! the hallways look like Mussolini build them. I am sorry but coming from Baglioni Hotel in Milan i expected the same standard. The staff was amazing! Thank you Jessica and Marco. If ill go back to Venice i would choose a different hotel.
