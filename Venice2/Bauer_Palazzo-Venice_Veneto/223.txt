We chose to stay one night after our Cruise but it was a wonderful stay from early morning to the next morning. It was extremely hot and as we were not able to go to our room before 3.00pm we explored Venice. The concierge gave us all the best places to visit as we had not been to Venice before.  he was very helpful. Our beautiful room was on the 2nd floor and the Canal ran along the side. The roof top was a stunning place to end the evening watching the Grand Canal  A tip though exit the lift with great care as the carpet leading out to the roof top is black and white and ismetric  and I had a very nasty fall. Breakfast was continental but there was hot egg bacon sausages too.  We would love to stay again for longer as It was in a wonderful position to see all the highlights ofâ€¦
