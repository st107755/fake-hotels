A beautiful, clean and well kept hotel throughout. We booked an executive suite for our 25th anniversary , the room was a joy to stay in , well appointed , fabulous linens and towels, huge comfy bed and well decorated. The breakfast was great , good choices and Roberta , who worked in the breakfast room, was so pleasant and helpful. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the Saturday evening and the meal was well presented and very tasty. If I'm going to be picky, this is a five star luxury hotel after all, is that the entrance carpet to suite 453 is starting to look a little threadbare in places and the shower seal needed attention, but that is being very picky!! I would love to stay again ,  it was great to feel special.
