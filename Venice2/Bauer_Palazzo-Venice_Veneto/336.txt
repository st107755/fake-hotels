The Bauer Palazzo  is actually 2 buildings. The old one facing the grand canal an another building behind. This information is not clear  when  you book a room.When we arrived we found out our rooms were in the hotel part, reception and lobby area looks as if we were in the 90's. corridors had no carpets, rooms was specious , bathroom was ok - Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel. Garbage was collected every day at 5:45 ( the noise woke up up).Breakfast on the terrace and the location were the only nice experiences we had.  When booking make sure in which part of the building you will be staying.
