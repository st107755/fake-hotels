very nice hotel in a great location. staff very, very pleasant. breakfast was good with ample choices. the view from the roof terrace where it was served was sublime. we arrived early on our check in day and to our amazement, both rooms were ready. my biggest complaint would be the noise level in the bathrooms of our room. we were in 748 and we could hear everything in the bathroom next door. the decor in our room was beautiful. the public spaces, esp hallways are a little run down..  however, the view off of our balcony was amazing. our boys were a few rooms down. their room was acceptable. overall, the staff make this place special. it reminds of the st regis in rome without the overall wow factor or opulence.
