We stayed in the modern part of the hotel,  which is impressively located, a stone's throw from St Mark's Square. Unfortunately this was the best thing about it. Our room & en suite bathroom, although spacious, seemed blandly corporate & averagely equipped for the hefty price. We've had better showers in 2 star Italian hotels & a greater choice of bathroom toiletries in many others. Housekeeping was sporadic but efficient when things were finally attended to. Breakfast (which is served in the palazzo part of the hotel) was also way below what we've had in other 5 star places; predictably buffet style but with a boring & limited selection. If you can sit outside on the terrace, the view is breath-taking but doesn't offer sufficient mitigation to persuade us to stay here again.
