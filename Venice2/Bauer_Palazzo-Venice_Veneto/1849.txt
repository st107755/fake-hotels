A Grand Hotel with a perfect location for a first timer. Only steps from Alilaguna airport bus and San Marco. Our room 538 was quiet, large with terrace and had great views. It has a flat screen TV with some satellite channels. WiFi for 20â‚¬ per stay is provided. Friendly staff at reception and within the breakfast ballroom-  Bar and breakfast selections are only average and heavily overpriced. Among the highest room rates in Venice also in low season.  As we now know our way around we will choose a better value hotel next time and will avoid the whole pricey San Marco Sestiere.
