Our last experience and visit was in October 2012 during our anniversary. The 4 day stay in Venice was the best destination to choose in order to celebrate a romantic celebration.   The hotel Bauer is a five star hotel just 3 minutes walk from St Marks famous square and church and the shopping area where all famous brands and cultural shops are.   From Piazzale Roma we took a private water taxi to the hotel's entrance.   Our beautiful room had a view to the condola's canal. But the most amazing view was from the De Pisis restaurant where it looks to the grand canal sitting on the beautifull veranda.   Tehe service was excellent and the staff very friendly and for sure we will return back to the beautifull and historical Venice and choose to stay to to the Bauer hotel.
