This hotel is beautifully located right in the heart of San Marco but having just spent three nights here, this is its single biggest asset.  Despite the cost, the accommodation is outdated, basic amenities were lacking from the room (shampoo, conditioner, coffee making facilities), front desk staff were pretty dismissive and the breakfast was ordinary at best.  The reality is Venice is a unique place and as a result everything is expensive but this is no five star experience.
