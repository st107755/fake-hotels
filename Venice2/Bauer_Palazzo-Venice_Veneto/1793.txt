We arrived late and were greeted by friendly smiling reception staff who noted that it was my birthday the next day and allocated us a room on the second floor with balcony overlooking the canal and gondaliers!  (One of only four with balconies!)  We had an amazing stay, the restaurant was lovely, food was excellent, view second to none, and we didn't find it any more expensive than some of the local restaurants in St Marks. Breakfast was included in our package deal which was a plus as normally 49.50 euros pp. We would highly recommend this hotel to all, situated close to St Marks Square and the blueline waterbus (which was an easy  and pretty 1hr 20 min trip from the airport for 13 euros, one way). Don't get confused and buy a goldline ticket for 25 eauros from the airportâ€¦
