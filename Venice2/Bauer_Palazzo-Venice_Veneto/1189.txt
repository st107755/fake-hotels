At the very heart of things but off the main drag, the Bauer is ideally situated for high end shopping or sightseeing in every direction. Our Superior room was airy and very comfortable, breakfast on the hotel's terrace with a spectacular view across the Grand Canal, add blue sky and sunshine and it doesn't get much better than this!!
