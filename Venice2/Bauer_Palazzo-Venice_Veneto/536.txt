Hotel Bauer is a very comfortable terrific smaller hotel in the heart of San Marco beside a busy godola station. It is surrounded by all the upscale shops. The long front desk at entry is always well staffed with warm greetings out and back. The lobby bar at the rear with a courtyard on the big canal is a gem. It is small, comfortable, and great for relaxing to generous drinks after shopping and touring.
