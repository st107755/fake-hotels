“I go to Venice annually for the Biennale and always find this intimate, chic hotel doesn’t disappoint! Located in the heart of the city next to one of the best shopping streets, it is in my opinion: the perfect choice. An authentic Venetian style palazzo, the hotel has its own private dock to the Grand Canal and is just steps away from the Piazza San Marco. We spend our days out - apart from the art buying, socializing and chattering about artists - taking advantage of the ‘City of Water,’ and are happy to come home to the plush comfort of our spacious room and pampering service here.”
