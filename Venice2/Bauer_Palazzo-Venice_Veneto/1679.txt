My wife and kids had the great fortune to stay at this hotel.  The property was perfectly located along the Grand Canal with a side canal that drops you off at the hotels front door.  Upon our arrival, we were upgraded to two suites overlooking the canal.  Needless to say, the trip started off great.  We were there only one night as we were departing on a cruise the next day.  The hotel is first class and the staff was great.  The concierge was a bit overwhelmed but his attitude did not detract from my overall stay.  Not cheap, but well worth it.
