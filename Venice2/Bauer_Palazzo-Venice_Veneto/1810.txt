We stayed at Bauer when came to visit the Biennale Arcitecture exposition last year. And I never had to regret the choice! The hotel manages to keep and trasmit the genuine antique Vanetian atmosphere and to combine it with top-class modern levels of comfort and service! If you want to get a full immersion into the spirit of this wonderful city and to be sure that every your request would be satisfied by the hotel's staff, then this is defenitely a hotel for you! And yes, the "B bar" downsairs is one of places more "in" for having a drink in Venice.
