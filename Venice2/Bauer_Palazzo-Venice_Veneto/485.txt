Right on the grand canal and brilliantly located for st Marks square. Interesting furniture and objects everywhere. Staff were exceptional- courteous, professional, knowledgeable. Comfortable rooms and beds- our bathroom had marble with sparkly bits in it. there was some music on Friday night from jazz below but we were able to get to sleep. Breakfast was extensive but bacon rather salty. Breakfast room has a view with bobbing gondolas. We arrived here by water taxi from the airport. It's rather special.
