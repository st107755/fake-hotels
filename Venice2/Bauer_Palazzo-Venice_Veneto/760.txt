Great staff. Very helpful and informed. Brilliant, almost perfect location close enough to be in the midst of everything, not too close you felt in a tourist hell.  Our family suite was big and well furnished. Comfy bed and two bathrooms were great.  The breakfast on the terrace is amazing for a location but the quality of the food could do with a little improvement if I'm honest.   I would definitely go back though and would be happy to stay there with or without kids if I return to Venice.
