hotel is rated a 5 star but i feel it is a 3 star.  found hotel employees to have a very anti-american attitude.  first words out of desk clerks mouth to us were "you americans".  had problems with concierge trying to over charge us for airport transfer.  had been quoted 130 euros then asked for 180 euros...cash only! a bellmen entered our room without knocking.  i think he was going to rob us. no explanation was given.  same thing happened on day 2.  i would never stay here again.  extremely arrogant and rude  staff.  we travel frequently and are very easy to get along with.
