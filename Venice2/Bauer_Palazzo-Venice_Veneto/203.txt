There are two Bauer hotels on opposite sides of Venice and we stayed at the one near St Marco Square but there is a shuttle to the one on the other side which is worth visiting.  The rooms were very nice and the bed comfortable.  We had a bit of an issue because the maid closed the external blind and it took us 24 hours to work out how to open it - in case it happens to you there is an unmarked switch next to the bed, saves keeping the light on.  The food at night was really good but the breakfast buffet left quite a bit to be desired.
