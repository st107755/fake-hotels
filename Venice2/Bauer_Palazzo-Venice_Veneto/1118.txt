You can't beat the location. This is literally 2 minutes walk from St. Mark's Square and right by the water! My husband and I were in Venice for our honeymoon. We emailed them ahead of time to request for a higher floor for our room and letting them know that this is our honeymoon trip and they're very prompt and friendly at replying to our email. Once we arrived there, to our surprise, our room was upgraded to Junior Suite! The service was so amazing and it couldn't get any better. Definitely recommend this hotel to everyone!!
