Arrived from the airport by water taxi (the only way to arrive). Greated by doorman who wisked our luggage away. At reception warmly greated but we were early so room not ready, no problrm we went for our first look round St Marks Square. Came back to hotel and greated by same receptionist who informed us that we had been upgraded, great. Escorted to our room which was fabulous 4th floor room with balcony overlooking the street. Went for drink in the bar, great bar staff we got to know well during our stay. Drinks expensive but this is Venice and what we expected. Only downside was breakfast not a great choice of hot options and some items were only warm. My parner asked for pouched eggs but informed this would be an additional charge.Overall though fabulous stay in greatâ€¦
