We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights pre-cruise on recommendation from Princess Cruises. It was a truly lovely hotel and difficult to fault. The location, on the Grand Canal was great and only a short walk from St Mark's Square.   Gondoliers did trips from immediately outside the hotel and the concierge was happy to negotiate prices. He was also most helpful in identifying locations of a card shop and a supermarket and the shortest route to the Rialto Bridge  A super breakfast buffet was included in the price of our room. However, we did feel that 18 Euros for 2 coffees on the terrace was extortionate!.
