Spent two nights at this worn down facility. First experience was the staff dropping a suitcase of ours in the river. Staff said it was ok and dry, but surely most of the clothes was soaking wet. After some hassle they agreed to wash the clothes only to demand a full payment of 330 euros by check out. The staff wouldnâ€™t let our party leave without payment, so we had a hard time reaching our airplane. Quite unbelievable.
