The hotel services didn’t meet our expectations. Location is amazing and they offer nice and big room. But those didn’t compensate the flaws we’ve noticed during our stay: -WiFi was awful, I had stronger WiFi signal from the hotel next door, it was amazingly difficult to connect to Bauer’s. Three stars hotels offer better WiFi  -just average breakfast, hot beverages took forever to be served. And we’ve witnessed the staff discussing among themselves in front of all guests, that’s unacceptable for a 5-star hotel -room air conditioning had some problem, we arrived one afternoon and it took like 30 minutes to start working. Housekeeping came in to check, couldn’t find the problem, then had to call maintenance. It was summer and around 32o Celsius outside. I think the only advantage…
