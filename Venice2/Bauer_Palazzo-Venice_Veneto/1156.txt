I was in Venice for Save Venice Carnevale last year and this was the hotel Save Venice recommended. I had prior knowledge of it, and thus did not know what to expect. It was exquisite! The staff was congenial, the rooms well appointed and cozy. I've read multiple reviews citing the rooms are small and I have to say that is just Americans equating size to quality. Its Europe,  rooms are smaller! I had a five star experience and I will definitely be back.
