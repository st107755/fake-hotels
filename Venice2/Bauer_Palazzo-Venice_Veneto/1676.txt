I hesitated for a long time before choosing the Bauer Il Palazzo because I had very high expectations and was not disappointed: it’s a real 5 star Palazzo and it’s location 2 minutes away from the Piazza San Marco is ideal to discover Venice (and the view on the Grand Canal is great).   The Bauer Il Palazzo should not be mistaken for the Bauer that is next to it but has now view on the Grand Canal and is a modern building when the Bauer Il Palazzo is a former Palazzo turned into a hotel! We had two different rooms during our 5 days stay: we started with a Deluxe room that was gorgeous Venetian style: red floors and tapestry, a separate living room, murano glass…45 square meter (roughly 450 square feet) was large enough for the time we spent there, there is so much to see…
