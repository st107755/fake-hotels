This is a hotel fairy tales are made of...from the time you arrive via boat, everything is taken care of for you.  The service is sublime! Our room was a suite facing the Grand canal.  It was very spacious as was the bathroom. I could barely sleep at night because I felt like a child on Christmas Eve hearing the noises of the evening traffic of the canals,  the beautiful ceiling paintings, the crisp Italian linens...The hotel is in the perfect location for all walking attractions,  St. Mark's Square is 5 mins away if that! Breakfast is included with the stunning views. Cannot wait to go back!
