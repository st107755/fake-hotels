The hotel is close to all the attractions yet just far enough away to be quiet in the evenings.  The outside area was great for drinks in the evening and breakfast in the morning.  The room was larger than I expected for Venice.  The only "negative" may be value.  The room was fairly pricey and while nice - it was not extraordinary.  This was my only visit to Venice so I can't compare it to any other hotels.  The staff was helpful, the room was clean and spacious.  I would consider staying here again.
