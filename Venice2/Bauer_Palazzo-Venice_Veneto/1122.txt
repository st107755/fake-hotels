We really enjoyed an excellent time during our stay at Bauer. The location of the hotel is perfect... near the sea and St. Mark's square. The hotel staff are very helpful and courteous. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the view from the breakfast room was amazing. I would stay at this hotel again during my next visit to Venice.
