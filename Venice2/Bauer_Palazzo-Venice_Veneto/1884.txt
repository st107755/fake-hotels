It was our first time to Europe and so I wanted to be sure we stayed somewhere central and recommended by other travellers. I was not disappointed with the Bauer! The location is prime - near St. Marks, on the Grand Canal, central for the miles and miles of walking you are prone to do while in Venice. Somehow, no matter how twisted around or lost we got navigating through the narrow corridors of Venice, we always wound up right back at the front door of the Bauer.  Having a home base that was pristine, safe with attentive staff made our time there very pleasant. We paid a premium as we made late reservations, but it included the breakfast, which was wonderful!   The internet access was little problematic - not quite sure what the problem was but their connection was down or weakâ€¦
