We stayed 3 nights at the Bauer in March 2016. While the hotel has a superb location, and food and drink was very good, it is the service that is truly outstanding. Whether from the Concierge, or wait staff, or the bellboy, it is warm, hospitable and very professional. The room itself was fine, smaller than we expected for a deluxe suite and less of an interesting view than we had hoped, however we came away delighted with our stay as a consequence of the wonderful staff.
