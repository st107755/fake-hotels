Venice was our last stop on our Italy vacation...we only stayed there one day/night.  Our travel consultant booked us in the Bauer and we couldn't have been happier.  The hotel is stunning as it sits right on the Grand Canal.  It has its own water taxi stand.  We had drinks in the rooftop bar at night and the view was lovely.  Breakfast on the Grand Canal the next morning was wonderful and they give you an enormous and delicious breakfast spread to choose from.  The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was by far the largest in our entire stay in Italy. Terrific location as it is around the corner from San Marcos square and close to great restaurants. We were only there one night but it was so lovely and worth every penny.  Highly recommend!
