For location, the Bauer is hard to beat, 5 star hotel, great service and nice accomodations...for Venice. Our rooms were on the canal and the views were great. The breakfast buffet is quite good and the views from the 7th floor are stunning. The staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I would pass on the main restaurant, ther are others that have a menu that has more selections and the overall food quality was fair, great venue, beautiful views but, you can do better somewhere else. I would stay here again. you are just steps away from San Marco and the trip to Murano is great, the arrangement with a top glass house is worth going to visit. Ask for Luigi.
