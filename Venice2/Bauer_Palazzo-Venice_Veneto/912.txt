The place is really  fancy and elegant,  super well located few steps  from Piazza San  Marcos and absolutely  close to other important  places in Venice.  My room had a nice view to the canal  next to the hotel and to the old roofs  os buildings  nearby, I lived the bathtub  and the bed which  took me to the past (comfort  & elegance)  Staff was cool and friendly  from beginning  to end.   Breakfast  was nice but should be served  from  6:30 A. M.  and terrace  to Grand Canal should be open always.
