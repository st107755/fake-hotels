An excellent hotel. Perfect location on the canal half block from San Marco.  Relatively modern for Venice. Courteous and helpful staff. We book a room in Casanova, the main hotel annex across the side street. Newly renovated spacious room. Two large windows and a lot of light.  Large marble bathroom with a tub, a separate shower, and a bidet.  Luggage were brought to the room. We have full access to the main hotel.  Significantly exceeded our expectations.  Breakfast on the terrace on the Grand Canal is a memorable experience.
