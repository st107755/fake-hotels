Really disapointed. I was expecting more for a five star hotel. The basic of basics you would expect is a kettle in your room. First you hava to ask for it to be brought to your room, but then 2 tea bags are 20 euros! Extortion when your already paying so much. Plus, booked a double room, they gave me a twin! And then offered to put the beds together because they messed up the booking. Breakfast is average as well. Really regretting chosing the Bauer over another hotel we had been looking at. Certainly not returning. Don't get swayed by the 5 star rating. It is not 5 star....
