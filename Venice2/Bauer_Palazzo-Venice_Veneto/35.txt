Our room looked out over The Grand Canal towards a large cathedral with a dome. Beautiful every day. Its only a block from St. Mark's Square. Located on an upscale shopping street. Our room was very quiet as the hallways are divided up to avoid long spans. Its pretty cool taking a water taxi right to the hotel's door. Will go back again someday.
