Arrived at the hotel and apparently was upgraded to  Superior Suite which looked like the room that was booked already in the first place,however what was booked was a KIng Bed and it was 2 Singles together about as comfortable as a bed of nails, Had walked into Hotel next night to ask for a kettle for the room and was told it was part of room service and there is a charge of 5 euros, had to argue my case that I am standing in your reception with 2 arms and to 2 legs and that I can carry the kettle to the room,again Argued and this was Desk Manager at night time and I had finally tell him and raise my voice that had no issues with Rome and no Issues in Verona and your trying to Rip me off,finally some common sense was delivered to the Manager....Impressed I was not...22 Eurosâ€¦
