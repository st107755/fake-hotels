The hotel was fantastic! Centrally located in Venice surrounded by canals in a church square it is the perfect setting in the island of love. The hotel itself has old world beauty, with the rooms reflecting all of its charm. the staff could not be more helpful, the concierge the best of any place I've stayed. in particular Sarah did not know the word no, and always took the time regardless of how many people were waiting to make you feel like you were the only one staying at the hotel. Stefano was also extremely helpful, and make sure you get tickets to the Ducal palace from them to avoid the long lines .  A lot can be learned in the restaurant as well as the bar from the other services provided by the hotel. This is the only thing that stopped me from giving them 5 stars. â€¦
