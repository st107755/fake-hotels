We are thrilled with our hotel choice in Venice! We are staying in the older part of the hotel that oozes charm and elegance! Soaring ceilings, marble bath room, heavenly toiletries! Every member of the staff has been welcoming and helpful. Gaia at front desk and Lucia at breakfast in particular. Great location, great views, great, great hotel!!
