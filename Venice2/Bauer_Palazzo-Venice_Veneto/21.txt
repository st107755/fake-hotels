I spent a week at this hotel. I then flew from Venice to Vienna to stay @ my go to Hotel Sacher. All I could talk about when I arrived was how brilliant their current General Manager is. I had the pleasure of meeting a very active, charming and I suspect one of the best in the game. Hard game!  It was a perfect stay. I was acknowledged... looked after like a Queen. Beautiful, comfortable room. The staff you won’t fault. Position perfect.  Breakfast generous. Room service... 15 euros for delivery... no, no, no.  Having stayed in Venice many a time. Bauer Hotel... you have won me!  Special thanks to Marco... Concierge... exceptional, you were the icing on the cake!  Paulo... Concierge... I drove you mad but you send me to the best restaurant of the stay. Grazie!  Five star plus.…
