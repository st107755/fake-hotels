OMG, I love Venice, and I love the Bauer Hotel!  We stayed here as part of our Tauck tour.  We had never been to Venice before; taking the boat to pull right up to the hotel was amazing.  It was our 40th anniversary and the hotel gave us the most unbelievable room overlooking the Grand Canal!  I will never forget the room; I felt like a princess.  Over-the-top elegance with fabric on the walls.  We were in the heart of Venice, with gondolas and music right outside our window!
