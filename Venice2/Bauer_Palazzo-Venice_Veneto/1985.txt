Upon arrival at the Bauer, we were greated with a tired hello.  During the check-in process we were not informed of the complimentary breakfast that was included with our rate.  The staff proved to be some of the rudest people I've ever encountered during a hotel stay.  The rooms are nothing to cheer about especially for 300 Euros.  Save your money and stay somewhere else.
