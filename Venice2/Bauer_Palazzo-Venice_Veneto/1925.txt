This is a wonderful hotel.  It is best when it is not busy.  The staff is extremely helpful, but be aware...this is not for the budget-minded.  Every single thing is expensive.  Try to look for a plan where the breakfast is included.  It can be delivered to your room for an extra charge.  The dining, however, is better at other hotels.
