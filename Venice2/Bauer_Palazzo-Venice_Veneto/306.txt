All staff we encountered were helpful and professional. This includes waitstaff, bartenders, bellmen, maid service, and front desk.  Our room (333) was clean, comfortable, spacious, elegant, and quiet. It was the perfect refuge after time out among the rest of us tourists.  Hotel location is at the center of the most spectacular district. The included breakfast can be taken inside or on the patio with glorious views of the canal.  Complaining about fog or dampness in Venice is like visiting Jackson Hole Wyoming in January and complaining about snow. Itâ€™s the nature of the location.  I am unhesitatingly recommending the Bauer Palazzo.
