The first thing to say is this is really two hotels, one of which is more expensive and exclusive (Palazzo) with a separate dining terrace. We were in the less exclusive end with the ground level terrace, and a room overlooking the side canal. Great location right on the main shopping street, though with eye-watering prices to match.   Up in a tiny lift (Americans beware!), down a tiled corridor with strange glass cabinets displaying bottles of wine and other oddities, our room was perfectly nice, reasonably sized with good storage. The bed was comfortable though the pillows were lumpy and unyielding. One bottle of water provided on the first night was not replaced for the second so we had to resort to the minibar for water.  Breakfast: great setting right on the Grand Canal ifâ€¦
