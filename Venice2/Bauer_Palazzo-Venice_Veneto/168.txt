Bauer Palazzo was our first hotel upon arriving to Italy for the first time. The location is perfect where one side you have access to the 'Rodeo Drive' stores and the other side is the Grand Canal water views. Andrea and Stefano made our anniversary stay amazing! We were upgraded to a beautiful room with a terrace where we can overlook Venice and partial of the Grand Canal - 7th floor is the highest in Venice. And it was the same floor as where we would have delicious breakfast and evening drinks.  The views were spectacular! It was so nice to be able to walk everywhere. There was one day that the service in the outdoor bar on the main level was very very slow. Every customer was complaining to the staff at the restaurant next door since there seemed to be more staff available.â€¦
