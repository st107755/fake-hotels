This hotel is located in the very heart of Venice and famouse for it's beautiful building and long history. The room is not big but such size is tipical for the hotel in Old Europe. Service is impeccable, I couldn't see any problem there. The price reflects to the best location, service and quality of everything in this nice hotel
