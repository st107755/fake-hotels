This is a beautiful hotel conveniently location on the Grand Canal and just around the corner from Piazza de San Marco. The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Our room was spacious, clean and we were very well attended to. The view of the Grand Canal from the outdoor patio and restaurant is amazing. I would stay here again.
