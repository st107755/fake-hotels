Due to a strike of Alitalia, our 3 day/2 night trip was shortened by one day. We checked with the airline and could move our tickets to a future date. A good idea, only the hotel would not agree to changing our reservation to a future date.  As we had booked 2 double rooms for 2 nights, we were very disappointed at the less than elegant response of the hotel.  Even our suggestion of a complimentary gesture to make up for the lost night (2 rooms including breakfast), the hotel was unwilling to even consider a friendly gesture. A good hotel, but we will not recommend it to fellow travelers.  Bauer is indeed a 5 star hotel, but their customer friendliness is far below 5 star standard.
