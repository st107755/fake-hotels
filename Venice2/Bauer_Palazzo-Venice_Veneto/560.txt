Having travelled on the Orient Express to Venice, we wanted to maintain our luxury holiday experience, so we booked the Bauer Hotel. 5 star former palace located minutes from St Mark's Square. Understated when you first arrive, the hotel rooms are really spacious and luxurious. We dined there too and have our best food in Venice. I would totally recommend this hidden gem in a superb location.
