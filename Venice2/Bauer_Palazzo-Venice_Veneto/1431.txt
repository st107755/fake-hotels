To be frank, I don't agree with most of the reviews on here and perhaps it's a personal thing but I thought I would voice my opinion.  We stayed at the Bauer for 4 nights in the summer and what I can say that if you want a typical Venice experience then feel free to stay here and I'm sure you'll have a good time.  However, when we stayed we payed around 800 a night for our rooms and I have to say I've stayed in 3 star hotels that the service was better in. I'm not sure how most people are on holiday but when I am away I'm not in 'showing off' mode (here's a drink to you, 10 bob millionaires) but the staff seem to think you should be. So excuse me for not donning a Prada miniskirt and Gucci Blazer, you see I'm not entirely comfortable in 40 degree heat and would rather wearâ€¦
