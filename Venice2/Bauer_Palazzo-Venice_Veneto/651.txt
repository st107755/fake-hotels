We arrived at the hotel on private taxi the Hotel has private small pier at the front on the Grand Canal, the porter was their to take our bagage & assist us to the front desk. The Hotel was amazing inside very impressed. We were quickly checked in & shown to our room which had a partial view onto the side canal & also onto the main canal. The room was large amazing high ceilings, small hall containing the walkin waldrobe & the bathroom with an additional bedroom door. The bedrooms are so quite we never heard a thing from other guests or from outside electric blinds on the outside of the windows ensure complete darkness. The bathroom was nice & large opal colored marble good shower plenty of room. There is a private terrace which guests that stay in the Palazzo can use withâ€¦
