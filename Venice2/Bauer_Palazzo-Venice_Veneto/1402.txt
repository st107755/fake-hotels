This hotel has it all…glamour, style, location, quality, serviceability. Must admit I have seen many good hotels and this is one of best I’ve been to.  Perfectly located, footsteps away from Pza. St. Marco, Harry's Bar and on the Grand Canal. Rooms are huge and well decorated.  The rumor has it that Tom Ripley spends his time here, when in Venice. Hope to come again soon!
