I stayed in room 434 at the Bauer Hotel in Venice.  WONDERFUL room with a lovely patio overlooking the square.  The view from the patio is the lovely church in the square and the beautiful sculpture.  The patio is a wonderful escape from the heat and crowds of Venice in the afternoon.  Overall, the Bauer hotel was a delight.  Perfect European charm, wonderfully decorated, amazing food and drinks.  The bar (looking over the canals of Venice) has wonderful music, great food, and don't forget to try a Venice Aperol Spritzer.  Lobby is a cool oasis from the heat and crowds, beds are comfortable, bathrooms are very nice and have very nice local bath products.  Most importantly, the location is prime.  Steps away from St, Marks, surrounded by the best boutiques and luxury stores,â€¦
