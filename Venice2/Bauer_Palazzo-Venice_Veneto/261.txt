I actually stayed at this hotel a few years ago but have to say it was everything I had hoped for. Service and Staff was incredibly accommodating and treated us royally. Location was great. Food was great. Close to Saint Marks and shopping! The ambience was "Venice" at it's greatest. Old world elegance! At night we would sit on the terrace and listen to the music of Venice! Romance...Romance... I LOVE VENICE! Great Boutique Hotel.  #travelDivaDayna Dayna Pappalardo
