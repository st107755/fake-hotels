Can it get any better in Venice? - the rooms are spacious and elegantly appointed - the concierge (Carlo) is extremely helpful and made it a very pleasant stay for us - the food at the restaurant was niot so much our thing, other restaurants (such as the A Beccafico offer better vakue for money) - the continental breakfast buffet had a good selection of cold meats and cheeses - the location is supurb and nothing beats that breakfast on the terrace whilst watching the gondolas pass by
