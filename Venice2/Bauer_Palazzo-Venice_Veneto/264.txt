You could not find a more spectacular position in Venice.  The  terrace is one of the most desirable places to sit and sip proseco in the whole city.  I visited with a group of work colleagues who had all won and incentive. This would be a perfect place for a couple also  . I had a nice room and it was grand and immaculate and I always love a Turn Down service which obviously in a 5* you would expect  I would highly recomend a room with a view if travelling as a couple - the view is very romantic   Service is exemplary and understated and subtle   The beakfast is superb with fruit, freshly squeezed juices, pastries, breads, sumptuous cakes and also a continental meat and hot cooked buffet  Top tip - the icing sugar covered baked apples are a dream - ask for a take away coffeeâ€¦
