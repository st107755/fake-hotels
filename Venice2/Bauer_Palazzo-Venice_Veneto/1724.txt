From the airport to the hotel we were driven boat. It's so beautiful when you see on the horizon, Venice, she is getting closer and closer ... It is fantastic! Located in the heart of Venice. Around the hotel there are souvenir shops... We bought gifts to relatives. The room was overlooking the canal. Window shutters, as of old. At night, hear the water beating against the wall. Very romantic. The room is decorated with beautiful paints. Breakfast is very diverse, huge selection of food. Restaurant with a beautiful view over the Grand Canal. Dinner in the restaurant is also very good, excellent selection of wines and seafood dishes.
