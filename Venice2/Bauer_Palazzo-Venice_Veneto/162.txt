The best thing about the Bauer is the location.  We had a suite with 3 kids occupying the sitting room on fold-aways.  The room was comfortable with good strong showers and the towels were replenished twice a day.  I mention this only because summer in Venice involves a lot of walking in hot sunshine and that means sweat... lots of sweat.  So to be able to return to the room from time to time to refreshen with a cool shower was simply... lurvvv-lee.  Breakfast on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal is superb.  Breakfast itself was standard buffet style - don't expect fabulous.     We hired the rooftop jacuzzi and that was a cool experience... they serve you Prosecco and strawberries too and the views over the rooftops is Wow !!
