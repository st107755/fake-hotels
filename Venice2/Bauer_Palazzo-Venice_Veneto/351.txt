Having a special family weekend away we wanted to stay somewhere with a terrace overlooking the grand canal and this place doesn't disappoint. Breakfast and evening drinks can be taken looking over the canal whucgbis great (the pigeons can be a bit annoying and will set onto any table recently vacated but it's bearable). The views are fabulous and it's a few minutes walk from St Marks square. Rooms were a decent size and comfy beds with shutters on the windows to provide a true blackout environment. Some delays with ordering drinks on the terrace but when you have that view you can forgive the.
