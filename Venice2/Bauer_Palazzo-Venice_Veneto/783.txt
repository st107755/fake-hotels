Water taxi dropped us off at the great Bauer Hotel location on the canal. Classy, friendly staff and lobby. Arrived a bit early and requested early check-in.  Wasn't immediately available, but the square is only a couple of blocks away, and we toured until about 1pm, ate a nice lunch on a bustling Venice avenue, and then got our room.  Nice hotel restaurant location with an awesome canal water view from the terrace. Views are like out of a travel documentary.  Upscale hotel d√©cor fits the Venice setting.  Great location near the square. Took a gondola ride, and the singer could have won American Idol. Very nice breakfast buffet, attentive service and the Venice morning was a beautiful one.  Didn't want to leave.
