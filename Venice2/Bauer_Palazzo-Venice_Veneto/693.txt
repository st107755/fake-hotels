Stayed at the Bauer for 2 nights before a cruise, the hotel is without doubt the best located in Venice, it has the best restaurant deck overlooking the Grand Canal and the main entrance is literally 100 metres from St Marks Square. Along with other 5 star hotels in Venice the Bauer is not cheap, but if you want to arrive at a private mooring in the centre of Venice with no hassle then this is for you.  The Bauer's location means that you can see every sight on foot and a Gondola station is right at the front door. Other 5 star hotels in Venice are located across the canal and you have to take a complimentary hotel boat to cross to the St Marks side, this is not always made clear with some of the hotels on that side of the canal.  The De Pisis restaurant is indeed a fine diningâ€¦
