Recommended by a seasoned traveler and friend, like ourselves, we took the advice and booked two nights and we are very pleased we did. We had a very nice traditional Tuscany decorated room, spacious and lovely. Would have preferred a view to top this out completely but the Bauer location is so advantageous that was not entirely a factor. We took the water taxi from the train station and while expensive, we were on splurge and it was well worth the introduction to this magic city.     You really cannot mention this property without addressing the dining area and breakfast buffet. World class experience, quality and the view well...its just a dream, get in if you can, it really is very special. Thankyou to the great staff, super friendly.
