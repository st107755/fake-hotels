After reading several of the reviews on this site, I was concerned about the booking I had made at Bauer hotel. However, our experience was excellent! Although there only two days, we really enjoyed our stay. The location was tremendous and only a few minutes walk to San Marco. The hotel is situated directly on the canal, and the morning breakfast is served on the terrace where you can enjoy the views. We enjoyed good service as well and found the rooms to be nicely appointed.
