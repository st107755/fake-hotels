Huge entrance, very good reception staff. Room very comfortable with massive double bed. Bathroom had everything one could ever want. Cleaned twice a day. Fantastic breakfast sitting right by the grand canal watching the gondelors. Amazing bar on floor 7. With view over the canal. Only downside was price of the drinks on floor 7. They were ridiculously expensive but the view was phenomenal.
