We spend 4 wonderful days at  the Bauer Hotel. The hotel is located close to  San Marco basilica.  We had a suite with a veranda, overlooking the canal and a lively street. The hotel is beautiful, the room was spacious, the service impeccable and breakfast was great.It is expensive but really worth it.
