We we lucky enough to come back to the Bauer. They now have great jazz performances on Friday and Saturday nights. Roberto Manca is an excellent concierge who advised us on restaurants, booked reservations and arranged for a water taxi to the train station. Very attentive and friendly. The breakfast here is wonderful and the decor is not to be missed. Great outdoor patio for drinks, lunch, etc. Incredible view of the grand canal. Gondolas are right out the front door. The boats with singing gondoliers travel down along the side of the outdoor patio to the grand canal. Special and fun.
