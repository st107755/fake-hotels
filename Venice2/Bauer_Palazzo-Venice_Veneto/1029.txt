My mother and I stayed at The Bauer Hotel for 5 nights in June 2015 and we were so pleased we did. The location is perfect- right on the Grand Canal and the front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful...they gave us great restaurant recommendations and advice on how to get to places we wanted to visit. The breakfast on the terrace every morning was heavenly not only for it's view but also the quality of the food and service. We hesitated on whether to spend the extra money on this hotel but were so glad we did as it was worth it. Would recommend staying in this lovely hotel to anyone. Thank you to the staff, you were all brilliant :-)
