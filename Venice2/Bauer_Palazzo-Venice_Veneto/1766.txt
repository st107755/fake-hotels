We had a good Expedia rate for a room in the Casa Nova annex but were upgraded to the main hotel at check in.  Other than lack of view (and we had never been promised a view) the room was virtually perfect, including a luxurious bathroom, bath robes, and comfortable bed.   Prices at the restaurant and bar are expensive but -- with the exception of the 50 euro breakfast -- did not seem out of line with the market.  What really stands out for us was the very professional yet friendly service, which included them doing a quick room check as we were checking out and finding our passports for us before we realized we had forgotten them!  The location is also virtually ideal -- close to St. Mark's but just far enough way to not be mobbed.
