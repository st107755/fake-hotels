Located on the Grand Canal, the Bauer has everything you need.  Very close to St. Mark's square. Breakfast was included. Go the the rooftop for a great view.  The Bauer also  has a water door.  Your luggage can be dropped directly at the bellman, rather that lugging it around Venice yourself.  Concierge had great recommendations for dining!  The elevator is a little small but worked for us. Hint, ask about FREE transportation to Murano.
