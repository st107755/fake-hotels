Greeted by friendly staff upon arrival and through out.  Pretty rooms.  Fantastic breakfast and you could have prosecco with it too for free.  Amazing location, under 5 mins walk from St Marks Square.  It really did live up to my expectation. Only downside is that the bar charges you £13 mojito and £17 for a pimms. Very pricey and not great, infact it was awful.
