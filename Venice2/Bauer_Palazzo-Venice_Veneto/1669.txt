This was my third time at the Il Palazzo, I was with my 19 year old Grandaughter. We were on a cruise ship and I saw it was overnighting in Venice. Even though it would have saved quite a bit of money to stay on the ship, I could not resist the chance to show her sheer Luxury. Of course the Bauer Il Palazzo did not disappoint. The service, the private check in, the bedding, everything was incredible (once again).
