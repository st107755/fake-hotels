Stayed here on our last 2 days in Italy with my sister and 2 teenage boys. It was terrific. The staff was very accomodating. We had 2 fantastic rooms that shared a single door to the hallway but separate doors and keys to reach each allowing the boys the illusion that they were on their own. The rooms overlooked the little side canal. The view on the Grand Canal in the restaurant at breakfast can't be beat. Boys complained that the internet access was expensive but really what isn't in this fabulous city?
