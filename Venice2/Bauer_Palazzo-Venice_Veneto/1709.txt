As soon as you walk into the Bauer lobby you feel like you are at an upscale hotel. The staff are all nice and seem happy to be working there. The concierge was so nice, funny and helpful. The breakfast buffet was by far the best of the 3 hotels we visited in Italy.  The rooms are small. Our room opened to a canal that had gondola's going by all the time, but when the windows were closed, you could not hear them.
