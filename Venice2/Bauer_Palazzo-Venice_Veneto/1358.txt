We arrived via water taxi at the Bauer Il Palazzo for a 2 night stay. We were warmly greeted at the front desk and told we had been upgraded to a Grand Canal view room. The room was large and comfortable. The breakfast on the roof terrace was fantastic and staff was very accommodating. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay at the Bauer Il Palozzo again.
