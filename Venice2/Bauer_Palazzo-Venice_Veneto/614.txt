After reading some of these negative reviews I was a little nervous at first. We stayed in Room 530 on the modern side of the hotel. The room was large and beautiful. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was amazing sitting on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. The hotel is in a great location,  and all the sites are easily walkable. Just be prepared to walk a lot. We walked 9 miles each day we were there, to get around Venice. I Really can't find anything negative and I would not hesitate to recommend staying at the Bauer
