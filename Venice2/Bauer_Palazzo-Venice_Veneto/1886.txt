It was for a weekend trip my husband's birthday. Booked with ebookers then contacted hotel to request a nice room. They gave us upgraded room with jacouzi was so impressed with thier customer service. Lovely hotel, great location quieter area of the centre of venice only 2 min walk to san marco square though. The fact it was directly infront of the Prada store was a bonus for me!! The breakfast was lovely .. amazing views of the main canal. The hotel itself is luxery but not "old and tatty". Rooms clean and the bathroom was new and v clean which is very imp for us.  All in all highly recommended .. v glad did not stay at the danilie as almost booked there!
