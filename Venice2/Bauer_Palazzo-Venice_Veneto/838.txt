Perfect location, Great breakfast with very nice waitresses and of course unbelievable sight. Maybe you think their menu are expensive but you'll get all your moneyâ€™s worth. however they are so good, I don't believe this hotel is Unexceptionable though, for example they resor was most cheap razor in the market so if you choose this hotel don't forget your shaving machine or Gillette!!
