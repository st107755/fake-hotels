We stayed 3 nights in the Casanova Superior Suite and was an amazing experience. Very good conditions, cleaned room and facilities. Every night someone opened our bed and put some slippers on the floor for us. Amazing breakfast, a lot of choices and the most amazing view to the canal. Recomended for everyone.
