The Palazzo had all the charm of Venice we could have asked for, modern where it needed to be yet worldly every place else.  The perfect combination.  We were upgraded to room 309 which faced the Grand Canal.  Wow what a view.  I said this to myself each morning and evening.  Our breakfast was up on the seventh floor outside on the patio.  The breakfast was fantastic and the view up top breathtaking.  While this hotel is truly expensive, I wouldn't have traded it for another during our four day stay.  The staff were so friendly and eager to assist.  Their private boat was nice as well taking guest back and forth to their other property and spa.  Where else could you get a free boat ride in Venice?  Would stay again for sure.
