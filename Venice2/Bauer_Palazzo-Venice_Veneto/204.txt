I wish I could rate the Bauer Palazzo higher than 5 stars, because it was that spectacular!   Our flight was delayed leaving Paris by many hours and thus, we did not arrive to Venice until 3:00am. The hotel staff went above and beyond, helping us secure a water taxi and find our way to the gorgeous Bauer Palazzo at that late hour.   My husband and I stayed in a beautiful suite with views of San Marco Square and loved everything about our room and stay. The breakfast selection was quite impressive, as were the views. Next time we visit Venice, we will certainly stay here again! Thank you so much, keep up the great work, Bauer!
