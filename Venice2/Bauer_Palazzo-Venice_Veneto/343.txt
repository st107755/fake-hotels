This is my third visit to Venice. I booked this hotel because of proximity and what was advertised as easy to get to from the water bus stop. It is NOT accessible along the grand canal.  It costs the price of two nights at most hotels.  We did get a room "with a view" so it was bright. But you had to hang out of the window to see the little side canal.  The facility is otherwise extremely fancy and they know it. There was a certain air about the place as though the only reason to stay there was for status. Even the staff seemed cold and elitist.  Don't believe the reports that you will get a Grand canal view, unless you paid a few thousand euros a night.  The breakfast buffet was very nice. The canal views from the restaurant and the terrace were perfect.  The beds comfortable,â€¦
