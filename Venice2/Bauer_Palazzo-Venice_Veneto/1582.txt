We stayed in the Bauer Hotel for 7 nights, and the room and service was excellent. Breakfast on the restaurant on the Grand Canal is one of the best experiences of Venice as you can watch the world go by in a most spectacular setting. During our stay this time, the Redentore was taking place, and we were however not permitted into the bar area after 7.30pm that evening. One had to have dinner at the cost of 500 euros per person!!!  The bar is expensive, and we were overcharged on the last evening for drinks we didn't have. There was also the charge levied for the being a visitor to the city which was added to our bill. I would nevertheless continue to book the Bauer as it is quite the best hotel I have stayed in Venice on my many visits over the years. Beware the hidden chargesâ€¦
