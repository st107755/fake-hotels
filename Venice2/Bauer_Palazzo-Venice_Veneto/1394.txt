A perfect location, friendly staff, superb room and great breakfast made this a super place to stay. We booked through ba.com and got a great deal on flights and 4 nights stay. London City Airport was so effecient and easy compared to the other London airports. I checked out previous reviews but some of the negative ones must have stayed elsewhere ! The room was clean and quiet and we had 4 excellent nights sleep ! Breakfast was superb and everything was there, overlooking the Grand Canal and all it's traffic and we watched a cruise liner arrive on the last day. Just a tip : share a taxi to the airport both ways and save a fortune ! You will find somebody going to the airport more than willing to share the cost. If you are going to Venice, try the Bauer.
