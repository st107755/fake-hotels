I have been fortunate to have stayed at this hotel on many occasions.  It is perfectly positioned on the Grand canal directly opposite the Santa Maria della Salute.  Enjoy a delicious Bellini (best in town) on the hotel terrace.  In the winter months they have a cool retro cocktail lounge with live music and dancing!  The Bauer is only a couple of minutes walk from San Marco Square and is also surrounded by up market and authentic venetian shops........perfecto!!
