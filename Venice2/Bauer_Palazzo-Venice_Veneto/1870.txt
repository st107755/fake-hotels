I stayed in 2 hotels in Venice - a 4-star hotel - Bella Venezia - at Calle Dei Fabbri, followed by Bauer Hotel (meant to be a special treat for my husband on his birthday).  What a disappointment.  I wish I could have extended my stay at the Bella Venezia, which was fantastic value for money as compared to Bauer Hotel.
