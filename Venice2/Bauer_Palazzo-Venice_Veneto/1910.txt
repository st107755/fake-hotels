I Booked this hotel after a friend recommeded it to me. I Booked it after reading a few reviews on this web site and i am so glad i did. Very happy stay. One of the best 5 Star hotels i have stayed at. Will visit it again next year and book the same Hotel. Well worth shopping around. I paid £680 for 3 nights B&B but could have got it as cheap as £425 :-(. Not bad for a xmas and new year prices
