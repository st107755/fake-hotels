This was our second stay at The Bauers, the first for our wedding last year. This year we arrived to celebrate our anniversary and were greeted with a 'we remember you' welcome and the usual outstanding service. Our room was beautiful and the servicing of our room was done with so much care. The bed was huge and so comfy. The breakfast is fantastic, prosecco every day and a view over the Grand Canal and over to Guidecca. When it got too hot we were able to enjoy a drink in the shade watching the world go by. The staff at the Bauer are friendly and so attentive. Being able to catch the boat across to the sister hotel was really useful too.  The location is fantastic - 2 mins to Piazza San Marco yet quiet and understated from the outside.  We will return here time and time again.
