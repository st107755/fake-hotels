Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location just minutes from St Marks Square.  Room was extremely large and well equipped. Loved the ambience and feel of the hotel.  Had breakfast overlooking the water and staff were attentive and helpful.  Hotel isn't cheap, but from a view and location perspective worth the money.
