We stayed here for two nights for a long weekend. The hotel was fabulous, traditional and in the heart of the city. Literally a stones throw away from St Marks square gave us access to the whole city. The rooms were a great size with fabulous amenities. Staff were friendly, gracious and very helpful. The bar area was lovely to relax in with a bottle of wine after a long day of walking, sat by the canal listening to the bustle of the boats. Definitely recommend it and stay here again.
