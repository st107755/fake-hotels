Definite 5 star almost to the point of feeling out of place! From the moment you swing into the hotel foyer, we felt special. The concierge are so very helpful and friendly and seem to appear just when you need a hand! The room was lovely which overlooked a canal where people caught a gondola. We could hear the hustle and banter (albeit in Italian) of the gondoliers and the beautiful romantic singing.  The hotel is situated in a square surrounded by designer shops, but quintessentially Venetian. We had our breakfast at the front of the hotel, right on the Grand Canal. A dream location which we'd definitely return to.
