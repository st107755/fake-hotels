THIS HOTEL WAS ONE OF THE BEST WE HAVE EVER STAYED AT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 6 * SERVICE FROM MANAGEMENT & STAFF.  Our room was stunning, overlooking the Grande Canal with a Romeo & Juliet balcony from which to view "All of Venice". Decor was outstanding in that Over The Top (But classy not garish) way that only Kings & Queens thought was normal so it was wonderful to be transported to another era that is so sadly missing today in this hurried fast food junk emporium we are creating.   The MANAGEMENT & staff are true hospitlity SUPER-STARS who never put a foot wrong & delivered 6 * Star Service. Gracious and 100 % Guest focussed with with a class & elegance that is missing from most high end hotels today ! These people are my OUTSTANDING HOSPITALITY GOLDEN STANDARD Examplesâ€¦
