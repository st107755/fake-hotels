Great location and clean...there ends the positive review. The reality is that the Bauer lacks customer services from arrival to departure. Upon my arrival on the public ferry (because we weren't informed of a private ferry directly to the hotel), after walking 3 blocks with my luggage there was no doorman to help me up steps and through a revolving door (I kid you not). My room was clean but dark and the refrigerator was broken (and remained so even though I reported it twice). The wifi was always around 40% and my friend didn't even get wifi in her room but they offered to give her a router for 200 EURS. There was no iron/ironing board so I had 5 pieces ironed for 85 EURS (crazy but needed as I was on a work trip). The restaurant breakfast was good but the service not so -â€¦
