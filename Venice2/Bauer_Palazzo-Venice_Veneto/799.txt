Absolutely loved the location, but given the price of this hotel, it could use a little updating.  The shower only had a piece of glass that goes about half way the length of the tub, which is quite small, so water typically ended up on the floor (and we are not big people at all).  Also I was surprised there was no bottled water or robes.  Our room faced directly into another building, so the curtains always had to be drawn and there wasn't a lot of light.  Other guests have noted that their rooms faced air shafts though, which is probably worse.  On the flip side, the location can't be beat, and the views from the terrace and the surroundings are beautiful.  I feel like this was a bit overpriced, but then again it might just be a reflection of some of the logistical challengesâ€¦
