We were initially disappointed that the view from our room on the fifth floor was of a wall, even though it was very attractively painted! Our two night pre-cruise stay there was part of a package, so we didn't know if we were entitled to anything better...in any case the hotel was full.  The room had all the elegance of a bygone age, the walls covered with silk. It was very quiet, with two doors separating it from the hallway, and shutters at the window which were lowered at the time of the evening turn down service. The bed was very comfortable and towelling robes and slippers were provided. The marble bathroom was attractive and very spacious, however due to the design of the bathtub not so easy for those with dodgy hips to get in and out.  The public rooms are magnificentâ€¦
