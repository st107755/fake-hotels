I have just spent three night at this superb hotel! The location is excellent right at Canal Grande - and the terrace is a wonderful place to sit and relax and enjoy the view. The kitchen is top notch and we really enjoyed the splendid dinner and delicious breakfast. We had to pay for WiFi and use of gym - should be free of charge (and would have received 5 stars if included) Hopefully we will be back ;-)
