This hotel is well located if you want to be near San Marco Square and the Doges Plaza.  They serve a lovely breakfast overlooking the grand canal, with very friendly and accommodating staff.  But it is very expensive and not worth the splurge.  This is not a five star hotel.  Rooms are tiny, beds are mediocre and overall you feel like you are getting ripped off.  It is in the middle of expensive restaurants and luxury boutiques (Chanel, LV, etc) Recommend staying away from the square ... as far away as possible.
