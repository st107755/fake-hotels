Really looking forward to returning to Venice and staying in our Superior room.  But what a disappointment.  Front desk staff unfriendly and aloof. The same man checked us in and out, and both times hardly said a word to us. Certainly no welcome or how was your stay! I found some of the breakfast staff grumpy too.  The Superior Room (so called) was very dark getting no light in, the window looked down into some sort of inner shaft that was dark and dinghy.  We were given 2 single beds instead of a double.  When I queried this with front desk I was told it was part of an extension building and it was a Superior Room, Superior to what!  I would have made a fuss but we were very late checking in and tired and it was only a 2 night stay and we were out all the time.  The 2 starsâ€¦
