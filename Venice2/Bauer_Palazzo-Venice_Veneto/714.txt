My husband and I stayed 3 nights in a deluxe room whilst celebrating our Wedding Anniversary. Check-in was very easy and we were shown to our Room which was overlooking a side canal - look out the window and to the side and you could see the Grand Canal, The Room was spacious and comfortable and had a very good A/C system. Breakfast taken on the ground floor terrace was excellent and we enjoyed the odd glass of Prosecco - a good way to start the day - a special mention  to Natasha, who's cheery disposition greeted us every morning. We checked with the Concierge  Desk about opening times and ferries for a visit to Torcello  and Carlo was incredibly helpful - not only with the information we required but other historical sites worthy of visiting and suggestions of places to dine.â€¦
