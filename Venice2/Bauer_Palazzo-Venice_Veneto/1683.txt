It has been a wonderful experience. Hotel and rooms are extremely clean and comfortable and the concierge is absolutely fantastic. He'll suggest you the best restaurant and sightseens giving you the possibility to enjoy Murano island, even if sometimes you risk to find unprofessional sale agents ( in Linea Murano or Linea mazzuccato I met a men kidding me telling tales about colors made with precious stones and chandeliers exposed in museums around the world ). Visit also Torcello island according with the restaurant mr Minatelli will suggest you.
