We recently stayed at the Bauer Hotel.  I had paid for two rooms.  Room numbers were consecutive but one was down stairs from the elevator and the other was upstairs from the elevator.  This was not very convenient!  Only thing bad about the room was the mattresses-very,very hard and the pillows were just as bad.  Very good location on the Canal.  Breakfast had a very good selection.  View from patio was amazing!
