We stayed in the Bauer Palazzo for two nights.  We were greeted very warmly and as a wonderful surprise given a room upgrade.  We were shown to our room by the receptionist who checked us in and was a lovely touch.  The hotel is in the heart of Venice with a very short walk to the Piazza San Marco.  The room was large and well appointed.  We had a lovely city view.  All the staff were friendly and very courteous.  Breakfast also offered many choices.  We would love to stay here again if we get back to Venice.
