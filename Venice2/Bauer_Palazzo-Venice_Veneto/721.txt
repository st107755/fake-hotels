We had a lovely water taxi journey from the train station to the hotel dock. Fantastic location, close to the square and all the transport links. Terrace over the canal and pleasant breakfast in the sunshine. We were disappointed by our room which was described as deluxe. It was very small and the window looked out onto a brick wall so it was also very dark. The pillows were dreadful too but the hotel changed them quickly
