The Bauer is a lovely hotel! Staff is very friendly, Italian Style hospitality, perfect! We had one of the less expensive rooms and it was still fantastic, with a beautiful view on a small canal, comfy and clean room, a little dated but very charming, marvelous breakfast with view on the Canale Grande, and the famous terrace! I'd always come back here! Location can not be topped! It's right in the heart, next to Piazza San Marco.
