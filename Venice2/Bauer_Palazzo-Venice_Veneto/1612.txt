Best thing we did in Venice was to stay at L'Hotel Bauer in Venice. Venice itself is a beautiful location for a vacation but the Hotel Bauer made the stay in Venice sublime. Apart from the excellent location of the building, the service of the staff, the interior design of the magnificent Hotel, the spacious room all made our stay in Venice perfect in spite of the fact that Alitalia managed to lose our luggage upon arrival. The gentlemen working at the concierge were very helpful with every question that we had and were constantly assisting us attempt to locate our suitcase. Regrettably we left the Hotel returning home last night / early this am and still no suitcase. However we will always treasure the memory of our stay at the Bauer. We highly recommend this Hotel for a stayâ€¦
