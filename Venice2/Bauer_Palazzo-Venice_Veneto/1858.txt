having been to the Palazio Bauer which is the attached sister hotel right on the canal, some 4 years ago, wanted to be in the same area, quite honestly could not see the difference between the 2 hotels, but the bauer  is much cheaper. fantastic room with fantastic view, excellent concierge service. Couldnt fault it really.  would definately recommend private water tax transfer just for the experience.   Fabulous place will definately return again, but not in August, too hot and too busy
