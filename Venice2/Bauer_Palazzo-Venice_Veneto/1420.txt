You can't find a better location for a hotel in Venice.  Breakfast in the outdoor terrace overlooking the Grand Hotel is a little slice of heaven.  Hotel rooms are nice, clean and comfortable.  But the staff left much to be desired.  I was informed at check-in that my 2 night stay (pre-cruise) was not long enough to get a canal view room.  It took 3 calls to convince them that there was no hair dryer in the room.  They were so exasperated with me that they sent someone up to search the room.....finally  they were convinced that there really wasn't a hair dryer in the room and they brought me one. The  room that had a window looking into a very small courtyard.  Not very nice.  Be forewarned, if your room is not ready....do not kill time at the Bauer Hotel Bar.  4 beers and oneâ€¦
