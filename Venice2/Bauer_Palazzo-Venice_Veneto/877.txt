Old school hotel. Amazing service, specious room, a real 5 stars hotel We have upgraded the room so got one with a balcony and a view, Breakfast really good. Only down side is that every morning 8.30 there was a house keeping ringing the bell in order to clean.   It is almost dark out side!!! too early...
