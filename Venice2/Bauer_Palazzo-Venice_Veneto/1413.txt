There are two Bauer Hotels in Venice; ours was the one on St. Moises (Moses) square.  Our room was lovely, blue and gold damask on the walls, very large marble bathroom, and a window onto the square.  We stared right into the sculptures on the St. Moises church facade, had a view of the San Marco bell tower and could hear it chime.  Our travel agent had arranged a special farewell to Venice meal in the hotel dining room and it was delicious and seemed lavish.  When we return to Venice (some day!) we will stay at this hotel.
