Hubby and I had an overnight stay in the Bauer 11 Palazzo hotel, Venice.  Excellent staff and concierge. Beautiful room which did not have a view over the water, but as we were only staying one night, it didn't matter.  We had dinner on the terrace which was brilliant.  The only slight problem was the pigeons but the hotel supply a 'pigeon zapper'.  I hope it wont be too long before I return there.
