We really enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Bauer. When our water taxi arrived at by the lobby area, we knew we’d made the right decision.  The hotel felt very opulent and grand. Our room was not ready as we arrived early so we went for a drink in the courtyard overlooking the Grand Canal. What a moment. Magical.  Breakfast seating boasts the same views. The view is simply lovely. Gondolas regularly pass by as there is a gondola station outside of the hotel. Loved listening to the singing Gondoliers.  Our room was fab. We stayed in a deluxe room in the main hotel.  Huge bed, view of the canal and really spacious. The décor was tasteful.  Ideal location. In fact this hotel is all about the location. A few minutes away from St Mark’s square and within walking distance of all…
