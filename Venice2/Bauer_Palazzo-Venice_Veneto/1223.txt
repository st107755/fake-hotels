After a couple nights at a less than amazing hotel on the Lido, we checked into the bauer as we had friends staying there. The location was great, staff was very nice to deal with and helpful when making restaurant recomendations. Also, room service was great, which i have found to be unusual in Venice thus far. We were there during the Film Festival so it may have been more expensive then regular season but it was worth the price. will go back next year for sure.
