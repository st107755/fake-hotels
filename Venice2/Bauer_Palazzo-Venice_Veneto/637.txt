This is a lovely hotel operated and maintained to a good five star standard with an unbeatable location on the canal and adjacent to St Mark's Square.  The views from the terraces are fantastic and it has a real luxury ambiance.  However all this comes at a price. Be prepared to pay more than double the asking rate of comparable  hotels not in such a prime position.  We treated ourselves for three nights on the basis that you only live once. Our third trip to wonderful Venice.
