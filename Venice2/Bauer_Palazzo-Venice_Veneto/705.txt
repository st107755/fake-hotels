The hotel could not be more luxurious. The location was PERFECT. St. Mark's was a couple of blocks away in one direction and excellent restaurants a couple of blocks in each direction.  Out the front door were blocks of high end shops like Prada. All of the various concierge we dealt with in the hotel were most attentive and helpful. The ONLY downside was that there was a fairly steep charge to even get ice brought to the room. (It was not available to get yourself.) And, the bed broke and fell all the way to the floor! Thank goodness only one of us was sitting on it at the time.
