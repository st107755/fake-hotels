Part of out Insight Gold, Playgrounds of Europe tour. Very nice grand old hotel, right on the canal, few minutes away from St. Mark's square. Close to stores, restaurants, attractions, water taxis, museums. Older, but elegant, just don't try fitting more than 2 people with suitcases at time in the elevator. Restaurant overlooks canal, very romantic. Buffet breakfast included cereals cheese cold cuts but there were scrambled eggs, pancakes (albeit not great). Service very good. Coming from Swiss Diamond Lugano, quite a smaller room and bathroom. Still, adequate closet space, drawers, in room safe. Love the power window shades in bedroom. The shades in bathroom however are NOT powered, do it the old fashioned way. I think we had 2 twin beds adjoined. Didn't have time to use anyâ€¦
