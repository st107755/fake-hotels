The hotel is perfectly located in Venice. The deluxe room was a nice size with good closet space and a big bathroom. My biggest complaint if the AC was not strong at all. The highest you made it barely kept the room cool. There is AC in the lobby but you could hardly feel it. It has very hot outside so this is an issue...especially if you are American where we are use to great AC. They charge for wifi which no 5 star does. And the service at the hotel is more of a 4 star.  Carlo at the concierge was fantastic and very helpful but I cannot say the same for anyone else on that team.
