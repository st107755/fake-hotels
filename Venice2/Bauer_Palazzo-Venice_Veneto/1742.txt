The Bauer is a very nice, elegant hotel in an excellent location. Our room was lovely and roomy and the bathroom well appointed. That being said, it just felt like something was "missing"...and I can't quite put my finger on it.  I think the staff, while very professional and polite, lacked the friendliness that can make a hotel stay so much more enjoyable. Perhaps that is due to the size of the hotel. I don't know...it just didn't "feel" like I wanted it to and I probably would try a different, smaller, homier place if I were to go back to Venice.
