Superb location for walking about high points of Venice or catching gondola (right out front door) or water taxi/bus to go elsewhere.  Staff very attentive and helpful. Lobby beautiful. Breakfast buffet average for hotel at this level. Our room (#343), however, was small and needed some attention. Bed sagged big time (worst bed I slept in during my RTW trip) and bathroom was a tight fit.  Towels thread bare. All in all, a bit of a disconnect in what they aspire to be and what they actually achieve.
