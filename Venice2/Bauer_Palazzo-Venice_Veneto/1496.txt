My family and I stayed here for one night before a cruise, and was not disappointed. The hotel was within easy walks to most major sites in this beautiful city, which to me, was the most important aspect to a hotel in Venice. The morning buffet did the job, and the lobby bar was a nice place to spend time before going out in the city.  The only real downside for us were the rooms. Yes, this is Europe, so subsequently the rooms are small. The beds weren't entirely comfortable, and the pillows weren't very plush. The bathroom was gorgeous though.   All in all, this is a beautiful hotel with an even more amazing location. Highly recommend it.
