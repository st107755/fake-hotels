My wife and I stayed at the Bauer hotel in Venice in Sept, we were very pleased with our decision, superb location 700 feets from San Marco square and the main designer shops.  We had a room in the Casa nova section room 45 with an amazing little balcony to feel like a Venetian. we had a view on San Marco tower from the balcony.  Great room size and the most important is it was so quiet. We had the breakfast included it was very completed and excellent but on top of that we had breakfast every morning near the canal superb view on the gondoliers  don't look anywhere else.....location, location, location
