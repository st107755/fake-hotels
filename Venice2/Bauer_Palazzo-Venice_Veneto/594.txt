My husband and I have stayed at the Bauer before but not in Il Palazzo. The rooms was terrific, very large with a view of the side canal and grand canal. The bathroom was huge! It was really a wonderful experience to be woken up each morning by the gondoliers singing on the side canal. Breakfast was free and eaten outdoors on the canal which was fabulous! The hotel location is near everything. Worth the money to stay in this hotel!
