This trip was the first trip overseas  everywhere we travelled was fantastic as soon as we arrived at the Bauer we were blown away by the whole place and its surroundings the room was huge and spacious not to mention beautifully decorated and overlooked the large structure in San Marco Square.We were there for 3 nights and loved every minute of it.Perfect location.
