We've booked a Superior Suite at a good price (€ 320 / night). They gave us a junior suite. After dinner of first night, I've asked them if there is a mistake. The receptionist mentioned, that this is the largest room. Inside the room a sign indicated that this room is a Junior Suite - on the webiste and the confirmation was mentioned the Suite. So in the beginning, the lady at the reception simply was lying.  After some discussions suddenly they had a suite and moved us to the room type we've booked. Without annoying them, they would have just downgraded us without any notice. Very bad! Bah!  Location is perfect while the rooms are small (like all italian rooms in general and in Venice especially). Bar is heavily overpriced, breakfast in summer on the teracce with direct view…
