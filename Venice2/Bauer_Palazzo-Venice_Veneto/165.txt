Hey, it's 5 star with a huge history, and within yards of St Mark's Square. Choose your room to suit you, but hotel has been careful to keep up to date and have renovations when and where needed. We had a deluxe room (no view) which was perfectly adequate and very lovely, as is bathroom. All amenities and A/C. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the canal is an absolute delight, and a life box ticker. From 6pm, take a drink on the rooftop bar (highest in Venice) and see the amazing views, although do bear in mind this luxury does come with a price - in our case the 2 most expensive drinks we have ever had! Was it worth it? Probably.
