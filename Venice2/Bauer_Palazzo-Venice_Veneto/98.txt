We just came back from a 4 nights stay at the Bauer Palazzo, traveling as a family of 4 (us and our two daughters of 7 and 5 years old). We stayed in 2 connecting rooms facing the Grand Canal in the historical part of the hotel. We had a wonderful stay and the service was exceptional. Concierge team, restaurant, breakfast team on the 7th floor under the lead of the fantastic Lucia: the details and kindness of the staff really made the difference. Worth the price in our views, even though it obviously represents a big spend. We would definitely go back at the Bauer.
