We spent two nights at the Bauer.  The rooms are probably average size for the European style.  They did have a nice bathroom with tub/shower, commode, bidet, etc.  The main problems we encountered was with the service.  When we returned after the first day, there were no hand towels or bathmat.  A minor inconvenience, but one that should not be found at an upscale hotel.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The beds were comfortable.  The room was nicely furnished (though on the small side from an American standpoint) with a two desks, two night stands, a flat screen TV, a desk chair and easy chair.  There was adequate closet space and a safe.  WiFi was free and that's always appreciated.  Attempting to print out our airline boarding passes at the hotel computer was a futileâ€¦
