Excellent hotel. Very close to the Square. Our room was extremely nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay. It is very convenient to get to by water taxi from the airport.  We will certainly stay there again on our next trip. I would avoid the restaurant, however. Horrible service. See my write up about it.
