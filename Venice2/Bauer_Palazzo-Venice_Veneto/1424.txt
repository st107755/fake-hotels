This is a beautiful and lovely spooky old hotel. It is vintage Venice – like everything in Venice. When I was walking through the halls to my room, I kept expecting to see a child’s ghost appear. You can certainly tell that the hotel was converted from an old school. It still has that Catholic dormitory feel to it.  The lobby, lounge, and patio are beautiful; no dormitory feel at all LOL. It is a treat to sit and enjoy breakfast on the verandah; the exterior building is a work of art onto itself. The staff is warm and very professional. The location is great for strolling around San Marco, catching tea at the Caffe Florian or viewing the lovely waterways of Venice. I truly romantic experience.
