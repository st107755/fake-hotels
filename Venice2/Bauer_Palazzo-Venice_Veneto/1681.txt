Had 4 nights here and we really enjoyed it. Location hard to beat and staff were really great. breakfast included was a nice touch as well as staff turning down the beds and helping organize restaurant reservations. Overall would come back and we really enjoyed our stay and many bellini's on the balcony overlooking the grand canal
