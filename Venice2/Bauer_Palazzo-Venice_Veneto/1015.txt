Like the reviewer below, we booked the Bauer Hotel and didn't realise we would be staying in a separate building, the Bauer Casa Nova. Our booking and the hotel website didn't make it clear what the Casa Nova is.  On arrival we were told we would be staying in the Casa Nova, which is an anonymous building down an alleyway running alongside the Hotel. The Casa Nova is not special at all, this is not a luxury hideaway more upmarket than the Hotel. It is dark and uninviting and the alleyway is littered with cigarette butts (some due to hotel staff smoking there). There are no staff to greet you. There isn't even any signage the doorway indicating that it is connected with the Bauer. I would worry about the security as the door to the Casa Nova doesn't close automatically. One dayâ€¦
