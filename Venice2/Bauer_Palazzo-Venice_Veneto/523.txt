What a dream of a hotel very typical of Venice old world charm the rooms are very large and very comfortable on the Grand Canal, the restaurant for breakfast the nest morning was like something out of a picture postcard right on the canal watching all the boats and gondolas cruise by whilst enjoying a great breakfast. The service and the staff were all very friendly and helpful could not ask for anything else, we had a fantastic 3 nights. This hotel would have to be one of the best located in Venice walking distance to St Mark Square, high end and normal shopping at your doorstep.
