Stayed here for 4 nights. Service was very good, room was excellent. Location is hard to beat. Views are genuinely breath taking.  Our room was luxurious, clean and fitting for a Venice 5 star hotel. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom had an air of luxury to it.  Breakfast was a daily treat. Great food, impeccable service and the finest morning view of the Grand Canal.   It's not cheap, but it warrants it's 5 star rating. Treat yourself, it's Venice at its finest.
