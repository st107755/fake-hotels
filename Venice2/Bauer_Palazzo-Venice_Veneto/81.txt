I took my daughter and my mother for a few days and we had a great time at the Bauer Palazzo. A fabulous location on the Grand Canal and so central for all the places we wanted to visit. Lunch on the terrace and breakfast on the roof top restaurant was just amazing. The rooms are spacious but old fashioned but still very comfortable. It is worth getting a room overlooking the Grand Canal.   Superb and long serving staff were so warm and welcoming. I had not stayed there for 15 years and it exceeded all my expectations.
