One of the happy few with the Danieli, the Excelsior and the Gritti. The « Venizia The Serenissima » touch at its best. Old charm well maintained & preserved. Only in Italy, surely in Venice. Ask for a room on the Canale Grande or on the charming (but narrower) St Moise Canale. Have a 6pm drink at the 7th floor roof top overlooking the Grand Canal... And propose! Salutti Tutti readers!
