We were staying in this hotel during 9 nights in last August with our two daughters (1 year and 5 years old), our suite was very confortable with a beautiful view on the St Marc Place. The staff was very nice with our daughters. The room service was very good and the restaurant was excellent. Don't forget to go to the jacuzzy (not free but private and the price include cocktails) because after a day in the crowd you will have the pleasure to be in a small swimming pool alone with a 360Â° view over Venezia it is just a PLEASURE
