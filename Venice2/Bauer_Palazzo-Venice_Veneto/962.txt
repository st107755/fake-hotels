Was fun to be dropped off at our hotel by boat. Nice hotel by overpriced. Nice breakfast buffet was included with our stay buy we were going to eat lunch here, but was way too expensive. Lunch was like $26 and didn't even care for the menu. We enjoyed staying at Hotel Rialto better. We were there with two other couples and we especially liked the rooftop terrace overlooking the canal at the Rialto.
