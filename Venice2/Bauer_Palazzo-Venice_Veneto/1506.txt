Wonderful staff, wonderful position, wonderful rooms, just wonderful. We have travelled to many, places and stayed in many hotels but the Bauer had it all, the rooms were lovely with a very nice bathroom, the staff were very friendly and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. The location of the hotel could not have been any more central. Will definately return.
