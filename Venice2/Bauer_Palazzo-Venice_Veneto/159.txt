We stayed 3 nights at the Bauer Palazzo after a cruise.  The staff was great and the location couldn't be better.  With a view of the Grand Canal and serenading gondoliers outside my windows, what more could I want for my first time in Venice?  The concierge was super helpful in arranging all our taxis and giving us ideas for day trips.  Loved it!
