Ok admittedly, we were upgraded one room category because we are Leading Hotel group members... but our room!!!!! Oh my... what a view... and we had a patio where we had cocktails at sunset... We were perfectly situated 3-5 min walk to St Marks Square. Complementary breakfast on top of the hotel at the 7th floor - was fabulous too!  Again, our concierge Marco was tops... set us up for all our excursions and ventures outside of Venice.  A little spendy, but guess there's a lot of up-keep in Venice... Still wonderful experience!
