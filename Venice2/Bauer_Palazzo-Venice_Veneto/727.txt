Stayed here twice now and on both occasions it has been out of this world.   Location is great (two mins walk from San Marco) and easily accessible - your water taxi will drop you at the side door! Rooms are fantastic, ours was a deluxe room, very large and decorated to a very high standard.  Sadly no view this year, but that's fine (we were lucky enough the first time to have a view of the Grand Canal!).   All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly - nothing is a problem.  Great outside terrace overlooking the Canal for drinks.   Will definitely stay at The Bauer when visiting Venice again in the future!
