Just stayed at the Bauer Palazzo this week:  first off let me say that the location and views are outstanding, walking distance to St Markâ€™s etc. and on the Grand Canal.  But the hotel interior is very outdated. Dated rooms and carpets, rusted light switches, old thermostats, staining all over the marble in the bathrooms on the sink and floor.  My room rate was $595 per night.  I love the location but the hotels are back to back on Grand Canal, so you could probably get the same view and location at a place with newer accommodations.
