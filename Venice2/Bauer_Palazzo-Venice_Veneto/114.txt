Our room was a delusion. We booked a superior in this 5 star hotel in a landmark Venetian palace overlooking the Canal Grande on the front, and a secondary canal on the side. We were given room 462. This room has one window on a cavity, from which you don't get neither air nor light. Lamps in the room probably had cheap energy-saving bulbs, as the overall light was terrible. Internet in the room did not work. Staff was very supportive and added an additional router, but could not solve the problem. We complained about the room, but management deemed it a fair superior room! Internet is a weak point for the hotel as you can find a wifi signal only if you are lucky, depending where you are seated whether in the lobby, in the bar or at the restaurant. Internet is very slow also forâ€¦
