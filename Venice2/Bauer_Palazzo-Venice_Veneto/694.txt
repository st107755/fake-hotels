Room was really small, services was bad⋯⋯ I was decided a place to have my birthday dinner, as the services was just too bad, I went to the opposite hotel and dinner at Westin. I don't understand why we need to pay for the hot water bottle. I don't understand why the hotel say no or need extra money on everything I requested.  Instead of services, I enjoyed the view outside of my room(river facing) and I enjoyed the breakfast place and the food provided by the hotel. Just , if they can improve the services a bit, everything will be better.
