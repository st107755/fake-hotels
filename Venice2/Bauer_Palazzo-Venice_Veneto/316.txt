We had a good stay at the Bauer Palazzo in September 2013, so I booked it again for our stay 26-30 September 2017.  I used 275,000 Lufthansa Miles and $926 to get a Superior Room for four nights.  I had a confirmed reservation at the Palazzo.    When we arrived, I presented the paperwork and was informed that "We don't have a room for you at the Palazzo.  You are in the Bauer."  (The Bauer is connected to the Palazzo.)  We were then literally frog marched to the Bauer, which caters to HUGE tour groups (Chinese, American, French,...), and were told by Jimmy at the Front Desk that "We have 25 categories of rooms.  Yours is the cheapest."  Really.  Unbelievably rude.    We were reminded several times that we had a cheap room.  This was no way to treat people who paid the equivalentâ€¦
