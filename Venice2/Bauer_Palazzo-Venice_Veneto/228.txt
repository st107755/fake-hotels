My family stayed at this beautiful hotel last week (formerly a Venetian palace), and we loved it! The staff were professional, friendly, spoke excellent English and were very patient with our limited Italian vocabulary :)  A special grazie mille to Iralia for all her help during check-in and with recommending some great local restaurants. We stayed in adjacent rooms (202 and 203) that very comfortably accommodated the 5 of us - 2 adults and 3 teens. Room 202 had a terrace and both rooms looked out on the Grand Canal and Santa Maria della Salute. The hotel is located near many attractions in a very nice neighborhood, and it's an easy walk from the hotel to Piazza San Marco, the Rialto bridge and numerous restaurants. I recommend this hotel and we'll definitely stay here againâ€¦
