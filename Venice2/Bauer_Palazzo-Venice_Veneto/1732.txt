We stayed a couple of nights at the Bauer - it's definitely time for a re-fresh of the rooms, lobby and exterior.  First impressions being what they are, the carpet on the floor of the revolving door is worn, noticed a torn and flapping awning when next door at the Feragamo store and the room was clean but dated - water leaked from the shower.  Excellent concierge with Marco, great restaurant recommendations and very helpful with guidance.  Very clean rooms and great water pressure! Excellent location for everything Venice has to offer.
