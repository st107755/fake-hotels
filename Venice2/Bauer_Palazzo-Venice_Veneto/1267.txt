Our room was comfortable, well decorated, with a partial canal view. Our luggage had been delayed and I was really impressed with the help that we got from the concierge service. The De Pisis restaurant served excellent food that was acceptably priced and given an interesting touch by the Japanese chef. The roof-top breakfast site with great views was an unexpected pleasure.  One recommendation at the airport--don't pre-book a limo. Our luggage was delayed and we stood in line for an hour and a half at the luggage window dedicated to Air Canada affiliates. This translated into a 170 Euro limo delay penalty for a limo that drove 3 minutes to the boat-dock. There are other options available, including on site limos.
