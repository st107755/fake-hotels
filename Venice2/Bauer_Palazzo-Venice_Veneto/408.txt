We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo for three days in June and had a very good experience. While the view in our room wasn't spectacular - we overlooked the rooftops of adjacent houses, but you could see the the San Marco Campanile - the room was very comfortable, and the bathroom was almost as large as the sleeping area. The service was excellent, from the concierge to the wait staff to the housekeeping staff - all were friendly and helpful. We ordered room service the first night of our stay, and we had the best room service meal I have ever had in all of my travels. The breakfast was also excellent, and it was lovely to dine every morning overlooking the Grand Canal. Truly, the location can't be beat - just a few short blocks away from St. Mark's Square and very close to excellentâ€¦
