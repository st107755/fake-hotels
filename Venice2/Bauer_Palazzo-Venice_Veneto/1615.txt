My husband and I stayed at the Bauer Hotel in October 2011.  The hotel is in an amazing location right on the Grand Canal and very close to St. Mark's Square.  When we arrived, our room was not available.  After doing some sight-seeing, we returned to the hotel to see if our room was ready.  Luckily it was and they upgraded us to a suite!  Our room was amazing!  It had 2 separate bathrooms, a walk-in closet/dressing area, a sitting room and a bedroom with a king size bed.  The view from our room was not very good, but that didn't matter.  Breakfast each day was very good; the best we had in Italy, and eating right along the water was amazing.  The drinks at the hotel bar are too expensive, so skip the hotel bar.  We definitely recommend this hotel and upon our return to Venice,â€¦
