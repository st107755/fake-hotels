We only stayed at this hotel for one night before we caught our plane the next morning.  Even though we arrived early and our room was not ready, they took care of our luggage and called us as soon as our room was ready.  The staff was very nice.  Our room was a little bit dark but the air conditioner was great!  Had a late night drink on the rooftop bar--beautiful!
