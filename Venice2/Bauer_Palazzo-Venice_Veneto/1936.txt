We were extremely disappointed with the Il Palazzo. Although lovely to arrive by boat, it went downhill from there. We paid a huge amount of money for a deluxe double canal view and all we could see were rooftops and a tiny  portion of the canal. Our son's room faced a wall with a picture of Venice painted on it. Ridiculous. The hotel looks tired and worn. After staying in such amazing places as Le Sirenuse in Positano and Splendide Royal in Rome, this was extremely disappointing. The breakfast room needs redoing and although the view was lovely,  the food  was mediocre. This hotel is very overpriced and  very overrated.
