This was our 3rd visit to Venice having stayed at the Danieli twice before. We booked thru Luxury Link and were upgraded to a Palatial room with a view of the Grand Canal with a white marble bath with gold fixtures, walkin shower and jacuzzi tub - Magnificent !  The staff was completely on top of their game. They didn't miss a beat from check in to check out. I never have had such wonderful service from the chamber maids to Lucia and Roberta, who staffed the wonderful breakfast buffet every morning on the roof with the best view of the Grand Canal and the Santa Maria De La Salute Church. Cocktails and Hor D'Voures on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and listening to the singing gondoliers will always be a romantic memory. It only cost a few bucks more to go first classâ€¦
