Stayed 3 nights. Outstanding service throughout. Special mention for best concierge in years and wonderful attentive staff on bar terrace. We were booked in Bauer after Centurion didn't honour our booking. Pleased they didn't ! Room was good but no view. But really didn't matter as so little time spent in room. Lunch when we arrived was excellent and in magical location overlooking Canal.  Criticism room walls very thin and had to call reception in middle of night due to loud music next door but dealt with immediately. Also surprising lack of info in rooms e.g. Breakfast times and who gets access to upstairs terrace.  Overall though the sort of hotel and service I thought had disappeared. I look forward to my next visit.
