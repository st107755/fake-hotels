We went to Venice as part of our planned 3 week Europe trip with our tween daughter.  The location of this hotel was good, as it was close to St. Mark's Square, but that was the only plus. We booked a room with a separate area for her to sleep, which this room had.Our room was not clean. It smelled. The bed and the pull out for my daughter were uncomfortable. It did not resemble any of the photos on their website in any way. It overlooked what I will call an abandoned patio area, at close to ground level. The tile floors in the bathrooms were spotted and disgusting. The shower was unclean. We had planned to stay for several nights but left after just one, not wanting to spend any more money on this place. They were abrupt at the desk, which is not too surprising.
