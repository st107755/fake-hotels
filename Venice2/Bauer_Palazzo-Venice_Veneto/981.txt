The Bauer II Palazzo was impressive from the minute we stepped off our water taxi.  The hotel is on the Grand Canal, and we had a grand time and stay. Marco, our Concierge and the reception staff were first class and treated us magnificently well and so personally.  Lucia and the Restaurant (Breakfast staff and manager) were delightful and terrific.  The roof top locaiton for breakfast is amazing. Even the birds have names. Marco, our Concierge also went above and beyond in helping us when we had a mishap going to great lengths to help us. We thank him so much. The restaurant on the water was also charming and classy.  The hotel upgraded us honoring our American Express program so thank you.  Well done Bauer staff, and Perfecto. Grazi.
