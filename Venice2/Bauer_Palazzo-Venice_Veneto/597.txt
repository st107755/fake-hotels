I booked this hotel as a surprise for my wife as we meet 40 years ago & it was well worth it. It can work out expensive if you wish to dine & drink here though. The restaurant faces the Grand Canal & I was not able to find many other hotels with a better view. It is s couple of minutes away from St Marks square & you can get a water bus to anywhere from there. There is even a rooftop terrace for customers to use, this is a definitely a plus as it is somewhere to just relax with a couple of drinks especially in the evening look out over the Grand Canal. In the morning you can either have breakfast right beside the Canal with all the hustle & bustle or have a relaxing breakfast up on veranda. The service was very high through out the hole hotel. It was a good choice but as alreadyâ€¦
