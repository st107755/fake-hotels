Bauer is in the leading hotels of the world network so you know what to expect. Great location. Close to S. Marcos but not that close. In the shopping area where all the international brands are. It has a lovely restaurant room for breakfast with an astonishing view of the Grand Canal. The service is very professional and is very worried about details.
