A 25th anniversary trip. Greeted by Claudia who personally showed us to our room. We had been given an upgrade, a chilled bottle of Prosecco and a congratulatory message from the management awaited us in a beautifully appointed room overlooking one of the canals. Room had a balcony with table and chairs and we were often serenaded by the goldoliers setting off from the gondola station. Large room, superb bathroom with the best water pressure we have ever encountered in a hotel!  Spotlessly clean, well equipped, good air conditioning/ heating, fairy reliable wifi. Breakfast good, quality products. We usually got a table looking out onto the Grand Canal. Staff were the best, each and every one were friendly, helpful and caring. The Christmas decorations deserve a mention too - soâ€¦
