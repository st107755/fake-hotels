From walking into reception we were so  Impressed. Receptionist Angelina amazing, they all were couldn’t do enough for you. Fantastic room upgrade with balcony and views over canal. Book romantic package which includes dinner, private jacuzzi and Prosecco on 8th floor amazing. Dinner in restaurant probably one of the best we’ve had with exceptional personal service. Couldn’t recommend it enough.
