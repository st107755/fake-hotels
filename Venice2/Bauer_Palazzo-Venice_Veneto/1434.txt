I am still at the Hotel while writing this. But I had to do it since Hotel Bauer Palazzo and in particular its highly professional front desk have made my day: We were rather early when our water taxi dropped us off at 11 am. So the room of course wasn't ready yet. Although official check in time is only three pm, front desk was very apologetic about that fact and gave us a room upgrade to a deluxe room facing Grand Canal and Santa Maria della Salute with its own balcony. FYI: I had booked the cheapest room category. We also got free WiFi, a voucher for a free bottle of wine during lunch at the fantastic terrace restaurant De Pisis and lots of nice smiles by the staff. Be aware: it's pricey. It's not the Sheraton or something but a deluxe grand hotel! So expect to pay for whatâ€¦
