We booked the Bauers Casanova through Bristish Airways holidays for our anniversary. The suite we stayed in was nicely decorated and spacious with a separate sitting room. There was also a kitchennette with hot plates but we could not use them because there weren't any pots and pans for us to use. There was also a microwave but we could not use that either because the rotating glass tray in the middle was missing. Lastly, there was no complementary bottled water or free WiFi that you would expect from any 5 star hotels.  We would be fine with all of these 'withouts', had the staff been somewhat polite and helpful to us.  I must say that we didn't feel welcome at all from the minute we got there. The staff were  unpleasant,  rude and at times condescending. Not sure if it was…
