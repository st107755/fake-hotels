before you read this you have to know that venice hotels aren't as anywhere else .. so DONT expect anything like four seasons or any vegas hotel .. 5 star hotels are like 4 stars hotel anywere else ..  i stayed here for 3 nights in my honeymoon and i was pretty satisfied .. its a very nice hotel with the perfect location .. 1 minute walk to the piazza san marco  there are many famous botiques ( prada, bottega veneta, versace, ..... ) right in front of the hotel entrance ..  rooms are old and small but well furnished and very clean  the staff was very helpful  in my opinion .. this hotel is the best place to stay at in venice ..
