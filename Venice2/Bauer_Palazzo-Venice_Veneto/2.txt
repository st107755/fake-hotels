Venice is as quiet as fifty years ago. There are few benefits of Covid but this is one. Prices are much lower than usual but we prepaid many months ago pre Covid. The hotel softened the blow with an upgrade to a palace room with an excellent view across the Canal grande. We had an excellent dinner at Pisis again with the excellent view. The hotel is close to Piazza San Marco.
