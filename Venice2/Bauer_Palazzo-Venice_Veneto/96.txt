We arrived by boat to the back end of the hotel - interesting experience. The rooms were all beautifully decorated and very comfortable (we had 3). The location is very central to walking anywhere. Easy access to St. Mark's Square and shopping areas. Also close to getting boats to visit Murano/Burano. The breakfase is good, not outstanding. The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. Umbrellas always handy. Do recommend a stay here.
