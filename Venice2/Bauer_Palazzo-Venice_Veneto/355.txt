Steps from Saint Mark's and in the midst of the tourist hordes was fine with us.  It allowed us to be more comfortable letting our young teens the freedom to bounce around without us.  Breakfast and late-day drinks on the canal were particularly charming. Service was always prompt and thorough.  You cannot go wrong.
