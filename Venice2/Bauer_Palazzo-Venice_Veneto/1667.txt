I booked the Bauer Hotel for five nights on a breakfast inclusive basis which was confirmed by the hotel what they dont tell you is that if you have breakfast in bed all items are charged individually with no allownce for the all inclusive element for example a youghurt is €10 half a mellon is €22.In addition .When the hotel quotes an tax inclusive Rate  they omit the local occupancy tax .  This hotel is staffed by the most unfriendly unhelpful staff you could ever meet .The rooms are substandard and poorly equipped .
