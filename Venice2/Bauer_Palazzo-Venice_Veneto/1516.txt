A fantastic welcome from the Bauer receptionist, who escorted us to our room, was a splendid start. The bedroom was huge, with a separate dressing room and lavish bathroom. The enormous bed probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in .Unfortunately, on and off rain made the restaurant terrace unusable, but the views towards the  Salute are still classic, and the breakfast choice of food and beverages enormous. Still, it’s Venice, and there’s nowhere remotely like it. We’ll be back
