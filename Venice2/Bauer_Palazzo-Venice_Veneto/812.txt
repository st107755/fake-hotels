Our first visit to this hotel was ten years ago to celebrate my birthday, we come to Venice almost every year and stay in a variety of hotels and apartments but push the boat out to stay at the Bauer on special occasions. This is a superb hotel, the staff are great, the rooms are beautiful and the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is the largest in Venice with a fantastic view. St Marks Square is 2 minutes away and Harry's Bar is just around the corner. Our recent Bauer stay was wonderful, we particularly enjoyed the Jazz concert in the cocktail bar and the breakfasts.
