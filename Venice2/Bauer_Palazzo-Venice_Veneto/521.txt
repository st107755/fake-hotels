This is a classic hotel.  Great breakfast out on the grand canal with a wonderful outdoor patio which turns into a nice bar in the afternoon.  The rooms are big and comfortable as are the bathrooms.  The location is perfect.  I would highly suggest taking the private water taxi from the airport directly to the hotel as they will drop you off literally at the side door.
