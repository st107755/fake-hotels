This hotel is beyond descriptions in terms of interior, service and people working there)  we had three rooms at the same floor, traveled with family,  8 people in total)  rooms were great, all those old roles with antique furniture,  great lamps and mirror, wardrobe room,  wonderful bathroom with bubble bath, good shampoo etc products,  nice choice in minibar.  Separately I want to mention breakfast terrace at the rooftop!  It's an amazing place with probably the best view Un venice!!  Seagulls add a lot of charm to that terrace)   Good concierge service, we received only the best recommendations) thank you, Bauer staff, we will come back again one day!)
