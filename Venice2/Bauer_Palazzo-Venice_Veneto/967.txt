What a fabulous location. As you sit at the water's edge at breakfast, enjoying a glass of champagne (yes, even at breakfast, it just has to happen...occasionally), you see and hear the gondolas go past. The phrase that springs to mind...'this is the life'! Very close to St. Mark's square and with it's own jetty. Just recheck any pickup details given by the  hotel. We were given totally the wrong times and had I not queried it would have missed our cruise. We were also in the annexe. The suites were lovely but if it's raining you have to go outside to get to reception.
