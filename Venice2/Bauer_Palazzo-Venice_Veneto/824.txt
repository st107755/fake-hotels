I stayed at this hotel last week as a retirement gift from my daughter and her boyfriend. My room was large and the bed very comfortable. The bath in the en suite was a jacuzzi which was an added bonus. The staff were all very helpful and breakfast was delicious and served in a beautiful dining room. I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to return
