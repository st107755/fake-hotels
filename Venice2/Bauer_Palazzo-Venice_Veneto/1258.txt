What a great hotel. My wife and I stayed here for three nights for our 20th wedding anniversary. At check in we were given an upgrade to a canal view and a bottle if prosecco. Little touches that go a real long way. Breakfast stunning with views to match! Staff very attentive and hotel could not be better located.
