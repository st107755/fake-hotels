First, the location is absolutely wonderful.  A few hundred meters from St. Mark's Square.  Impossible to get lost.  We took a water taxi from the airport directly to their front door.   Yes, their side entrance is right off the Grand Canal.   High end shopping district steps outside of the front door.  I felt extremely safe in all of Venice, but this location and hotel especially so.  They also have a restaurant/lounge on the terrace directly facing the Grand Canal. A lovely place to drink some prosecco and some appetizers.  Second, the staff was amazing.  From the doorman happily helping with all of our luggage to the front desk woman who actually walked us to our room.  The concierge desk was helpful with directions and suggestions.  The bed was comfortable, lots of storageâ€¦
