After 11 years my wife and I came back again to the Baur il Palazzo again. A very historic building which is located near to the center. So every interesting place like Markus square is in walking distance. However the interior is a bit old fashioned and very be very style. So some of the rooms a very dark from an interior point of view. As we booked an Excutive suite we made this experience becoming one under  the roof top. After a brief discussion with the concierge the hotel offered us an upgrade to a canal suite (room 630) which we would take definetly again. It was a bright room overlooking the grand canal and a perfect view over the roofs of Venice and to the st Markus square. The personal was very courteously. Venice is expensive but considering this the Baur il palazzoâ€¦
