Simple, clean lines - unusual for Italian hotel architecture & aesthetics - with tiny butlovely rooms. Elegant bathroom & toiletries (perhaps sourced from their related spa?). Fabulous daily breakfast buffet - rain daily kept us from the terrace, but still, the view was great. Beautiful & delicious whole poached fruits, & Prosecco available in the morning... Discrete but helpful service from concierge & front desk.
