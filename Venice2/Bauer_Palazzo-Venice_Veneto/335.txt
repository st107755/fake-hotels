There are more expensive hotels in Venice, but they are not the "Bauer".  Everything about this Hotel lets you know you are in one of the finest anywhere.  The location is superb both on the Grand Canal and close to St. Mark's Square.  Breakfasts are excellent.  Wish they could do something with the pigeons on the terrace.  True menaces to peaceful enjoyment of the excellent Terrace.  Our rooms were beautiful and well appointed.  Only objection was that every outlet was taken by lamps.  Surely we are not the only guests who like to charge their phones in the bedroom.  Grandson set up charging station near the floor in living room, LOL.  The water entrance is always a joy to use and the Concierge service is excellent.
