Stayed in the CasaNova section, a few steps from the main entrance. Escorted to the suite by a senior desk manager. Very well appointed, immaculate, with fresh linen every day and attractive fabric covered walls. There is no view, just blinds drawn over windows that look out onto the main hotel a few metres opposite, and there is a bell tower next door so twice a day...but bells are part of the Venice experience. Hotel has an atmosphere of quiet calm- big spacious public areas in a long sequence down to the restaurant and terrace on water front. Lovely to sit out, coffee not cheap (9E PP) but this and other orders came with complimentary biscuits etc.  Breakfast buffet very extensive and impressive. Dinner was beautifully presented and excellent. All the staff we met were veryâ€¦
