Thoroughly enjoyed my few nights at this five star hotel.  Marvellous location - two minutes from Piazza San Marco and located right on the Grand Canal   Good service and good good - attentive staff.   Lovely terrace over looking the canal - great for watching the gondoliers.   Hotel has its own private jetty which we used both for our arrival,and departure.    A touch of class in the heart of this lovely city.
