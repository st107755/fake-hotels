This hotel was our first stop on a 12 day trip to Italy so my partner insisted on stepping out for a better place. Unfortunately euros don't get you much in Venice these days.  Though the location was convenient, the entrance is in front of a busy gondola station,so there's always a crowd to greet you at the door.  The room was adequate, but not exceptional for $500 per night.  The front desk muffed our dinner reservation and the staff was not overly friendly.  The best part was the outdoor terrace where breakfast was served.  The view is unparalleled, but at 55 euro pp we were relieved to know it was included with room.  We probably will not return but cannot dispute it's convenience.
