From the moment my wife and I arrived we knew we were is a special place. The hotel is beautiful and the room was amazing. It is decorated in a style you would expect of a historic hotel in Venice. The staff is amazing. The hotel is well situated. The only negative item was that the view from our room was into an ally. We would stay in that room again.
