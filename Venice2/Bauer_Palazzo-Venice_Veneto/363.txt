Great location, very close to St. Marks Square.  Close to all the restaurants with a stunning view of Venetian waters.  Service was top-rate, what you'd expect from a 5-star property.  My favorite moment was having breakfast on the terrace, glimpsing the water and watching the world go by in front of the hotel.  Rooms were nicely appointed and the beds were particularly comfortable.
