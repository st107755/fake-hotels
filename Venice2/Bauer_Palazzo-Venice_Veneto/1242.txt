We had a room to die for,with a private patio over looking square. The food was as good as it gets,with fabulous AM and eve. dining.. The location was more convenient to more things,easily than the plusher Gritti. I must say,that compared to others in city,of this type,this hotel was a fine value also. The staff was OK,just not as fanatical to please you as might have been the case. Go back? Yes,I know we will
