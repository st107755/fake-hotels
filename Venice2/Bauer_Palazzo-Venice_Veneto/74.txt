We only spent one night here but it was wonderful. The rooms were beautiful and the hotel staff were excellent. It was close to San Marco we could walk and being on the Grand Canal was perfect. We had dinner there which was excellent. And breakfast on the terrace on the roof was very good and the view was breathtaking. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.
