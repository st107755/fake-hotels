We arrived late from Paris and were immediately escorted to our junior suite, with views in three directions (including the Grand Canal).  Reception and service staff was impeccable; accommodations were outstanding; and only minutes from the heart of Venice - Piazza San Marco.  We had a great three day stay - will definitely stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo on our next trip to Venice.
