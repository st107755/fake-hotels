We have just arrived st the hotel to celebrate my 50th birthday. We booked a deluxe room with views, website stated the rooms had views of the canal which clangs the hotel. I e mailed to ask for a balcony and we explained ed we were here to celebrate my 50th in the e mail specifically asking for a room with a good view. We were happy to pay extra if needed but apoaray the deluxe rooms flank the canal and as per previous reviews you can here the gondoliers singing fro your room!! Have just been shown to a room which although nicely decorated is no where near the canal, and overlooks a load of plastic green roofs!!! It would have to de a recording of gondoliers as there is no chance! If you lean to the right you can see a spire in the corner. But unless you like looking at wallsâ€¦
