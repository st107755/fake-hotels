Venice is one of the best cities in the world and choosing the right hotel makes all the difference; the Bauer Palazzo is perfect in every sense.  Outstanding old building beautifully decorated, spacious rooms, terrace overlooking the canal -near a gondolas' station- where tens of gondolas cram the water alley with beauty and love songs and a professional warm staff.  The hotel is a two minutes walk from San Marco square, the most famous and exquisite venue in Venice, the restaurants and the shopping area.  Go for it!
