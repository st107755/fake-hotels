Immersed in history each room tells its own story. Breathtaking original features transport you back to the past and you can imagine the palatial and crazy lifestyle of early Venetians. Our room was beautifully appointed, generously proportioned, pillows and mattress were really comfortable and staff were fantastic. The view from the balcony was supreme, looking across the grand canal to the basilica Santa Maria  and the 7th floor rooftop superb. Also neat gym and steam room / sauna facilities.  The concierge, Paolo hit continual home runs for us with tours, guides and restaurant recommendations. This is a very special place!
