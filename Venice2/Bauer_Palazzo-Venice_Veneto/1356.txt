We stayed at The Bauer hotel for a 5 day pleasure and business trip and it ticked ever expectation we had and more.   ROOMS: We stayed in the Casa suites which were a little cheaper but proper italian feel and very spacious. Even though we didn't have views over looking the grand they were still great suites. Very nice.  STAFF: A class apart, couldn't help us enough and very friendly. I lost my phone at the airport before we arrived and they helped hugely in dealing with it. They were truly great at good service.  LOCATION: Best in Venice - FACT. You can explore Venice by foot from this hotel and you can throw a stone to St Marks square and easy access from San Marco port (3-4 min walk). Honestly the location is beyond perfect.  FOOD/BAR: They have a very romantic Italianâ€¦
