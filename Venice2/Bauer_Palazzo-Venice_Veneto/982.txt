Great Hotel.  Great friendly staff.  Location is ideal. Rooms are very nice and quiet.  Spotless. Concierge staff was very helpful and courteous.  The restaurant is right on the water.  We watched the gondolas being prepared for service every morning right in front of the restaurant as about six of them were docked there.
