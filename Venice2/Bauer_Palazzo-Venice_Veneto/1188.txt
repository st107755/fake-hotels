We just returned from a 4 day stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo for our 15 year anniversary and it was beyond wonderful.  After Roberta check us in and upgraded our room, he guided us up and gave us a tour of the hotel as we walked.  We were given a complementary bottle of prosecco for our anniversary that was already chilled. Our room was beautiful with a large bathroom and a balcony with a side view of the Grand Canal.  Housekeeping came twice a day, once to clean and the other to touch up the room and turn down the bed, which was a nice touch.       Breakfast was served on the terrace with breathtaking views of the city and the Grand Canal.  The pigeons and seagulls are entertaining, especially keeping them away with the pigeon fighting device (a bamboo stick). We also had dinnerâ€¦
