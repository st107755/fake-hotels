Recently returned from a 2 night stay (July 6-7).  The Bauer is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location, just steps from the Piazza San Marco. The hotel lobby is elegant and spacious.  The rooms were very nice, clean and very comfortable.  The buffet breakfast was very good and complete with outdoor tables overlooking the Grand Canal which was simply beautiful. The concierge and front desk were very helpful and friendly with everything including restaurant recommendations.  Overall, a wonderful couple of days in one of the world's most beautiful cities.
