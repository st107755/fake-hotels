This hotel is one of the nicest hotels in Venice. Located right off the Grand canal and near St Marks square, it was a perfect location. The concierge was so helpful; arranging tours, taxis, anything we needed.  The rooms were beautiful. We loved the free breakfast in the morning. We will definitely stay here again.
