The Bauer Hotel is classified as a 5* De Luxe hotel however our observations and experiences over a 5 night stay in July 2007 would place it as a 4* due to the following:- The Staff with few exceptions are inattentive & unwelcoming The Hotel is dark in its furnishings The Conciege service is awful The rug in our De Luxe room(236) either requires a thorough cleaning or replacement The wretched pigeons on the Terrace are a health hazard constantly landing on the tables when one is eating !  The location of the Hotel is perfect for San Marco Square where you can experience the "rip off" by taking a drink at the Cafe Florian or Cafe Quadri and if the band are playing you are hit for the Musica Supplement - the height of cheek ! Given the prices charged we would not stay at thisâ€¦
