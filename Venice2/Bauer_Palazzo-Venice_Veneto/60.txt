The hotel has a prime position by the entrance to the canal. The breakfast area (nice array of food and attentive service) overlooks this. Windows at the front of the main lobby overlook the busy Gondolierii station, offering a splendid sight of the daily bustle there. Pole positioned for St Marks Square.
