We stayed at the Baurer for two nights. A great location close to Saint Marco square. The Hotel has old world charm and the common areas are spacious.  The breakfast Terrace is delightful in the mornings as is the open verandah off the Bar. The staff are very courteous and helpful as would be expected. This is a quality Hotel and offers such services as bed turn downs at night, which is almost unique in Italy. The only minor negatives we found were that we could not locate the air con control as the room was cold for our liking and the hair dryer power point was not in the bathroom? If you can afford it, and have the opportunity, the Baurer will add to your Venice experiences!
