What a nice hotel. The tapestry wall paper, delicious toiletries, the peaceful small sitting areas, and the quiet window above the click clacking below on the narrow Venetian sidewalks. Breakfast o. The grand canal was gorgeous, lazy gondolierres just outside the entrance which faces a small square, an old church, and a stereotypical Venetian bridge makes this idyllic location just right for someone looking to be immersed in the way of life in Venice.
