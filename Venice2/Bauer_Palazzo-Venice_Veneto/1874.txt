I stayed at the Bauer Il Palazzo for 3 nights on May 17, 18 & 19, 2007.  The hotel has a superb location on the Grand Canal, very close to St. Mark's, yet on a quiet side passage. I don't think there is a nicer place to stay in Venice if cost is not a concern.  I had a palatial room with full canal view and a balcony.  Very expensive, but worth it for a splurge.  I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the diverse activities on the Grand Canal.  Traditional Venetian decor.  Large marble bath with separate shower.  The hotel is well maintained to a very high level. Outstanding concierge--not only knowledgeable, but regularly going above and beyond what is expected even of a hotel of this quality.  And this is quality--a solid 5 stars.  Only weakness was only one computerâ€¦
