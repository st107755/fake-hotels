My husband booked 2 nights at this hotel. This hotel is the best hotel we stayed in. The whole atmosphere was lovely. Our room was ready on arrival we had a double deluxe room which had a view of the grand canal on the side. This was beautiful as the gondolas were lovely to watch and listen to. The breakfast view was like i was in the movies.....so so beautiful. If you are thinking of booking this just do it and you will not regret it. As soon as you exit the hotel the shops are right outside with everything close. We loved being here and talk about it all the time.  We are so glad we chose this hotel and celebrated here.   Thanks Bauer Palazzo you are doing an amazing job.
