The staff are superb, quality of the rooms excellent and the hotel is perfectly situated for a romantic weekend in Venice. Within easy reach of shops and St Marks Square. The Breakfast at the hotel is also fantastic. We booked via the British Airways Website and the price was incredibly reasonable for this quality of hotel.
