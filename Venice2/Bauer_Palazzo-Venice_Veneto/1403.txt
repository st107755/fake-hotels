A very tired hotel, I was caught off  guard by the dirty carpet in our room, it was filthy, the bathroom are very compromised and the size of shower might be similar to one found in a boat or motor home! the furniture was minimal at best and pretty well the pieces were scratched and the wear and tear very visible... crazy as this hotel gets good write ups, not sure why, is the best Venice has to offer? I would hope not. BTW I was told I had the "best suite in the hotel"! Crazy. Now, breakfast was also sad and tired, my impression was they "have to offer a breakfast" so lets do as little as possible. And the help, yea throw them in also, nobody is very friendly, again the attitude of we "have to have staff, so lets just put them out there, no need to monitor their behavior"!â€¦
