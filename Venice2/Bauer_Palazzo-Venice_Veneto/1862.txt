Have just returned from a 4 night stay in the Hotel Bauer and loved every minute of it.  I had some reservations after reading some recent reviews but have to admit I was left wondering if in fact I stayed at the same hotel!  We arrived late in the evening and were met at the door by the concierge.  Check in was very efficient and friendly and we were offered a room upgrade without requesting one.  We were escorted to our room and our cases followed.  Our room was excellent - a huge kingsize bed, separate wardrobe and dressing area and immaculate marble bathroom.  It was decorated in traditional Venetian style - some comments on the site suggest that rooms are dated and worn, however ours was quite the opposite offering elegance and charm.  Venice is not a place to come to ifâ€¦
