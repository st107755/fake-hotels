Loved staying here in the thick of the winding streets of Venice, hopped straight onto a gondola coz we had to do this.!!  It' was lovely n relaxing but not on your wallet ! Like most things here nothing comes that cheap. Had plenty of great food, beautiful old surroundings and a most enjoyable 4 days. Just remember this place is not a bargain break weekend ! But it was romantic :)
