Have to give this place 5*. The rooms were AMAZING and the location is excellent.  The only thing I could say negative is that if your not laced in Guci and Louis Vitton then your a second class guest in this hotel and the service from the staff is inferior.  The roof top terrace is gorgeous but your not allowed in if your not top to the dressed to impress so come prepared.  Breakfast on the terrace by the canal is gorgeous and the service there is excellent. The sweet treats at breakfast are lovely but the fresh fruit is to die for.  We would come back here again for the location and quality of the rooms  Many thanks.
