We spent a long weekend in Venice, the hotel has the most impeccable location. From the moment the water taxi stops at their steps you will be taken care of. Fabulous lobby with amazing deco furniture. Marco, the concierge is outstanding, found us low key amazing food places to eat and arranged for all the transfers. The breakfast is amazing in the room by the water with the most spectacular views.  The Bar has great jazz on Fridays and they can make great drinks. Overall, the staff is lovely and courteous.  My only comment is that even though room was large and with lovely views it was a bit "tired", we usually get better rooms through LHW than through hotels.com which is what I used this time. Would definitely return.
