Besides being a wonderful hotel, attentive staff, fabulous outside bar/lounge area, great location, this is where you want to have your breakfast.  The restaurant is right on the water.  WHAT A VIEW.  Dinner is served in the same restaurant but we felt it was a more limited menu.  We had some very picky eaters in our party so we looked for a more basic menu.
