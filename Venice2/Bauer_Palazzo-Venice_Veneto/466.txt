My husband and I stayed in Venice as our first stop on our honeymoon trip to Italy. We arrived late due to missing our train from Milan and not being able to take the next ones as they were sold out. By the time we got to Venice, it was close to midnight, but we were greeted by welcoming staff upon check in. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite in the older part of the hotel and when we got to the room we were blown away. The marble bathroom was amazing as was the rest of the room. We also had a bottle of prosecco waiting for us which was a nice surprise.   The concierge was very helpful in helping us make reservations for dinner and giving us tips on what to see since it was our first time there. The breakfast was amazing and the views outside were only what you could dreamâ€¦
