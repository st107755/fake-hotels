First time to Venice.  We chose Bauer Palazzo based on location and price in relation to other 5 star hotels.  We were not blown away but we weren't disappointed either.  We were given a complimentary upgrade upon arrival on our 2 night visit.  Marco the concierge was very helpful and friendly.  The gentleman at the front desk walked us to the room.  The room was spacious.  It was old world charming but nothing fancy.  The carpet was a bit worn as were the wall coverings.  the bathroom was nice and the toiletries and linens as expected.  The hallways were a bit of a maze to maneuver but not a big deal.  The highlight was the roof top breakfast.  The selection was great- more of a hearty, American style buffet.  The ladies working the breakfast roomwere gracious with funâ€¦
