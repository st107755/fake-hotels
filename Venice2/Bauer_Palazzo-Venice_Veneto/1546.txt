Most of the people that I have talk to, argue that the best hotel in Venice is the Danieli. I cannot agree with them. The location, service, rooms of the Bauer are magnificent. Everyone ready to greet you and make your life a little easier while you trying to chill down in the beautiful Venice. I stayed 2 nights and got 2 Deluxe bedrooms connected through a private hallway. The only problem is the price which is above what I was expecting, but worth every cent.
