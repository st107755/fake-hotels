Stayed here recently for two nights for the VEnice Film Festival - this is a converted convent, and there is still a kinds of reverent hush drifting around the building. Its in a fabulous location, the staff are all adorable, and it has a big bonus of a huge garden for relaxing and sunbathing - quite a major luxury in venice.  The rooms are quite low key and spartan, but still very comfortable, and one of the nicest things is that you're across the grand canal from all the noise and bustle of st marks square - so a lovely little oasis of peace and quiet.
