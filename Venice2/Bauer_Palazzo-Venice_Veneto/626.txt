We didn't stay here, but we met some friends and went here for lunch.  I have to say everything was fantastic!  The staff was friendly, the food was great, the wine hit the spot, and the view was second to none.  We could have spent the day watching the world go by. Worth going for lunch even if you aren't staying in the hotel.
