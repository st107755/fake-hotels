The hotel is beautiful and the location is great! It's literally two minutes away from St. Mark's square.  We booked a canal view room, when we got to there we were informed that we got a upgrade and we have a room that has the grand canal view.  The view is simply amazing.  We had a great experience, the service was wonderful and the staffs were extremely friendly and helpful!  The only thing I didn't like was the bed.  We had a king size bed, but it's one of those that seem to be put together by two small twin beds.  I don't know if that's just the way in Italy, but we had the same bed in our hotel in Rome.  The bed just forces you to sleep on each side, if you attempt to sleep together in the middle, it becomes really uncomfortable and you would feel like you're about to fallâ€¦
