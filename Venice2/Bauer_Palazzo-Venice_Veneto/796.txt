I only stayed here one night during a quick side tip to Venice. It's perfectly located to take the Vaporetto (water bus) from the train station to the hotel stop (San Marco). Just a quick walk from the stop to the hotel & no stairs/bridges to cross. Easy walk to the main attractions in San Marco.  Hotel is a little pricey but beautifully appointed. Also, they have air conditioning, which was great in July.  They have a beautiful outside area that sits along the canal, with gorgeous views!
