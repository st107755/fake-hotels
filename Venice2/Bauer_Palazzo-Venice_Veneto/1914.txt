This was the best of the 4/5 star hotels on our Italy adventure.  The room was spacious (in the Casa Nova section), clean, and with first-class amenities.  The B-bar was great (live piano and pleasant servers) and the rest of the staff generally responsive.  The location cannot be beaten for access to great shopping and the most important attractions.  Come here with confidence!
