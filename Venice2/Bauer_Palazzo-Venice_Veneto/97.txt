The Bauer Palazzo Hotel is in an ideal spot for a Venice trip! This hotel is situated right off of one of the Canals at a Gondolier station. If you are lucky you will face the Canal and see the many tourist taking their Gondola rides. Also, the breakfast was excellent and the bar serves up great drinks. Staff was helpful. Thank you for a great stay at your very fine hotel.
