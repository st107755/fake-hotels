We have stayed in all of the big name hotels in Venice over the past 15 years but Bauer Il Palazzo was by far our favorite!  We were greeted warmly by the front desk.  We arrived early so our room was not ready but they arranged a tour at Fortuny for us.  Fabulous!  The concierge is amazing.  No request was too small.  We then had a wonderful lunch at Psis.  Great food and service.  Our room was amazing.  Large, great view, comfortable bed and large well appointed bathroom.  One afternoon we had a late lunch in the bar.  It was really nice to have this as an option and the food and service were superb.  Breakfast is an amazing experience!!!   The food is so good and the view is to die for.  Only complaint-please have the rooftop open for drinks in the evening.  It is soâ€¦
