We stayed for 2 nights in mid March. We took the train from Florence, which took 3 hours, and on arrival at Venice S Lucia station,  took the No. 1 Vaporetto along the Grand Canal for about 35 minutes to the stop called San Marco. The hotel is a just few minutes walk away from there.   We arrived about 2pm on Sunday afternoon and as our room wasn't ready, we left our bags with the porters and went out for lunch. When we got back, our room had been upgraded and we were given a huge room and bathroom, walk in closet, but quite a dull view of an adjoining roof top.  We loved the spaciousness of our accommodation, and the fact that we were located in a great area, right next to Prada and other smart shops, a buzzy but safe location, and 2 minutes walk from Harry's Bar, San Marcoâ€¦
