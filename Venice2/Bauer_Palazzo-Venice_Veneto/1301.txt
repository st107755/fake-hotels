I walked into the Bauer Grunwald hotel some 25 years ago, just to see....we are just back from an invigorating 4 day stay at the now-titled Bauer Hotel and it has more than lived up to its reputation. It's for the understated, quiet spender. Spill out of your water taxi from the airport into the rather odd European lobby, marble, strange art, a hushed professionalism...and you know you are somewhere unique and special. A good feeling in today's travel world. We had a small suite that overlooked the side canal, which was blissfully quiet, with endless old-world touches that flourish in Venice, with their grip on craftsmen and care. Linens, towels, heavy hangars, fruit candies, duvets, more of anything is not a problem. There seems like a small army of concierges up front to helpâ€¦
