This hotel is well situated near Piazza San Marco. Rooms (we had two) are reasonably large for a European hotel. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were great, and the staff was friendly & helpful. We stayed here for several nights as a prelude to a cruise with Celebrity (the cruise line recommended the hotel). Continental breakfast was served on a deck on the water. The views were amazing... and the food wasn't bad. I'd stay here again.
