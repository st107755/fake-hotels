Have just returned from a short break to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday. The hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are very clean but the only down side our room did not have any natural light which was very disappointing. On the day of my husbands birthday we returned to find a bottle of champagne waiting for us which was a nice surprise. The terrace where the breakfast is served was excellent overlooking the Grand Cannel.
