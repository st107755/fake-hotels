My mother, my aunt, and I stayed at the Bauer as part of our Club ABC tour to Italy.  We had been to Italy previously so we were not "neophytes" to the scene.  The Bauer does not live up the reputation it claims.   First, we loved Venice, mostly because we like glass jewelry and we like shopping and Venice has both in abundance (albeit in expensive abundance).  The Bauer was in a good location, steps from St. Mark's Square, but you should keep in mind that it is hard to be in a particularly bad location in Venice.  It is an island and not all that large.  The hotel was clean and nicely appointed, but the service was poor.  We were in a triple, which was really only the equivalent of a double with a cot, thus it was small for three adults.  Moreover, they did not supply the cot â€¦
