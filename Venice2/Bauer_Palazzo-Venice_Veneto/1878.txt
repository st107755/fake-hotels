Had a wonderful trip to Venice, hotel is beautiful and staff are very attentive. The hotel could do with somewhere to sit and enjoy the sun .  Paolo recommended a couple of nice restaurants for our evening meals. Amazing city!  Gondola ride, although pretty expensive at 100 euros, was the highlight. Took a train ride to Lake Garda on the sunday, very nice! (Take good walking shoes.)
