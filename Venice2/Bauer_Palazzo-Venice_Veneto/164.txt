On my many visits to Venice over the years, I had always wanted to stay at this hotel, and when I finally stayed there last month I wasn't disappointed.    The room was very nice, clean and very adequate, and the room was quite large for Venice.  What made my stay was the view from the terrace at breakfast over looking the Grand canal, and the Santa Maria del la Salute, watching the Gondoliers going passed, and you felt like you were being serenaded too.  The staff were equally pleasant as the hotel.   It is ideally located for St Marks Square, and other tourist spots and for those that want to do a bit of high end retail therapy.
