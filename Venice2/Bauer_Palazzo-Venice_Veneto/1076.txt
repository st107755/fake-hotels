Superb location is within short walking distance of San Marco square and faces the water.  We arrived by gondola "curbside" to the hotel.  Breakfast room also faces the water.  Downer for me was that my room had windows out to a several story high atrium of sorts...not at all an attractive view. The room itself was very nice and hotel service quite good.  I stayed there in April, 2014.
