For Venice Bienale which we visit every 2 years we prefer to stay in Bauer hotel because of its location, service, ambience and the overall quality. This time thanks to reservation office for giving us a beautifull big room upgrade with a nice terrace and city view where we vividly listened also the mıusic comıng from the Canal gondolas.. This unique city and Bauer Hotel give everytime another diary memory more to us..
