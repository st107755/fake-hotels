Wow, fantastic location within easy walking distance of St. Mark's Square.  Get a room facing the Grand Canal such as room 307.  What a view, and the window opens so you can here the sounds of the gondola singers as they go by.  First class all the way.  There are actually a couple of hotels in one. We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo to get the Canal facing room.
