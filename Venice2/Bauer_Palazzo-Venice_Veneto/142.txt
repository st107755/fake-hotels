This is one of Venice's best hotels, beautifully situated at the end of the Grand Canal and accessible by water taxi. this was important for us as we had a lot of baggage for a 24 night cruise we were embarking on at Venice the next day. So many hotels in Venice require the hauling of suitcases over cobbled streets and we did not want that. The hotel is very old and we were given an upgrade to an elegant suite, complete with genuine antiques and chandeliers. The are 2 restaurants, by the waterside and on the roof, as well as all the other things one associates with a 5 star hotel, including the price - Â£400 for B&B but worth it for a special occasion or if you want to get to the cruise terminal in some kind of comfort
