We went to Italy on our honeymoon and we were so disappointed thank God we had only booked one night in this hotel.  the first from all when we arrived to the hotel they couldn't find our reservation!!! We showed them all confirmation where it is confirmed that the room is booked and paid but they wanted to leave the problem to us they told us that we should call Agentur where weâ€˜ve booked the room and resolve it ourselves. We never expect like this in a 5 star hotel plus  the room door was stuck and we couldn't open it, the room was very small, breakfast very poor, staff reluctant. only one plus the entrance hall with fresh flowers.
