This hotel is a magnificent building directly on the Grand Canal in San Marco. Our room was overlooking the small side canal and from our balcony we could see all the gondola activity. The room was gorgeous and exceptionally well appointed. The terrace for food and/or drinks offered beautiful views of all the activity on the Grand Canal, which gets very busy with gondolas, water taxis, etc. Breakfast was great and drinks were very good. I would have given the Bauer 5 Stars except for the fact we found the service on the terrace to be quite slow and tables took quite a while to clean up from the previous guests. Very easy to walk around San Marco and a must visit is Harry's Bar. If staying here, we would recommend lunch or dinner at Teamo, about a 10 minute walk from the Hotel.â€¦
