OK, let's get the not so good out of the way. The Superior Room we had looked out on to a shaft area which looked into other rooms. Even if you cranked your neck by the window, I couldn't see any sky.   At.   All.   Not great, really. A feeling of claustrophobia and you wanted to have the curtains closed the whole time as other rooms could see in - and besides, it was not as if you were missing out on any view. I got to see a Deluxe Room, and while you could see the sky from it (!) it was still pretty small. It also shared a little entry hall with another room which was a little odd - good if you had both rooms, perhaps one for the kids and one for the adults, but not so good if it's complete strangers in the other room.  Now for the better stuff: the staff were wonderful,â€¦
