We went to Venice on 10 February for three nights and stayed at the Hotel Bauer. We were fortunate to get this hotel on an amazing deal so paid pretty much half price for the stay.   The hotel is really easy to get to from Marco Polo airport, we got the bus and then the Vaporetto. It says on the hotel directions to get off at San Marco Vaporesso but get off at San Marco itself as you can then get the quicker vaporetto and there's literally a minute extra walking.  Our room was huge - beautiful wooden floors, lots of space, the bathroom was really nice and fully stocked with everything you need. We didn't have a room with a view but that didn't really matter, they were just so nice anyway.  The buffet breakfast is great - it's served in a room with a fantastic view over the Grandâ€¦
