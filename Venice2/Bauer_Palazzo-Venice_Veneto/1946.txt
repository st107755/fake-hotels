This was my fourth stay at Il Palazzo and a first for my husband.  He is ready to move in!  The room is elegant and beautifully appointed -- Venetian but not too over the top.  The small suite was quiet with minimal canal or hotel noise.  The staff was observant but not obtrusive.  Breakfast is currently being served in the downstairs dining room and is OK.  There is a huge buffet with almost anything a person could want but it gets very crowded as the buffet is shared with all the patrons of the Hotel Bauer as well so get there early or late but not at 8.  The bathroom amentities are very nice and made locally.   The individual fax machine was a nice touch but I wasn't in Venice for business!   And I would love to have such a large dressing room in my own home.  I concur withâ€¦
