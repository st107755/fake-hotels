Flew out from Gatwick using Business lounge and booked business seats with BA ( NO EXTRA LEG ROOM ) with just a seat left vacant really. in the middle. We took the 16.25 flight from LGW which took around 1hr 45 flying time.  We had already booked a private water taxi at 209 Euro's return. From the terminal its around a 10 minute walk ( which used to be outside but now through a covered walkway at the airport) to the water taxi's ( all sign posted) and straight away jump straight into our own ride. It was covered when you get in and from floor to ceiling just enough room for you to sit without bashing head ( open top in the warmer weather though)  It was dark outside and was around 20 min's journey, the last few minute's it goes down the back canals to arrive at your destination.â€¦
