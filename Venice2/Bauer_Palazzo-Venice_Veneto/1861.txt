Just came back from my stay at the Bauer Hotel, Venice, a 40th Birthday present so a total suprise!! Hotel was nice but not exceptional for the cost, as with everything in Venice. If your expecting a reasonable cost break think again. Everything costs the earth!!  Its placed right on the Grande Canal but most of the rooms have no view at all, mine overlooked a store cupboard, unless you can afford the top suite you wont have a view. The bathroom was okay but no shower screen so the floor gets wet and mildew on the walls, and the bath robes were very well used and not comfortable. As far as the fine dining (Gourmet) restaurant give it a miss, very overpriced and not good at all. Speak with the conciege who will send you to a great restaurant called Di Forne just off St Marksâ€¦
