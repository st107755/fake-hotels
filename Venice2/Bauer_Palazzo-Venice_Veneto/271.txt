When booking, be aware that the accommodation in Bauer Casanove is in the four star annexe to the main five star hotel which is a separate building. This means you have to walk outside, between buildings, to breakfast in the main hotel. We already knew this on booking, having read other reviews. Other than that, the service, the room, housekeeping, breakfast, bar, facilities etc are of five star standards. Outstanding accommodation and location. Staff were very helpful and looked after us well. Would love to return.
