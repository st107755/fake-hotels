Myself and my husband chose this hotel as a special treat for my fiftieth birthday and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right choice. The lobby is stunning, huge with marble floors and beautiful furniture and very tastefully decorated.The room was equally as impressive,a large comfortable bed,fabulous wallcoverings and a large marble bathroom with lovely handmade bath products. We had requested a high floor and they honoured this with a room at the top of the hotel,a nice touch was the bottle of very good quality complimentary prosecco.Housekeeping was wonderful they kept the room immaculately clean and the turndown service was nice. The breakfast and breakfast room are also very good the views are fabulous. A special mention must go to Natascha she is a creditâ€¦
