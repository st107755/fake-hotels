Absolutely stunning. The Deluxe Palazzo Double room facing Grand Canal is spectacular, the views are like nothing we had ever seen! Service is top notch and the location is unbeatable. Loved the breakfast on the top floor. If you want a picture perfect memory of Venice, this is the place to stay. Experience of a lifetime worth splurging on. The old part of the hotel where we stayed has a separate reception that you enter from the Grand Canal, rather than the side canal that gets you to the big reception for the large art deco part of the hotel, just in case you take the water taxi.
