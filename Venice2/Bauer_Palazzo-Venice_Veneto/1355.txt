Hungry or not...it's all about the view. Front row seat to Santa Maria della Salute on the canal cannot be beat.   Get in the November high water spirit and climb on a few cafeteria tables to get in and out of the lobby. It's just part of the Venetia scene.  The location is fab, the front desk were very courteous and helpful, the room was absolutely fine and all is right in the world. Some rooms have a view/balcony, I am told. Anyway, go to Venice. It will not be here forever.
