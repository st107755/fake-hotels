Five star treatment in a beautiful Hotel. We parked the car then took the Vaporetto to the Bauer (recommend a 3 day pass for this) We were in the Casa Nova Suite a few yards from the main entrance ... lovely large quiet room with a separate lounge and super bathroom. The hotel, bars and restaurant are very well appointed. Breakfast was excellent ... The terrace overlooks the Grand Canal and St Marks Square is a few minutes walk away ... Superb!
