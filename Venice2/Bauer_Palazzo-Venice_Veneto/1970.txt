My wife and I booked 3 nights in a suite in January 2005. While the location is unbeatable and the size of the room was good, we both felt disappointed by the sterile experience that is the Bauer Hotel.This hotel lacks Soul.Maybe it was off peak but the cold weather was matched by the atmosphere in this place.  The breakfast is very average and again only raised by the superb views across the lagoon.I do not know how they justify the price of this breakfast.The corridors are shabby and generally the hotel has a jaded feel to it.  I cannot comment on the staff as interaction was limited and our only request over the three days not even replied to.  5 star location.3 star Hotel.
