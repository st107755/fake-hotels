My wife and I stayed at the Bauer last month for a week. I can honestly say that it was the best holiday of my life! The Bauer Il Palazzo is a superb, 5 star deluxe establishment situated minutes away from St Marks square. All the best Venice attractions are close by but due to the hotels location just up a narrow calle, the hotel is quiet, peaceful and secluded. The staff could not have been more attentive without being overbearing. We enjoyed a free upgrade to a suite which was immense by Venice standards and had a separate shower room, bathroom, lounge area and an enormous bedroom with an enormous bed. The reception staff all spoke to us by name - always, and were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel restaurant "de pissis" is just fantastic! We enjoyed a memorableâ€¦
