We stayed at the Hotel for 3 night and went to Venice especially to see the Biennale. The Concierge Marco made us get into the Biennale and made the holiday for us amazing. Venice is a wonderful town to visit and sleeping at the Baur in the lovely decorated rooms is very nice but the rooms in the venetian building are a bit noisy. The Room Service was good but a bit to slow.  But we will come back. ;)
