We recently stayed in Il Palazzo with our two kids. The personalized service was excellent! We were upgraded to a suite, which allowed a lot more space for the kids. The location was great, close to St. Mark's Square where we spent a lot of time feeding the pigeons. We will not stay anywhere else if we go back to Venice!
