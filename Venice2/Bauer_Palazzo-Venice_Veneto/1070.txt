The Bauer Hotel is in the heart of Venice and just a short walk from San Marco Square.  You can take a water taxi or Gandola ride right next to the hotel.  There is high end shopping from every corner of the hotel.  Walk just a few steps further and find a vast variety of local shops. Did I say purses yet.  Well plenty of shopping was had by all.  The hotel has a good buffett and you can eat outside and people watch.  Lovely hotel with helpful staff.
