We stayed in the new Baur Casa Nova Residence, which is next to the Baur in a seperate building. Despite beeing absolute near to everything (San Marco etc) it was very quiet. We got a perfect brand new suite with a marble bathroom and everything was very tasteful. The service was excellent. We enjoyed our day in the Baur very much!!
