be carefull when booking this hotel whose main building is very nice greatly placed in venice near piazza san marco on the canal grande and just a stroll from all the great places . insist that your room is on the main building and not at the nearby casa vechia that belongs to bauer but is by far inferior place.so check prices and take a room there even with 50 euros less. our room n24 was small with no view but what was unacceptable was the noise from the room above as the floor has no insulation and could hear people even just talking. for the rest stuff is very polite and helpful breakfast full veranda to eat and drink right on the canal with great views
