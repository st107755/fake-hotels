We had a beautiful room overlooking the grand canal.  The staff were incredibly helpful referring us to a delicious Italian restaurant.  A very easy walk from st Marco square was convenient for arriving and getting back after a day of exploring the streets of Venice and getting lost... could easily find our way back
