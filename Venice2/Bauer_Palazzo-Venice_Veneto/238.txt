Get room 156! You won't believe this but it's true: there is a door near the reception desk, by the elevators - you open the door and simply see a staircase which leads to one door - room 156. It's your personal staircase, personal door, personal room. It has two bathrooms, a sitting room, and the sleeping quarters down the end of the hall, with a separate closet. We thought it was fabulously fun. About the hotel: the breakfast is great, the outdoor areas are great, concierge is helpful, and the location can't be beat. The gym is fine, too, though often hot.
