The Bauer was one of the best experiences of our three weeks in Italy - if you are a first-timer to Venice, please note:  You will not beat this location!  We had a suite overlooking the Grand Canale with a small terrace, and it was picture perfect.  Marble bathroom (as big as ours at home!), separate bedroom and sitting areas, and wonderful, wonderful views made this a very memorable hotel.  It's only a short stroll to the Piazza San Marco (and the adjacent vaporetto stops), and there is a gondola station right outside the hotel entrance.  If shopping is your thing, you won't be disappointed - designer shops are located just across the piazza.  Eating breakfast each morning on the large terrace was especially nice, as was having after-dinner drinks with the same views late atâ€¦
