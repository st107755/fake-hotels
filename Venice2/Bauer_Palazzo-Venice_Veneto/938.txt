  This hotel is the perfect location for exploring Venice very close to St Marks square. It has a terrace with the best view over looking the main canal, the food although more expensive than your average is well worth the extra cost involved. Our large room was of an old classical design the request of a room 236 with a view was better than anticipated it also had a terrace over looking the designer shops and gondola pick up area with the occasional sound of the gondoliers singing and playing accordions as they past by, best of all you arrive at the reception in a water taxi, truly amazing.
