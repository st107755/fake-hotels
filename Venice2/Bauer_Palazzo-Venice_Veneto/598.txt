The Bauer is situated on the Grand Canal, right next to Piazza San Marco.  The terrace on the canal is a wonderful place to relax for drinks and watch the gondoliers ply their trade.  We had a wonderful suite, with an elegantly furnished sitting room and two bathrooms.  The hotel staff was attentive and the concierges were very helpful in arranging our transportation to and from the airport and the the island of Murano to visit the glass factories.
