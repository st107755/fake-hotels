We travelled for a long weekend the 2 Nd week of January. The hotel is fabulous. The location is perfect and it's welcoming yet grand. My husband had taken me to Venice for my birthday and it was a lovely touch of the hotel to provide a bottle of bubbles which we drank on the terrace by the waters edge  Really lovely! We ate in the restaurant and very expensive but a special treat and was delightful!  Only negative was paying â‚¬20 for the Internet which we could have used for free as not once did we have to put the password in!!  Defo would recommend
