We spent 5 magical nights in this hotel for our honeymoon ...Location is just PERFECT (3 minutes from San Marc, in the heart of the luxury shopping center)...Room is typically in venician style, spacious, very confortable with AMAZING view (huge terrace over the grand Canal and Chiesa del Salute) ... Yes it's expensive, but it's worth every penny ...Nothing really to say except: OUTSTANDING ... It's really THE destination in Venice ...A memorable stay ...We are already planning to go back for our wedding anniversary ... One advice: Don't hesitate and don't look further ...It's THE right place in Venice ...
