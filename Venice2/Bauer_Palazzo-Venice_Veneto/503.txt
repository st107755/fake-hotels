We had a superb long weekend at this amazing hotel.  The location, on the entrance to the Grand Canal, is spectacular with the view from our room overlooking the same.  The staff were brilliant and special thanks should go to the General Manager, Matteo (one of the waiters) and Sergio who is the Maitre d'Hotel.  Everything from the food to the room to the concierge were brilliant.  If you are looking to have a luxury stay in Venice book this hotel with confidence.
