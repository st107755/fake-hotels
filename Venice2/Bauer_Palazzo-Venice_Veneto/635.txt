My experience with the Bauer Hotel exceeded my expectations.  We visited the hotel for two nights, August 3-4, 2016.  Wish we had stayed longer.  I love a clean hotel, and The Bauer was spotless!  The Concierge Desk was very courteous, patient and helpful.  They assisted with my boarding passes, transportation to airport, sightseeing, restaurant and gondola recommendations, and offered to make reservations for us. They treated me like royalty.  The buffet breakfast was wonderful! It was included with the cost of the hotel room.  It included several meats - sausage, bacon, cold cuts, eggs - scrambled and boiled, breads, spreads, many fruits, juices, Danish - and whole room full of food.  Very tasty. The bathroom was fit for royalty.  We purchased the cheapest room available, â€¦
