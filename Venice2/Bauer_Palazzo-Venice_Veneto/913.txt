I 've just come back from a stay of a few days at the Bauer and it was perfect ! I had a deluxe room with city view but I didn't expect such a gorgeous room. When I entered the building, I already had a "wow" feeling. Check in went smoothly with very kind Lucia who showed me my room and what a room ! Absolutely gorgeous : very chic art deco, lovely bed, deep bath, great amenities, and a huge terrass with an amazing view. Breakfast offered a large choice and also a magnificent view on the Salute. Staff was very courteous at all times. Hope to be back soon !
