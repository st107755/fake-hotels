That was our third time at the Bauer Il Palazzo. We like the place but do not rate as top. First time we came we were booked in one of those modern low ceiling rooms in the former attic with a private terrace (magnificent view on La Salute). Booking at the Palazzo we were hoping for the Palazzo style and we were therefore disappointed. One should also know that the bathrooms on that floor have no natural light in that part of the Palazzo. Also, due to the ventilation system you can hear conversations from other rooms (especially when you are in the bathroom) which is quite surprising for a 5 star place. Second time we were again in that same room 749 but we explained we do not like it and asked to change. We could move to the real Palazzo to a very nice room. Third time, guessâ€¦
