We always stay in five star hotels and we expected the Bauer  Il Palazzo to be one but were disappointed.  I  read through the other reviews and will agree that the location is fantastic and the 7th floor breakfast and view are amazing but the rooms and staff at the front desk need to be spruced up.   Our room was nice  but a bit plain and in need of new carpet.   For the price we paid, we feel the room should have been in better shape as well as the corridors.   I will also agree with some reviews that the hotel front desk was a bit snobby (not all but a couple) which definitely leaves a negative impression.   We thought this would be the best hotel during our two week italy vacation but  it was not and we don't think we will return to it.
