The hotel lobby to the Bauer Palazzo it quite small especially in comparison to Bauer but that's ok because the rooms are wonderful.  The size was much bigger then I expected & to our pleasant surprise there were draws and enough hangers for everything we needed.  The bathroom was really nice as well and always well stocked.  The view from room 302 was great.  We got a wonderful view of both the Grand Canal and the Rio Moise which was wonderful to have the windows opened to hear the singing gondolas come by.  It is so convenient to walk everywhere from this hotel.  You basically are right behind St Mark Square which is absolutely fantastic!  Special recognition to Marco Minatelli who was just an absolutely wonderful, kind and all around great concierge.  He always had a smileâ€¦
