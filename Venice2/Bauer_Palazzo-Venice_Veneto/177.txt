We arrived at the Bauer Palazzo Hotel to celebrate my 50th birthday.  I chose this hotel because it was so beautiful and on the waterfront.  We checked in and the lady at the front desk showed us to our room.  We were confused because she left the hotel and took us around a dark corner down an alleyway to a door in another building that wasn't even connected to the Bauer. It was very musky smelling and old. I was very upset because we paid for the room  in the main  hotel that was advertised and we did not get to stay there.  The only reason I gave it any stars is because the view from the breakfast area was beautiful.
