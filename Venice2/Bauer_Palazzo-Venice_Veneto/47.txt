Luxurious and professionally appointed hotel in a great location. Rooms are small and quirky - but you are in Venice!!  Central to everything including St Markâ€™s, museums, shops, restaurants and Peggy Guggenheim, and a gondola ride at your front door step. Ask the concierge (Marco) for the best way to see Murano and have the time of your life. 7th Heaven Bar also a great place to see the city from. Brilliant hotel in the best location. Highly recommended.
