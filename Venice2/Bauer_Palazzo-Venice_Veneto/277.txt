This is the second time we stayed here, overall great location, amazing service.  Rooms: traditional old style.  Try to stay in the palazzo building.  It has a small lobby and better access to the water taxi.  Also great concierge service.  Location: great location, walking distance to everything.  Service: top notch  Very romantic place.
