Bauer Palazzo is a true gem in an amazing location.  We spent 3 blissful nights there at the end of August: the staff are incredibly efficient and courteous, and we were so impressed with the concierge who without fail remembered our room number without prompting.  The roof terrace has fabulous views across Venice.  The restaurant De Pesis is truly outstanding and we had the most delicious dinner with a wonderful table overlooking the Grand Canal: we were celebrating our ruby wedding anniversary - all the waiters were so very kind and attentive.  We cannot wait to return to Bauer Palazzo which, in our opinion, is the very best hotel in Venice.
