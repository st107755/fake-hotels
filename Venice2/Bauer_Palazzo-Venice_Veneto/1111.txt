We ordered a club sandwich on room service even though it was €24 we were tired and hungry. What arrived was a three layered sandwich of soggy toasted bread with a slab of rubbery egg(?), limp lettuce, soggy tomato and a microscopically thin slice of something that may or may not have been chicken.
