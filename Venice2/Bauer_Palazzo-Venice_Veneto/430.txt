I first booked a deluxe room : sad and small. Icalled back the front desk. they offered me an upgrade with a gran canal view for 170 euros. And then magic : an other hotel, an other style... chraming room oldstyle byt good bathroom... and the best concierge in the city : helpfull, funny, clever, generous... Venise as it should be!
