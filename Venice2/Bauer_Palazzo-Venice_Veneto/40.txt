We booked this through our Virtuoso agent and as such were entitled to an upgrade. Upon an early arrival, our room was unfortunately not ready. We were told that the room would be ready near noon. We were actually not given the key to our room until close to 3pm..so we were pretty tired and worn.  The room itself was lovely, with a HUGE terrace over looking the city. The view was pretty great and the terrace was nice...too bad it did not have a lounger or some comfortable seating. There was only a table with hard dining chairs.   There was a bottle of Prosecco on ice waiting and the room itself was nice. The bed was comfortable, the bath was large and luxurious. A couple of things were missing, like a clock in the room, and the lighting was not great.  We had breakfast includedâ€¦
