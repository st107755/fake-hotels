The launch boat moored here from our hotel across the lagoon.  We had dinner here, menu read very well, Venice prices.  Starter of ravioli very ordinary.  Main course of monkfish was succulent and saved the day.  Recommend local wine as good and inexpensive.  Service, excellent.   Next day, whilst we were waiting for the launch, we were given a glass oh Prosecco on the house, bravo!
