Stayed at the Il Pallazo last week with my family. One of the best hotels we have stayed in Europe. Fantastic location with an absolutely beautiful  dining terrace on the Grand Canal. Rooms were impecably decorated with good a/c. Concierge went out of his way to help us. A wonderful experience in a wonderful hotel!
