The Bauer Palazzo is attached to the modern Bauer just behind it. The water taxis found this confusing going to the wrong reception twice to pick us up. Anyway, arriving from the Grand Canal was thrilling. Reception were great the concierge superb and all had excellent English. Breakfast was average for the food and service  but a brilliant location on the deck overlooking the Canal. Our suite was as expected spacious and tastefully furnished .The Terrace on top of the hotel was glorious in it's views and served a nice lunch. We also had dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed that. However, the best feature was the hotel's location  - next to main attractions. Highly recommend if you haven't been to Venice before.
