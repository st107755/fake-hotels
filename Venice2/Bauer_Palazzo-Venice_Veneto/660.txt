Just back from a few days in Venice.  Stayed at the Bauer.  The breakfast terrace and staff were top notch.  Roberta and her crew were kind, PRO, delightful.   The two sea gulls that hang out Sofia and Gina were a great added touch and like a little cheese!  This hotel is truly a leading hotel and we will be back
