Arriving by water taxi we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff who showed us to our palatial room with its silk covered walls, huge marble bathroom with separate shower, large, soft, white towels and big fluffy bathrobes.  We have travelled the world and stayed in many great hotels but this one was the best.  From the excellent breakfast buffet with heavy silver tea and coffee pots served on a terrace with fabulous views, to the wonderful dinner in the restaurant overlooking the Grand Canal everything about this hotel surpassed our expectations.  Add to this its situation close to St Mark's Square and wonderful shopping we could not have asked for more. This was our first visit to Venice but it will not be our last and our hotel of choice will always be the Bauer Ilâ€¦
