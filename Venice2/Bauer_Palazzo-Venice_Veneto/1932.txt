My husband and I absolutely loved this hotel and Venice. Great location. Front desk staff  were always helpful and friendly. We had the superior room with the jacuzzi tub and view of the street below as well as the canal. Great for people watching. Room was spacious and comfortable. Decorating was outdated but that didn't bother us at all. Bed was absolutely comfortable. Enjoyed every minute of it. Would stay here again.
