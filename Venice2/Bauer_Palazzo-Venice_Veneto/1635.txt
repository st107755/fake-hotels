The hotel personal is very  professional  and helpful. I didn't like the Entrance to the lobby  or coming down an alley to enter the lobby. Our room Was nice but much too dark, the lighting was terrible. The bathroom was  excellent . But not good enough to stay there again.     The dining room was very good and so was the food.
