There are several hotels in Venice belonging to the Bauer group, and two of them seem to be the same building, L'Hotel and Il Palazzo. I had booked Il Palazzo as I really wanted to stay there, then was informed that from now there was now difference between the two buildings anymore, and that I would stay in the modern part, anyways, in the end I had a very beautiful room in the old part called Il Palazzo. I loved it. Fantastic view to San Marco and the tower, beautiful luxury room and bathroom, breakfast on the rooftop overlooking the laguna... , very friendly staff, a perfect treat. The modern part of the hotel is fair enough, but this older section really is yet another story... for a special day I'd return anytime. Of course the location in the heart of town is unbeatable.
