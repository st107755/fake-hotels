We have just returned from a fantastic 3-night stay at Il Palazzo.  We had booked the Bauer, but were upgraded to a wonderful room in Il Palazzo, which had a balcony overlooking the side canal and views to the Grand Canal.  I could have easily spent my entire time in Venice either on our balcony, or on the terrace where breakfast was served, watching all the activity on the water; it was fascinating!  During our stay, we were thoroughly spoilt by the friendly staff who anticipated our every need.  The location of the hotel is excellent too.  In summary, this hotel was expensive, but worth every Euro!
