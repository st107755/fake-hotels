We spent part of our unforgettable honeymoon in this romantic and beautiful old palazzo, that made us feel like in ancient Venetian times. The hotel is beautifully located just at Canal Grande and only few steps from Piazza San Marco. The reception was always very helpful and friendly and gave us good hints for restaurants and they made reservations for the nicest tables in the best restaurants in Venice! The deluxe rooms are luxuriously furnished in ancient Venetian style, some of them with balcony and breathtaking view on Canal Grande. The first highlight every day was the delicious breakfast from the rich buffet, unbelivable view from the beautiful terrace, also with view on Canal Grande and the best and attentive service ever: Thank you for everything Lucia, Manuela andâ€¦
