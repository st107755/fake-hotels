the location of this hotel s excellent. It is dark and traditional. The staff are the most miserable i have ever come across. our welcome was cold to freezing. We were lucky the receptionist actually looked up at us. nobody smiled, not even the receptionist who took us to our room. Visiting a Hotel like this should be like visiting somebody's home, the welcome is so important. The staff are more important than the guests.
