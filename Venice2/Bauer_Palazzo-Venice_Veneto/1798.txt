Truly Romantic, perfect honeymoon hotel overlooking the canal. We had a beautiful room with a balcony. Venetian Decor. We had Champagne in our room when we arrived! Excellent breakfast, close to St. Mark's Square and all the luxury shopping. Very nice breakfast in a room overlooking the canal. Professional and courteous staff. Canal cruise right at the doorstep. A magical experience, worth the price!
