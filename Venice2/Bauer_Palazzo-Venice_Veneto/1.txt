Stayed with my mother for a week. It is not the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at but it was very good.  The room was comfortable and clean and the staff was pleasant. the food in the restaurant is very good and the service was fine. The bar with outside patio on the grand canal is amazing!  I think we stopped there for a drink almost every day because of the view and friendly service. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. Easy to go to the Square when it is less crowded when you are only steps away.
