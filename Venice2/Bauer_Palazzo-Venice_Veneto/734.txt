We have just returned from our honeymoon where we spent terrific 5 days at the Bauer Hotel. This choice of hotel was a leap of faith from the good reviews on tripadvisor, thankfully we chose well. The hotel was clean and tidy throughout and gave a service to match any hotel that I have stayed in on foreign soil. The breakfast was simply amazing.....taken in the open terrace area overlooking the Grand Canal - what a start to the day!   The hotel location is perfect as it is located at the southern point of Venice which means you can walk in almost any direction without taking the same route.   Travel tip: From the airport take the Alilaguna orange route to Santa Maria Del Giglio....NOT the blue route to San Marco as (1) It takes 30 min's longer (2) it's a more picturesque routeâ€¦
