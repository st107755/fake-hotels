We stayed 5 nights at The Bauer and loved every minute. The room was gorgeous, the location is perfect, the staff are so friendly and the breakfast view is second to none.  My husband received a chocolate cake for his birthday, which was a lovely touch. We feel so lucky to be able to stay here and we will will be back again in January 2021. Thank you for the perfect stay!
