Superb location just 1 mins walk from Saint Marks Square. The hotel is a little oldy-worldy. Beware that to enter it you officially have to enter through a side entrance down a narrow passageway as the hotel itself is located behind and adjoining to the Bauer Hotel which seems to be the more modern/newer part of the hotel. The older Bauer Il Palazzo overlooks the river behind and from where you can catch a water taxi etc. Of course you can get to it if you walk in to the newer part of the hotel but it takes a little longer. Room was ok.Again a little old fashioned and not much of a view.A much better view is afforded from the top floor breakfast room which over looks the city.Breakfast again was just your typical continental fair.
