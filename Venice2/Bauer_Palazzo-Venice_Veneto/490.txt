Venice is a very expensive city to visit and this hotel is no exception. However compared to other luxury hotels within the San Marco area, this is probably one of the best.  I had originally booked another hotel which was a major disappointment so we moved to this hotel on the second day of our stay. With a wife with disability issues, we wanted to be near to the major attractions and this hotel is superbly located just about 250 metres from the square itself. The major shops like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs etc are literally outside the front entrance.   The breakfast (although a buffet) is taken on a roof top terrace and is well presented fresh and you have a choice of sitting both outside and in. Of course we sat outside and noted most people were seated inside. Why?â€¦
