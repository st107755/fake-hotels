We stayed here for two nights in June. It was a spacious room and well appointed. The location is fantastic. We were dropped at the front door by our water taxi and we were just a short walk to St. Mark's Basilica and the square. The second night we were there, Venice experienced a "high tide" and the streets were flooding. The hotel staff was excellent. We had to cancel our dinner reservations at the restaurant we had planned since we could not get there on foot and the tide was too high for the gondoliers to get under the bridges. The staff arranged for us to have dinner at their sister restaurant which was on the other side of the Great Canal and we could get there by using their boat. Dinner was pretty good although the waiter was swamped. I am sure they had not planned onâ€¦
