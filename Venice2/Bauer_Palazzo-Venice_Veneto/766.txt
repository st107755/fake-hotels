I wouldn't rate this hotel as exceptionally luxurious, nor very good value for money. However, Venice is exceptionally expensive so there are no real value for money hotels. The hotel is clean and the receptionists are obliging and courteous. The breakfast, which was included as part of our package, is well presented and adequate. Besides the eggs as part of the buffet, anything extra is charged for.  The location of the hotel is excellent - a stone's throw away from St Mark's Square and an easy walk from the ferry - about 11 stops away from the train terminal.  I would recommend the location.
