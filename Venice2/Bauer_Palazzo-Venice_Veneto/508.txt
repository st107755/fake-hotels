Stayed for a couple of nights following an Adriatic cruise. Lovely setting next to St Marks square. Nice room, although no view, with fantastic bathroom (more a ballroom!), good breakfast with attentive staff.  Great location and an easy walk to the main sites. Being December very quiet, which suited us as it was easy to get into the Basilica and plenty of restaurant offers.
