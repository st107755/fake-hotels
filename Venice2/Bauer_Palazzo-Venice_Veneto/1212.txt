I am a bit late writing my review, but I could not let it go.  Our stay at The Bauer II Pallazzo was absolutely perfect.  Before I get into the particulars, I want to mention that there are 2 Bauer properties connected to each other.  One, with lobby access from the square.  The other, with lobby access on a side street.  Both have access from the water but Bauer II has a boat dock that faces the Grand Canal.  While the 2 hotels have separate lobbies and seem to be treated as different properties, they are connected and share common areas.   We arrived by water taxi and checked in at the  Bauer Il Pallazzo, but I actually think we stayed in The Bauer Hotel.  It appears to me that the Bauer Hotel may be a bit more modern.   Now for our stay, The Bauer and Baure II delivers luxuryâ€¦
