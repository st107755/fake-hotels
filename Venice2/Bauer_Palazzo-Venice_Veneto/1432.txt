A really magnificent hotel, front line Grand Canal. Very good accommodation and great food. Nothing could prepare you for the breakfast experience on the terrace. (You couldn't buy this view if you tried). Very friendly staff, especially the front desk and the concierge. We were very grateful for the help and advice given by the concierge when my wife had a minor medical emergency. We also took the courtesy launch to the other Bauer hotel across the grand canal.  We have since recommended this hotel to friends who have stayed or had lunch there.
