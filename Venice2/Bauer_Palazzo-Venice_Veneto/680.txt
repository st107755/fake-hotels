My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on July. The staff was very helpful and the location of the hotel was very central. We got a very good rate and we got upgraded to a side canal view on the fifth floor which was nice. We also enjoyed the view during breakfast on the terrace (although the food was just ok). The hotel has a rooftop bar with one of the best views in the city although it seems as though people don't really know about it as it was pretty empty. I highly suggest anyone staying at the hotel check it out.   There is also a boat to the other properties across the canal if you want to get away from the tourist mess of central Venice.   Overall good experience given the rate we got. If you are going to stay in central Venice it's all about location and thisâ€¦
