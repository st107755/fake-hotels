At first we made a reservation to the hotel Casa Nova Very disappointed that this is not the level we are used to it The hotel staff was very accommodating and realized we were wrong, and upgraded us to a large room in the hotel, at a fair price. The children wanted to stay in Casa Nova. This hotel suitable for young people.  We were very pleased from Bauer, Cleanliness, service, meals ... everything was perfect!
