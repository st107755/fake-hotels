Stayed two night in August before heading on to sea.  Upgraded to room high up with lovely view of canals/sea.  The roof top terrace on 7th floor is well worth a visit. Good quality breakfast although a bit hectic due rush of guests just before closing.  The cafe/breakfast area is wonderful and perfect place to relax looking out at the water and away from all the tourists swarming around the city.
