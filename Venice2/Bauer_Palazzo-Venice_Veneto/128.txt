This is a beautiful hotel, our room overlooked a canal where the gondola stand is. We could hear the gondoliers singing, it was a wonderful experience.  I can't say enough about this hotel, the staff is wonderful, they go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and all of your needs are met.  The breakfast in the beautiful dining room was delicious and had a great selection.  We are looking forward to staying here again and highly recommend this hotel.  Thank you!
