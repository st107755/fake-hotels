The hotel is very well located, Near almost everithing to see in Venice. Easy to find and to arrive at. The rooms are OK, needing some work to modernise a bit. But everithing works well and the dimensions are good. The hotel is beautiful, and the breakfast room is very nice with a great view. The service is good and the personnel very attentive. I reccomend it.
