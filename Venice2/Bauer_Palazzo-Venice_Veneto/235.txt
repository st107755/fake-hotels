We celebrated our 20th anniversary at the Bauer (where we came for our honeymoon 20 years ago!), with our kids.  The staff were so kind and engaging, they even went back to their archived paper files, and put us in the same room we had 20 years ago!  To take that extra step was far and beyond anything we ever expected.    The room we had was old world luxury.  Not musty or worn as one would expect, but beautifully appointed rooms, with immaculate marble bathrooms, textured and padded walls, comfortable and updated bedding...we felt like doges!  The service was excellent, always, the breakfast spread was expansive (for a European type breakfast), and the breakfast terrace views were unrivaled on the Grand Canal, with a gondola "parking lot" adjacent to the rails.  Just amazing. â€¦
