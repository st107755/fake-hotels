Passing the hotel one evening after dinner we heard live music. Having seen posters around town for 'Jazz at The Bauer' we thought we'd investigate. We went into the bar where there was indeed a very good band playing so we sat down and a waiter came to take our order. He mentioned straight away that there would be a cover charge of nine Euros each for the music - not a problem as this usually (should) go to the musicians and we were happy to pay it. What he failed to mention was that there were only two more songs in the set before the band finished for the night. The drinks are quite pricey as well so the upshot was that we got two drinks and two songs for almost the same price as we'd paid for dinner earlier in a perfectly nice restaurant.  I'm just writing this review soâ€¦
