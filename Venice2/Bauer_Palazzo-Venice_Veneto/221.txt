This is real gem of a hotel. Yes we paid a little more than some other hotels in  Venice but boy did we get value for that. The room is spacious  very clean and very well equipped with good air con. The view from our room  was superb over the gondolas and roof tops. However not everyone is fortunate to have that. The views from the ground floor restaurant or the roof top bar which everyone staying at the hotel can enjoy are amazing looking straight across the Grand Canal.  Later on we found that the hotel provide a courtesy water taxi service to other islands directly from the ground floor restaurant. We took advantage and went to a Maurino glass factory for a guided tour and return water taxi trip all for no extra charge. Breakfast has been one of the best hotel breakfastsâ€¦
