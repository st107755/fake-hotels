If studying mosquitos is your thing, then this is the hotel for you. On the other hand if you hate being bitten by them look elsewhere. I was given a narrow poky room, which I suppose was an ideal breeding place for them. Definitely not what you expect for your $450 a night. The hotel is handily located next to the ferry stop, so escape is relatively easy. This place is definitely over-priced for what you get and in comparison with equivalent luxury hotels.
