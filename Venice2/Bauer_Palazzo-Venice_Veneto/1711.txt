We arrived in style at the Bauer Il Palazzo on 7th April 2011.  We caught a private water taxi from the airport which took about 40 minutes and cost 100 euro.  When we arrived at the hotel we were greated by Paulo and his team, they took our luggage off the boat and straight up to our room, whilst we were offered a glass of water and somewhere to rest whilst they organised the room key for us.  The room (746) was on the 7th floor and had a lovely large terrace which views over the Grand Canal and the busy street behind the hotel with all the lovely designer shops on.  The room it self was a little tired but I think Venetian style in general is!  The bathroom was lovely, all marble with a seperate shower and bath and nice big mirrors, essential for a lady!!  My only fault aboutâ€¦
