this must be a great hotel very well placed on the grand canal very near piazza san marco  and in the middle of the shopping district with lots of restaurants nearby.however take care when booking to stay away from casa nuova which is next door to the main building it belongs to bauer but is inferior even for a lesser price . room n24 for example is rather small but most important you can hear everything happening in the room above like people talking plus no view . my review concerns my experience at the casa nuova , the rest like breakfast area bar etc very nice stuff extremely polite
