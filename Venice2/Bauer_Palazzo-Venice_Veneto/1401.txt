Stayed here for one night. Location of the hotel was perfect. Many great shops very near by and only a 2 minute walk to San Marco.  Rooms were nice and clean although a little bit dated. The only problem we had was the internet where the signal was very weak. We had to stand by the door to use the wifi as it did not really reach other areas of the room.  Staff very welcoming and attentive.
