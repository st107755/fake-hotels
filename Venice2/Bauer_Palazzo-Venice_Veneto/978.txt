We stayed after a cruise.  Great location on the grand canal and close to St Marks square.  The hotel is very nice and we stayed in the Palazzo part of the hotel. The service is friendly and accomodating. We enjoyed a delicious lunch overloozing the Grand Canal.  We started our morning with breakfast on the roof top terrace. Will come back and enjoy more of Venice.
