We started our trip in Venice and it was a wonderful welcome to Italy. Originally scheduled to stay at the Bauer, we were upgraded to a suite at the Il Palazzo. The suite included a Grand Canal view balcony (two chairs, no table), a large living room, a large bedroom and a fabulous bathroom. The bathroom consisted of a large shower, a separate sunken tub jacuzzi.  Although we didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant, it gets very good reviews.  One strange thing...we had to walk a bit of a distance (and two elevators) to get to your room.
