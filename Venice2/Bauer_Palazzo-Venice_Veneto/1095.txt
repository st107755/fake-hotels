The location can't get much better and in reality you get what you pay for. This hotel fronts on the Grand Canal only a few blocks from St. Marks Square. It feels old although the rooms are clean and pretty. The staff is very helpful (especially the concierge). This was our first trip to Venice so maybe this type of hotel is to be expected. Above average but not great.
