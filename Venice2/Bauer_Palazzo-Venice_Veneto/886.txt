The hotel is stunning! The design of the hotel just like a palace! The suites are stunning, the service we received in this hotel is the best service we have ever hotel (thanks to Elena!) Breakfast really varied, there is a large selection of breads, pastries and cheeses and of course the most delicious cappuccino in Venice! The hotel's excellent location, close to San Marco and all the beautiful boutiques, near the gondolas but not too noisy. Just perfect!
