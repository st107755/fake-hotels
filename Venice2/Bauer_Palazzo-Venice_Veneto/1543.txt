We stayed for three nights at the Bauer Casa Nova, which is a separate building from the main hotel. We need to use our cards to get into the building, so it felt like we had our own private apartment in venice! The room was clean and the decorations was typical venetian, very romantic. Breakfast was served on the main building overlooking the grand canal and the Santa Maria della Salute. Location was perfect.
