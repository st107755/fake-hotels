This was our third visit to Venice and we booked five nights at the Bauer Palazzo. From the time we checked in until we left our stay was absolutely superb. We upgraded our room on check-in and the receptionist was very helpful. Gianluca and his concierge colleagues were really superb helping with all sorts of information and making bookings for us. Breakfast on the terrace was great and the whole experience was excellent. The only small issue was that we had two single beds pushed together and not a true double. We will book again on our next visit.  Thank you!
