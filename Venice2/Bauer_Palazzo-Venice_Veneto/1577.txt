We picked up this hotel on a super discount site so we knew going in that we'd get the worst rooms which weren't that bad.  They had tall ceilings, a new bathroom and AC that worked well.  The only issue was a goofy shower that got water all over the floor.  This hotel was marketed as 5* but I'd really only give it 4*.  My only complaint was that the Internet is a bit spotty.   The breakfast on the deck outside overlooking the Grand Canal is worth the price alone and the location is excellent just a minute walk to Plaza San Marco.  I'm happy with the hotel for what we paid but would I pay full freight for this hotel...I don't think so.
