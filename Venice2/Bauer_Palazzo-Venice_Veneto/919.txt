Several years ago I stayed at the Bauer.  Today on a one day trip from Florence to Venice traveling with three friends I go lost and went to the Bauer.  The girl at the front desk was so sweet offering the WiFi and phone.  I decided to wait in the bar and Roberto was amazing!  I had wine and snacks.  I think it is the best place in the world to be lost.
