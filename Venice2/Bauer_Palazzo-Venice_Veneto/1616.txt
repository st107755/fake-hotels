What a disappointment! We were expecting aroom with canal or street view and we got a wall. Lights had to be on at all times as there was no natural light -impossible to know what the weather was like. This didn't come cheap. Having booked through Citalia we have complained over the misrepresentation of their website but after several e-mails and telephone conversations we have got nowhere with the company. Yes the hotel is in an excellent location and breakfast was lovely but would not recommend it as when we walked round Venice we found so many other hotels offering more for a good deal less.
