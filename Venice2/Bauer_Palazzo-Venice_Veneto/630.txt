Absolutely perfect location - just off San Marcos square and on the Grand canal. Easy to access by cost effective local transport - water bus 7 Euros per person. Wonderful staff and amazing setting. All the "singing" Gondolas come passed while sitting on the outside balcony and picture perfect setting. Lovely posh room with a gorgeous bathroom, dressing room and comfortable bed. We loved it. A perfect piece of our honeymoon in Italy. Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed.
