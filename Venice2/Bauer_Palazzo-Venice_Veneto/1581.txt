This was our second trip to Venice & our second stay at The Bauer.  I cannot express how happy we are with our choice.  There was a moment of hesitation prior to booking (yes it is pricey), but in the end, we wound up booking through a travel website with a combo air & hotel package.  That brought our cost down. This trip was extra special since we were in Venice to get married. Due to this, we splurged & got a suite. I recalled our last visit & how impressed I was with the large size of a regular room, but WOW!!  On this visit, our suite was probably as large as a NYC apt.  There was a glass paneled foyer, a sitting room w/ fireplace, a living room w/ TV, the large master & 2 (!!) bathrooms.  The service throughout our stay was perfection. The housekeeping staff was in & out inâ€¦
