We wanted a romantic meal by the grand canal on the final night of our honeymoon and this place didn't dissapoint. The food was just wonderful and the views absolutley beautiful. The staff were fantastic, even if slightly mortified that I put my handbag on the floor and not on the table hanger but they rectified that quite quickly! Really beautiful location, will definately go back.
