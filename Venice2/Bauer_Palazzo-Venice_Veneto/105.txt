Hotel consists of two parts - an older part that is on the Grand Canal and a newer part that was not designed to fit in with the rest of the buildings or the other buildings beside it. Service, including the concierge, was very good. Toiletries provided by the hotel were excellent. A good bed. The only negative was that the room had carpeting that needed cleaning.
