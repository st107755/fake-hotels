Check in was friendly and professional and the room rate very competitive by Venetian standards. We were in the annexe , although not directly connected, it was fine. a really nice luxurious room and a great bathroom in white marble with large bath and separate shower. Fresh linen and a comfortable bed.  Breakfast was excellent on the terrace. To be honest, if your budget is 2-300 euros per night - this is probably the best bet in Venice.  I gave it a v good rating- it just lacks that little bit of magic to get an excellent rating. Maybe a little soulless.
