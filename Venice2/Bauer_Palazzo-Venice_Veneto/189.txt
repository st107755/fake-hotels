Stayed three nights in one of the old Palazzo rooms. Very elegant with wonderful Murano glass lights and mirrors. Stunning views across the grand canal.  The buffet breakfast on the rooftop terrace was excellent and the views from there over the city were stunning. Dinner on the terrace by the Grand canal was also superb. All the staff were very attentive. Great position only a few minutes walk from St Marks Square. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a special stay.
