Beautiful Old World 2 Room Suite with Balcony on the Grand Canal.  Classic Modern Bathroom with separate shower and spa tub which felt great after a day of exploring.  Authentic Art which gave the Living Room a Rich Quality.  Breakfast in Settimo Cielo was heavenly (view on the Grand Canal, Food, Drink & Service included)  Passing gondola's added to the ambiance.  Staff - Good to Us!  Oh the Memories :)
