We stayed at the Bauer Hotel for 4 nights....perfect location, perfect service and one of the most beautiful hotels in Venice.  It is located on the Rodeo Drive of Venice....wonderful shops and restaurants nearby.  All price ranges for food.  Only 2 blocks from St. Mark's Square and Harry's Bar.  I do suggest you take car and boat taxi from airport.  Well worth the extra expense...they bring you right up to the side of Hotel.  You do not have to mess with luggage!
