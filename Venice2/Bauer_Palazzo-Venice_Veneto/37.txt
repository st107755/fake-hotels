This must have been a wonderful 5 stars, but today the hotel is very far from being a 5 stars. The facility itself is very nice the room are very well but seriously the standard of the some items in the room are at the level of a 3 stars, first you need to ask to have a coffee machine in your room, second the TV is just out dated it is not what you would find in an Holiday Inn express! Now breakfast, recently we were in Napoli, in a Novotel, the breakfast was 3 times better both in quality and in diversity of food. I was really badly surprised by the Hotel, I love Venice and will come back again but not at the Bauer. No one should consider that because it has a reputation he should forget to take care of it's customers in the best way...
