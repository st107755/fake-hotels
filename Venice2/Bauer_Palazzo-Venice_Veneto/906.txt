We spent just one night at this charming hotel overlooking the Canal Grande. We were granted an upgrade and stayed in a beautiful room with partial view of the Canal, lots of space, a very large marble bathroom equipped with both bath and shower, very quiet, no smell despite silk tapestry on the wall and full carpet. And the toiletries were very good, too. Do go and ask for a room in the old part of the hotel - the Palazzo. Do not miss a visit to Assouline, the lovely bookshop opened in the hall of the Bauer hotel.
