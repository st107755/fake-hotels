 I booked the Bauer Palazzo because I wanted to be as close to San Marco as possible. I also wanted a nice romantic setting with fantastic views and service. This hotel exceeded my expectations and delivered on every level of what a great Hotel should be. The Room was a bit old and need to have more outlets so that one could plug in a cell phone. But otherwise that hotel was perfect. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone going to Venice!!!
