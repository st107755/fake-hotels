There is really two properties that appear as one. When you are walking from the main Calle you see a newer hotel without much character. This is the main hotel. However, on the far left side facing the hotel there is an alleyway that you need to,talk all the way back almost to the water. There is an entrance to the Palazzo hotel of the right side. This part of the overall hotel is the older part with tons of character. Check-in was a great experience and then they showed us around before taking us to our room. The room was huge and had some canal views. We really enjoyed it. Breakfast was on the top floor with a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. There also is a bar area here as well with lovely views. Staff was great, location was great as was the room and public area! Greatâ€¦
