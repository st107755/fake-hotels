The Bauer Palazzo is a five star hotel, but just barely.  It has a great location, large rooms for the money and a professional, helpful staff.  But it is dated with old, plain furnishings in poorly laid out rooms.   Like it probably was 30-40 years ago. For example, no room key cards, actual keys.  No safe with push-button combinations, but with actual keys (which you must then hide). Small TV's with poor reception. Our spacious room had a shower that wasn't much bigger than a phone booth.  The breakfast buffet was sub-par, although sitting outside on the canal made up for it.
