This hotel is everything a 5 star hotel should be but what makes it even more memorable and special is the genuinely warm service and welcome from the staff. It doesn't have that stuffy cold atmosphere many 5 star hotels have, it's really personal and without exception every member of staff we experienced were incredibly warm and friendly.    The roof top breakfast restaurant is also probably one of the best views in any city in the world. It is spectacular.    What a stay. Can't wait to return.  !
