My husband & I stayed at 3 nights in early Sept of this year. When we booked this hotel, we were under the impression that we will be staying in a luxury 5 star hotel. However, when we got there, we were informed that our room that we booked is in their sister hotel next door, called the Casa Nova. (Please note that nearly all travel websites I have looked at, will give you the impression of staying in the main 5 star hotel, but really you'll most likely stay in the sister hotel which is more like a 3.5-4 star... So make sure you ask before you book!) We asked if we could upgrade the room so that we could stay in their main hotel, we were told that we could not receive any credits from our current room, that we would have to cancel our current room and book a room of theirs,â€¦
