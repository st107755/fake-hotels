Old world luxury, Sophia Lauren, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn kind of charm.  Spent a couple of nights in a room with a view of the grand canal and Basilica di Santa Maria.   Breakfast is served on the top floor (indoors and outdoor terrace) with a great view, make sure you don't miss it.  Great location being a short walk away from St Mark's square.
