This was my third stay at The Bauer and each time it is such a pleasure. I wouldn't stay anywhere else. The staff are wonderful our room always perfect and the best view for having a leisurely breakfast, finishing off with a glass of fizzy. Just perfect, thank you The Bauer once again for a fabulous stay.
