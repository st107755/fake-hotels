For our daughters 18th and 21st birthdays we returned to Venice to stay again in our favourite hotel. The service was impeccable.  The rooms were spotless.  The views spectacular.  2 min from St Marks, the location is perfect. We had trouble printing our boarding passes to fly on to Rome and the reception sorted out for us.  The  breakfast is mostly self service and of excellent quality. The manager was visible around the hotel and was very helpful in relation to some information we required. We will return this year  for a 5th visit  since discovering the hotel and would recommend anyone thinking of a night in Venice to choose the Beaur. Experience the luxury.  Take the speedboat from the airport right to the door of the hotel. It completes the whole experience.
