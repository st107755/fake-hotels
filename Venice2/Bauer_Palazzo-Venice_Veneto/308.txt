Very satisfactory for what we wanted although whole area was shrouded in fog.  As everyone knows Venice is crowded with tourists like us !  We have been to Venice several times before so we were not actually deterred by all the people. We arrived by pre-booked water taxi from the airport and both our bags were delivered pronto to our comfortable room.  Excellent breakfast overlooking Grand Canal but still shrouded in mis.  Recommendation previous night by concierge of a dining place was not as good as it might have been.  Went to interesting exhibition on Vivaldi called 'Viva Vivaldi'.  Very good continuous show lasting as long as suits you costing about 12Euros each.  well worth a visit.
