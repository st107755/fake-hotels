Ths is a classic old school luxury European hotel just moments away from St Marks Square and on the grand canal.  The rooms were, clean were well done and spacious, the staff great and helpful and the breakfast on the veranda a front seat view to the grand canal.  It's pricey but you feel ok given all of the above
