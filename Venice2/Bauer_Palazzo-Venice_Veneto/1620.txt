We spent 4 days at this extremely well located hotel.  The staff was very helpful and even added towels/pillows to our room upon request.    The breakfast banquet is served on the outside terrace overlooking the Basilica and the Gran Canal.  Does it get any better than that?  Well, yes, when alongside the hotel comes a gondola with a singing gondolier.    The bathrooms were very modern and well appointed. Our bed was very comfortable.  The food everywhere in Venice is divine.   Enjoy!
