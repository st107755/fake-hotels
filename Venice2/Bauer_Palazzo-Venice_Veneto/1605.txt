I stayed in this PALACE with my husband for 2 nights . The biggest surprise was the room , it was as big as a studio flat . ( room no 516) . The breakfast was faboulus with delicious cheese & bread alternatives . We arrived the hotel with a water taxi ( costs 100 â‚¬ ) from the airport ( 1/2 hour ) and hotel had a private deck .We had drinks at the bar but the service was not as good as a 5 star hotel.
