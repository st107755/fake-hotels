Beautiful hotel in a perfect location. With in easy walking distance of major attractions. Family of 5 so 3 to share a room was easy as the rooms  were very spacious. Evening drinks on the terrace a must do as you watch the gondolas go by. Breakfast was great with everything on offer and the service by all was impeccable . Could not fault this hotel .
