The Bauer Hotel is superb in every respect!! Location, location, location. If time is of the essence then the Bauer fits the bill. Close to San Marco Square and its many shops, sights and restaurants. The Superior Suite was spacious and inviting. It is a classy hotel that offers all the amenities. You cannot go wrong.
