Don't waste either your time or  money staying here.  5* my foot.  Having travelled extensively for many years,  we can honestly say that our experience of the Bauer Hotel was dreadful, the room was the worst we have stayed in anywhere. Peeling, dirty paint, curtains hanging off the rail, really very rude staff and a brick wall for a view.  There is antique furniture and there is just plain, simple shabbiness.  We had the latter.  It ruined the end of our holiday.
