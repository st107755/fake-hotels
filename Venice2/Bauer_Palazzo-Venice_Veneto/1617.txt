We stayed in the Baur Il Palazzo in the deluxe suites and just fell in love with the place. Venice itself is a very beautiful city and our rooms added another star to it. The rooms were big and spacious and food was also good. The staff was very courteous, polite and helpful. They told us about the city and recommended a few nice places to visit. +The hotel is very close to St. Marks Campanile.
