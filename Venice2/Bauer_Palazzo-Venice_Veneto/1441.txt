We stayed in this Great Hotel for two night 12/7.We had just arrived from London on the Orient Express. On checking in we were up graded to a suite. Wonderful with a balcony overlooking the side canal. The staff were very friendly .The position of the Hotel great right in the shopping area. Some very good restaurant recommendations from the concierge. We loved the Style of the Building. A great stay thank you to the BAUER!!!!!!
