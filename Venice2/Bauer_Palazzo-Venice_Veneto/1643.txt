Tooo much thinking is not so good and i THOUGHT that Venice would be a one time in life experience and was SURPRISED by its beauty and history and many many nice places, restaurants and awesome buildings. The Il Pallazzo in Venice was from A to Z a very warm place where you feel yourself at home and the architecture and interior design is magnificient and worse seeing - i will go back to visit this wonderful hotel and one of the most charming cities in this world
