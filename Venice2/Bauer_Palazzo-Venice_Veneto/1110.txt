This hotel was in a perfect location, a few minutes from the Vaporeto and St. Mark's Square, and with great views. Even though our room was not facing the Grand canal, it still had fabulous views. The courteous, professional and friendly manner of all staff was notable. Dining room staff presiding over the excellent breakfast buffet were efficient and pleasant.
