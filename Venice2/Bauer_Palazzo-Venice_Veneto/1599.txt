The best thing about this hotel is it's location. Right in the middle of the most exciting part of Venice. You get a real feel of this amazing city just from looking out of the hotel room windows because you are surrounded by the canals and the ubiquitous gondola trade immeadiately to the side and front of the hotel. We stayed in Venice for a short break of 4 nights. The rooms were luxurios and plush but it is very pricey. We paid extra for a room with a panoramic view, but this turned out to be facing the narrow canal to the side of the hotel and not the grand canal I was expecting. Our room had a balcony but a very narrow one and certainly not large enough to place a chair on. The rooms were also overlooked by the hotel opposite, but this would appear to be the case in Veniceâ€¦
