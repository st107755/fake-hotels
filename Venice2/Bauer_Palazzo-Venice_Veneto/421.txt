We had a wonderful experience at Bauer Palazzo. A bit aged, but presumably you've selected a historic hotel in a location that's hard to beat and incredibly convenient for a reason. Special mention to the concierge team and put your trust in them. Wholeheartedly. They know absolutely everything and always with a smile. Breakfast was sumptuous with a view. If I were to be critical, then it's the internet. Not the best, but it works.  We didn't manage to dine at the restaurant, but spent the evenings on the terrace at the bar upstairs with Bellini and Aperol Spritz in hand taking in the view.   All in all, hugely enjoyable three days.
