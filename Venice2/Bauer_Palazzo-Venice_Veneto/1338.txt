We staid at the Bauer Palazzo over the New Year. It is actually two h√¥tels in one. The Palazzo on the Canal side and the Bauer on the Camp San Moise. The Palazzo is supposed to be a 18th century building but only the facade is. The hotel was supposedly refitted in 1999. It does not show. It feels like a 1950s hotel with long dreary corridors and no soul. During our stay only one bar was open. The gastronomy restaurant is ecellent and we had a gread dinner one the 31st. All in all not what you would expect from a venetian palace
