A tour I was on wrapped up in Venice and our last stay was at the Hotel Bauer for two nights.  It was a lovely hotel very close to St. Mark's Cathedral and Piazza and many many boutiques as well.  The service staff was excellent as well as the desk staff and our stay was most comfortable.  The breakfast is probably one of the most generous of any of our hotels along the way.  It was very good, very opulent, and very filling.  No lunch required after that breakfast!  I'd stay there again if I were in Venice.
