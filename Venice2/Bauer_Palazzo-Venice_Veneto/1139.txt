We were due to stay at their sister hotel and were switched to staying here as winter renovations had not been completed. Our booking and room was honoured and we had a lovely spacious room with a balcony from where we could watch the Gondolas.  All the staff were so welcoming, friendly while never intrusive. We chose to eat our evening meals at the hotel as we has exhausted ourselves walking the whole of the day.  Wonderful selection, excellently cooked with some great wines too. The chef was kind enough to prepare an off menu dessert for my wife - fantastic 'Zabagllioni' made her meal special. The price to stay reflects the quality, comfort, service and the brilliant location. We cannot return soon enough!!
