The hotel is located in a prime location in Venice with old fashioned charm and style. Perfect service, beautiful rooms . . . Comfortable classy ambience. Happened to be staying when the Mardi Gras was on with lots of people parading around in stunning costumes and masks. Everyone should visit Venice at the beginning of February
