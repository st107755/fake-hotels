I must say that the rooms of the hotel are excellent. The service at the hotel is awful. I dont usually complain about service, because overall you are paying for the room.  But the service is appalling. It's as if they are going out of their way to be unhelpful and rude. James with gray hair at the front desk is especially rude and unhelpful. When you pay top dollar (over 500 euro a night) you expect at a minimum decent service.   Just know ahead before booking that the staff is extremely unhelpful
