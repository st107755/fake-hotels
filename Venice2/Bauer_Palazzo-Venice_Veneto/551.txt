Everything was wonderful about the Bauer Hotel!  It is 5-star and it lives up to the stars. The bedroom was huge and lavish; the bathroom was sumptuous. The breakfast buffet went on and on (including an array of food for gluten-free guests). Thanks to the staff, we were booked on a water taxi (which pulls up to the side door of the hotel) to Zattere for the ferry back to Terminal Fusina to pick up our car.  Great service!
