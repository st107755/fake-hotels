This hotel's location is the very best on the Grand Canal.Love this place. Best yet, we stayed in a smaller inexpensive room off the main building. Still not shabby with silk wallpaper, a tiny terrace, full marble bath and shower + all the vibrant and lux amenities of the breakfast room and lobby, terrace on the canal,etc.. The pictures do not do it justice. There is even a gondola stop for new arrivals with luggage. Wish I had known that, for the trek of a few block from the water taxi stop with my luggage was not much fun.
