We stayed here on the 5th February for 2 nights. The hotel is in a great location, right on the grand canal and close to St Marks square. The staff are very helpful and the concierge spent a good deal of time showing us highlights of Venice on the map. The rooms that we had (2 couples) were outstanding...large, airy and decorated in that gorgeous Venetian style. Probably the nicest room we had during our 3 week European adventure. Having said all that, the main areas of the hotel felt soulless , the lobby is large and did not have any ambience. The bar was the only one on our trip that was not warm and welcoming.The breakfast was in a small room on the roof of the hotel, great views of Venice, not so great breakfast, quite ordinary for a 5 star joint. Worth staying at but doesâ€¦
