We stayed at the Bauer for 7 days in October and were very happy there.  On other trips to Venice I'd stayed in more elegant hotels as well as less expensive hotels, but the Bauer is my new favorite because I felt I was in the center of the city with an easy walk almost anywhere. We knew the rooms run small so requested an upgrade to a suite. Our corner suite on the second floor overlooked the elegant shops and smaller canal and bridge, with floor to ceiling windows and doors flooding the rooms with light, and beautiful heavy draperies for blocking out the light in the early morning. (see photos) The photo ops from the balconies were great and I loved hearing the church bells ring and gondoliers sing! The breakfast buffet was just right.  That said, I will admit I was on a tourâ€¦
