Great location for walking the city, visiting Doges Palace or that moseven just taking a gondola ride- literally steps from the lobby. Right on the Grand Canal, have breakfast with excellent views! Only a very short walk to Doges Palace. Room was just perfect and inviting, very comfortable beds. Staff very friendly. I loved that we had a real key! It seems that most hotels now have electronic keys. Highly recommend....
