Though the hotel is well located it is very expensive and the size of the rooms are ridiculous  I visited many other hotels in Venice during my stay and I regret I paid for a 5 stars hotels while many other 4 stars hotels, half-price, had more charming and spacy rooms.  Be carreful : the managers will promise you a view - it does not mean a view on the canal but a view on the wall of the opposite hotel at a 5 meters distance ... but bending from your window down the building you could see a little canal : THE view  My advice : avoid this hotel
