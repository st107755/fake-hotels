Friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast complimentary. Near San Marco square and shopping. Gondola rides nearby. Good out bar patio   The patio and outdoor dining area are on the Grand Canal.   Like all hotels, drinks are pricey.  Be sure to have a spritz. With aperol. Not Campari  15 euros. Ouch.
