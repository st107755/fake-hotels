This hotel is tired and needs to undergo a refurb it is not what i would expect from a hotel and certainly doesnâ€™t come across as a five star place.    Discoloured carpets  Chipped furniture Even bath is chipped  Prices in the bar are high.  The location is great.  Breakfast is ok but the terrace magnificent.
