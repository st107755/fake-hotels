Elegant 1930's hotel that keeps the atmosphere and the charm of a grand hotel. Rooms basic and refined at the same time, beautiful old marble bathroom and very comfortable beds. Breakfast in the old part of the hotel was the highlight of our stay. The breakfast room with fantastic views of the canal grande is simply magic!
