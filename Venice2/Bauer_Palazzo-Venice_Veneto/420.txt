Stayed one night in two deluxe suites prior to a cruise. Hotel is not cheap (as one would expect in a five star property in the center of Venice during high season) but good value for money. Beautiful, spacious rooms exactly as advertised and booked via Agoda. Fantastic location in the heart of Venice. Excellent, friendly service throughout, late checkout request accommodated despite hotel being quite busy. Beautiful terrace for breakfast with an amazing view.
