We (me and my girlfriend) stayed at the Bauer from Dec/31 to Jan/4. The hotel was impressive and in the hear of San Marco. Here is my review:  Check in: Excellent - Fast and with a really nice staff. The hotel employee explained to us the hotel facilities and services.  Room: Really nice room and relatively big (especially for venice standards). The cleaning services were awesome and we could count with an in0bed breakfast without extra-charge. The bathroom was really clean and new, but it could be bigger. Since I'm really tall (+190 cm), the shower and the tub were not adequate to me.  Hotel: The hotel in beautiful and fulfilled with art objects. The bar was probably the best in the hotel - really close to the grand canal, with and incredible view and an amaizing wine menu. â€¦
