We stayed at the Bauer for our 25th Wedding Anniversary.  We booked a superior suite through Expedia which was very nice but the view was awful, especially for such an expensive room. Other than that we found the location excellent, the staff very helpful and the breakfast very good. The hotel, as the whole of Venice, (especially around San Marco square) is very, very expensive so be prepared to spend some cash!
