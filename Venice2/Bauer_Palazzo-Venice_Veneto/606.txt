Step off the vaporetto or your privately hired boat and step into the Bauer!  Five stars adorn each fluffy towel and if lucky your balcony overlooks San Marco Square and its bell tower.  Desk staff is most friendly, speaks several languages fluently.  They will even print boarding passes for your airlines! Just outside the front revolving doors is one canal filled with gondolas awaiting riders! Bridges are plentiful and all is well signed.  Walk everywhere and explore!
