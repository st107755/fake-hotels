The genuine venetian Horel experience, with the best location and an extremely dedicated staff and service, has an amazing rooftop and a great terrace for breakfast and lunch, overlooking grand canal.   Best Concierge setvice by super dedicated Signor Paolo and Fabio’s the water taxi driver.   Paolo made everthing possible for us during this years Film Festival.   A Must go to, will return every time.   Just avoid the gondolas right outside the hotel as there is where the Gondola Mafia will exploit you more and treat you the worse.  But that’s out of the hotel’s control.  Viva Bauer and Mr Paolo, Head Concierge I expect.  Thank you Paolo for everything   Couldn’t have been better, never have seen better.  As long as Paolo stays, we’ll always come back.
