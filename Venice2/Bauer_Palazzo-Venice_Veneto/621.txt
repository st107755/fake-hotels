When you enter the lobby and the your room, you can't help but think WOW. The location was fantastic as you were within a 15 minute walk of almost everything. The hotel  staff was most helpful and polite. The breakfast, on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, offered all you could desire to start your day. We met up with another couple on the final afternoon of our 3 night stay. We would be together for the next 10 days through northern Italy and the Swiss Alps.
