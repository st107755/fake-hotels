This Hotel is in a good location just around the corner from St Marks Square and even closer to the Vaporetto stop. Which is great but if you want good restuarants and to be away from the crowds, i wouldn't suggest staying here.   The hotel we thought was maybe 4* at best. The rooms are very average with none of the nice touches you would like from a 5* hotel (free botteled water and maybe some tea/coffee making facils?) We were given a Deluxe room to begin with and it was nice, very big but with not enough furniture in, so felt a little empty. The room though had a no smoking sign but had definitely been a smoking room so we asked to move and they did, which was great. The new room was a lot cosier which was good for us but maybe some would have complained that it was notâ€¦
