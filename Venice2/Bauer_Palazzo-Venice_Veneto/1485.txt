This hotel has one of the finest locations in Venice with a lovely bar and restaurant terrace right by the Grand Canal. The foyer entrance opens out onto quality shops and is just 2 minutes walk from St Marks  Square. Our suite was in its day of the highest quality but really needed refurbishment. Rooms lower down might be a little dark and lower rooms at the side have noise from the queue of gondolas waiting to offload. Would not choose to stay in a room below 4th floor unless at rear facing the Grand Canal.  The staff spoke perfect English, were attentive and also very helpful. The inclusive breakfast was first class. The bar menu was reasonably priced. Room service seemed expensive.
