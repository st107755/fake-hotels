Stayed for three nights as part of our golden wedding celebration.The hotel was in an ideal central position two minutes walk from St Marks Square The hotel itself was perfect they looked after us like Royalty always going the extra mile.Meals on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal were a real joy with service to die for..The extras they provided free because of our anniversary were both generous and unexpected.If you are looking for areal treat with someone you love you coudnt do better.Thankyou so much for a wonderful time.Ken and Jackie Harburn
