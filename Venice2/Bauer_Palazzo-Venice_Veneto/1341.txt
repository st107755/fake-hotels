Our last stop in Italy for New Year's eve. Decided it was worth the EUR65 for a water taxi from the train station. We were upgraded to a suite for our 2 night stay, 6th floor with views over the Grand Canal. Perfect location, near to St Marks Square. Staff were very helpful & nothing was too much trouble. Great breakfast on 7th floor, with awesome views - no better way to end our trip. We do hope to return one day!
