We were disappointed that we could not get a room at the londra hotel as friends said its the best in Venice   Someone must of looked after us from heaven as img img the Bauer palazzo was the best hotel  the rooms were so luxurious and the location was was vip and exclusive. We would definitely stay there any time we are in Venice
