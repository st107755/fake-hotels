My experience in the hotel was very bad! The hotel is very old with very old furniture. Even the bathroom was not up to a 5 star hotel standards!   I was very disappointed in the hotel.   The elevator is very small! if 4 people went in, they will be squeezed..   After this experience , I will make sure to read all the reviews on the hotels I'm staying in.  The location of the hotel is excellent but wasn't worth it though
