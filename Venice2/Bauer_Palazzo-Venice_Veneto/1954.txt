Just returned from a long weekend at Il Palazzo - which was absolutely fabulous. Our room was gorgeous, Roberto the concierge was very helpful without being overwelming. Breakfast on the roof was everything it should be for the the price to stay at Il P. and reserving the jacuzzi with a bottle of Pro Secco and a dish of strawberries was simply one of the most romantic experiences in the world. Its not cheap but its worth every euro!
