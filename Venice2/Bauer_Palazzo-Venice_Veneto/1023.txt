My family and I spent 5 days at the Bauer Hotel and loved it.  We had a magnificent suite which was spacious and very comfortable.  The location of the Bauer is excellent.  The breakfast buffet had lots to offer and was very good.  We loved eating breakfast looking out over the bustling Grand Canal.  The staff was always happy to help and very friendly.  Coffee and drinks of a long day of touring was also great on the beautiful back terrace.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to treat themselves to something special.
