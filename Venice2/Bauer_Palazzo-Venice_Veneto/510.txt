While this hotel is listed as 5 star and was in a great location, it was a great disappointment.  We reserved a higher priced room with a viiew. We were shown two different rooms and told that these were all that were available.  One was on the side canal and very noisy (the gondola drivers shouting at each other along with noisy tourists.  The second had a view of the interior air space.  Hotel needs a remodel!  Very dated and not in a quaint way.  Fitness/Spa is a boat ride away - not convenient.
