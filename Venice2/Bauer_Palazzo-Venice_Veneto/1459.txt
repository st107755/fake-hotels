The Bauer is a wonderful place to stay in Venice. Luxury and location all rolled up into one. Breakfast served on paio overlooking the Grand Canal where you can watch the gondolas go by. I would recommend this property highly and will stay here again, should I return to Venice. The room and bed was very comfortable, not up to five star US standards but very nice and very clean.
