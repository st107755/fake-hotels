For our first trip to Italy we decided to pay a little extra and do it right.  Our first stop was the Il Palazzo, it was amazing.  We booked a room with a view of the Grand Canal and a terrace and it was well worth it.  The rooms were impecable, with hardwood floors and huge marble bathrooms.  The service was perfect.  The staff was so wonderful and courteous, and they each called us by name (even the bellman.)  Each morning as we came down from our room, the concierge would ask how we like the restauraunt he suggested the night before and what our plans were for sightseeing that day.  He remembered where he sent us sightseeing the day before and suggested new places each day.  The location is great, only a few yards from San Marco square.  The only thing we were disappointed inâ€¦
