We stayed at the Bauer Hotel before Christmas.  It was fantastic.  The location is excellent.  Check-in was efficient and friendly. Our suite overlooked the main canal, and was very spacious.  The jacuzzi was relaxing and warmed you up after a day outside in the cold, especially during this time of the year.  The champagne on arrival was a nice touch.  The concierge provided excellent suggestions for dinner locations, and tours in and around Venice.  The breakfast setting is lovely.  Overall, a very enjoyable stay.
