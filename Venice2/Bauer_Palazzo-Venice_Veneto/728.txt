The Bauer hotel is fantastic, it's in a superb location just a few minute's walk from st marks square. The hotel has a real sense of luxury, stayed here a couple of years ago and we were lucky enough to have a canal view, which we didn't have on this occasion. The bar on the grand canal offers superb views, and is a welcome respite from the bustle of the city.
