Last April we spent a couple of days with friends in Venice. The hotel arranged our welcome at the airport and the boat ride to the hotel was very nice. Bauer Il Palazzo is a classic hotel, we got very nice rooms, and staff was very helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient with the grande Canal in front of the hotel and the fancy shops (Prada, Chanel etc) just behind, and off course only a 100 meters of the San Marco Square. Best of our stay was the concierge who was very helpful in making our daily planning. Breakfast is at the rooftop, nice place, but selection could be little bigger. Lunch & Dinner at the terrace were very nice. The only thing we missed was a swimming pool, but after all it was a romantic city trip.
