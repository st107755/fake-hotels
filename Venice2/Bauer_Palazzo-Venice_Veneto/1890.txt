This romantic, small hotel is in an excellent position 2 minutes from St Mark's Square and offers olde worlde charm with all mod cons.    Despite a great concierge and chambermaid room clean service, however, it doesn't quite manage to offer the highest levels of food or service which you'd expect at this price and a word of advice - make sure your booking is 100% clear about the room you'll be getting or you'll have to try to sort things out when you get there.    In its favour is a personal approach to its guests, who front desk staff soon get to know by sight and name.  But every extra comes at a price and although everything is done with charm and courtesy, the whole thing doesn't quite 'snap' as you'd expect.
