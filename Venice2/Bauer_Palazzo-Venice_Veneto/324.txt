It was important for us to choose a hotel that was conveniently located near San Marco because we were only spending 2 nights in Venice.  Everything went better than expected..for starters, they provided us with a complimentary upgrade to a suite overlooking the Grand Canal!  The bed was very comfortable, the room spacious and the bathroom was very large (tub and separate shower).  We utilized the concierge on a number of occasions to coordinate dinner reservations (outside of the hotel), a gondola excursion for 6 people (complete with champagne) and a departing water taxi to the train station.  The bar service and the breakfast service were exceptional - as was the hostess at the 7th-floor lounge!  We would not hesitate to stay here again.
