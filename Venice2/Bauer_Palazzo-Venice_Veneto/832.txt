We had the (in)opportunity to arrive in Venice with all of George and Amal Clooney's celebrity wedding guests in September 2014. It was a zoo.  Once we arrived at the Bauer, we were in heaven.  The outdoor terrace was a fabulous place to have a drink and watch the paparazzi swarm the celebrities down the canal--if nothing else, it provided amusement.  The hotel is 2 minutes from St. Marks square and other things.  The room was large and very tastefully done.  The service was good.
