We stayed 2 nights in a standard room. There is a nice lobby and the staff is helpful and professional. Our room was of good size and was clean, if a little dated. The bed was firm but comfortable. The pillows were thin and almost flat. Marble bath was nice and the toiletries were of very good quality. Our buffet breakfast was very good and coffee quality was good. Having breakfast on the Grand Canal is amazing. We had drinks one evening on the terrace. It was nice but 17 Euros for a tiny 4 sip martini seemed a bit steep. The real attraction here is the location and that is quite impressive. We had a wonderful time.
