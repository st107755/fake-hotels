Anyone staying at the Bauer Il Palazzo is in for a real treat. This hotel is nothing less than wonderful. It feels like pure luxury the moment you step foot inside. Not only is the hotel itself beautiful and the location fantastic but the staff fall over themselves to help you. Everything about this hotel is 5 star (which can't be said for all 5 star hotels). The concierge desk know anything and everything there is to know about Venice, even first thing in the morning at breakfast every member of staff greets you and we were asked multiple times if there was anything we needed. The staff should be exceptionally proud of themselves. The view from the terrace at the back of the hotel overlooking the Grand Canal is breath taking, a spot you never want to move from. We were luckyâ€¦
