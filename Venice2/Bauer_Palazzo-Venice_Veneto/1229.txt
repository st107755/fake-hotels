I stayed here with my boyfriend on his 21st birthday and it was absolutely perfect. The Bauer delivers luxury service, from their very polite and efficient staff, excellent breakfast, amazing concierge and turn-down service. The room are a little old and not as luxurious as they could be. The bed sheets were a little rough and not very soft and the bed was very squeaky and old. The bathroom was very classic Venetian style, dripped with gold finishing and topped with a Jacuzzi bath!

If you are looking for luxury in a 200 year old hotel the Bauer is a must. ***I LOVED theâ€¦
