Spent 4 nights here in September, having last been there in the 1960’s with my parents. It is a luxury hotel near San. Moise church so a few steps from the vaporetto stop at St Mark’s Square. (Vallaresso) it consists of a classic palazzo o the Grand Canal connected to a  vast concrete  rear addition built in the 1930’s, as part of the drive to improve facilities for tourists. The road across the lagoon was built at the same period.  The interior is impressive, full of marble. The rooms are large, ours having a walk-in closet. There are two restaurants, a bar, and a canal-side south facing terrace where refreshments can be had, also a roof terrace.  One restaurant is a starred place on the top floor. We did not dine there but in the ground floor one, which was hardly Spartan and had fine food and service. Lounging on the terrace with a glass of decent wine while admiring the Salute opposite was pleasant too.  Nothing not to like, in short.   Good choice for a central hotel with comfort, fine food and excellent service.…
