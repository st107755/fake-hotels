My family stayed at the Bauer Palazzo for a week during Carnivale 2019.  This is an old world hotel with classic decor.  Our room was a bit strange...accessed by a hidden stairwell in the lobby which lead to our 2 room, 2 bath suite.  The room was quite dark, furnishings were very dated, and the beds were not comfortable.  There was very little access to power in the room.  Bathroom and amenities were very nice.  The staff was very friendly (especially the concierge who helped us every night with dinner recommendations and reservations).  The included breakfast buffet was a disappointment, serving the exact same food each morning (none of which was creative or outstanding).  We had tired of it after 2 days...and stayed at the hotel for 7 nights.  The gym was small and crampedâ€¦
