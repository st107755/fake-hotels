Not much to add to all the other reviews as it's been pretty well covered.   Service: excellent as you would expect Food: very good Location: about as good as it gets for Venice Rooms:Very nice and beautifully done.  Perhaps showing a little wear but nothing significant.  Certainly the best room of any we had on the whole trip.  Very quiet. Views from the dining deck are perfect.  View from rooms will be limited unless you pay for the grand canal side.  Would I stay there again?  Certainly. I'm not sure there is a better place in Venice! Try to find a low rate on these rooms with the trip advisor site.
