Apart from the fact that i would absolutely reccommend the Bauer in everyway, the position of this hotel is amazing. We where next door to everything there is to see and do in Venice. Amazing canal view, next to San Marco's square, just a minute from transportation to all destinations in Venice. The hotel itself is a Gem and decorated in traditional venecian style with all modern amenities in excellent combination. The service is very good in a very serious and formal way but all large city hotels are like that. Beware of the water taxis as they are a rip off , 50euros for a 5minute trip from the train station to the hotel. try to use the water buses for your transportation needs as they are very efficiant and if you buy a 24hour ticket for unlimited rides it is a bargain!!
