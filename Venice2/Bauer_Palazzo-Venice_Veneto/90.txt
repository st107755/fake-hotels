I don’t think this hotel quiet makes a 5*.  Pros: It is in a great location to San Marco Square right  on the canal.  Lovely to have breakfast on terrace overlooking the grand canal   Cons: No tea of coffee making facilities in the room. Drinks in the bar downstairs considerably cheaper than in the roof top bar. I guess you are paying for the view! Room was a little rough round the edges. Paint on the doors and wardrobes was a little worse for wear.   Breakfast was the same every day no variations.   We have stayed in 5* hotels in Dubai, maybe I shouldn’t compare to them.
