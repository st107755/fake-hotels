Il Palazzo is in the perfect location in the San Marco area of Venice. Close to La Fenice (opera house) Harry's Bar and of course St Marks sq. Its bar and restaurant  look directly on to the Grand Canal. If you can afford the upgrade to a room with a view it is well worth it . Free shuttle accross to its amazing spa on the other side of the lagoon. Bed was very comfortable and all the staff very helpful. Absolutely the best area to stay for the sights and ambience making everything a maximum of around 20 minutes on foot away. All the tops shops are on its doorstep
