Totally worth the price. Everything's excellent. Breakfast next to Grand Canal is the best thing. We stayed at the Bauer Casanova, which are one of the Bauer's accomodations nearby. Breakfast is on the terrace of the Bauer Central, many options and excellent service from waiters. Food is fresh, tasty, but having dinner at the Bauer is not affordable to everyone. Attention at reception is excellent, very respectful and willing to help and give advice.
