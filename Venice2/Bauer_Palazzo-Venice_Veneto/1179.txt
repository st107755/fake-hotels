Absolutely stunning 360 panoramic view from the terrace at breakfast, at least two floors higher up than neighbouring buildings.  Literally next to Piazza San Marco, making it super easy to find your way back from anywhere within the delightful Labyrinth that is Venice.  Around 12 mins walk to the famous Rialto bridge and Rialto market area, which has some excellent bars and restaurants.  Would highly recommend Osteria Bancogiro (as was recommended to us by the concierge and friends from home), offering a cosy atmospheric restaurant upstairs or seating outside facing the Grand Canal. You can also grab a Spritz from the ground floor bar for only 2.50 and join the sea of locals and tourists usually found standing outside!  Make sure not to leave the hotel without a map scribbledâ€¦
