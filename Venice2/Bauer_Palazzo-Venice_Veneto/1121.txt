This has just about got to be THE best place to stay in Venice. We will certainly book the Bauer again when we re-visit Venice.  From the arrival on a private water taxi that takes you literally to the door of the hotel (so much better than lugging suitcases around the narrow streets to some out of the way hotel) to the bright concierge staff, especially Marco who was brilliant.  The breakfast was good with a sizeable spread.  The rooms were excellent, certainly big enough with the added bonus of an evening 'turn down' which was nice.  Overall an excellent hotel and one that we will without a doubt re-visit. If you are thinking of staying in Venice stay at the Bauer!!
