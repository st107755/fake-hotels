I stayed at the Hotel Bauer  for 2 nights with my 2 teenage daughters (12 & 15).  The staff at the Bauer went out of their way to help me my husband could not join me on this part of my Italy trip, as he had a delay in getting his visa. We had booked 2 rooms at the main hotel, but as I was alone with my children I only needed one.  The staff very kindly put me in a suite at the Bauer Casa Nova right next door and charged me the same rate without any fuss or penalty.  The Hotel is gorgeous right next to a main gondola stop and right in the center of the prime shopping.  San Marco Square is also just a few minutes walk.  I was considering a hotel off the main Island but I'm glad I did not as going back and forth on the ferry is tiring and little confusing when you have so littleâ€¦
