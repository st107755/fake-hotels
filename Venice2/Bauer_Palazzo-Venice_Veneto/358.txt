After several trips to Venice and experiencing a variety of top hotels, our agent suggested the Bauer. Location great, room large and beautiful but I have never left a hotel without tipping the housekeeping staff-this is a first!  My none smoking room had cigarettes behind a chest of drawers that they had to move and last nite they left 1/2 old glass of water on my bed stand and did not replace clean glasses in one bath. Sorry no tip from me!
