We enjoyed Breakfast and afternoon Tea time every day. The view by sitting at the Terrace Restaurant was magnificent and so relaxing. The hotel location is at center of Venice and surrounded by brandname shops. Surprisingly, we booked 3 rooms and all 3 rooms were different designs & decorations . Rooms are beautiful classic and spacious. Highly Recommend.
