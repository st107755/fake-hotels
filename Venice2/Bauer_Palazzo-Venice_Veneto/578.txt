Very well located by the Grand Canal.  Enjoyed view while having breakfast in the terrace.  Confusing though.  We booked at the Bauer Palazzo, with email confirmation, only to find out we were at the Bauer Hotel.  No matter, since we shared the same breakfast area with the magnificent view of the Grand Canal.  I believe we also shared the same reception area.  Service was very good, especially when I made one concierge snap out of his cranky, unsmiling demeanour.  Thereafter, service was impeccable until we boarded our water taxi for the airport.  Overall, a good Venetian experience at the Bauer (Palazzo and/or Hotel!)
