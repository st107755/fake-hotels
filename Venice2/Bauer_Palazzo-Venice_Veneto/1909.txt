We just took a trip to italy and we visited multiple destinations.  The best hotel we stayed at Italy was indeed Bauer Hotel.  We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary and they gave us a complimentary upgraded room and champagne as well.  The hotel had all the amenities you needed.  The location was superb and it was close to everything.
