The location of this hotel is the best!The rooms are not very big, but are very comfotable. The breakfast is unique- on the terrace with Grand channel view. Sunny morning and the glass of champagne on the terrace -it is worth going to Bauer hotel! Ideal place for the romantic trip for a couple of days!
