The Bauer is right on the grand canal.  Gorgeous hotel with a fabulous concierge who got us two excellent reservations.  Our corner suite looked over a side canal and the plaza in front of St. Moise church - it was a fabulous room, quite, with good a/c and a great bathroom.  Our daughters' were next door in a smaller but equally nice room.  Walking distance to St Marks and many other sites and easy access to the water taxis.  The concierge was one of the best I've used - friendly and incredibly helpful.
