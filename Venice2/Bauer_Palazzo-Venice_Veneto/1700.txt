We stayed for 3 nights and loved every minute. Breakfast on the 7th floor terrace is a treat. Rooms were spacious (junior Suite) and beds were great. Clean and comfortable - makes you want to stay in your room a bit longer.  Very friendly and helpful Service. Excellent location for every Kind of activity in Venice.  Looking forward to our Next stay hopefully soon.
