Location superb, literally 1-2mins from St Marc's. Excellent stop for catching a gondola. Big elegant rooms-bit dated- and fantastic customer service. The staff were brilliant. disappointed no tea coffee facilities in the room esp for a 5* ?? No ironing board or iron in room, due to health and safety... Come on.. I use one at home?? I was appalled that a hotel of this stature wanted to charge for me wanting an omlette at breakfast!? Despite breakfast being included in my room rate. Breakfast in my opinion was disappointing. The hotel is very overpriced, I thought â‚¬8 for a coke was very extortionate. The location is a big big plus. Great for first time in Venice.
