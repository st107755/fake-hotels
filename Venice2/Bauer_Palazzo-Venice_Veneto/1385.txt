This was my second visit to the Bauer Il Pallazo, and interestingly enough, I had basically the same room, only 2 floors up.  The one thing that I absolutely love love love is their breakfast buffet service on the rooftop.  It is delicious and has the most awesome view of the Grand Canal.  The service there is a hundred times better than the service anywhere else in the hotel.  On my first visit, I thought that maybe it was just the Venetian attitude that was borderline rude, but now that I have been to Venice twice, I realize that it is really the Bauer that has generally a rude front desk staff and the Canal-front restaurant has an extremely rude staff as well.  The location is breathtaking, but if you enjoy being treated like a second-class citizen, don't bother...
