Beautiful hotel very well located. Rooms are very well appointed.  Staff is not very friendly for the most part. Shockingly the concierge had no information on group tours even though there is a tourist office with numerous offerings a few blocks away. Restaurant service was slow although food was good..  For a luxury hotel could do better.  Oliver Koppell
