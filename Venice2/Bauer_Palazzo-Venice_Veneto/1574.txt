This is a fantastic establishment in Venice, right in the middle of town, facing the grand canal and a 2 min walk to the Piazza San Marco.  Lucky this was on business and paid for my the company as a single room night costs over Eur400!!  You get what you expect- nice rooms, good service, great location. All important for a short stay in Venice.
