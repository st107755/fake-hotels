The view for cocktails is fabulous. And that's the only thing that's good about this hotel. Five star no way, The staff and service is terrible. When you check in if you're not staying at a certain part of the hotel even in the pouring rain you have to walk all the way around and they won't let you in the back entrance. There's no coffee or tea in your room you have to walk almost a block in the morning to get it. The room that we're staying in is dark and dingy. I highly recommend no one staying at this hotel. Perhaps try a two or three star hotel instead I'm sure the service and the rooms will be better. Sad to say I have one more night here and I wish we could stay at a different hotel.
