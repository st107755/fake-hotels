This is now our 6th time in Venice as it is still our favourite city in Italy. On three occasions we have stayed at a Bauer Hotel, two are close or attached the third is on an island across the Grand Canal. The more upmarket and expensive is the Bauer Il Palazzo which faces the Grand Canal and is in a much older building. We chose to stay in the larger but less expensive, more modern Bauer, although all are five star rated. The Bauer is close to San Marco as is the grander Bauer Il Palazzo and the location is hard to beat for centrality to shop, sights and restaurants. The breakfast area at the hotel has one of the best terrace views you will find with an excellent buffet selection and outstanding service. The rooms are varied in style and price as you would expect with aroundâ€¦
