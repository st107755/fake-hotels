We arrived by water taxi from the airport which was an amazing way to arrive at this lovely 5 star hotel.  Our suite with view to the side of the hotel overlooking the canal side entrance was large and comfortable.  We would have liked to have had tea/coffee facilities but it wasnâ€™t a major issue.  Staff were all really helpful and attended to all our requests.  Very good breakfast, all tastes catered for.  Location is excellent, less than 5 min walk to St Marks Square.  Thoroughly enjoyed our first stay in Venice.
