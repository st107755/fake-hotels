we spend three fantastic day in venice. our stay in the Hotel bauer was very good if not excellent. Service during breakfast could be improved, more Attention by the waitress for orders but the rest was excellent, clean rooms, Bagage and roomservice perfect, and the Hotel ist perfect located 3 minutes form Piazza sanmarco. its in the center, so you reach the most imporant "must sees" in a few minutes.
