The views from our spacious room were lovely - canals, churches, shops.  The breakfast was delicious with seating outside to enjoy the Grand Canal.  This is a  centrally located hotel that offers guests elegance and comfort. We loved taking the water taxi from the airport and setting into the charming lobby of the hotel.  It offers everything a guest could need.
