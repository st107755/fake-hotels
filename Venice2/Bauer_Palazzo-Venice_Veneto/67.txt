We were a family of 5 with kids 15, 13 & 11. This hotel is everything you are looking for in a first class hotel. The location is perfect, walking distance to Piazza San Marco. We had 2 connecting rooms which were HUGE, very clean and classic looking.  As with anything else, what really makes a place shine is the staff and this staff was awesome. From the person managing the water taxis to the bartender to the concierge, they were one better than the next.  Venice can be tricky with hotels when it comes to quality so you have nothing to fear with this place!
