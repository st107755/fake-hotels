Great breakfast with exceptional view however having stayed in many 5 star hotels, I find it really disappointing that you have to pay 25 Euro's to use the gym, and if you want to use the outside terrace with whirlpool,which would have been lovely for an hour of chill out with my book... it's 45 euros total! In addition to this, no iron provided for guests but you can use the pressing service for around 15 euros per item! Hairdryer ironing it is then! I feel this is really cheeky but typical of everything in Venice I'm learning,  where tourists really are taken for a ride. What is a cover charge bye the way?!!
