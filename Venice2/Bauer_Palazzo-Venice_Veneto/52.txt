Amazing facilities, friendly staff, boutique decor and even a complimentary pigeon stick! Our rooms were comfortable, clean and nicely furnished and the view from the main cafe out onto the lagoon was absolutely stunning. Breakfast was a bit hit and miss (by bacon they really mean Parma ham, as it turns out) and there was a brief misunderstanding with the bill, but these were very minor blips in an otherwise enjoyable stay at what is surely a top class establishment. Would definitely come again.
