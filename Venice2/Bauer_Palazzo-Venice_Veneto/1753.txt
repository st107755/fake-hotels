Arrived by water taxi and greated by very friendly staff.  Luggage immediately taken to our room.  We were not sure what to expect with the room as we had done a deal and thought we might be put in an annex somewhere!  No need to worry the room was spacious, light and very comfortable.  The bathroom was superb.  Breakfast was excellent and all the better as  this was negotiated in the price.  However..............................be aware of the extra cost of drinks and snacks.  The charges for these are outrages.  Everwhere you go in Venice you have to pay a fortune for drinks and meals and the Bauer is no exception.  This is our second visit to Venice and we love it.  Go with an open mind and count the cost, on your return home!
