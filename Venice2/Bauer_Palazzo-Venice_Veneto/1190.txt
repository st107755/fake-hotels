We are just returning from a fabulous four days in Venice.  The Bauer Palazzo is ideally located to San Marco, shopping, vaperetto stops, and more. The roof top included breakfast gets you off on your day with luxury & a great view of Venice.  The hotel staff was very helpful in every way.  This was our seond visit to the Bauer Palazzo & when we were shown to a room on the first floor close to the lobby elevator, I thought it was a good thing.  Generally, it was, but the room faced onto a walkway from the canal that gets lots of activity early in the morning & as a result it was less quiet than we would have liked.  This is a problem common to other luxury hotels we have stayed in in Venice because when goods or trash are moved to or from the canals there is unavoidable noise. â€¦
