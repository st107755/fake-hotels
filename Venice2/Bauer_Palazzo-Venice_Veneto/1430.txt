We planned our wedding reception from Australia with the staff at the Bauer's Il Palazzo. Everything surpassed our expectations and we were given a true VIP experience. Special thanks to Pietro, Daniele, Mauro 1+2 and all the staff for taking such good care of us and our guests. You all really went the extra mile for us and we'll never forget your kindness and hospitality on our special day.  We hope to see you again one day!  Elisa and James
