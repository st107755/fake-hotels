I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Staff, location and room was all extraordinary!   While the Venice streets were busy with foot traffic, the hotel was an oasis.  I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone that wants excellent service.  Be sure to utilize the rooftop patio for wonderful views of the canal.
