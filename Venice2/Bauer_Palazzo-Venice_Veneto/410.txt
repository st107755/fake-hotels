Positive : Charming terrace with great view and fortunately a friendly staff. Great location next to Piazza San Marco.   Negative : check in and service experience were very poor and rude which was quite a shame for this kind of hotel! Good to know : Sauna and steam room have to be booked 30 minutes before use because they are switched off and to use the Jaccuzzi you have to pay 150.- euros extra.... Breakfast was basic and the bed was old and noisy.   I would not recommend this place!
