I spent two days with my wife in this fantastic hotel located in a strategic position close to San Marco. Everything was excellent. the room, the service, and especially the bar and the restaurant with a delicous italian food. All the restaurant and bar area is managed by a guy named Giorgio, a really gentleman who will explain you any recipes secret and is able to suggest the right wines to enhance the taste of what you have decided to eat! I suggest this Hotel to all the couples who want to prove a longlife remembrance for Valentine's day!
