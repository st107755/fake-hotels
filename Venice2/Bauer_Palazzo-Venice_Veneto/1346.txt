The staff was the Best in all of Italy. The room was nice with a balcony that looked over the water on one side and the beautiful street with all the Christmas lights on the other side. The staff allways stopped to talk and ask if we needed anything and the champagne in the room for my wifes birthday was a real treat. The only thing about the room was, I don`t like it when they push two beds together for a couple. I allways get wedged int the crack.
