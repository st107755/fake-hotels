We really enjoyed being on the canal, and having a lovely view from our room.  The room was as I expected in a luxury hotel in Venice......the only thing I didn't care for was something they are very proud of.....linen sheets.  Yes, they were elegant, but I guess I've gotten too fond of high thread count sheets.    Concierge was very helpful and directed us to a local restaurant where we honestly had the best meal of our stay in Italy.  Wish I could recall the name, but it seemed to be one of the favorites when looking for someplace more casual and family oriented.    Staff was very helpful with all of our transfers, etc.  I was sorry we only stayed 2 nights.
