Location was wonderful. The room was comfortable and bathroom was a good size. Bed and pillows where both comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding and the outside seating was superb. Enjoyed being able to see all the boat traffic had a fantastic time enjoying breakfast and eating on the terrace. Food staff members where very nice and attentive to our needs.
