We stayed one night only - from ship for our flight the next day. Can be reached by water taxi only which in itself was a great experience in the luxurious taxi they contract with. Smooth welcome and check in. The room was a suite - we could not believe our eyes. Huge room with sitting room separate, two full bathrooms, huge closet for luggage and clothes, bedroom very spacious with queen bed. Decorated beautifully with antique furniture and heavy drapes. Fit for a King and Queen. Breakfast outside. Posh linen on tables. Buffet breakfast was very good. View cannot be beaten. 50 yards from St Marks square. Surrounded by lovely shops and boutiques. Professional staff. Very helpful and friendly. Recommend this hotel any day. It has Class!
