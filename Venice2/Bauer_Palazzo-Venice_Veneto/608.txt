The Bauer Palazzo is Ideally situated on the Grand Canal and within a few minutes walk of St Marks Square and all the major attractions of Venice. Our bedroom was very comfortable with a super size bathroom. Hotel itself is very grand with a great terrace on the Grand Canal where you take breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like most hotels of this standard it is expensive but then you are in a prime location in Venice. Great to sit on the terrace with a glass of wine and just watch life on the Grand Canal.
