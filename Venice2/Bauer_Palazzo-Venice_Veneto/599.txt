My wife and I were on our yearly October getaway.  First time to Venice and we chose the Bauer.  This is a wonderful property!  Very close to San Marco!  Room was very nice, staff was great, breakfast good.  The restaurant overlooks the Grand Canal!  The hotel is also on a side canal and you can pick up a gondola just out the front door.  The best part... we were there for my birthday and the hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne.  We had to shorten our stay due to Hurricane Matthew bearing down on our home in Charleston, SC.  Highly recommend this hotel!
