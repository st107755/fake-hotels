The Bauer is certainly reknowned and it should be. Five star service from the staff! We stayed here prior to boarding our cruise ship and could not have been more pleased. It is  a 3 minute walk to St Mark's and maybe 10 to the Rialto Bridge.   The rooms are adequate and very small compared to most hotels. But they are spotless. The bath tubs are very high so some people may need to consider that feature as it is difficult to get into and out of. Loved the provided slippers and robes.  Sitting on the patio looking out on the canal is unbeatable.
