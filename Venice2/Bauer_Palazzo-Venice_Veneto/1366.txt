I'm thinking Prada, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Ferragamo and all the other high-end stores immediately outside the doors of this 5 star hotel came to the same conclusion, 'Yep, this is the best location in Venice'.  We had one if the superior suites that overlooked both the grand canal and the canal that ran along side the hotel. Living room, walk in closets, bathroom and sheer space was such a treat. Top notch at every turn.  Did I mention the location?
