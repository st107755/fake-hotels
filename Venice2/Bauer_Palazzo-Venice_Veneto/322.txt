The only way to arrive here is by water taxi, it makes the experience. You are right I the heart of Venice and can walk the wee streets once in situ. All you would expect with a luxury hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. The terrace gives the most amazing perspective of Venice which is wonderful. In fact it's so great you don't want to leave the hotel.At times we felt we were the only people there. Beautiful hand blown glass in the room. Things to consider  -half floors could be confusing for some. Please don't feed the pidgeons and gulls they detract from the terrace!
