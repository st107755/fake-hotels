Prior to a cruise, Seabourn put us up at The Bauer Il Palazzo.  Wish we would have stayed longer - the room was breathtaking with ceiling frescos and Murano chandeliers.  We had a late breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal which transformed us immediately from the long trip to total relaxation.  Good food, good service, great room.  We will definitely go back!
