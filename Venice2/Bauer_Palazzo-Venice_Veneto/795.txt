We stayed here for 4 nights in April.  Check-in was poor.  Checked in with one girl, gave her our credit card,  etc and were told that the room wasn't ready.  Fine, we understand.  However when we returned the advised 20 minutes later, we had to through the whole process again with a different receptionist.   We told them that we had done all this about  30 minutes ago and we're just waiting on our room allocation,  but the staff still insisted.  Not the greatest first impression.  Anyway, room was beautiful and quiet.   A good sized room with sumptuous decor and a spa bath.  Thewindow shutters allowed for total black out and the bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was varied and ample.  I enjoyed being able to enjoy bucks fizz at breakfast ðŸ˜‰.  The view from the terrace overâ€¦
