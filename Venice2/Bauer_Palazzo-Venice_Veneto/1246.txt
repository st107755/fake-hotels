Literally Hundreds of meters from St. Marco. If you don't want to take a water taxi, the boat station is also literally meters away. The hotel is 5 stars and needles to say , it was 5 stars. The rooms are small,  but this is Venice. The breakfast on the terrace right on the water front was great. Good menu choices. One little irritation, one pays a bundle for the room, yet the wifi is chargeable.
