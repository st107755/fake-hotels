Great location, 5 minutes away from Piazza San Marcos.  Rooms were on the small side, bathroom was descent size and bed was comfortable.  We have a room with a view to the internal channel and we loved watching the gondoliers and boat passing by.  Staff was superb and concierges were extremely helpful.  The bar area was great, specially after a long walk in Venice.   We had breakfast included, and the terrace was a great place to enjoyed.  However the breakfast set up was chaotic and selection/quality was mediocre.  I am sure they can do a better job for the price you are paying in a luxury hotel like the Bauer.
