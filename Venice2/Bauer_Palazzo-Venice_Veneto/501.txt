We so very much enjoyed our stay at the Bauer. The hotel is perfectly located and the staff is lovely. Absolutely would recommend it and would want to stay there again for a next visit. The concierge had very good recommendations, both for food and things to visit. The breakfast is superb and the room was most excellent/ Loved it, all the way.
