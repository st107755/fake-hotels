We recently spent four nights at the Hotel Bauer and couldn't have been more satisfied with the entire facility. The quality of the finishes in our room were superb, with padded silk wall coverings, beatiful moldings, venetian plaster, superior soundproofing and a luxurious marble bathroom. The Hotel Bauer and the Il Palazzo share the same common areas, which are spacious and well appointed. We especially loved the dining terrace on the Grand Canal and the cocktail terrace on a side canal. To find this much open space so close to St. Mark's Square is a terrific extra. Each night, a guitarist would play until 11 PM while the gondolas would glide past. We will definitely stay here again!
