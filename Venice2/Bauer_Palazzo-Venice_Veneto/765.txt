Nice old hotel of 5 stars with amazing view! The breakfast is good with nice coffee but not with a big choice of food and they could make freshly squised juice. The stuff sometimes is not so polite and once the sicurity stuff didnt allow us to enter the hotel even if we told that we live there, it seems he doesnt understand even english language)
