Super nice Hotel in super location.  Stayed for three nights in older original hotel with Grand Canal view.  Beautiful, clean and everything you would expect from a 5 Star.  Room cleaning and turn down was flawless staff very nice.  7th Floor breakfast and evening bar was fabulous.  Highly recommend if staying in Venice.
