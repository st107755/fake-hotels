I am stayed at the Bauer Pallazzo room 620.  I checked in yesterday and are here till tomorrow.  My stay has been HORRIBLE.  I got my room same decor as 2010 when I stayed here last time and it had amazing service this why I returned. It started with the wifi it took 3 minutes to load each email.  So after 3 different people came to fix they finally gave me a portable router. I was very tired from my travels so got in bed 9pm.  About 930 house keeping walked in to do turn down service.  930 is to late.  So I laid eyes there trying to fall back asleep and then the BOOM BOOM started.  Music from the party on ur hotels patio.  Finally about 1140 I called asked for manager.  They gave me Roberto and he said sorry I can't tell them to turn it down.  I said so at 5 am if I blare musicâ€¦
