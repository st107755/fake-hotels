In our fourth visit to Venice, we have again stayed in the Bauer Palazzo Hotel and as before, it was an excellent experience in all aspects. In the last one, we chose a different hotel and regretted the decision.  Starting from the reservation process everything was done correctly, fast and in a very kind way. The check in (and check out) were done fast and courteously. The hotel facilities are beautiful; the room was very nice, with a nice bathroom, and a beautiful view of San Moise Square with the Gondolas port. The breakfast was quite good in a very nice area outside with a marvelous view of the Grand Channel and the internet worked well. In general, the services are excellent: housekeeping, concierge for reservations, etc all was done in a courteous and professional way.â€¦
