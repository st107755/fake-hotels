We stayed at the Bauer for one night prior to embarking on a cruise. Two things that appealed to us were its conveneient location to St.Marks Square and the fact that all rooms are non-smoking. Otherwise the rooms, facilities, and services are slightly above ordinary. It is quite expensive but they do offer special rates if you book well in advance.
