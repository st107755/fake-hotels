This was my husband and my final stop on a trip through Italy. Definitely saved the best for last. This is the place to splurge on your hotel. I highly recommend this hotel...worth every penny. The staff was friendly and helpful and not snobby or pretentious. They upgraded our room upon arrival at no charge. We had a junior suite with a view of a side canal and partial view of the grand canal...amazing! The breakfast is incredible...a huge variety and what a beautiful setting...eating on the roof-top, open-air lounge with 360 degree view of the city. They arranged a free tour (and transportation) to Murano for a glass-blowing demonstration. Cannot say enough great things about this place. We had no problems and would definitely stay here again!
