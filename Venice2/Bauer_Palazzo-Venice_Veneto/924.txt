Our first trip to Venice was all the more special because of this wonderful hotel.  Our suite was opulent and meticulously clean.  The little touches of slippers and robe were wonderful as was the nightly turndown service.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The location was absolutely the best as it was so close to St. Mark's Square.  We had so much fun just watching the gondolas go by from the beautiful sitting areas in the lobby.  Thank you Bauer for helping make our stay the trip of a lifetime.  We Will never stay anywhere else.
