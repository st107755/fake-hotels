Stayed here for 3 nights and it felt time traveled so fast. We took the water taxi from the train station straight to the hotel. From check in till check out, everything was so good!  We had a room with a canal view that comes with a balcony. The view, the room, the amenities in the room was just truly awesome! The size of the room was good. Breakfast was served daily on the 7th floor. Magnificient view! Great spread of fruits, bread, eggs, juices etc.   The opposite entrance of the hotel brings you straight into the shopping street of all the designers brand items like Prada, LV, Chanel, Ferragamo etc. A short walk brings you to Piazza San Marco and Royal Garden where most tours start. You can also take the Gondola right just next to the hotel entrance.  There is also a shuttleâ€¦
