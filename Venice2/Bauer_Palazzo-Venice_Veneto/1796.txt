Hotel Bauer was the perfect choice to a perfect trip. Very convenient to all attractions and in the center of everything. Yet it was also a very quiet hotel. I only wish our view could have been better but we didnt want to spend more for the view since we stayed little inside our room. It had lots of closet place and a very old world great charm. I would love to stay there again
