We stayed at The Il Palazzo in Venice in October of 2013.  I was somewhat suspicious after spending most of my trips to Venice in other five star hotels.  We arrived late at night after missing my original flight.  What a wonderful surprise.  Our room was crisp, clean and comfortable.  The location was spectacular.  The staff was extremely helpful.  The location of the facility offers privacy and access to San Marco.  The two young ladies who host the breakfast are real gems.  They go out of their way to make breakfast a wonderful experience.  They, along with the views at breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal made the Il Palazzo quite memorable.
