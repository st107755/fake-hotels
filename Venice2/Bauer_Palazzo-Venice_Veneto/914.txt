Such a gorgeous hotel just steps away from St Mark's Square.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!  The room was truly beautiful.  We were in Italy for roughly 2 weeks & stayed in comparable hotels- the bed at the Bauer Palazzo was the most comfortable bed we slept in the whole time. In addition, delicious breakfast every morning & incredibly helpful concierge & staff.  Highly recommend this hotel!!!
