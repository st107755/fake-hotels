Location is perfect.  There is no better location. This hotel is bit confusing.  Their is actually 2 hotels attached. The Bauer is newer and more modern.  The Il Palazzo is being renovated, but some of the rooms are very old and need some updating. The staff is very nice and knowledagable. The longer you stay the more it grows on you. Just be very specific about your room catagory and room type and confirm what the view is going to be. It is typical Venitian, but be sure to ask questions. The staff does try very hard to accomodate,
