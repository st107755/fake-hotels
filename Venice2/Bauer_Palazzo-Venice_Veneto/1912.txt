This is one of the finest hotels my wife and I have ever stayed in. It's located right on the Grand Canal, less than 1/2 a block from St. Marks square. It is a 5 star hotel in every sense! Room is very large, bathroom to match and in black and white marble. All the goodies such as robes, slippers, towel heaters, closets you could live in, etc.  The staff is extremely friendly. Re meals, we ate only breakfast every day (included in our package thru Club ABC) and what a feast!! It was buffet style and included everything that you could imagine and then some. This hotel is worth the price of the entire trip, DO NOT MISS IT!!
