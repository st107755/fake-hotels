Excellent location, the hotel is right next to a place where you can hire Gondolas and within walking distance of all prime shopping boutiques. Transfer from airport to hotel was smooth. It has a beautiful church right outside it. Feels very historic with an impressive reception (especially the Murano glass centrepiece).  Staff efficient and friendly. View, not much really, was overlooking a tailor shop and the elevators only hold four people at a time, but since I was not in the room much that was not an issue.   Loved waking up in the morning to the sounds of the city .Most of all enjoyed having breakfast -It was served on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal with very friendly waiting staff.  Will come back here again.
