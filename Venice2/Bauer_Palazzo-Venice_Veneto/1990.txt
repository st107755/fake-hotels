Returned from Il Palazzo spending 3 nights in such beautiful and spacious surroundings.  It has been along time since we were addressed by hotel staff by our name each time we asked for something.  We were upgraded to a beautiful balcony suite overlooking the grand canal.  I could have stayed on the balcony for hours watching the traffic, but we had business in Venice.  The food and drinks were superb as was the service.  Coffee was delivered to our suite within 3 minutes of requesting it. It was a great experience compared to the "other" five star hotel we had stayed in the past. We will never stay anywhere else in Venice when we return. .....Go, enjoy it!
