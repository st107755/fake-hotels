We normally tend to stay on Lido when visiting venice, but decided to go the whole hog this time. We were given a 5th floor room with balcony and side view of the grand canal, decor was luxurious but the bed could do with a new mattress and pillows poor, a/c noisy so a good nights sleep was not on the menu. Bathroom with spa bath and lots of marble was nice but gold fittings a bit worn and tired. Housekeeping was excellent as was breakfast a very good extensive buffet with hot options if required. Prices for mini bar are rediculous we had one 500ml still water on arrival and were charged an unbelievable 14euros which i should have queried but i did not check bill until at the airport. The Bar prices are very similar and a spritz will cost you 14.50 euros compared to 3 and 5â€¦
