I purposely selected this hotel for its ratings and location. It did not disappoint.  It is a two minute walk from St Marks square. It is situated right at the end of the grand canal. We went bed and breakfast. We stayed only 2 nights. We were placed in the annex which was across from the main hotel. I would recommend to select for a river view if you can afford it. The breakfast was excellent and service the same. There are loads to see around Venice and all within walking distance from the hotel. We dined out every night with so much selection. It was my wife's 50th Birthday surprise. I did notify the hotel in advance but sadly nothing special was put on. Disappointing from the hotels welcome pack.
