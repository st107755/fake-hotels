Gorgeous place right on the Grand Canal. Great restaurant De Pesis too. Great location. Short walk to everything. And if you are an architectural fan you will be in heaven. Lovely interiors! View from the Il Palazzo out to the Grand Canal is stunning. Staff was wonderful. The gold and red of Il Palazzo is so Venice. We loved our room.
