My wife and I travelled to Venice to celebrate her birthday. We stayed at the Bauer Hotel. We loved the position of the Hotel. It was close to all the most important sights (2 minutes walk). The breakfast deck is on the Grand Canal. Every morning we could see the cruise ships passing 200 meters from where we were siting to come into the docks. The food was great. We highly recommend the Hotel.
