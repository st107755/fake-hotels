Bauer Hotel is 3 min walking distance from San Marco, and 10 mins from Rialto Market, making it strategically placed to visit Venice from.  The highlight for us, was the breakfast and that you can catch a water taxi (from the door step of hotel) to airport. You can also take catch a Gondola from just outside the hotel.  :)
