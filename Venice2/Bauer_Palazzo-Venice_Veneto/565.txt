This is one very expensive hotel, the most expensive one of a group in Venice. We paid to stay in this hotel to have a view of Santa Maria della Salute and to paint it. We could have done what we did last year and sat on the terrace of the adjoining restaurant and had a coffee and painted. The price we paid gave us a very large room with a terrace from where you could see a side canal and some top of the range shops five floors below. If you want to have a view of the Grand Canal in this hotel, either be prepared to pay a lot, lot more or have a long breakfast in the superbly placed dining room or have a coffee on either  of the two terraces. We would not pay for any other meals and breakfast was included in the price.
