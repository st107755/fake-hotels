Spent 3 nights at the hotel. Wonderful location on the Grand Canale and smaller canals. Reception and concierge were extremely polite and helpful. The rooms were large with a great view. Hotel is located very close to St Marks square.  Buffet breakfast is included. Would definitely come back if returning to Venice
