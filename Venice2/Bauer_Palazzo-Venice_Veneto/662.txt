the location couldn't be better..next door to St Marco square...the hotel has a jetty and it is great taking a water taxi from the airport straight to the hotel!! the rooms are amazing..old world charm with all the modern comforts...superb service from check in to being shown to your room to the turn down service to the room service and the fact that towels are replaced at each service...and what a view at breakfast!!
