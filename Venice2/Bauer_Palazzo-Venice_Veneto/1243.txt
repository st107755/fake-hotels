My Wife and I stayed here for our 1st Wedding Anniversary, the staff, the hotel, the location and the food were perfect. One of the best places I have ever stayed.  Nothing was too much trouble, they have their own peer for boats and impeccable standards.  The breakfast terrace overlooking the Grand Canal took our breaths away.
