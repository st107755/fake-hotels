Must admit we thought we had gone to the wrong hotel as it looked so plush.   Its been a long time since I stayed at a hotel with a proper 24 hour concierge.   The bar is painfully expensive (10 Euros for a small beer).  The hotel is in a fantastic position really close to St Marks Square.  The staff were incredibly friendly and the room excellent and remarkably quiet.   I hope we can return again one day.
