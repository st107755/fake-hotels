The suites were great though it depends on the one you get as not all the rooms are the same. We were offered a small room at first although we specifically mentioned in the booking details that we were coming with a child who needed an extra bed however this issue was quickly resolved after we asked to be shifted to another. We got an excellent room, one which was very spacious with sofas and two bathrooms.The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly!
