This hotel is simply splendid.  I understand there may be variations in rooms as the structure itself was built many, many years ago, but we were blessed with a wonderful room overlooking the grand canal.  It was incredibly spacious with a very large sitting area, huge closet area, and grand bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable and the fixtures appropriately positioned.  We were in Venice 15 years ago and our hotel did not come close to this hotel.  New hotels are not being built in Venice and I can only imagine what real estate values are.  It is truly a blessing to be able to stay at a property like this.   I ate the breakfast buffet everyday we were there (compliments of our virtuoso travel agent) and really enjoyed the wide spread of food available and the seating rightâ€¦
