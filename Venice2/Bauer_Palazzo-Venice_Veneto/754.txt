We were originally booked in the Hotel Bauer, which was not good, and then the manager moved us to the Il Palladio and everything changed. Elena was amazing and the breakfast staff on the terrace was superb.  Our room was beautiful! We would definitely recommend staying here and if we are lucky enough to return to Venice, we will stay here again.
