I booked the Bauer Palazzo after having carried out some research on the locations of various hotel, the types of rooms and the ratings. We wanted something quite central of all of the sights and at least a 4 star rating, which is how we came to choosing the Bauer Palazzo.   The hotel was in the perfect location! 5 minutes walk from St Mark's Square, on the Grand Canal, within walking distance of the Rialto bridge, great restaurants and gelaterias, and Vaporetto stops.   The hotel itself was quite big, with a big lobby with seating and a number of check in staff and a concierge. We arrived at around 2:15pm,  earlier than the stated check in time, but thought we would see if our room was ready before we went out to explore. Luckily it was so we were taken to our room by the checkâ€¦
