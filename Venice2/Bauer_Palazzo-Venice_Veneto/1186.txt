Hotel IL Bauer is the perfect spot to relax after a trip around Tuscany. Rooftop breakfast has a panoramic view of the Grand Canal as well as perfect service. Our suite was well appointed and had beautiful decor, right down to the antique secretary with the chocolates and champagne waiting for us. Loved it, been 3 times and can't wait to go next year. Pricey but worth every euro.
