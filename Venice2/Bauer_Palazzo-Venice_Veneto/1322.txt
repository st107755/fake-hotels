Just back from a trip to Venice and stayed at the Bauer Il Palazzo.  The hotel was amazing.  On our arrival at the private landing we were made to feel like Royalty.  We were sat down during the checking in process and given information about the hotel and its services - no having to read leaflets here!!  We were escorted up to our room and it was huge and beautiful.  The woven wallpaper matched the bed headboard and the surround.  Our windows overlooked the Grand Canal and one of the hotel terraces.  Breakfast was on the seventh floor with incredible views (the highest place you can eat in Venice) and was very good.  The hotel restaurant was very good too; they were happy to prepare dishes not on their menu.  All in all a wonderful hotel and the best i have stayed in.
