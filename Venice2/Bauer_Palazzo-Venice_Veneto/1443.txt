I think this historical palace deserves the wow factor in venice,.. Yes the lobby is not big enough to relax but I liked the antique touches in the library..  We have stayed in a junior suite canal view, it was so spacious,charming,luxurious with stunning canal view through the surrounded large windows. I liked the gold plated touches in the bathroom with its huge jaccuzi ..  I didn't try the hotel's restaurant but I had the breakfast in the roof of the hotel , the buffet was kept in a narrow corner with limited passage area and I think there should be more food varieties in the buffet to meet the 5 stars hotel standards..  The staff of the hotel were very friendly and polite..  My overall experience in this hotel was great..
