This was our first trip to Italy for my wife's birthday.  We contacted the Hotel Manager before hand and following trip advisor reviews we requested a room facing the grand canal. We needed to really pay for a upgrade but were unable to do so as our budget was stretched. Upon arrival the Hotel Manager had arranged a suite for us as it was a special occasion which was a real treat. The room was superb, the bed to die for and the bathroom shower was awesome. The staff were friendly and helpful and our favourite part was the superb breakfast on the terrace facing the Grand Canal. The breakfast staff were accommodating and we drank our body weight in Cappuccinos (delicious). The Hotel was well placed to explore Venice on foot and we would both recommend this hotel withoutâ€¦
