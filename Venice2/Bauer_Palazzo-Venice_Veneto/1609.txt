We travel to Venice one or two times a year and always stay at a very special hotel known with it’s antique collection. This time, we could not find a room and decided to stay at Bauer Hotel. The location is excellent; right on the Grand Canal at a 5 min walking distance to San Marco square among the luxuary shops. If you travel by vaporetto from the airport and have luggage, this hotel is ideal since you don’t have to climb any bridges while walking to the hotel.Rooms are great with a seperate living room, good-size walk-in closet, good-size bathroom and a large bedroom. The bed is huge and very comfortable. Overall the hotel is very clean and the staff is really kind and friendly.  The stiriking feature is that ceilings are so high that you really feel comfortable.
