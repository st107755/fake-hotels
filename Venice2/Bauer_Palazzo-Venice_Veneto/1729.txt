The Bauer Hotel is beyond true hospitality. the location is a dream come true centered around EVERYTHING. The staff are true professionals beyond any guest's expectations. the housekeeping is outstanding and the front desk and conceirges go out of their way to back The Bauer your home away from home. #1, A+ is the rating The Bauer Hotel receives in my little black book. Make sure and book a promo with the FULL breakfast included because the buffet that awaits you can be breakfast,lunch & dinner....it is endless! I want to return every anniveresary.
