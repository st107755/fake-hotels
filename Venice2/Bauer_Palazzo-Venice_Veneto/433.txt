Venice is a very unique and interesting city. We only have 2 nights to stay in Venice so we decided to stay nearby San Marco Square.  The room is not big but it's good for two adults. If you have kids you need to book 2 room and request for a connecting rooms. Breakfast is great and you can sit outside to enjoy the grand canal view!
