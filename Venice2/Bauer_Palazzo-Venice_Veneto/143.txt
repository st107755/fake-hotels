When we travel we try to stay at hotels that are members of the Leading Hotels of the World (LHW) as we have rarely been disappointed with any of their hotels.  The Bauer Palazzo is one of the members of LHW and as we pay an annual fee to LHW, we are given benefits, such as continental breakfasts included and room upgrades if available.  Upon our arrival at the Bauer Palazzo, we were given a room upgrade and it was a beautiful room.  The room itself was very large with a very nice upgraded bathroom (double sinks), and it was very quiet.  The hotel is located within a very short walk to St. Mark's Square and we loved eating our breakfast outside overlooking the Grand Canal.  We would absolutely return to this hotel.
