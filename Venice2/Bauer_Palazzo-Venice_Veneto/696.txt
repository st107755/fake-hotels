From the moment we were dropped off by water taxi directly into the lobby to the time we left the staff were professional, attentive, helpful ... what more can I say. We checked in and were shown to the room booked by our travel agent.  Sadly it did not have the view we had anticipated (and specified) but this was not the fault of the hotel and they were quick to accommodate us on the 7th floor in a luxurious room with a terrace, sun loungers and a view of the Grand Canal.  There was an additional charge for all this extra enjoyment, but that was as expected.  Early check in/ late check out and great service from the Housekeeping staff.  Our stay was entirely satisfactory.
