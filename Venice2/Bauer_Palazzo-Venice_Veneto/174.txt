After a long flight to Italy, I was elated to arrive at the Bauer Palazzo with its many charms! The hotel has a private dock, which made it easy to get to directly from the airport. The room we were assigned was stunning- high ceilings, ornate details, huge bathroom (all marble and included a bidet) and the linens and towels were all in pristine shape. The roof-top breakfast (included) with stunning morning views of the canals was breathtaking, and I will definitely book again the next time I am in Italy!
