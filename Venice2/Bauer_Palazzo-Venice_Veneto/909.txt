We were not able to reserve the veranda equiped room overlooking the little square,so we opted for Grand Canal side,"settling" for a lavish suite with great views. GREAT rooms,lavish appointments.VERY comfortable for the semi-lengthy stay we so enjoyed.  The FOOD???? FANTASTIC!! The staff in that dept.,were just perfect.LUCIA,up top,for breakfast,was the epitome of loving care,kindness and attention to detail. The conceirge staff was just as attentive,just as effective,as we had several difficult requests,including a very early departure for Marco Polo.  Loved this stay atleast as much or more than the last one..   ONE teeny,tiny compliant by me----NO FOX NEWS CHANNEL.  Of,course,my dear wife would pay extra NOT to have it.   I also must say,that the LOCATION is simply the bestâ€¦
