Good hotel. Lots of marble and gold taps. No tea or coffee in rooms and have to pay extra for use of wifi costing Â£20 for 3 nights. Wi fi is slower than dial up. Better to use the wifi in the various eateries around Venice. The restaurant and views are good, but as always, lots of licking for the end of stay tips!
