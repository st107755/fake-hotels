We absolutely loved this hotel. Breakfast was eaten outside overlooking the Grand Canal. The buffet breakfast was one of the best I have had with many different choices for all nationalities.  In the evening we had the mot wonderful meal as we watched the water traffic go by. The food was amazing the the wait staff most attentive, We will remember that meal for a long time.  The room was large, even though it was just a standard. We couldn't work out why it was so dark in the morning and took us ages to realize that the exterior blinds had been lowered by the maid. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice.  The rooftop bar was very nice in the evening. I did not think the prices were outrageous as some have stated in their reviews. Would definitely stay there again.
