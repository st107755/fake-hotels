I have been the first time to Venice and we stayed at Bauer Palazzo. It is a 5 star Hotel and it had everything a 5 star hotel has to offer.  Breakfast: good variety, nothing special was missing Hotel: Nice hotel because it has an amazing terasse and a great location Room: We had a suite even though we did not book it. The cealing was really low and the room was dark (typicall Italian though) but the bed, TV and especially the bathroom were nice. Serivce: Great service especially the concierge was a great help in finding restaurants. Room serivce: really expensive 10 euros for a small water. Location: 2 minutes walk so Piazza San Marco in an shopping area but not too noisy Overall a great experience, however we made a really cheap deal online. The normal price would be tooâ€¦
