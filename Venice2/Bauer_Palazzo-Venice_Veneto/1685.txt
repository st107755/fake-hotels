This was our first visit to Venice.  The hotel was in a great location, just minutes from St.Mark's square and other places to visit.  It sits on the Grand Canal, so it meant a great location to have a meal or for breakfast (which was excellent) right by the waterside.  The room was also very good - we were overlooking the canal by the side of the hotel- with great towels, toiletries and fantastic maid service.  It was expensive, however (beware, the de pisis restaurant is very expensive and the food isn't up to the price) but in Venice the costs can be higher.  For a special occasion, it can't be beaten and i would recommend it thoroughly.
