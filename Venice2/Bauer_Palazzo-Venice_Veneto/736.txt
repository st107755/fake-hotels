My wife and I recently visited Venice for our wedding anniversary,  We stayed at the Bauer Hotel and boy what a hotel it was.  From check in to check out we were treated like royalty. The views from the bar and restaurant were absolutely sublime. Nothing better than looking out across the Grand Canal on a sunny day with a glass of wine.  The buffet style breakfast filled me up for the day and the dinner served in the restaurant was delicious.  The rooms are spacious and the beds really comfortable.  When we checked out, the Concierge called us a water taxi and we got to the airport in 30 mins. When I return I will definitely be going back to the Bauer.
