The public rooms were lovely, service perfect, breakfasts long and lingering in a choice of places, a friendly, competent bar, ,nothing in the hotel was too much trouble. I would go there again and again ..and again. The bedroom was lovely and big, big opening windows with lovely drapes, , fabulous fabric on the walls, , a Splendid marble bathroom, expensive  linens changed daily. Or in the case of towels every time I used one . I felt utterly spoilt and pampered. Everything in my room was of high quality. Even the hangars were matching and padded.the air on worked in silence..bliss
