We arrived in Venice and we were blown away by the city and the amazing scenery. The water taxi to our hotel was fantastic and the way we arrived was really incredible. The service at the hotel was ok when we arrived but once we got to our rooms we were really disappointed. Nothing like the photos. For the money I paid I felt it was really poor. The room faced a wall and there was very poor wifi, no iron, and amenities like hair dryer for my wife didn't have a connector. The service was average when we asked for the above to be rectified. We were offered a router for wifi so obviously knew it was an issue. The rest we put up with. We dined at the restaurant in the grand canal which was part of the hotel. I thought that for a 5 star hotel I would have been offered a drink/ wineâ€¦
