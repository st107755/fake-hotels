We have stayed here many times and it is always enjoyable. The rooms are nice and very clean. Breakfast is good and dinner at the restaurant is very good. Everyone is very accommodating. The hotel is in a good location. The only issue is the pigeon problem on the out door patio. They dive bomb your table and are the worst scavengers. They make for a very uncomfortable visit. As soon as the pigeons start flapping we are out of there. Something has to be done about this problem. There are sticks on the tables but this is a little archaic! Kill them, they are dirty and spread disease. I cannot imagine eating anything out there. If it weren't for this extremely disgusting issue I would have given the hotel a better rating.
