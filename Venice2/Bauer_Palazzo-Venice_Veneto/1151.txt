We had spent two nights in the hotel. It was perfect location probably a 5 minute walk to the main square and in the heart of all the big branded shops in venice. The staff was very hospitable, friendly and polite. The rooms were spacious and gives you a feeling of living in the Victorian time. Enjoyed eating the breakfast overlooking the canal. Though the choice for vegetarian's was not much. We celebrated our first anniversary and I was very happy with my husbands choice of this hotel.
