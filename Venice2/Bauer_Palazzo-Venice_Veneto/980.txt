We stayed 4 days in the Bauer il Palazzo go 4 days and loved everything since the minute we arrived we were welcomed by the front desk who showed us a couple of room to choose from. We chose a magnificent suite decorated in the Venitian style with a balcony having a magnificent view on the Grand Canal Breakfast on the 7 floor with a good buffet and breathtaking view Hope to be back soon
