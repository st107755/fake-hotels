This was our second stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo and only have the highest praise for this wonderful, intimate hotel.  Admittedly we were spoiled both times with amazing canal facing rooms.  For this stay we had a junior suite on the top floor of the hotel overlooking the grand canal.  Nearly every room is different so if you don't like the first room you are shown, kindly ask for another.  The front desk staff are more than willing to do whatever they can to make your stay more enjoyable.  I'm a bit of a hotel snob and have no reservations recommending this truly special Venetian hotel.  Expensive?  Yes (like everything else in Venice.  But completely worth it!
