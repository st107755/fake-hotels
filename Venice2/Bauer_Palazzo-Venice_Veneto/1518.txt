Everytime I am back at the Bauer i have the impression to be' back home. This is an institution of the old world luxury. I love the feeling of the old times...but compared with the other 5 stars hotels in town, bauer has it modernity both in the spirit and in the architecture. The position is amazing and if you have a room on the chanel...it is a Dream. I love the breakfast room facing the salute church...the only thing can be improve the quality of the breakfast and the amenities
