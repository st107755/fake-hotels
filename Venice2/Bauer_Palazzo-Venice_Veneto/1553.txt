Had the experience of staying at this wonderful hotel about 3 weeks ago. Arriving by water taxi from the airport and stepping into the lobby where we were greeted by a very professional staff. The room was very warm and inviting.We had breakfast each morning overlooking the grand canal as the traffic increase by the minute. What a circus! As for assistance in eating and touring we found the concierge to be excellent. Recommend this fine hotel to everyone.
