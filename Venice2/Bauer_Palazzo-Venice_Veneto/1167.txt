The best thing about the hotel is the location which is directly at the main canal with the most amazing view. The room that we got was big, but the "city view" that they are talking about is just roofs of the neighboring buildings.  They gave us a complimentary sparking wine at arrival which was a nice gesture. The breakfast was ok, they have sparkling wine, but the scrambled egg was very runny,
