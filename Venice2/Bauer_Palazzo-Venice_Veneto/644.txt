1 night at the hotel for a quick stop in Venice. Room booked via Expedia. At check out the 2 receptionists told me that I overpaid the room booking with Expedia as they had a lower rate. I called Expedia on this point asking to match the lower rate few min later- Expedia called the hotel to confirm and the hotel DENIED they told me so! Very unprofessional and upsetting from the hotel staff. Apart from this nice place but would not go back.
