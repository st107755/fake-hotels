This is the perfect hotel for Venice. Fabulous location, easy to get to, safe part of the city, surrounded by fabulous shops and great restaurants. The accommodation is wonderful. My husband and Ihave a fabulous suite with balconies that overlook the square and canal. We waken to the gondolas gently passing by. Amazing hotel in an amazing city!
