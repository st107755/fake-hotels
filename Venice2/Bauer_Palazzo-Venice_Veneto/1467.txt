I stayed here for a weekend and must say I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. The hotel is situated in the perfect location, 5 minutes walk away from Piazza San Marco, it boasts stunning rooftop views with rooms which are ornate and extremely elegant. Breakfast is served on the terrace at the waters edge looking out onto Santa Maria Della, with a very large selection of different and very tasty foods to choose from. The staff were very friendly here and also very helpful. I would definitely return and enjoy more amazing memories of Venice by accompanying my visit with a return to stay at The Bauer Hotel.
