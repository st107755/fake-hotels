From the moment you arrive by water taxi to the hotel, the experience is one best described as  "Surreal." It is a fantastic hotel and yes some areas are a little dated, but hey ho it's all part of the nostalgia.... As you leave the main entrance of the hotel, opposite starts a trail of shops, including every designer fashion brand you can think of...... five minute walk to St Marks Square which is an experience of a buzzing atmosphere and unbelievable architecture.... However be careful when you sit in the Square for a relaxing drink.... Small bottle of beer and a small wine 40 Euro's (Oh yes that did include a small bowl of crisps and eight olives) The whole experience of the Bauer and Venice was fantastic.......
