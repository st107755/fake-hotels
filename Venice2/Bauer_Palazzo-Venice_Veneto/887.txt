The location and service level made this hotel really stand out.  We were in a great area, surrounded by tasteful shops and restaurants. The staff was always friendly and helpful with all requests.  The daily breakfast was also nice and added additional value to the already well-priced room. The room itself was just as described... nice high ceilings and comfortable beds. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Venice.
