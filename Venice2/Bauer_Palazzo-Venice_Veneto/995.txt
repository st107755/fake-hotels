Okay, so Venice is Disneyland on the Adriatic for adults...but at the end of a long day of oohing and aahing, you need a comfortable bed, clean sheets and towels, and...did I not mention a concierge that will take care of reservations, give you suggestions on places to go and see, and look after you?  No?  My mistake!  The Bauer is an amazing hotel, but once you get past the marble in the lobby and hallways, the very comfortable seats in the public areas, and the wonderful terrace on the Grand Canal, the real treat is the staff.  I've noted the concierges, but from the bartenders, to the wait staff, to the housekeepers - this is a team that knows how a hotel should be run...and they take pride in doing so.  We've found our hotel in Venice - and yes, we will be back.
