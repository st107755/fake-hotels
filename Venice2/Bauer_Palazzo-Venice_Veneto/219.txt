We booked the Bauer for its location.  Right on the Grand Canal just as it opens up and looks unto the Basilica di Santa Maria.  In my title I stated that the property is confusing and I’ll explain in hopes of clarifying for first-time bookers.  There are 3 properties under the name Bauer Palazzo.  First, the historical property which is most expensive due to its location right onto the Canal.  Second, the modern portion which is set deeper (but attached to the historical hotel) therefore no Grand Canal views. Then there is the third property which is outside the hotel and you will be escorted to it by the front desk upon arrival. It is a few metres but still not part of the main two properties.  The third property is called Casa Nova suites.  These are the cheaper priced rooms…
