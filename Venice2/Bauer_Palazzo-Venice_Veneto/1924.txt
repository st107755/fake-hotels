We were expecting a first-rate, classy hotel in an amazing location and we were not disappointed.  The room was beautifully decorated, with a king-size bed.  The room size is a bit small but a roomy walk-in closet with space enough to set up an opened suitcase was helpful.  Service was superb.  The view from the restaurant terrace on the Grand Canal was breathtaking!  Perfectly located, it's a two-minute walk from Piazza San Marco.  Venice is an experience beyond compare, and our stay at the Bauer added to the  pleasure!
