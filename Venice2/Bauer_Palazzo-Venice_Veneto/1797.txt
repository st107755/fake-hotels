The hotel is in San Marco so there is an abundance of restaurants and shops.  The hotel lobby is nice and the view from the main floor terrace is beautiful.  It is on the canal and a very pleasant place to have a drink or breakfast.  The first night we stayed in room 228.  The next morning, I woke up with several bites on my back.  My husband, who is a dermatologist, immediately recognized the pattern of bites to be that of  bed bugs.  We called the lobby and complained.  They moved us to another room without a problem.   No bugs in the new room.  I'm not sure if they did anything about the bugs.    Our reservation was made through hotels.com and the rate included breakfast.  Good thing, because otherwise the breakfast would have cost 50 Euros per person which was outrageous forâ€¦
