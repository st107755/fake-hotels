"My wife and I have just returned from four nights at the Bauer. We booked for a Deluxe Room and were discretly upgraded to a Junior Suite without realising !!  What is good about The Bauer: superb location and position on the Grand Canal; huge palatial lobby areas; an army of professional and attentive staff; very high quality spacious accommodation. What is bad about the Bauer: nothing !!   I price-researched all the 5 Star Hotels in Venice before booking and my feeling is that you will get the best $$$$$ value here if you are doing Venice in style and can afford to go 5 Star. Page down past a couple of frankly ridiculous recent negative reviews and you will see other savvy British travellers raving about the Bauer like we are !!!
