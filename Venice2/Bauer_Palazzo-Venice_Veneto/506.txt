Very good classic Venetian Hotel in a great location on the grand canal ideal for all locations .  I would advise that when you book be 100% sure of what you are booking , it is better to splash out a little and get a room in the old part of the hotel with a view it's very much worth the extra .  Beware drinks at bar g&t 23€ , water €14 litre bottle plenty of places outside to buy.  Wifi very good , breakfast adequate  Staff very friendly
