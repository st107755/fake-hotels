I liked some things about this hotel, and some things I found to be very disappointing.    My biggest disappointment was the housekeeping.  I have posted a picture of what our shower looked like upon arrival in our one bedroom suite with canal view.  I'm sorry, but soap scum in the shower is completely unacceptable for a hotel of this standard.  I found that housekeeping did not really clean our room.  Instead, they kind of just "arranged" things.  Toilets, bath,  and sinks were not cleaned, toilet paper was not replaced, and waste paper baskets were not emptied.  LAZY!  I'm all for period furniture, but it should not be stained.  There were stains on the carpeting, furniture, walls, ceiling, etc.  Not good!  The room was of a decent size, but I would say that it was a bitâ€¦
