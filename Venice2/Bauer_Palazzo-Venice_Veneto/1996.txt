Stayed at The Bauer il Palazzo over Christmas 2003 and was pleasently surprised by this fantastic hotel in Venice. Having been to Venice countless times we found the il Palazzo to be the best hotel we had stayed at. Perfect location, fantastic rooms and friendly and helpful staff. Would stay here again!
