Not clear how this hotel makes it into one of the world's finest hotels. We had a small and somewhat cramped and dark room. The wireless Internet was VERY SLOW. I could barely get enough of a signal to write this review. The bathroom was adequate but there was no way to shut the curtain to avoid being seen by the neighboring building while standing at the toilet. Worst of all was the bed, which was SO hard that our backs were screaming in the morning. Overall, we were very unimpressed.
