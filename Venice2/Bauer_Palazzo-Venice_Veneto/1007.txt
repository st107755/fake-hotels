We only stayed in this awful place for one night....thank goodness.  We had upgraded to a "superior double” and the room was only just large enough to swing the proverbial cat around 4.5 metres by 5 metres or thereabouts!  It was dark and dismal with the noisiest air-conditioning that I have ever experienced.  It was an interior light well view with another room around two metres from our window…privacy none!  The bathroom, although well-equipped had a cracked basin in a five star hotel I don’t think so.  To cap everything the fruit at breakfast was tinned I could not believe it with fresh fruit being abundant in Europe in the summer I can only put this down to penny pinching.  Never again, there are many more better hotels in Venice avoid it like the plague.
