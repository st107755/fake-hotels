This is a world class hotel in the perfect location. Breakfast on the outdoor terrace is a wonderful relaxing experience. The hotel is well run - staff are attentive and efficient. Thats all one can ask for. If you wish to reduce the cost of your stay - then have a room in the Casa Nova annexe, just around the corner. The rooms are large, classy bathrooms, very nicely furnished, and you still have access to all the main hotel facilities.
