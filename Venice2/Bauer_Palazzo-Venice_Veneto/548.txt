Excellent staff, particularly Marco, who is on reception.  We had a small problem with our room on the first night.  The next morning I spoke with Marco and he happily and politely offered us another room. Everything was good from then. This is about our fifth visit to either the Bauer, the Bauer Casanova and this time the Bauer Palazzo.  Every visit has been exceptional.  The breakfasts are fabulous, everything you could want. Coffee good and hot. It was very warm in Venice on this trip and the problem with all city hotels is the air conditioning units which make a noise. A small price to pay for such a fabulous place.
