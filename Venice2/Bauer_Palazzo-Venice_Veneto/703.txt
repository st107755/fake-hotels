My family and I only stayed one night. The front desk was very nice and courteous and we loved our room. Inside our room was a mix of old and new style. The only complaint is the next day we kept getting knocks on our door for various reasons. I thought after I turned them down to fix my room the first time that would be it. They came back two more times and it felt like they were trying to push us out. I didn't think I needed to keep explaining to the staff not to clean my room today. Another time somebody came by with champagne that wasn't for our room. Besides that it was an average experience and them trying to "push"  us out could just have been my imagination.
