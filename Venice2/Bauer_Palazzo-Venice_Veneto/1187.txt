Had a fantastic stay at Bauer Il Palazzo. We arrived before check-in: no problem to leave bags (full hotel the night before, so no early check-in), and water, OJ or prosecco offered to us (and are available to guests for free during the day - though I could only see water by early evening). Likewise, when we had a 3pm water taxi to leave but check-out at noon, not a problem, and we felt our bags were safe. Very helpful concierge, who booked our preferred restaurant (no hard sell trying to get us to go anywhere), and also arranged a (free) private boat to Murano (with a glass-blowing demonstration, and a bit of hard-sell!), and also a (free) water taxi (this time shared) to Burano. The room was comfortable, though the air conditioning was a bit noisy and did not seem particularlyâ€¦
