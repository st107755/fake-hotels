My husband and I had just finished a 12 day Crystal Cruise (which is the top of the cruise lines) and finished our trip in Venice and stayed for 3 nights at the Bauer.  Right off of St. Mark's Square.  Breakfast was included otherwise it would have been 50 euros each.  Always make sure that is included.
