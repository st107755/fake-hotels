On approaching the hotel we thought uh oh but once inside we were pleasantly surprised.  The staff were lovely.  Our room was beautiful and best of all the location was spot on.  It meant we didn't need to get a water taxi unless we wanted to and could wander round Venice and enjoy.  St Marks Sq is a stones throw away and the gondolas are moored next to the hotel.  We had an amazing breakfast each day, being November we stayed inside the stunning dining room most days but managed once on the terrace with views of the canal.  I cannot praise this hotel enough, it made our trip even better.  Will definitely be returning again.
