The Bauer hotel is in two parts - the part on the Grand Canal is known as the Bauer Palazzo and is an old Venetian palace, the modern part is behind it.  Both are 5 star, but the Palazzo has more charm and views of the Grand Canal.  My room was perfect, just on a side canal,  large with frescos, and a balcony with a view of Grand Canal without the attendant noise.  Breakfasts for the Palazzo are on the spectacular roof - the highest in Venice.  The staff are charming and hugely helpful. The Modern part is very convenient for sightseeing and shopping.
