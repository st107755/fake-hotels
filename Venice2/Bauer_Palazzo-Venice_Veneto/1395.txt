The Bauer is indeed a grand old dame of a hotel. My guess is it was built in the late 30s or early 40s and would have been the star of Venice in its day. Its charm is that it has survived in large parts untouched. There are some wonderful light fittings and other fittings (and a beautiful staircase) that make you feel you're in a grand hotel (akin to stepping on to the Titanic). But that same original style also serves to make it feel a little tired compared to today's modern brands. (But I much preferred it to the dreary Westin Excelsior in Rome.)  The position and setting is nothing short of magical. Breakfast in the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal just cannot be trumped. But the breakfast is lousy. For a five-star hotel it's criminal. I've had better at an airportâ€¦
