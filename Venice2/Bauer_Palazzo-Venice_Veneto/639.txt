My partner surprised me with a long weekend in Venice. What can I say Venice is amazing it was my third visit to Venice and I will never tire of the city.    We travelled by water taxi from the airport to Venice which is well worth the extra expense, the view of Venice from the water is stunning.    We arrived at the hotel but we very disappointed to be sent around to the side to stay in the newer part of the hotel.  The booking was very misleading as we thought we were staying in the older part, be sure to check this out with whoever you book with.    We arrived around 12 am and were tired and hot having left home at 3am, and were disappointed to be told our room was not available until 3pm.  We were asked to leave our bags with the concierge but to be honest no one was payingâ€¦
