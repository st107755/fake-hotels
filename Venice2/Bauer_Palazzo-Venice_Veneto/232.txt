Another fine stay at THE Bauer. The staff, location, rooms, breakfast and amenities are all top notch and will meet your expectations.    On this stay the quality of service on the patio did disappoint.  Unlike the staff in the rest of the hotel, over our two days the waitstaff and bartenders were uninspired, unknowledgable, robotic and displayed  no emotion. Service was always mediocre and slow. Quality of drinks and size of pours dramatically changed each round.    When prices on the patio for a drink are 3x the norm, the level of service needs be excellent.  Better training and more staff are necessary on the patio. Maybe next time.
