Splendid Hotel, is how I will describe Bauer Hotel. Got a great price including breakfast from Expedia. It was expensive but met our expectations.  We were celebrating an anniversary and so we splurged a bit.  Close to Piazza San Marco, La Fenice, Gritti Place and many other places of interest and must see.  Accadamia, and Guggenheim are across the grand canal from the Hotel. It has a great patio along the grand canal where we sat and had breakfast which was fresh and to die for. We also did a lot of people watching from this spot.. This hotel is housed alongside other Bauer properties at the same location so do not be confused about the difference.  The best shopping is right at their door step and though expensive it is worth window shopping and strolling along. Closeby areâ€¦
