Stayed with family @ Bauer's hotel in Venice in mid July.Honestly we were worried about the weather and the possibility of facing the bad water smell during this period of the year but fortunately we had a wonderful weather and all our trip was superb. Regarding the hotel it was an excellent choice,the location ,service ,cleanliness and breakfast were perfect, the room though was on the small size but acceptable.
