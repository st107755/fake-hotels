We booked this through the ba website and paid a little extra than other hotels and websites but it was 100% worth it. The location is perfect, just a short 2 minute walk from st Marco square and 2 minutes from the airport water bus. The hotel is more luxurious than many that you see and has 2 buildings. We stayed in the 2nd building, next door, and it was lovely, although not quite as posh as the main building and we had to go out of the building to access the front door to the property. Having said this, the room was rest and tidied/cleaned every day.   Breakfast here is amazing!!! We were never early enough at 9am to sit in the main hall, however, other seating options were lovely and the food was delicious so we didn't mind - it was somewhat like silver service.
