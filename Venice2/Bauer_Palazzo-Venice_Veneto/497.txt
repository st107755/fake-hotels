Stayed three nights recently in an excellent room overlooking the Bauer terrace, and the Grand Canal.  Room was decorated in a classic Venetian style – with red walls and tented poster bed, though a bit small.   Bathroom was long and spacious, though shower was immediately adjacent to the bathroom door, and somewhat difficult to access.  Room package included an excellent breakfast buffet in the top floor executive lounge, with a rooftop terrace featuring stunning views of the city, and the canal.  Location is fantastic – convenient walk to St. Marks Square, and various high end retailers.
