We decided on this hotel when we read all the reviews on Trip Advisor. We flew from Dublin to Treviso with Ryanair. The location is perfect, within a couple of minutes walk of San Marco. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite on arrival. The room was very spacious and had a view of the little square in front of the hotel and you could also see the canal which ran alongside the hotel. The bathroom was large and luxurious with a jacuzzi bath. The best thing about the hotel apart from the location  was the breakfast and the view over the Grand Canal while eating it. The selection and quality was excellent and we hated having to give it a miss on our last day as we had to leave the hotel at 6.00am to get our flight back. We didn't consult the hotel staff much as we chose to mainly doâ€¦
