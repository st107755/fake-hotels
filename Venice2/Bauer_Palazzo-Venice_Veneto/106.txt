A lovely hotel with a fabulous position. We were upgraded on arrival to a junior suite which was a much appreciated gesture. The hotel is minutes from St Mark's Square and opposite the wonderful Basilica Santa Maria Della Salute. One of the highlights of the hotel is enjoying a drink on the outside terrace, watching the Gondolas float past towards the Grand Canal. Attentive, friendly staff. Would highly recommend.
