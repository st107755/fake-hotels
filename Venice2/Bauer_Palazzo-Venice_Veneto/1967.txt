We have just spent three wonderful nights at the Palazzo and would happly go again, it is just off the tourist track and is 3 min walk in to St Marks square.  The staff fall over themselves to help with reservations and also mapping out the tourist trails for you.  Its Grand canal rooms are great, but we will go for the same suite each time for the location and space involved.
