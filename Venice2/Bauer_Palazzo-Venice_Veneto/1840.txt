There is no denying the fact the room was lovely. We had a drawing room with silk wallpaper and a jacuzzi bath for god's sake! The concierge were snobby and arrogant but the barmen, waitresses and maids were really nice. There are two bars at this hotel, the internal BB bar was twenty euros cheaper than the outside canal view bar for the same round of drinks, and when I queried this with the concierge, he just shrugged and said maybe we paid more for the view. Well, considering it was my birthday, and I had paid three hundred pounds for a room for one night, I was more than a little shocked by this reply. The staff seem to have a playground mentality and the older more important staff almost bullied the juniors and meek guests, no attempt was made to hide this. I liked the lookâ€¦
