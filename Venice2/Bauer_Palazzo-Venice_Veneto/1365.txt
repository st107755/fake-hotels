The Bauer II was our second hotel that we stayed in during this three week stay in Italy.  It is a superb hotel.  The room was beautiful with a large balcony and a great view of the Canal Grande. We were at the hotel for three nights.  The staff was professional and courteous and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.  The breakfast on the terrace was excellent.  I would definitely stay here if I am ever back in Venice.
