I was here for 2 nights on the 12th and 13th of July. First, the positives. The location is perfect. It is right on the Grand Canal and a block from St. Mark's. The lobby of the hotel was very nice and I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The airline lost our luggage and the front desk was very helpful in communicating with them to make sure we got it before we left for Florence. The breakfast was good, not great. There were definitely options for everyone. I am not sure what the difference was between the continental breakfast and the buffet breakfast. We had the continental and it seemed to be the same exact thing, so that might be something to consider if the buffet breakfast is more expensive. The hotel also has a free water taxi to take you to a Murano glassâ€¦
