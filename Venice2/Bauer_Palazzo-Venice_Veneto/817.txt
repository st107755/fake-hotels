Venice was the last leg of our tour of Italy and I should say this was the best of all the hotels we stayed.  Very classy and feels like a palace.   Even the toilet brush had a Swarovski looking crystal handle on it ;^)... So you can  just imagine how nice the furnishings would be.  We got the penthouse on the Casanova side of the building.. The service was excellent and the rooms were extravagant..Breakfast was classy with a lot of varieties.  There is an outdoor dining section which overlooks the Grande canal...  Location is indeed very good.. Just 2 to 3 mins walk from the main square...I did not see any other hotel closer.  One draw back is the shared Water Taxi pickup which is abt 8 to 10 mins walk and if your flight is early in the morning... Make sure u have plenty ofâ€¦
