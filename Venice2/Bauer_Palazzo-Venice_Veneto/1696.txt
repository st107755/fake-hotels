Staying at the Bauer Hotel was our family's "splurge" for our tour of Italy.  It didn't disappoint.  From the moment we were greeted by Giancarlo, the hotel manager, we were treated to a superb experience.  The location is extraordinary and we particularly enjoyed the views from the open-air veranda for breakfast and cocktails.  We were also pleasantly surprised when the hotel responded to our email requests for a suite with a sitting room large enough to accommodate our two teenage boys.  In lieu of only a fold-out couch, they put us in an internal but larger suite that could accommodate a roller bed as well as the couch.  It was perfect for our family of four.  This was very customized treatment and showed that they paid attention to our request, even during a busy season! â€¦
