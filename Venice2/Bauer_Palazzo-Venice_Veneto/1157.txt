This place deserves more than 5 stars. We booked a suite and it was totally worth it. Everything about our stay, every guy from the front desk to room service was simply perfect. The rooms were clean and tidy almost all of the time. Excellent service. Excellent view of the canal from our room. We were offered a complimentary wine when we arrived. Well done. Great location-right next to St Mark's square.
