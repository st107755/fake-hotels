This is an outstanding luxury hotel 200 metres from San Marco square. Terrasse is the best in Venice with direct view on Grand Canal. Rooms and suites are spacious and very well decorated with antique and pseudo-antique furniture and luxury marble bathrooms. Service was impeccable. It was a real 5 stars deluxe experience. Restaurant in hotel is very popular and I would advice an advance booking for weekend. Every moment in this hotel was pure happiness.  Hotel was on luxury shopping street, two steps from vaporetto station, 2 minutes walk from San Marco square. We will return there with pleasure.
