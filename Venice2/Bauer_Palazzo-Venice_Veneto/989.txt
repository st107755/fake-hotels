Location wise, you can’t ask for anything better. San Marco, on the waterfront, shops just right outside.   Check-in was quick with big smiles from everyone. We got a room upgrade too, thank you! We were shown to our room which had a part view of the canal. I can imagine why some people might complain that the design may look “old” but I absolutely loved it and found it charming. Everything was clean and spotless, bottle of chilled sparkling wine waiting.  Special mention on the Concierge: this is by far the BEST Concierge service I had ever encountered! Crazy knowledgable, reeling off names of owners/managers of restaurants, where to eat, the different types of food, etc. etc. Last minute private tour of the city? No problem; we got a local lady with the most amazing knowledge…
