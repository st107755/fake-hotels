Just returned from a trip to Italy where we spent several nights at Il Palazzo.  The hotel has an elegant charm (very different from the adjoining Bauer, which is much more modern).  The staff were terrific -- very helpful.  We loved the breakfast on the rooftop terrace -- it was the perfect way to start a day in Venice.  Having said that, breakfast was included with our room (at 400 euros per night); I would not have paid 50 euros per person for the breakfast. The location (close to St. Mark's Square) is very good.   I would definitely recommend the hotel.
