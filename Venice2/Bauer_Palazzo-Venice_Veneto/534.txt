Stayed December 26 to January 1.  Family of three:  two adults and one nine year old.  Spacious and well appointed room in the Bauer Hotel section with a king-sized bed and a cot set up for our son.  Crisp white sheets, towels, and turn down service.  Dinner at De Pisis was excellent.  Live jazz in the lobby bar.  Buffet breakfast was great with a nice selection of pastries, meats and cheeses.  2 minute walk to fireworks in San Marco square on New Year's Eve.  Concierge gave excellent recommendations for restaurants in the area.  Front desk staff was very thoughtful and provided us with a packed breakfast for our early 4 am departure.  Highly recommend and will back!
