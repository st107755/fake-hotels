Location: Place is right in the middle of the High end shopping...block away from San Marcos square...two blocks from the Hard Rock Cafe.   Service: Everyone has been professional and courteous (front desk, concierge, bell man, housekeeping). It was raining for a couple hours and they were providing all guest with umbrellas.  Appearance: Very clean and well kept. Decore is beautiful, old venetian style.  Cons: Great buffet breakfast excluding the eggs...they are under cooked and runny...when I asked for them to make me some eggs they said it would be an extra charge. There are no "do not disturb" for the doors. The housekeeping came to turn down the sheets while I was taking a nap and work me up.
