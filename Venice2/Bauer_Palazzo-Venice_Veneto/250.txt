Lovely hotel 5 minutes from San Marco.  Great base for all the touristy bits but easy to navigate off the beaten path and explore 'hidden Venice'.   From the moment we walked in every member of staff we had contact with could not do enough for you. All staff from reception to restaurant to housekeeping greet you with a cheery smile and Buongiorno!   At breakfast there is a splendid choice and I was very impressed at the scrummy scrambled eggs every day (so many hotels are not able to do this).  You can fill up with endless delights and coffee and no need to eat til evening.  A terrace and verandah with what must be one of the best views in Venice. We had a delightful spacious and very clean twin room with canal side view, a joy to open the windows to singing gondoliers eachâ€¦
