Stayed here for 2 nights recent trip to Venice. Lovely hotel right on the canal. Enjoyed sunset view while having cocktails and appetizers on outdoor patio overlooking canal. Amazing breakfast buffet with same wonderful view. Room was large clean with comfortable king size bed. Lobby beautiful and staff accommodating and helpful. 5 Star hotel. Would highly recommend to stay at this property if you get the chance to visit Venice.
