Restaurant for dinner and breakfast overlooks the canal so really good in terms of situation and choices. Breakfast all inclusive and menu was wide and varied. Lunch and dinner expensive ; there are better places to eat .  Room ( de-luxe and number 229 ) was spacious but slightly old fashioned . That said the beds were comfortable and it was clean. The biggest issue was the early morning noise- must be situated over the kitchen area as first thing, the bins were clearly emptied and the staff were really noisy as they chatted away - not great at 6 am . location overall was amazing - walking distance of everywhere .
