We loved this hotel.  The location, rooms, staff and dining was top notch.  Waterside locations with fantastic views were just breath taking.  The staff was so helpful and the hotel was impeccably clean.  The woman at the check in was so welcoming, (tall with straight black hair -  cant remember her name) was so thoughtful and answered all of our questions and went though how to use everything in the room.  If in Venice and want a super hotel with an amazing location and so close to so many attractions, definitely give Bauer a shot.
