Arrived in Venice for our honeymoon and all the water taxis and public transportation were on strike. Had to walk from Realto Bridge and find our way to the II Palazzo. It was worth the walk! Right on the water amazing view of Venice from our room.  The staff was so nice and extremely helpful.   This staff was the BEST staff we had in our week long stay in Italy.  We loved Venice and the II Palazzo. Great decor, gorgeous bathrooms, rooms are big and spacious. We received welcome cookies and chocolates upon our arrival.  Breakfast buffet is so yummy! Make sure to reserve the rooftop jacuzzi it has great views of Venice!  Also,don't forget to eat spaghetti carbonara and must do gondola ride who cares if it's costly.
