Perfect location with at only short walks´ distance from all the sights. Beautiful old building with an equally beautiful more modern extension, everything furnished and decorated in excellent taste. Friendly, courteous staff - unfortunately my husband fell ill for a while during our stay but we got all the help we could wish for from the staff, calling a doctor etc etc. The breakfast buffé is lavish and the dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was delicious. Highly recommended (And do take the water taxi straight from the airport to the hotel quay - it´s an amazing experience to approach Venice from the sea!)
