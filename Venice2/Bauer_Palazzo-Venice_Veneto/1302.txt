I have stayed with Bauer Il Palazzo last year during Biennale. This year I returned for a short weekend break and redeemed my free night with Leading Hotels of the World. Check-in was smooth, very warm welcome by receptionist and residence manager, addressed by name and everything was taken care of very professionally.   Location just can't be beat: Directly facing Canal Grande, opposite of Punta della Dogana, St. Mark's Square is just 3 minutes by foot. We arrived very early by private boat and the room wasn't ready yet, so we went to have breakfast at Settimo Cielo on the rooftop which is one of the highlights - panorama-wise and service-wise. Lucia and the whole breakfast team are just amazing.   Since we were not paying anything for our stay, I wasn't expecting anything inâ€¦
