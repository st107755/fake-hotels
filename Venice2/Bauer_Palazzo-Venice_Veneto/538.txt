My family and I visited from Miami.  Multiple friends recommended we stay at this property.  It is not a modern hotel (I'm not sure a modern hotel exists in Venice).  But the rooms were super quiet and comfortable. The concierge and front desk were all super helpful.  I'd definitely stay at the property again and have no qualms recommending it.
