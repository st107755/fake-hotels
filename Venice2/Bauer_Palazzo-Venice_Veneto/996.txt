I got the booking for hotel Bauer Venice . After arriving to the hotel & getting the formalities done at the reception ,they asked to take me to my hotel which was outside the hotel in the next lane . It was an isolated hotel just like a house converted into a hotel . I told d hotel that I got d booking for hotel Bauer & not for d hotel Casanova (so called) .they asked me to pay euro100 per night extra to stay in the hotel.finally I ended pup paying those 100 euros extra per night to stay in the same hotel the Bauer
