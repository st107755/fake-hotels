Great Hotel, the best location, great service from arrival to departure. Great dinning on the grand canal in the evening, the food and service 100% perfect.  Our room was  very nice with 6 windows looking at the canals, very nice bathroom, great bar for evening drinks.  The only comment is the breakfast was very poor, we had two great dinners and a poor breakfast, even the bread was not fresh, the juice is not fresh and a fired egg is 6 euros extra, no fresh fruit apart from whole orange and grapes every other fruit were tinned.  Great free internet service.
