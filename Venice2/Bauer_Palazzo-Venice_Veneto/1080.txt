The hotel is so expensive, and not up to the standard of five stars hotels.  Rooms are very small; I paid 1000 Euro per night in the period from 05/05/2015 to 08/05/2015.  Breakfast is so limited. If you need you to have another type of egg, you have to pay.  Rooms are do not have noise reduction windows, however, they provide you with ear plug!!!!!   Staff are not friendly.
