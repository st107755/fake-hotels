We stayed in a Superior room with city view earlier this month and although rather small the room was airy with lots of windows (all opening) and great views over the red tiled rooftops. The best thing about this hotel is breakfast which is served on a wide terrace on the grand canal. It's also the first place I've been where you can drink champagne for breakfast! The bottle's cooling on ice if you want it. Unfortunately the croissants were stale and there was nowhere to toast the bread. It must be noted the hotel is a sponge for any funds you may have. On top of the room price where you're looking at around a £1,000 for 2 nights, there is the constant tipping (€5 here €10 there) as everyone you encounter is more than happy to take your money and lingers until you do. No change?…
