We spent four days in Venice. This hotel is very well situated for walking around. It has the most stunning roof top restaurant, but you can only get breakfast otherwise it is closed despite the fact there are comfortable chairs. Similarly the canal side seating area is only available at meal times. The hotel needs updating and if you compare it to the Gritti Palace you will see what I mean.
