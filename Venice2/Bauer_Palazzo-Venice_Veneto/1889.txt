We recently returned from Venice and a stay at the Bauer. We couldn't have been more pleased. The front desk staff were extremely polite and gracious. We were upgraded upon our arrival to a beautiful suite. This suite was amazing, more like an apartment with bedroom, beautiful bathroom, sitting room, living area, etc. downstairs and another bedroom, bathroom, etc. upstairs. We noticed a few more stairs leading up to a small door, and discovered it led to our private rooftop terrace. Amazing. We went to a small grocery store nearby, bought wine and bread and cheese and enjoyed it while sitting outside on our private terrace. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was super-polite and friendly. The location couldn't have been better. The water taxi dropped us off and picked us upâ€¦
