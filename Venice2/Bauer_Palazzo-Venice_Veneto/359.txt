My husband and I just stayed in the Bauer palazzo it was lovely The room was upgraded to a delux palazzo with a view, side on to the grand canal.It was spacious with a walk in closet and marble bathroom kitted with soaps,shampoo etc  The service from all the hotel staff was excellent. We eat in the restaurant it was expensive but the food was good. We liked the roof top bar for the lovely views I would highly recommend this hotel  It is just around the corner from San Marco square very central
