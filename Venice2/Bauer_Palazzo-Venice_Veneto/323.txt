Arrived by water taxi, straight to hotel entrance, was a very central area for shops and waterfront and gondolas were right outside , breakfast was continental style, fresh and plentiful, staff helpful and friendly, outdoor breakfast is a battle with pigeons and gulls so BEWARE.  We had a suite was comfortable and a good size with lovely toiletries and fluffy towels, our room was right outside the church with a bell that ding  dinged early morning , so no quiet lie in.  Would stay again, but is expensive.
