We had a perfect 4 night stay at this hotel. The location is perfect, the staff couldn't do enough for us even brought a cake to our room for my birthday which was a lovely surprise. We arrived with no real plan of what we wanted to do and Paolo the concierge was so knowledgeable. We spoke to him most evenings and  worked out our itinerary for the following day. A definite 'do again' holiday.
