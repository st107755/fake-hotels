We spent three night at the Bauer at the end of our Italian vacation and found it to be very nice by European standards.  The location simply cannot be beaten, just two blocks from St. Mark's and sharing a location on the Grand Canal with the upper scale Bauer Il Pallazzo (whose rooms front the Canal).  The hotel offers a complementary breakfast buffet at its restaurant that sports a veranda overlooking the Grand Canal.  The rooms and the service were both good, though not exceptional.  It was perfectly acceptable for what we were looking for and the location couldn't be beaten.
