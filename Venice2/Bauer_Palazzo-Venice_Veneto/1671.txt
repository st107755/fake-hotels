Whilst this hotel is in a great location at the entrance of the Grand Canal by St Mark's Square, the room we had was not anything close to a 5* standard. We toured round Veneto and thought we'd splash out (pun intended) on our Venice Hotel and have a little luxury. We were very disappointed. The ground floor of the hotel is very large and luxurious giving false hope about the rooms above. After a lengthy check-in we were shown to our room which was smaller than the Ibis we had stayed at in Verona. The bathroom was marble (guessing that was their justification for the 5* rating) but small. The view out of the window was commercial roof tops - air conditioning units and the like.  Never mind we thought, put it down to experience. We thought we'd at least try out the spa - it saysâ€¦
