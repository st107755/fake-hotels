We booked 4 rooms for a Family get together and had an unforgettable experience. Three of the rooms were on the 3rd floor and one on the 6th floor. My mother, on the 3rd floor, had the room closest to the front of the hotel with a wonderful view of the Grand Canal. The other 2 rooms on the 3rd floor were situated further back and overlooked  a small side canal and the building next door. All three rooms were not very spacious but adequate. The room on the 6th floor was much bigger and had a great view of the Campanile in St. Mark's Square and Venetian rooftops. Breakfast is on the 7th floor with a fantastic view and the possibility of sitting outside on the terrace to fully appreciate the marvels of the surrounding area. The reason I am not giving the hotel an excellent ratingâ€¦
