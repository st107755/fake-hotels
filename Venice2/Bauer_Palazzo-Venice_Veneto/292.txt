Excellent location, staff and overall fabulous! Love this place. We will return! We arrived in September to find upgrade to canal view. OVERALL EVERYTHING OUTSTANDING! The concierge's were so helpful - tRoberto and hey even drew maps! Recommended fabulous walking guided tour. Gorgeous room, bar, restaurant - everything. Can walk everywhere. We came for Biennialle and we have art & design business and our home is great but I want to live in this hotel! Perfect bathrooms, bedding all exquisite taste! The rooftop fab too! I have stayed around the world and this is standout on service and style! Thanks - See you soon I hope!
