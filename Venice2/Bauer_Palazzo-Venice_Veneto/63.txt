Trip to Venice for 2 days was nothing but amazing Hotel was very nice, however asked 3 times to look at our bed as itâ€™s was very uncomfortable   However: on final night at 7pm they offered a change of room. Not convenient with a early start next day  Also celebrating our 30 wedding anniversary in Vience and Bauer also chose not to acknowledge
