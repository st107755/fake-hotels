My boyfriend surprised me with a long weekend in Venice for my Birthday & chose this hotel for our stay.  We got a private water taxi directly from Marco Polo Airport to the hotel. It was a great way to see some of the canals & sights on the way.  The hotel is right on the Grand Canal & was the perfect location to walk around the entire city.   The hotel itself was very clean & grand with marbled floors & rich decor. The walls were covered with fabric as tradition.  The bed was very comfortable & the bathroom was gorgeous, although the bath was a little small for my 6ft 2" boyfriend! He also thought the room was a little on the small side but it made no difference to me as I just wanted to explore the city.  The turndown service was lovely to come back to after a day of walkingâ€¦
