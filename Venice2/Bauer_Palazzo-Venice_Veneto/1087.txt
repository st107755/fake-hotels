This hotel is a beautiful hotel right next to San Marcos Square.  The room we had did not offer a view of any kind, but the terrace where they serve breakfast overlooks the Grand Canal and has the most amazing view. The staff are very polite and helpful. Our room was a good size, very clean, with a nice size bathroom.  Will definitely refer this hotel to others.
