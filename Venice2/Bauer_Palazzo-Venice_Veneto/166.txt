The Bauer Il Palazzo occupies such a splendid position on the Canal, the hotel staff simply cannot do enough for you and the rooftop terrace for breakfast is simply stunning. The rooms are opulent and well cared for with the most sumptuous linen making a good nights sleep so easy. Central location means you are in St Marks in seconds but also can wind the back streets and find great little restaurants with fabulous food at a fraction of the price. We returned for my husbands 60th to find a bottle of champagne in our room to thank us for returning and to celebrate his birthday. Very rare but made such an impact. I would not want to stay anywhere else in Venice as this hotel has such a great personal touch.
