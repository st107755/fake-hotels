I get it, the location is good.. Its right near all the high end brands, but I don't get the reviews. The hotel looks like and is setup like it was out of the middle ages. Its right in the dead center of the worst tourist trap imaginable, the rooms are old.. I mean like medieval looking old and smell moldy. Due to the location and quality of staff I could see paying US $400 maybe, but for $1000 a night I expected to be blown away... Far from it. So glad I didn't book extra days here. This is a good value at a couple hundred a night, at $1000.00 you will feel cheated.
