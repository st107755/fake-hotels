We got married September 10, 2016 and booked a two week trip to Italy for a honeymoon. Our travel agent suggested this hote in Venice. We went by water taxi right to the hotel.... it was very exciting to be in Venice! They upgraded our room and the accommodation was beautiful. The hote itself is beautiful, clean and everyone is friendly. We dropped our luggage in the room and set off to explore Venice. We ended up having to come home the next day due to a family emergency and the staff was very accommodating to help us get back to the airport the next day but not before we had breakfast ... which was included ...on the water with a magnificent buffet! We left for home with very heavy hearts but not before falling in love with Venice and the Bauer. We are planning to go back inâ€¦
