I stayed at this hotel after spontaneously deciding to stay the night in Venice while visiting on vacation with my father. I was amazed at how accommodating the staff was for a walk-in reservation. Not only did the helpful gentleman at the desk "Massimo" take the time to show us different rooms (We were unsure if the rooms were worth the price), but they let us pick the one we wanted at the end.   The room we chose was amazing. The walls were lined with elegant fabric, and the view was to die for. Overall, it was very ritzy.   To top it all off, the breakfast spread in the morning was great, and they had both Italian and American cuisine.   I must say, I will be back on my next Venetian visit in April!
