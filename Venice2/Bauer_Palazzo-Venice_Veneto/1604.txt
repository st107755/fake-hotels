A lovely hotel, well located central for shopping, stilling and getting around in Venice.  Our room was really large, well appointed, but we hardly had any windows, and what we had, looked out onto an internal courtyard. We didn't complain, it was no big deal, and we only had two nights, not that we spent much time in the room.....Venice is so beautiful loads to see and do.  The breakfast is really nice, from cooked, to continental, fresh fruit and light bites. Really great american coffee too ! When the weather is nice, its lovely to sit on the terrace over looking the canal.   I would stay here again, it is good value, and a lovely hotel. We have stayed at the Danelli too, which isn't to far away, but for this particular weekend the price was double, and Id rather use that onâ€¦
