We upgraded to the Bauer when booking a Gate 1 air/hotel package in April to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  We are still in awe of the gracious treatment we received and their incomparable location, including outdoor rooftop "Settimo Cielo" breakfast setting.  You look to the left at sunrise and there is the Bacino San Marco coming to life, with boats of all types starting another glorious day in Venice!  Breathe it in!!  You look across the Grand Canal to Santa Maria della Salute, Venice's most beloved church, and up to the right as far as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.  (You can buy  the DVD "The Sound of Venice" at the hotel, which includes this memorable scene).    If you choose to arrive by water taxi (which we did not), the Trinita dock is on the Rio San Moiseâ€¦
