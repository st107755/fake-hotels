We had an absolutely incredible stay in this hotel. It really was amazing. We arrived by private water taxi (such a special way to arrive at a hotel) and were greeted by the concierge. We stayed in a junior suite which overlooked the Grand Canal and took my breath away - such an incredible view and as the weather was so good we kept the windows open all the time so we could hear all the activity outside! We found the staff to be extremely helpful and welcoming and the hotel, even though it's not brand new, clean and well presented. The hotel is very well located and it's just a short walk to catch a water taxi which are easy to work out and navigate you around Venice. You can of course arrange private water taxis to take you around but we weren't in any hurry and quite enjoyedâ€¦
