The Hotel Bauer was located right on the canal.  The room was beautifully appointed. An outside courtyard was perfect for watching gondolas and boats going up and down the waterway.  The breakfast room was elegant and the buffet had everything anyone would want to eat!!  The staff was very professional and willing to assist and answer questions during out stay.
