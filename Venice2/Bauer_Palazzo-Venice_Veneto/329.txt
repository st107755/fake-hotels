We recently stayed at this Hotel and we enjoyed our first experience of Venice. It was located in a perfect position facing the Grand Canal on one side with access to the Gondolas on another side and access to luxury shops at another. We were so close to San Marcos Square and the Doges Palace a 5 min walk was all it took. The Hotel has a boat that takes you across and  to Giudecca Island and then takes you back at set times during the day. We found the staff very polite and helpful and the breakfast on the terrace facing the Grand Canal was amazing - so much choice!
