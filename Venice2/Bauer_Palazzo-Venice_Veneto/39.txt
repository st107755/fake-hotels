Located right on the Grand Canal and a 3 minute walk to St. Mark's Square this historic building has been updated into a modern hotel. Staff and services are very good, the room prices vary by location, view and size. Ours was more than adequate--we didn't come here to sit in the room. The lobby is spacious, helpful staff arrange and assist with your water taxi or gondola needs. There is a good breakfast buffet with inside and outside seating right on the Grand Canal with views of 3 other islands. There is no shortage of dining, cafe and shopping options in this area of the city...many high end shops are located here.  Venice is a walking city and the hotel is a great starting point. They also offer complementary shuttle to and from Murano, where you tour a glass blowingâ€¦
