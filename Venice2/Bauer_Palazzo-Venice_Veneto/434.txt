We enjoyed our stay at the palazzo portion of this hotel (the street-front section is more modern). It has a confusing layout that takes a while to figure out, and takes some time to reach your room - but the private terrace for palazzo guests was amazing for breakfast and afternoon apertivos. Staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Just steps from San Marco and central to vaporetto stops and waking to other areas. We took the water taxi (â‚¬120) to the airport from the hotel dock, which was quite convenient.
