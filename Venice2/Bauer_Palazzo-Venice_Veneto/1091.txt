We have stayed here before and the quality is consistent. The location is excellent with the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. The staff are all very friendly and professional, the decor is beautifully art deco and very clean. We were presented with a bottle of Prosecco on arrival which was lovely. Our bedroom was well equipped though as usual the lighting was ambient so not helpful for make-up or hairdrying. Other than that I can't fault the room. Breakfast was good but lacked fresh fruit salad which was disappointing.
