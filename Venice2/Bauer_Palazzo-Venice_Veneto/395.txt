We booked for our 10 aniversary a superior suite with view to small chanel. Specially the Il Redentore weekend. We rent a boat-taxi to arrive there. When we arrive to the Bauer Palazzo dock, the docker said me that we dont have booking on the palazzo. We have to go to reception of the hotel.   When we ask at counter the kindly counter woman said us that dont worry that we will be hosted at palazzo. She gave us the room 557 at hotel. A old decorated spacy room, with a view to small coutyard.(see photos) How can become a new decorated venetian style room in a old decorated room with view to the neighbor.   We booked in advance and I presume that they book our room higher price and gave us this one. Staying in Palazzo you can access to diferent parts like settimo cielo restaurantâ€¦
