Most things in Venice are over priced-certainly the hotels and restaurants especially near to San Marco Square.  The Bauer being no exception.  We were in a basic room in the Casanova wing with no day light as the next building was so close.  Nevertheless the decor was opulent with lined walls.    We were next to the lift but never heard a thing.    I would have expected tea/coffee facilities in a 5 Star hotel but they were not included.  Slippers and dressing gowns were there.  The breakfast was modest but well cooked.  I did wonder about the lack of cutlery and plates on the table and no toast available although we were using the overflow room until the last day when we discovered the main dining room nearer the canal.  We enjoyed wandering the streets around the Grand Canalâ€¦
