Loved the decor of this hotel, the rooms are large with high ceilings and brilliant views of the Grande Canal. The service is brilliant! The food is great -breakfast was delicious, overlooking the Canal. the location is close walking distance to St Marco Piazzo. The concierge organised everything for us from excursions to the Island of Murano, to restaurant recommendations and bookings. We loved this hotel.
