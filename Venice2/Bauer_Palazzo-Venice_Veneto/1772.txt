Upgraded on arrival , we were very lucky to have found a good rate at this elegant, beautifully decorated hotel. The room size was excellent by italian standards and the furnishings plush. Overlooking the church next door and the designer shops in the square below, the location was ideal. Breakfast ( hideously expensive but worth it for the views alone) and meals overlooking the gondolas and other water traffic passing by and magnificent views of the Santa Maria Della Salute, we absolutely loved it here.
