I went on wedding anniversary ( how original...) but my wife was not disappointed: location is perfect, take a room with view on the canal..; and go on the evening to the restaurant: I had a fish Rosso buck for the first time of my life and it is excellent ... excellent wine is affordable ( in contrary to most of expensive Venetian restaurants !!!) and the service perfect. The breakfast on the upper terrace is just magic.
