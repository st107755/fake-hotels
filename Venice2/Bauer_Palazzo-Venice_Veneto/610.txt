We were staying in the sister hotel on the Guidecca island.  The courtesy water boat took us between the two.  This was the first evening all out group of people were together, with people arriving at different times.  The food is actually very good value for money.  We did laugh at the end of the meal, as when we arrived, none of us wanted a started, however the waiter was very clever in getting us to have one!  Service was amazing and it was a great place for people watching.  Overall, out meal for 8 came in at around 750 euros, including drinks and deserts.  Would definitely recommend.
