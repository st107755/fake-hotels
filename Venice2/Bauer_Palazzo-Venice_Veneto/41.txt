I am Very disappointed of what I ve found after 5 years. It was used to be an exclusive, perfect hotel. From the quality of breakfast nowadays you already understand the level where it is now. Everything was very cheap and tasteless. Where are the good italian patisserie or the good cheese and prosciutto???? Itâ€™ s time for a restyling in every single way.
