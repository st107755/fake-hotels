Dear Bauer Hotel staff,  Thank you for making my weekend thee best weekend I have had in a long time. From the point we touched down we were treated with such high priority. Cannot fault this hotel at all. Beautiful rooms/food/service. I don't understand why you are classed as 4.5 stars when it is quite obvious this hotel is 5 star.  Kristina
