I have booked to stay at Bauer hotel, but on arrival was places into a separate external self catering apartment block, with kitchen not functioning. The was no room coffee making facilities, no room service, late difficult check in with not help, understanding whatsoever, unhelpful front desk manager, staff, noise apartment, and average breakfast. The bath taps not working, kitchen taps not working, housekeeping had to be asked at 4.30 to come and clean the rooms. The entrance door was not working and comply to health and safety regulations. We have booked to stay at Bauer hotel in a suite, but the front desk told us that almost all their rooms are located outside the hotel, and there are other buildings located in other island, including sauna/stream facilies was in anotherâ€¦
