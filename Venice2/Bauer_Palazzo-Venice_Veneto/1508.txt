Travelled BA Business as the three day trip was a gift. Excellent cabin service and views of snow capped Alps in October. We arrived in good spirits to be whisked away by water taxi, who sped across the lagoon much to the delight of my teenage daughters.  Were met at the hotel`s private dock by the concierge, and after a brief chat with the manager were shown to our rooms.The wallpaper and furnishings were sumptous, the view out of this world - I spent hours at night gazing from the window...unforgettable.  The bathroom had the largest marble bath I have ever seen, but sadly did not provide bubble bath /oil, despite other luxurious beauty products, perhaps to avoid slipping? It did seem a ploy to discourage use.  The staff were efficient and polite. Had a meal from room serviceâ€¦
