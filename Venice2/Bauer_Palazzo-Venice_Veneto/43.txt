This hotel presumes to be a five star luxe hotel. So, after changing a room from a poor suite we found a nice room. The hotel does not serve the room at evenings, does not refill soap , shampoo or creams. Reception services are poor, answering the phone by concierge is non existent. Restaurant at evening: service of waiters is good, but the kitchen so slow. Prepare to wait an hour for a dish. We had been compensated by tiramisu and petit four. Still , doesnâ€™t worth it.not mentioning the joke they call minestrone. Hoping overloaded Venice can offer better hotels for an outrageous price
