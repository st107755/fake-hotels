Now don't get me wrong the Bauer is a special hotel in a great area. HOWEVER, be aware that it encompasses 3 hotels: The Bauer Palazzo, The Bauer Hotel, and The Bauer Casa Nova. In my experience the star ratings should be 5, 4, 3 - in that order.  We stayed in the Casa Nova and were pretty disappointed with the overall stay. The positive aspects of the stay were: room was spotlessly clean, and maid service excellent - our room was made up in the morning and then again in the evening along with the turn down service. One of our bedside lamp bulbs blew one night and was replaced the next day without us saying a thing - very impressive!  On the down side though the Casa Nova public areas have a stale/musty smell. The room itself has NO view - except for a wall, in fact we were soâ€¦
