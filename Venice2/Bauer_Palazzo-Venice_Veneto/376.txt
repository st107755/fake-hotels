We recently stayed at the Bauer il palazzo in Venice. It is a luxurious hotel and we were very lucky to be upgraded to a deluxe suite, which also gave us access to the executive breakfast area on the 7th floor which had fantastic views of the grand canal. The room was very clean and all the staff we encountered were very helpful. It's location is ideal for exploring the main sites of Venice being only a five minute walk from the boat dock, ST Marks square and about twenty minutes from the Rialto bridge with lots of shops and restaurants in between. I will also say although an expensive option the speed boat back to the airport was amazing.
