By husband and I stayed at the Bauer January 3-6 and loved it.  Great location!    Our room was gorgeous and perfectly put together.  We had a great view of a little canal, too. Upon arriving, the staff was very attentive and so helpful.  Every night, the room was turned down ready from our day out in the city.  Any clothes that were laying around were hung up in the closet and my pajamas were always folded neatly on the bed!  It was great.  The day we left, we had to leave very early in the morning.  The hotel staff had to-go breakfasts for us to eat in the water taxi to the airport!  I would highly recommend the Bauer and would definitely stay there next time we're in Venice.
