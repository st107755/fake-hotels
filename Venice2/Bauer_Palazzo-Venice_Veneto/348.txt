The Bauer has a great location on the Grand Hotel. Loved being able to take a boat right to the lobby. Having breakfast out on the beautiful terrace overlooking the water was awesome. They also have a fabulous rooftop bar for hotel guests only, expensive but worth it. On the other hand, the rooms were dated and not in the condition I would expect at a hotel on that level. The rugs were stained, there were large rust stains on the marble tub and a rip in the bathroom curtain. The public spaces were beautiful but the rooms could use a little TLC.
