We had lunch on the beautiful terrace overlooking the Canale Grande. From the outside, Hotel Bauer is an ugly building - this architectural catastrophe should never have been built. However, the terrace is a small oasis of quietness in the midst of the lively streets of Venice where you can relax after sightseeing and shopping. Staff is friendly although it took them too long to appear (we sat on the bar-side, not the restaurant-side). Prices are relatively high.
