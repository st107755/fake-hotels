i stayed at Bauer for Carnival.  The Hotel itself is ok, nothing to write home about. I think you can find very easily much more better 5stars hotels in Venice.  On Saturady 2nd there was a party at BB, the hotel's lounge bar; police everywhere, people screaming everywhere in the lobby, someone at the door checked who i was after a long queue.  The hotel lobby seemed to be a train station lobby. Is this a 5stars hotel?
