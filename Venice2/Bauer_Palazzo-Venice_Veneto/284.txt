We recently stayed at the hotel and we were not impressed and did not think the hotel was anywhere close to a 5 star hotel.  After reading all of the other comments I might think that I stayed at a totally different hotel!   Everything was mediocre at best- room (dark and dreary) lobby-tired.  The only good part of the hotel was the location-- Sorry, but need to be honest.
