Stayed here for a romantic night and Agoda and Booking.com showed a room with a balcony and view but were given a small room with no balcony or view in another building to the hotel which ruined our stay. There are so many different types of rooms and not all are even in the hotel building so it’s impossible to know what you will get when booking through Agoda or booking.com. The hotel are not interested in assisting as the room was booked through a booking engine, but if the hotel wants you to book direct then why advertise through the other third parties? The hotel should remove their listings on the search engine if they are not interested in having their rooms correctly listed. We only had one night for our first time in Venice and I thought I had booked a really nice room…
