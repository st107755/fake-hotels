My partner and I stayed at the Bauer during our trip to Venice last week and just wow. The hotel is gorgeous with lovely decor and a classic finish and our room was fantastic. We were lucky enough to have a terrace for the room to sit on and enjoy the views over the rooftops and the sunshine! Placed right on the canal it has easy access to everything you might want to see and the staff are incredibly helpful.   In particular Marco our Conceige stood out for me. He was fantastically helpful in organising a few surprises for my girlfriends birthday and helping us arrange our water taxis to and from the surrounding area. Always had a smile and hello for us.  Really can't fault the place...well worth it.
