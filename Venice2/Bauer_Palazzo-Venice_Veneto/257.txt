This was our first time in Venice and after much research we chose the Bauer Palazzo. Great location and so convenient for all of the main attractions. The entrance lobby is spectacularly grand. We booked a superior suite and the room (No 163) on the first floor had an amazing view of the hotel's terrace and canal beyond from 3 large windows. The downside to this is that we occasionally could smell cigarette smoke in our room coming in from outside and although not a major issue now  - in the height of summer with the terrace busy this could be a problem if like us, you are non-smokers.  The room although nice, lacked tea/coffee making facilities and a dressing table and makeup mirror - for my wife this was an issue. The hairdryer had to be plugged in to the shaver point besideâ€¦
