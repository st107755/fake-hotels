If you are looking for a very nice hotel with personal service and a lovely location in front of the Grand Canal and 5 minutes walking from San Marco Square in Venice the Bauer Il Palazzo is the one. There are another Bauer next to the Palazzo that is Bauer L'Hotel. I have been already on both and they both are good but the Palazzo is better, more exclusive and has a different and personal treatment to its guests. It has a wonderful breakfast on the terrace at 7th floor with an amazing view of Venice. The rooms of the Palazzo are all facing the Grand Canal just in front of La Doane and the famous museum of contemporary art founded by Fran√ßois Pinault the french collector.
