Stayed here 24-28/5/14. Excellent location, wonderful staff and service - simply nothing too much to ask for. We had 2x inter-joining rooms that were both very well furnished with modern bathrooms and very good air-conditioning. Bar fridges were well stocked. Room service was almost instant service. The hotel's main restaurant, De Pisis, is excellent in all respects. We will return.
