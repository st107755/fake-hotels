this is my third time at the Bauer Hotel and each time I love it more and more.  This time my wife and I brought our adult children and their other halves with us to celebrate having retired earlier in the year and we were all so pleased with all we enjoyed during this stay.  It was particularly nice that the manager made the time to come and greet us as he had heard that we insist in staying in his hotel each time we now visit Venice.  The staff could not be faulted and the accommodation was exemplary.  To have breakfast overlooking the Grand canal is such a bonus.  The only improvement for me would be the return of smoked salmon upon the breakfast menu, such a good thing to complement eggs.  I look forward to my next visit in a year or two.
