My wife and I have been visiting Venice since 1963 and consider it to be one of the most alluring and enigmatic cities n Europe. Together with my wife on a recent occasion it was our delightful pleasure to stay at the hotel Bauer (Casenove). Our rooms were delightfully and imaginatively dressed. Having spacious bed and ensuite facilities. We could not have wished for better presented quality food for breakfast lunch and evening meal occasions. The views from the Terrace on the Grand canal are quite compelling and run the risk of persuading customers not to retire to bed until the early hours of the morning.  The front of house staff are amongst the most friendly and accommodating we have had the pleasure to meet and in particular we would like to express our gratitude to Carloâ€¦
