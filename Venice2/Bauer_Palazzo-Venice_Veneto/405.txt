Before writing this review I read the last 3 reviews.  As a reader you are trying to get a consensus of opinions. Count me as another Bauer fan.  Yes, this is 5-star hotel and you shall be paying 5-star hotel prices but if it is within your budget go for it.  Excellent location, just minutes from St. Mark Square. Excellent service.  Beautiful property with a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  The standard room is adequate, especially for a European hotel.  Most importantly is that the air conditioning works extremely well during the hot Venice summers.  If you can take a water taxi and get dropped off on the canal and take 2 steps into the hotel.  Very cool.
