This is one of those truly rare places that anticipates your every need. Every touch is carefully thought through to reflect the gracious elegance of Venice. We were there for 10 days and found the service, gorgeous interiors, lovely breakfast buffet, reception personnel; all aspects from top to bottom are exceptional. Bravo to everyone at the Bauer who made our stay a romantic magic carpet ride!
