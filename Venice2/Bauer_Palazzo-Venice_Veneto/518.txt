As others say, you couldn't hope for a better location - 2 mins from St Mark's Square and beautiful views.  No idea why, but we were upgraded from an entry level room to one of their suites.  And it was mindblowing.  Beautiful, huge room.  Balcony with views you could die for.  We didn't eat in the hotel, but the staff we interacted with were absolutely charming.    Thank you, Bauer.  We'll be back.
