My second visit to Bauer Hotel. This stay was better than our previous visit as there appeared to be a big improvement in the staff attitude that made quite a difference. I arranged a surprise long weekend for my husbands birthday and a treat for my brother and his wife who have never been to Venice so I wanted everything to be perfect and special. The Bauer was definitely the best choice. They were amazed and delighted when our private water taxi pulled up alongside the hotel lobby and we all simply stepped out into the hotel. What a great start!  A beautiful, charming and efficient (Spanish) lady on reception accompanied us to our room and made us feel very welcome indeed.  Our Venetian Art Deco rooms were lovely and spacious with great views, beautiful high quality bed linensâ€¦
