We stayed here for a week in November. We had a junior suite that we found spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was excellent. All expected in a hotel that level. What was a wonderful surprise was the fantastic restaurant room: an incredible view onto the grand canal; you feel that the gondolas were passing inches from the windows. The service is efficient and amiable, the food excellent. The lobby service was also very friendly, helpful and never condescending. If you fancy a change, you can also ask for having meal in their other hotel across the laguna, in an old monastery with a beautiful secluded garden. To go there, the hotel private boat will bring you there.  All in all an excellent and relaxing stay.
