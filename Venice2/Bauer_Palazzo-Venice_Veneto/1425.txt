Spent the last 4 days at the Bauer Hotel, Venice. Possibly one of the best hotels ever......excellent location, great breakfast (on the terrace overlooking the Grande canal), lovely friendly helpful staff, good rooms, and gondola's on tap. If you can afford it I would recommend this hotel as a brilliant place to stay.
