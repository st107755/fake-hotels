This hotel is EXPENSIVE, but the location is great, front desk staff and concierge were wonderful, and room was quite large. When we went to the rooftop bar for a drink one evening, however, they wouldn't let me in because of my shoes!! Mind you they were leather wedge-heeled thong sandals, not rubber flip flops. All this attitude at hundreds of euros per night, on a really hot evening.  I probably should have asked for a manager and made an issue, but we just went downstairs for a drink. Caveat emptor.
