I must counter the previous negative comments. I have been going to Venice for 25 years and our experience at the Bauer Il Palazzo was dreamy, romantic, luxurious, and in a word, unforgettable. The rooftop breakfast was simply magnificent, the room, bathroom and view exceeded all expectations, and the staff were extremely welcoming, helpful and friendly. Add to all this an incredibly central location, and for the best of Venice, this place is not to me missed.
