We stayed five nights and the Bauer was all we hoped for.  Only five minutes from the Piazza San Marco, the Bauer offers the traveller to Venice real luxury at an affordable price.  We were located in the Casa Nova complex in a stylish bedroom with its own sitting and dressing rooms.  All within easy access of the hotel's facilities.  The Bauer must also have the best location for breakfast of any Venetian hotel.  We sat overlooking the entrance to the Gand Canal with fantastic views of San Giorgio Maggiore and Santa Maria della Salute.  This hotel is a real find and one that we will return to soon.
