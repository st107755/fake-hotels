This is a a five-star hotel in rating and delivery. It is perfectly located on the Grand Canal with a breakfast/dining terrace right on the edge of the canal. Its a very romantic setting that deliver the peculiar Venetian experience of boats and Gondolas, complete with tenors and guitars. We had a suite that was beautifully and tastefully presented, in keeping with the rest of the hotel. It was a five-minute walk, at most, to St Mark's Square (and 30 seconds or so the Venice's most expensive shops). It's expensive but delivers on its promises while still feeling very much like Old Venice. The service was excellent -- discreet but extremely efficient. We loved it and would stay there again in a heartbeat.
