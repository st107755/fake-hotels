We stayed here one yr ago and had such an unpleasant experience it adversely colored all of Venice for me. Problem: entrenched, unpleasant middle aged men who staff the front desk. The worst one wore the special Secret Order of Concierge pins on his lapels and should've been a pro. We were treated with contempt over and over. They need to get some pleasant women working the front desk -of course female gender is no guarantee as the frauleins at the breakfast buffet were dour as all get out. Nasty grouch threw my map to the side when I asked for directions- he was too busy reading his newspaper to give any help! Liked: location, fabulous breakfast buffet (incl in our room rate), our second rooms (the first were microscopic), bathrooms, bed linens. Also liked the younger 30ish menâ€¦
