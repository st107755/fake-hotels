My wife and I spent three nights at Bauer Hotel last month, and it was a wonderful experience.  Everything from check-in to check-out was "5 Star."  We arrived at the front doors of the Bauer via private water taxi...very cool...were accompanied to our beautifully appointed balcony room by the concierge...and everything was just right.  We had planned and anticipated this trip for a long time.  Venice and the Bauer Hotel delivered!
