We stayed at the Bauer for 2 nights following a Med. cruise.   Arriving from the ship by water taxi was a real novelty, and the luggage followed from the ship soon afterwards.   The room was well appointed, spacious and quiet.  Breakfast is a real treat here, as other reviewers have mentioned, as you can watch the busyness of the river whilst enjoying a leisurely meal.   St Mark's Square is only minutes away as well as an abundance of restaurants.  Also the vaporetti station is just 2 minutes away.   So a great location to base yourself and to see Venice from.
