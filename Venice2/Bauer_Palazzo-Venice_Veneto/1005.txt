My wife and I are experienced travellers to Venice and dined several times at The Bayer.  We booked the hotel for two days prior to a cruise. We really enjoyed the experience.The room was adequate in size and heavy on Venitian style. Service  was very good,particularly the concierge  service  but the real bonus is the location.To have breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal was wonderful.To be be so close to St Mark's Square was also a real bonus.
