From the moment that we checked in, our experience at the Bauer could not have been better. The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Our room was perfect - we had a second floor Superior Suite which had a view over the patio to the canal - amazing! We traveled with our daughter and an extra bed was set up for her when we arrived. One piece of luggage hadn't made our flight connection ... The concierge tracked it down and delivered it to our room later that night. Breakfast each morning was perfect - great selection, served on the patio facing the canal. The hotel location was amazing ... Close to everything. We were welcomed by name whenever we entered the lobby. The concierge had terrific suggestions and took wonderful care of us. I don't think I would want to stay anywhereâ€¦
