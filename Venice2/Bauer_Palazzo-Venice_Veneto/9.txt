We spent two evenings at Bauer this summer. We found excellent service at the bar, thank you Alessandro, Niky, Giorgio, for your gracious treatment. And the last evening we had dinner the staff made sure we had a super nice table for our family.  Sergio, Matia and Eric made our evening very, very nice. And the dishes that were served were absolutely excellent. An evening to remember for a very long time. It was our second visit to Bauer and we will certainly come back.
