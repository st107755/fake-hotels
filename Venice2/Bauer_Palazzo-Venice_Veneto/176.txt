I have had the opportunity to stay at many fine hotels around the world. We expect high standards of cleanliness,service  and appointments .But in my experience what differentiates one ‘ many starred hotel ’ from another is the Concierge Desk. At the Bauer Hotel, Roberto Manca is a prime example of professionalism, knowledge of Venice, restaurants and special cultural attractions. He is an adult who is proud of the Bauer and delighted to be of service to its guests.
