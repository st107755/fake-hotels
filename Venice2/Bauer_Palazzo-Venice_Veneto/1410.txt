If you are planning to stay definitively ask for the room with terrace- the view on the St.Moise square, canal with gondolas, the Church and  Campanilla is shortly wonderful, after the walking, sightseeing day and before dinner is so nice to have a glass of prosecco there. Also the breakfast area outside at the canal invites to stay longer and to enjoy the moments. I recommend the hotel more than 100%
