I joined LHW before I went on my recent trip and was treated like royalty at this hotel, and the others from the same listing. My room was absolutely beautiful, with a terrace. This hotel is directly on the Grand Canal with a dock for the water taxi to drop you right there. It's so close to Piazza San Marco and getting around to the other sights.  I would definitely stay here again.
