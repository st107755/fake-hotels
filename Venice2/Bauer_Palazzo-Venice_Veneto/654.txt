Most recommended for a vacation in Venice. The breakfast was great, and the staff made us feel very velcome. The hotell have a very good restaurant, that lives up to The standard of a 5 star hotel. The rom was spaicius and beautiful decorated. There is a rooftop terrace to be enjoyed, perfect ending to a great day out in beautiful Venice
