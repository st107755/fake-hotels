Beautifully done hotel in the old sumptuous Venetian style. Great service, and the most astonishing rooftop restaurant to have breakfast in EVER.  The location is so amazing-- around the corner from everything important.  And again, the service-- wonderful.  We checked into our room, and five minutes later we realized that we were next door to two screaming children-- we called and another from was found-- even better.  It's big and sprawling-- which can sometimes give you the feeling of The Shining as you walk down the hallways:) but we absolutely loved it-- would go back in a heartbeat.
