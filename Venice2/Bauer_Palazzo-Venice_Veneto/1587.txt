The Bauer is ideally situated, just two minutes walk from San Marco. I suggest taking the 20 minute water taxi from the airport, direct to the hotel's canal entrance, just off the Grand Canal (approx 120 Euro). Rooms are clean and elegant, mine was 3rd floor above the canal entrace - a source of great entertainment! The patio is a great place to enjoy a cocktail early evening. The terrace restaurant over the water is wondeful for breakfast. Most importantly, my room was efficiently air conditioned, ideal for escaping the blistering aftrnoon temperatures. A return trip is planned. Sorry about the pool rating... there is no pool, but guests have access to the sister hotel spa. Pricey, but great.
