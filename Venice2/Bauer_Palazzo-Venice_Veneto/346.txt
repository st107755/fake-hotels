The turn of the century elegance of the Bauer is around every corner you walk.  The lobby and restaurant are beautifully decorated, and the rooms are wonderfully designed with expertly crafted moldings, furniture, and wall coverings.  The restaurant was also delicious, and the location was perfect.  Our biggest issue with the Bauer was the electronic dance party which started at 10:30 PM and went on until 5-6 AM (or until dawn).  The music was awfully loud to the extent that the bass rattled the beds.  This made it nearly impossible to sleep in the rooms that we had booked on the third floor.  We received a note with a few sets of earplugs during out stay which apologized for the "party" that was planned to occur both nights of our stay, on account of the Venice film festival. â€¦
