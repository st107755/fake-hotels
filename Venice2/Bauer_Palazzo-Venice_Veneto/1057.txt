The staff was more than helpful. They all spoke English and we're very approachable. We took a water taxi to the hotel from the train station: easy. The hotel is located about 2 minutes walking from St. Marks square and is in the heart of a beautiful shopping area. I recommend their complementary breakfast 100%. It has amazing food that range from American to italian, and best yet, it's a buffet so you can go back for more. The rooms are spacious and come stocked with full amenities. The style is authentic italian, slightly modernized. After our trip in Venice, we needed to get over to Rome, and the concierge set everything up for us: train tickets, maps, taxi, everything. Overall, the Bauer Hotel was an excellent experience, I have no complaints.
