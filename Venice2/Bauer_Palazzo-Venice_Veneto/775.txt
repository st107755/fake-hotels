the hotel was excellent,the staff were so nice and very helpful.It was my wife's 65th birthday and there was a complimentary bottle of presseco waiting for her from the manager.That was very nice of him,so thanks for the added bonus making our first trip to venice so memorable.My wife and I had a great timetThe hotel is very close to the Sans Marco square and to be fair it's pretty handy for every where in Venice.If you have the chance to go to the music opera  do go it's excellent.
