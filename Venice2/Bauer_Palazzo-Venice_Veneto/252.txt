This hotel is excellent. The whole ambience is luxury. The decor the staff and the dining terrace make this something special. This high class hotel has a lovely family feel. The food is stunning. Visiting Venice try this hotel. The Sister hotel the Palazzo across the water is a world apart. Lunch in the garden was peaceful and the staff there were as welcoming and the food as good.
