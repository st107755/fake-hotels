We stayed here with our family and got two rooms.  One deluxe and one superior- after seeing both rooms I have to say that I really didn't see the justification of the higher price.  The "canal" view was basically a view of a brick wall as we were on the 3rd floor right across from another tall building and you would have to stand right next to the window and try to look down to see a canal.  The other room which was less expensive had an inner courtyard view which was nothing to look at either.  There was a tad more room in the superior and a little more of a decorative element but overall I would say if you don't get the front stunning view or the open side view there really isn't much difference in those two room categories.  The breakfast was nice and the lobby is beautiful.â€¦
