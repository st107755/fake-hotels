This is a high quality hotel. It is a large hotel so the boutique service provided at smaller hotels is not evident. I enjoyed our 4 nights at this hotel. The breakfasts are good. There are many people at breakfast time and I think there is room for improvement to ensure a high class service is provided. Perhaps the breakfast buffet should be spread over more tables so that less people are concentrated in a small area. It is clean and well serviced. Loved Venice and the location of this hotel is superb!
