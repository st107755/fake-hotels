Our family of three spent five nights here in late March 2004 and loved the Bauer! The room was fresh and elegant, the location central, the front desk staff really nice and helpful. We took a water taxi back to the airport - and the launch location was right off the lobby. Can't wait to return, both to Venice and the Hotel Bauer!
