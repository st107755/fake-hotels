First visit and loved it. Water & boats a pleasant change from bikes & vehicles. Food & drink great and not as pricey as we thought apart from the biggest rip off ever at Harry's Bar. Ludicrous prices 16 € + 10% vat for a Bellini that tasted nothing special in a place tha resembled the front room of a working men's club save for waiters in white coats. We must have been mad to pay 67€ for 4 drinks. Leave it to the rich yanks that frequent the place. Hotel Bauer absolutely fab great location.
