We loved the view and terrace of our room though I did find the room needed an update.   Carpets were old and worn.  The sheets were scratchy, not five star hotel quality.   The service was great.  The concierge phoned the concierge at our hotel in Milan in advance and informed them that when they were to recommend a restaurant, my kids didn't like fish.  Now that's service.
