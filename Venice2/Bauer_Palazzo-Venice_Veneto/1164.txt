We stayed one night in FEB  2014 in this hotel,when we checked in it was in Bauer  HOTEL,but to our surprise the bellman brought us to a different building which is CASANOVA HOTEL,when i booked it in Hotwire it was written in my confirmation letter that i booked the BAUER HOTEL (5 STAR HOTEL)NOT  THE CASANOVA HOTEL,I complained to them about it but they are not so accommodating.My advice stay away from this hotel.
