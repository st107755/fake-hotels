Next to St Marks square and in the heart of the part of Venice to stay in. Overlooking the Grand Canal with its own boat dock and a fantastic viewing deck on the roof. If you can upgrade to a room the gives you access to the executive suite and the complementary food and drink with fabulous views. We stayed 4 nights and still not enough time.
