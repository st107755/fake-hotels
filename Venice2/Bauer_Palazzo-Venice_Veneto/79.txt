a perfect hotel in a perfect city... it's hard to believe venice is real when you get there.. everyone at Bauer was friendly and welcoming.. i had the best sleep here of our trip, it was cool and quiet and we pulled the shades tight in our room... breakfast was a real treat, trying all the breads and drinking coffee, overlooking the water... location can't be beat... thank you for the hospitality! we hope to see you again! hugs from D.C.
