This is the kind of place you go to treat yourself on your birthday, like I did. It's impeccable, elegant, and great service. Our room was stunning with a splendid view of the Canal. Their breakfast was served at the terrace and it has a breathtaking view. This was my second time in Venice and the first time I stayed in Lido island so the next time I have to stay in a place that would be as interesting as this great hotel or maybe more. I would let you know.
