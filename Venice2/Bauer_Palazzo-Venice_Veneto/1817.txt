We left the Danieli and went over to the Bauer!! What a total delight! The Danieli should be visited just for a drink in the lobby -- but not to stay!! On the other hand the Bauer was excellent. Superb service. Friendly staff. Great location and an awesome breakfast!! And the rooms are gorgeous and very clean with great views!!  Can't say enough good things about this Hotel. Extremely pleased!!
