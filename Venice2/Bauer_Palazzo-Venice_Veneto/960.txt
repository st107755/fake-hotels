I stayed at the Bauer hotel for work . The structure -even if it's an eyesore in the heart of Venice- it is wide, clean , central . But the services are very bad . Starting with the reception where rude people work and distracted . My experience was very bad . And the price definitely exaggerated since the mid facilities are of equal quality but at least polite people that make the stay pleasant .
