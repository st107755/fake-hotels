Our first visit to the Bauer was enhanced by an unexpected early check in facility which was most welcome. Occasionally, one does rather get the impression that hotels, even five star hotels, delay check in/ are stingy about late check out unnecessarily. There was no fuss here - an early check in and a suite upgrade were offered courteously and without fuss.   This is a traditional Venetian hotel but comfortable and well appointed. The corridors remind me of a hospital or other institution but an excess of marble can do that. Our suite overlooking the Grand Canal was a little noisy but this is to be expected from weekend waterway travellers carousing in the early hours. It was not the fault of the hotel.  The staff are truly charming. Italians do charm so well - not obsequious-â€¦
