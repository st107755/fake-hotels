We stayed here for our one year wedding anniversary in May 2013. We arrived here in the late evening after catching a flight from Rome. We booked a private water taxi, which didn't drop us directly outside the water entrance (we don't know why the taxi did this) as a result we had to walk around with our luggage bags up and down the cobbly alleys. When we eventually made it to the hotel (looking very tired) we felt some animosity from the Reception Staff. We had the impression she felt we were at the wrong hotel! As a result we did not feel comfortable during our stay and would not stay here again. The rooms are also very small as are the bathrooms.
