I stayed at this hotel the night before a cruise.  When I checked in I was given a very large room with a huge terrace overlooking the canal and square.  My room had glass doors and a wall of windows overlooking the terrace and view.  The hotel had free wifi which was very fast.  The bathroom was large with many amenities I expect in a five-star hotel.  Room service was prompt and correct.  A large breakfast buffet was served and diners could sit either outside overlooking the canal or inside in a beautiful dining room.  The concierge and staff were helpful and friendly. Of course everyone spoke perfect English. The bed was comfortable and the room temperature was very cool despite the heat wave Venice was suffering at the time (mid-July). The location was perfect - an easy walkâ€¦
