The hotel is in an excellent location, a 3 minute walk to San Marco square and close to water transport links. The room was spotless and the buffet breakfast was a high standard. The hotel sent a birthday cake to our room, which was a really nice touch. The view of the Grand Canal from the patio is amazing!
