We visited the Bauers for our wedding anniversary last year and what a hotel from everything from the front desk staff to when you check out it is truly outstanding. The breakfast us fantastic and to sit in the terrace and watch the gondoliers go by is the icing on the cake. We will be returning again and can't wait for our anniversary in March for our return visit.
