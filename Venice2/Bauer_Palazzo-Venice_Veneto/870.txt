Traveling with our family to two days over New Years in Venice we stayed at the Bauer. In a city with a many superlatives the Bauer is certainly one of them. The location is a short walk to St Marks square and in the historic center of Venice, it is surrounded by outstanding shopping and amenities. The staff and in particular the Concierge team were great at arranging tours, reservations and exceptionally helpful. The staff were very friendly. The rooms vary in decor but are well appointed perhaps slightly dated. Regardless the rooms were well appointed and clean. Out particular rooms had spectacular views of Venice and St. Marks. Breakfast was included in our deal and it was typical european breakfast--food quality and staff were very good. I was very impressed with the hotelâ€¦
