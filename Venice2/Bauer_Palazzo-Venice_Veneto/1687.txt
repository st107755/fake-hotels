Can there be a better way of getting to your hotel thaan a water taxi down the canals to the side entrance and a warm welcome? The Bauer has some quirks, but the family run feel is there and the concierge was very helpful. Our rooms had no view - but please make sure you have a breakfast inclusive rate becuase it was lovely, but not oly that has to have one of the great views of any breakfast spot in the world.
