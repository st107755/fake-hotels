After a perfect luxury cruise trip we extended / finished our vacation with a visit at the Hotel Bauer in Venice. While the Hilton Molino Stucky was away from the hustle (which we wanted for the start off), we now purposely chose this place right in the center. The hotel is overlooking Campo San Moisè and is only 3 minutes from St. Mark’s Square and had a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal where breakfast was served. The Alilaguna ferry is only a very short walk away from the hotel, and only one small bridge needed to be crossed over which makes it very easy for suitcase transportation. Or if more comfort wanted, the hotel had its very own ferry station for water taxis to dock on. We were fortunate to get a double room with a big terrace overlooking San Moisè that was very nice…
