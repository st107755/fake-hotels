This hotel was recommended to us from a coworker who I should bring a bottle of wine back for as a thank you. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is incredibly friendly. The rooms are very nice. We didn’t have a view of the main canal but did have one of the small canal next to the hotel. It was nice waking up in the morning and watching the gondoliers get ready for the day. On Friday and Saturday nights they have live jazz music in their bar. We didn’t get a chance to check it out but it sounded great from the lobby and the bar was full of guests, so I’m guessing it was fun. Breakfast was included and the food was very good (is it possible to have a bad meal in Italy)? I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to travel to Venice.
