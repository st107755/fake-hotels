This hotel is in the best location, 2 min walk from St Marks Square. Beautiful hotel, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and very spacious.  Concierge - Carlos was so helpful, he explained all the sights and attractions, drew us a map and gave us a lot of information.  We had breakfast included which was served from 07.30 - 10.30. Good choice of cereal, bread, cakes, fruit, hot food etc.. Service is great always so efficient.   WiFi was complimentary  The bar at the back of the hotel is great to sit out in the sun over the canal and watch the boats. Expensive for a drink though, I had a Cocktail and it was EUR17! As it was such a nice location I didn't mind paying for one drink! Great picture opp.  The only complaint really is that the hotel does notâ€¦
