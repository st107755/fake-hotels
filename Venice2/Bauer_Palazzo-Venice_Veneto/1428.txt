Wonderful hotel. Expensive and worth every penny. Great service from all staff. Wonderful breakfast with excellent service and incredible views and ambiance, sitting on the Grand Canal.  The hotel is an easy walk or taxi ride everywhere. If you want your clothes ironed, bring your own travel iron or steamer. The hotel does not provide for them in bedrooms and insists that pressing must be done through the valet.
