My husband and I stayed 5 days at Bauer Hotel. The room was neat and spacious. The staff were kind and polite. Concierges always gave helpful answers to our questions. (We are Japanese, so I think it was hard to understand our English.)Our days began with a delicious morning buffet. They ended in our gorgeous bathroom, where the water in shower flowed with delightful force. It was very comfortable for our tired bodies after a long day walking around Venice.
