This hotel really lived up to its rich reputation. We had high expectations that were actually exceeded! Dominique checked us in and settled us into our room. She made us feel at home right away after a VERY long trip and even had some "locals" recommendations for us. She and the rest of the service desk staff were simply OUTSTANDING. (I must say I was a bit disappointed in the concierge staff. They were not very friendly and had NO sense of humor.) Bauer offers so many great amenities. It has a gorgeous and plush interior and the rooms are modern, yet they have an "antique" ambiance. This is a 1901 vintage building that has been renovated to extreme beauty. They are literally just a few steps from San Marco Square and many other sites including the beautiful, historic La Feniceâ€¦
