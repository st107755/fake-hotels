My husband and I just returned from a weekend at the Bauer Hotel. The location could not have been better and the staff was attentive and extremely pleasant. We had a deluxe room which was just off the Grand Canal. It was pleasantly decorated with 20 ft ceilings and met all of our needs. The only issue you might want to be aware of if requesting a room on/near the canal, is that it can get pretty noisy as the hotel’s water entrance is below as well as a gondola boarding station.  As for dining, we had a lunch and a dinner at De Pisis and the views and food were exceptional.  The hotel is very expensive, but location, exceptional food and courteous staff make it worth the £££££’s!
