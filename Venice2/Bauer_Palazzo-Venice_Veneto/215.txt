Our water taxi was greeted with a glass of champagne and we were ushered into the charming historic foyer of the Palazzo. There are two sections of the hotel. One section is newer with rooms in the tower and the other is the original historic section with more unique and large rooms. We were in the older section which is absolutely charming! There is a wonderful restaurant right on the Grand Canal and there is a rooftop restaurant which is used for the breakfast area. I believe that the rooftop breakfast area is only accessible for those staying in the Original part of the hotel but I could be mistaken. The hotel is only a five minute walk to St. Marks Square and there are many wonderful shops and restaurants very close by. I would highly recommend the accommodations, serviceâ€¦
