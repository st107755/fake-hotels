Bauer is a beautiful hotel in a great location close to San Marco.  The service was excellent and the rooms spacious with a large bathroom. The only problem was that our room overlooked some kind of service atrium, so there was no external view at all - a pity in such a beautiful city! Other rooms were available at a price, and we'd definitely upgrade if we were to visit again.  The rooftop bar is stunning and well worth a visit - beware though, it's expensive, even by Venice standards! Some beers were almost €30! A bottle of (good!) wine however is only €40, and is nice to enjoy with stunning views of the lagoon and Grand Canal.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend the Bauer, and would certainly choose it again if we were to return to Venice.
