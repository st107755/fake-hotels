Stayed at this wonderful location for just one night prior to joining a cruise. The welcome on arriving by water taxi  was really special and from check-in to departure one could not ask for more. Enjoyed a light lunch served in the bar area followed by an excellent dinner in the restaurant during the evening. The members of the restaurant team were friendly and very efficient and it made for a great pre-cruise evening watching the sun set over the Grand Canal. Breakfast was a sight to behold. If you couldn't find exactly what you wanted your eating style was unusual. A fantastic selection with the option to enjoy the food while sitting at table on the terrace.  We would recommend this hotel without hesitation and with luck we hope to have the pleasure to return one day. Thankâ€¦
