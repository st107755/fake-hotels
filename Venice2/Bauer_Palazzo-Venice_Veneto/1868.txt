What a wonderful hotel.  We found Venice to be just as magical as we hoped and this hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in.  Its great location means that you can go out and explore and pop back to drop things off without losing any time.  The staff were excellent and gave us some good tips on gondola bartering!  Relaxing having breakfast looking out onto the water and seeing the first lots of gondolas coming past was lovely. Whilst we found Venice and Bauer to be first class we did get the feeling that we would not be back because you sometimes cannot recreate such a special time - but you never know.
