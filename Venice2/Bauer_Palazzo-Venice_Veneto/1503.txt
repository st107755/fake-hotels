I have just returned from a visit to Venice and booked the Bauer ll Palazzo, which is a great place to stay. We arrived by private water taxi from Venice Marco Polo Airport (15 minute transfer), which stops right outside the hotel entrance and stayed in a Canal Room with a great view over the lagoon and St Marks Square. The room had a comfortable bedroom and separate living room. The bathroom was in Italian marble with Jacuzzi tub, and separate shower and exclusive toiletries by Santa Maria degli Angeli We had breakfast at 'Settimo Cielo' on the 7th-floor lounge, which serves a great breakfast and has a spectacular terrace with brilliant views of the city and lagoon." The hotel is a 2 minute walk from St Marks Square and about 10 minutes from the Rialto Bridge. I would recommendâ€¦
