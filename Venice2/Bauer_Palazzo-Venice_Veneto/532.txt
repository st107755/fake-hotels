We stayed two nights for New Years eve and New Years Day.  Well located on Grand Canal and next to S, Marco square. Our room was in the apartments next door to the main hotel - which was not a problem being so close by.  There are two breakfast rooms, the room closest to the grand canal side seemed to be better. The bar was convenient for pre-dinner drinks and also food - which was of good standard.
