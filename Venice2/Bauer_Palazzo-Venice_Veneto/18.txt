We stayed for two nights during Carnevale. The staff was amazing, the room was beautiful. We booked a superior room with the romance package and breakfast which was well worth the money. The breakfast is absolutely amazing, the hot tub is on the roof and it provided an amazing view of the city. Absolutely a wonderful stay and I would definitely come back. My husband and I loved it!
