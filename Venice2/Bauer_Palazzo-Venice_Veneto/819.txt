Stayed here mid March and I cannot fault the hotel. Our room was lovely and well looked after by the staff. Yes you do not always get a view but we did come here to  spend time in the room. Breakfast was great and the coffee wonderful - It was so nice to have hot milk with it. You could eat as little or as much as you felt like and the staff were very attentive without being over bearing. The concierge and reception were again very helpful and cheerful. The outside area was lovely to sit in and relax, a great place to watch people going about their business on the canal.   The water taxis and buses were within a very short walk and we would certainly use this hotel if we came back.
