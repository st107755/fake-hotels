BAUER IS FOR SURE THE BEST HOTEL IN VENICE  ! I had visited  Venice for many times in the past. The Bauer Palazzo an the Bauer are certainly the best ones. Best staff  Best Breakfast  Very clean  Great location  I just came back from there , we made a vacation to all my office managment .  we  were 16 people in the weekend vacation, everyone gloried the Bauer. We will come soon again , for sure ! Thanks to anyone of the staff, special thanks to Elena - you are the best !!
