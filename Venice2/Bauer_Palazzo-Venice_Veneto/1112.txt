My husband and I booked this hotel through an online booking website & we were so excited because the pictures were beautiful & we thought we were getting a great deal. WRONG!!! we checked into the hotel and the location and lobby were stunning. But that's as good as it gets!!! We were told that we were not booked for the Bauer hotel but for the Casa Nova Bauer which apparently is there crappy part of their hotel that they don't tell you about anywhere!!! It is a separate building around the corner and it's horrible. You walk in & there is no security & no one to greet you. Horrible interior too. The bell man walks you to your room after squeezing into a small elevator and the room is horrible. 3 stars at most!! Though I've stayed at nicer 3 stars. We went to the front desk &â€¦
