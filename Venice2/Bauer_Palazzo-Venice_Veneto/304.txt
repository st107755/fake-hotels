After a cruise, we stayed here for 5 nights.  The room was lovely, but the view from our room (223) was terrible.  We faced a window & a wall of the building next door.  The room was large, clean, comfortable, & nicely furnished.  The staff was always pleasant & helpful.  The breakfast buffet was very good.  I don’t think the location could have been better.  As nice & comfortable as the Bauer is, I found it a bit pretentious.  We have stayed at other hotels in Venice that maybe were not quite as “top shelf” but were very comfortable.  If you are looking for a 5 star hotel with a 5 star price, the Bauer is the place for you.  I am just more comfortable in a slightly lesser hotel.
