Been at the Bauer last year. It was a fantastic time for my partner and I. We dined in the hotel and had them testing menu with wine, every single course was out of this world. Very surprise how comes the chef hasn't got a Michelin star!!! The standard of the food is well above to other Michelin starred restaurant I've been to. Grazie for everything
