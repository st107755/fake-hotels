Never having been in Venice I really wanted to experience it in the best way.  The Il Palazzo was a fabulous location, close to the Square but not bothered by the noise and congestion; a short walk to great restaurants and designer shops; a beautiful suite and rooftop location for breakfast as well as a very nice in house dinner restaurant.  The water taxis and gondolas stop right next to the hotel if you want to go elsewhere.  And, they have fabulous concierge services that are knowledgeable and eager to help.  There might be more glamorous hotels, but none have all these qualities.  I would go back if I am blessed to return to this beautiful city.
