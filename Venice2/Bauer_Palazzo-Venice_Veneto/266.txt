We stayed at the Bauer Plazzo for 3 nights over the half term break. We decided to stay there as we wanted somewhere close to everything but we were looking for luxury. The hotel delivered on all of it's promises. We checked in after getting a private water taxi (expensive but well worth it) that delivered us to the private entrance at the hotel. From the miunte we landed we recieved nothing but the best service. The reception staff were lovely and really helpful. We booked in and were shown to our room. We had booked a superior suite and our only slight issue was that the one that we were shown to, although lovely, wasn't quite what we expected. I wandered down to reception and we were shown to another room without any issue at all. The suite was beautiful. Luxurious fixtures,â€¦
