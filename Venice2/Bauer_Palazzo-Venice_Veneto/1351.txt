I booked the Bauer after reading all of the great reviews, but honestly don't see why it gets so many great reviews. From the outside it looks like a newer property, and I paid extra to get a room the higher-end side of the property. The room itself was comparable to a standard room in many older hotels, including the age of the furniture and wear on the carpet. Still, I cant call it a bad room, just not what I thought I was going to get. The breakfast buffet itself was disappointing, but provides a very nice view. If you care more about location and view than the hotel itself, this should be a fine place to stay. If you want a nice room and luxurious hotel, you might want to keep looking. Overall, I would call it slightly above average.
