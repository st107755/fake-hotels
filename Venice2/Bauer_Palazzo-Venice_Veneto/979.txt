I decided to stay here for my birthday and it was the best choice I ever made.  the staff were professional friendly helpful smart and genuinely seemed happy. The room was lovely and nice size and lovely balcony off from the main room.  Breakfast was enjoyable and quite and great views of the canal and St Marks. The location of the hotel was excellent and perfect to get to everything in Venice.   Caution concerning birds at breakfast but don't worry the staff will entertain you while they scare of these feathered friends.  my overall view was luxury with a warm welcome
