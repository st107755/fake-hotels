We first visited the Bauer hotel 25 years ago and it left an indellible memory in our minds. This time we booked a room on the Grand Canal side. On arriving we were concerned as the entrance was not the same as we remembered but then we discovered that the Bauer had bought the hotel behind it which was where we stayed. Our room was glorious, luxurious, opulent, clean and had the most fantastic view of the Grand Canal. It was amazing. I think that rooms ending in 08 & 09 on each floor have the great view. The staff were extremerly pleasant, polite and very helpful. Breakfast on the 7th floor Terrace is fantastic. Besides the lovely food, the Panoramic view of the City is unbelievable. It is also very close to St Marks Square which is handy. We only had one meal there, lunch oneâ€¦
