We stayed at the Bauer Casa Nova for a week or so at the beginning of October.  I booked a holiday package via an airline and was offered a booking at "The Bauer Hotel" where the room was described as "Casa Nova - Continental Plan".  I briefly checked-out the Bauer online to read a few reviews and to find out where it was located.  Everything looked fine, so I booked the package that I'd been offered.  We had a great time in Venice, and the hotel was absolutely fine - I would be happy to stay there again.  However, it turned out that our room was in what is effectively a different building just round the corner from The Bauer Hotel.  This didn't bother us at all, but I can understand why some people might be disappointed if they first read all about The Bauer, make a booking onâ€¦
