My husband and I stayed at the Bauer a little over a week ago.  We both felt that the location was excellent.  Very central and easy to catch a vaporetto. The lobby was classy. The staff was very courteous and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was included in the price and was quite good with a large selection of pastries, meats, cheeses, and fruit.  Yes, the eggs were gooey, but they seemed to be this way wherever we went.  We had a lovely marble bathroom with great smelling soaps, etc.  My only complaint was that the carpet and bedding looked worn and dated.  This fact keeps me from giving the hotel five stars.  We would probably stay here again because of the location.
