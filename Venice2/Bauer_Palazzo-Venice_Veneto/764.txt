We arrived at 10:00 am and the hotel was more than accommodating by checking us in early into a suite located on the top floor.  The room (750) has a terrace with two full size lounge chairs that gives you a view of the Central Canal and the Santa Maria Della Salute Basilica.  To top it off, we were allowed access to the private rooftop terrace that serves complimentary snacks, champagne and cakes.  The bed was very comfortable and created a retreat that we really didn't feel inclined to leave.  Took the hotels private boat across to its sister property to check out the garden and spa.  Well worth the time. You will be amazed by the tranquility of the spot.
