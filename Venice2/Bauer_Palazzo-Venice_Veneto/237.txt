After researching hotels in Venice I booked Bauer Palazzo hotel which is situated on the grand canal. This hotel’s location is fabulous. You are a 5 min walk from St Mark’s Square.  The water bus stations are also a 5 min walk,  and the hotel has a water taxi service any time you require a taxi. If you walk out of the main entrance you arrive on a road filled with designer shops.  The hotel rooms are clean and a good size with the bathrooms also a good size. We had 3 rooms, 562-564. Located on the 5th floor. The views from these however look onto other rooms within a very close gap in between. The facilities in the rooms are basic. The TV’s do have one English Channel and one American channel and unfortunately reception on these are grim. We would have loved tea/coffee…
