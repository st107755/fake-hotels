The Bauer was fabulous. Room large, ultra clean, very comfortable and beautifully decorated. Bathroom also lovely with separate shower and jacuzzi bath. Buffet breakfast excellent, tables on roof terrace with great views overlooking canal (however don't leave your food unguarded if you go in for something extra or the seagulls or pigeons will have it!). Waiting staff very attentive and friendly. Hotel in perfect central location and very close to San Marco water-bus stop and San Marco itself. Photos are view of hotel from canal and view of canal from breakfast terrace.
