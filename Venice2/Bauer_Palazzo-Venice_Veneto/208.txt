We spent a couple of days in Venice recently and stayed in the Bauer Palazzo.  It helped make our stay that much more enjoyable.  It's location is ideal and very central.  The best memory I have is the outdoor terrace for breakfast occupying a corner position with the Canal Grande on one side and a smaller canal on the other.  Dinner was superb and the table we had at the front of the external dining area must be a contender for the best table in Venice!  I'll be going again!
