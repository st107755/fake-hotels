The location of this hotel was nice (next to San Marco Square) and the breakfast buffet was good and that's the only good thing I have to say. Besides that, the rooms were very eerie with barely any lights. The staffs here are very lazy with no personality and expect to wait for 30 minutes for a bucket of ice delivered to you from room service. The furnitures are extremely old and you need a physical key to get into your room. The hotel is extremely big but has very few guests. Over half of the hotel was empty in mid July! We got lost trying to find our room because there were very few signs. They put us in a dark room all the way at the back of the 2nd floor facing the roof of another empty building when they have over 50% of the hotel empty. My kids were wanting to go homeâ€¦
