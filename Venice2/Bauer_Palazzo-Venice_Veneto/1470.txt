This small, boutique hotel has the feel of an old manor house and is beautifully decorated in the old Venician style.  The entrance is directly off the Grand Canal and the water taxi ride was breathtaking from the airport.  We got an upgrade on our room and could not have been happier with our suite.  It had a modern bathroom and was very clean all round with a friendly and helpful staff.  The breakfast was included and very good with one of the best views of Venice that we encountered.  I would recommend the Bauer Palazzo and would definitely stay there again.
