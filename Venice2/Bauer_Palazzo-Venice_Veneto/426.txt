It took me forever to book a hotel in Venice... there was just so many amazing offers during the week I was there. After reading the reviews of the Bauer I decided to book. Best decision. The hotel is perfectly situated, near the Piazza San Marco and near a vaporetta, and if needed a gondola stop.A Leading Hotels of the World, it lives up to that. We were on the 4th floor, super quiet with views of the Moise Church. Stunning. It's on a fab street full of designer shops, if thats your thing. The staff were professional and friendly always. And yes, beautiful terrace where breakfast is served. Had dinner there first night, and it was satisfying with beautiful views and food. Our room was spacious and all comfortable, modern bathrooms, and like all Italian  hotels, VERY CLEAN!â€¦
