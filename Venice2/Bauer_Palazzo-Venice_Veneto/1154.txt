We visited Venice in late November with my family for my twin & is' 21st birthday celebrations. Upon arrival we expected a welcome drink (this is appears to be normal for most other guests) however we did not receive this.   I do realise that most hotel rooms in Venice are decorated in a unique way however for a 5 star hotel I believe that the rooms could have been much more opulent. The bed linens were rather starchy/rough which is not what you expect when staying in a luxury hotel.  Breakfast was rather nice but not nearly as good as expected from previous guests reviews. All food is served on small side plates which i found particularly unusual. The view from the breakfast terrace was wonderful.   In terms of the hotels location it was outstanding. I would highly recommendâ€¦
