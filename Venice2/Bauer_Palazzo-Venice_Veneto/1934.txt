My partner and I stayed here for five days in July and had a wonderful time. Most of the time everything worked like clockwork which is a real feat for a hotel working at full capacity. This even worked down to the chamber maids being told when we went out automatically so we were never bothered by them barging into our room early in the morning. The suite couldn't be faulted although our request for a DVD player went unanswered. There really should be one in every room anyway. Our only real problem with this hotel is the clientel it attracts which is predominantly ageing Americans of the type that wear all their jewelry all the time and consider themselves above even the gentle courtesies of "good morning". This was compounded by the fact that there is quite a large ageâ€¦
