For many months prior to our vacation we tried getting in touch with the hotel to no avail no one ever responded to anything we sent.  Our stay was nice the staff wonderful but again trying to get a refund on a gondola tour we paid for but didn't take we are getting silence once again.  Not very pleased wi this hotel at all. And the first night we stayed there the maid knocked on our door at 9 pm we told her we didn't need service that evening so she came back at 10 pm and walked right in our room, that wasn't good either.
