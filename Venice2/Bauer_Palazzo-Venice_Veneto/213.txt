Amazing location, right in the action of the Grand Canal.  The terrace is a fantastic space for breakfast, cocktails, dinner or just to people watch and listen to the serenadeâ€™s from the gondoliers.  Outstanding attentive staff, great service and such a perfect area to sightsee and shop.  Just a short walk to St Marks with restaurants and designer shops.  My room was beautiful, quite large and the bath was glorious.  The coral colored marble was so pretty and the tub was large with a great selection of amenities to please and pamper the most discerning traveler. I stayed just three days and it was hard to leave.
