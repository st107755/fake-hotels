Drive up in a boat to be escorted to a beautiful entrance to the hotel . Rooms are opulent with gold bathroom furniture and silk padded wallpaper with pictures and art hanging from silk rope ties.  Breakfast overlooking the city and a close 3 min walk to St Marks square, couldnâ€™t ask for more, amazing hotel and an amazing romantic city highly recommend.
