Felt so lucky that we were able to stay at the Bauer again.  From start to finish it was excellent.  We arrived early in the morning but the room was ready for us, which meant we were able to start our visit to this wonderful city almost immediately.  Yes the prices at the Bauer are silly which is such a shame in today's financial climate, but everything in Venice is expensive.  If you are working to a tight budget then probably Venice is not for you.  The service from all the staff was first class, so we look forward to visiting the Bauer again in the future - why would we want to stay anywhere else?
