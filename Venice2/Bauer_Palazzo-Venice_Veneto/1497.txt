Stayed at the Bauer during a family trip at Easter time. We enjoyed the hotel comfort very much because of the tropical rain outside and the acqua alta almost every night ! The Bauer is a mixture of a traditional hotel with gracious personals and of a modern hotel . The room for breakfast right in front of the Canal and the Duana is most memorable. Plenty of nice trattoria around. Trying to get totally lost in Venise and coming back to the Bauer is a great program
