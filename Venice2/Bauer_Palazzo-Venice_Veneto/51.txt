We were picked up at the train station and transported by private boat to the Bauer Hotel..what a fun experience!  The Bauer hotel is in a great location to San Marco square, restaurants and high end shopping. This Hotel is large in comparison to others I've been in Venice, it was clean with a friendly staff. Our room was clean and well appointed. Overall our experience at the Bauer was excellent.
