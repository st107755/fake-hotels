This was my 2rd stay at the hotel...beautiful, relaxing and a great location. Views from our room of the Grand Canel couldn't be beat! The staff was very acccommodating and and always available to assistant. The breakfast offered on the 7th floor terrace was a nice touch to start the day. We would not hesitate to return.
