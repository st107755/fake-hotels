In these turbulent times with only limited travel options we decided to go to Venice for a weekend and this was a great choice. The number of tourists was significantly lower and we really had a chance to experience the sights and feel the city.  After research we decided to stay at the St Regis mainly also because of the recent renovation ... and we were impressed ! The style of the hotel is so elegant but not over the top. The rooms very comfortable and airy, a good exception from previous Italian hotel room experiences. Service was outstanding, we could clearly see that the staff was happy that tourists are back and they did everything to make our stay unforgettable. Breakfast, for me a key event of a hotel stay, was amazing and the concierge very helpful, he got us lastâ€¦
