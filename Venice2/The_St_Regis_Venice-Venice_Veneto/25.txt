Our first time in this establishment was fantastic, we celebrated our first wedding anniversary in Venice.  Breakfast in the garden directly and Canal Grande, nice suite upgrade (as I am a Bonvoy Ambassador) and very friendly staff.  Definitely will come again! Suite with canal view would be nice next time though...
