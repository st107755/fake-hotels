I spent 5 days at the hotel as part of a work trip, where we also hosted an event inside the hotel (so got to interact closely with the staff). I just came back from the St Regis Maldives - so with that incredible experience fresh in my mind, I expected a lot from the newly opened/renovated hotel. It did not disappoint. The St Regis smell welcomes you as you arrive by water, complimented by amazing staff. The room is exquisite- it oozes understated luxury, and is incredibly well thought-through to make the most of a small footprint. Details like the stitching of the bed headpiece, the illuminated bathroom mirror patterns, the various shades and finishes of the marble In the bathroom make it truly special. The views from downstairs are amazing, and it is centrally located closeâ€¦
