If you want to be pampered well this is the right place to be. The Gio’s restaurant with its new menu is something that you have to try! The nouvelle cuisine mixed with fresh local food is simply stunning! Every plate is delicious and the best thing by far is the service.  The staff is extremely friendly and “au petit soin” . Lovely lovely lovely
