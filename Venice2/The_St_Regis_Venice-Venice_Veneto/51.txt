My wife and I spend 2 nights at the ST. Regis 2 weeks ago as part of our honeymoon trip to Italy. The hotel was an easy water taxi directly to the hotel dock or a simple water taxi to St. Marks Square make a left turn go maybe 6 blocks to arrive at the front door.  The services levels upon arriving and right throughout our stay was incredible. They upgraded our room based on our honeymoon, sent wine and cookies to our room.   The restaurant is on the Canal so beautiful views and the food was wonderful, ambience great and spoiled by extras due to our honeymoon, though I believe those special touches are offered to all who enjoy the property!  Concierge staff were incredibly helpful for anything concerning Venice and gondolas were literally a block away from the hotel.  Recommendâ€¦
