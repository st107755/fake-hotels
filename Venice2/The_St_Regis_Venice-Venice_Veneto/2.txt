We couldnâ€™t be happier with our hotel choice during our stay in beautiful Venice.  At The St Regis we experienced one of the best service ever. Hotel facilities are amazing as well as all staff members who were willing to anticipate our needs and making our stay as comfortable as possible. Special mention to Elisa for her kindness and dedication throughout our stay. We will definitely come back.
