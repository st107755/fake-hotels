We stayed 2 nights and had an amazing time. Location is great, and itâ€™s so incredible to take your - really good - breakfast in front of the punta della dogana. Attention to details is everywhere, from the beautiful furniture to the heated floor in the bathroom, the exquisite porcelain dishes, the fresh fruits at breakfast...We also had fun trying all the cocktails at the bar!
