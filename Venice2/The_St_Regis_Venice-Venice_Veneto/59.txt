There are great hotels and outstanding ones.  There are bad hotels and terrible ones.  There are new hotels, with great service and new hotels with mediocre service.  And then, once in a while, you come across a new or newly renovated hotel which is amazing and fresh -  with great management and everything works well.  SADLY, the St. Regis Venice is NOT one of these hotels.  We were so looking forward to staying at this hotel.  It just opened and we should have known there may be issues since communication with the hotel staff was slow and not very professional before arrival.  Upon arrival, as a gold member, we booked an Astor Jr Suite, we receive what we were told was the jr suite.  No upgrade at all and we doubt that this really was a jr. suite - it was small and not the 500â€¦
