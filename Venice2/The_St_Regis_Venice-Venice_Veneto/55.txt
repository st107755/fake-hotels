I don't have much to say other than wow!!!!  Beautiful new property, stunning art, amazing service.  Delicious food and the best setting in Venice. I honestly can't understand why this isn't the number 1 property in all of Venice on TripAdvisor.  It should be. A few things to note though  a) It is hard to find and google maps will not take you there (it takes you to the other side of Venice).  So splurge and take the private water taxi from the airport or train station. b) The rooms can be a bit warm and stuffy.  They only go down to 19C and so at night were quite dry. c) If you have the time - they have a tour to Burano to an amazing glass factory.  Take this tour!!!!!!!  I can't say enough great things about it. Again, do stay here.  You won't regret it!
