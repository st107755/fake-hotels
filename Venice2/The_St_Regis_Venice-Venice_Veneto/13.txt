Just so pleased with this hotel in every aspect service , hotel refurbishment , dining , drinks , all staff including the amazing complimentary butlers and the best address in Venice !  We have visited Venice regularly and stayed at the most iconic hotels including the Danieli , Gritti palace , Aman hotel , Ca Sagredo and Westin nothing compares to this hotel . I wish them success and a full house continuously .
