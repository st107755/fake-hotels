Stunning hotel in a stunning location. The view from the bar and the restaurant alone make the hotel worth it. Regrettably, although the hotel has had six months to prepare, the service was still rusty around the edges - not something one would expect in a hotel of this calibre.  The slightly snooty attitude of the staff was also unwelcome - this is now an industry fighting for its survival, and a degree of gratitude that people want to give them their money would not go amiss.
