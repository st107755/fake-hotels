We stayed at the St Regis for our wedding anniversary and had our expectations exceeded across the board.   The design standard of the recent renovation is exceptional, with high-end finishes throughout, including stunning marble flooring in the lobby. We loved the chic art deco vibe of Gio's bar and restaurant for cocktails overlooking the Grand Canal and Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute.   The hotel is ideally positioned for the main cultural attractions and getting dropped at the hotel's private pontoon by speedboat, having cruised under the Rialto Bridge was an unforgettable experience.   We're not usually drawn to branded hotels but the St Regis is part of Marriott's luxury collection meaning the best of both a boutique feel with the service standards of a 5 star brand.â€¦
