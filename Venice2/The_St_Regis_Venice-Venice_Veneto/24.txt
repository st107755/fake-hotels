Simply put, this was our favorite trip at a Marriott hotel ever (and as a Titanium over many years we have visited a couple of iconic hotels like the st Regis bora bora, etc...)  Obviously it certainly helped that our suit night upgrade cleared into the magnificient Grand canal suite, connecting with a Luxury Grand Groom and this enable the 6 of us (2 parents and 4 children) to stay in a room in a pristine condition -given the recent reopening.  The design choice is obvious from the website. We love to visit museums but we have always preferred the aman  hotel styles to sleeping in museum style rooms. The St Regis fits this bill. It has a more contemporary style with classic elegance. So yes you wont be staying in a museum style room - like basically all other luxury hotels inâ€¦
