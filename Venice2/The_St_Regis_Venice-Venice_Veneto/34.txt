The hotel has a perfect location in the absolute centre of Venice, directly at the Canale Grande. The hotel is “in the middle of it”, allows to have perfect views of the lagoon but at the same time gives some privacy. The terrace - directly facing the Canal is a wonderful place for lunch, a drink or dinner.   The team in the St Regis has done a perfect job during our stay and contributed a lot to have an enjoyable time. We received a friendly reception at the check in, the bar and restaurant are both exceptional in service and quality. Most importantly the team has a positive spirit to serve in a professional manner.   The newly refurbished hotel has a high end and really nice fit out. The dedication to perfection and detail is really visible and we loved to be part of this…
