this hotel is gorgeous ! tasteful, beautifully appointed , and superbly located! the staff are amazing and our assigned butler, " Pep ", was the most charming, helpful and considerate young man. the public spaces are exquisite. make time to just sit and savour the views from the restaurant or bar areas (inside or out). excellent breakfast buffet. complimentry shoe shine and pressing available. our room overlooked a beautiful courtyard and was very quiet and very comfotable. there was a lovely bottle of prosecco and macarons to welcome us . we have stayed at many hotels ,but the st regis is my favourite. highly recommend - you will not be disappointed . (also, enjoyed a great meal at gios - their inhouse restaurant ) with a gorgeous canal view on our last evening ; excellent foodâ€¦
