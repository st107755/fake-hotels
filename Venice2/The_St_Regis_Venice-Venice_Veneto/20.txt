The hotel in newly renovated and easily to be reached by public boat (1 minute walk). -The dinning and the breakfast direct at the Grande Canal is superb- -Rooms are spacious with modern bathroom facilities.  What I missed was the "Welcome Ceremony" and to often she staff was not coordinated and authorized for even small issues - thus only 4 out of 5.
