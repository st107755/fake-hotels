My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in august for our 5th anniversary. We stayed in a grand. Canal view terrace room, which was small, yet well appointed with a beautiful terrace overlooking Santa Maria della Salute. Bed and bedding was a dream, as to be expected at the St. Regis. Service was attentive, especially the concierge who arranged for us a lovely dinner and water taxi service to Torcello, as well as gave great recommendations for “off the beaten path” walks. Breakfast was great, each morning (I prefer the a la carte service over buffet and it was a good variety). Dinner at Gios was great, beautiful view and great food. Overall, a great stay in one of our favorite brand of hotels.
