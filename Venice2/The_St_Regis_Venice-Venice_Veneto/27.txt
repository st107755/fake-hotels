We enjoyed our stay at the St Regis Recently opened the hotel has been nicely decorated with high class retro design . We loved it and felt like home from the first minute . The room was spacious and beautiful . Despite the cancellation of the carnival we enjoyed visiting the entire city from the hotel which is ideally located in the middle of the town . Special thank to Eduardo our Butler who offered a fantastic service and assistance during our 3 nights stay . We ll definitely come back to Venice not only about the city but also because of the St Regis  experience
