I enjoyed a lunch on the terrace here and would say that the views and service were good. I ordered a fried calamari appetiser for 24 Euros and asked for a bit of lettuce on the side and was charged 20 Euros extra.  They also charge 6 Euros/person as a "table charge".  There are plenty of great terraces with similar views and equal quality food. We felt that these charges were a bit much and would recommend guests to go to similar restaurants like the one at Gritti Palace nearby.
