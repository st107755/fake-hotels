This hotel is an absolute treat. The location is undeniably one of the best, the views itself are worth it. Sitting in the terrace facing the Basilica and having tea is probably one of my favourite memories from this trip. It is literally right next to all the luxury boutiques but still tucked away enough that it's quite private and not noisy. The room was small, but comfortable and luxurious. Bed and pillows felt like a nice cloud and if it wasn't for the blue skies and twinkling canals outside I would have just stayed in bed all day. Definitely recommend getting a room with a canal view.  The staff are all in a league of their very own. Everyone from the doormen, to the check in staff to the concierges were all warm, welcoming and came across as sincere without trying tooâ€¦
