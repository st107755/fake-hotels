St. Regis Venice would defiantly raise your expectations for a star hotel with their hospitality. They would leave no stone unturned to pamper you and make you stay in Venice a memorable one.  Special mention to the Butler service and Senior Butler Mr Leonardo Leoni who went out of the way to help us plan our schedule not only while In Venice but also at other locations in Italy.  I would highly recommend St Regis Venice to everyone who is looking forward to stay by the Grand Canal, enjoy Amazing cocktails at the Gioâ€™s bar overlooking the Canal and get spoilt with the amazing hospitality of St Regis.
