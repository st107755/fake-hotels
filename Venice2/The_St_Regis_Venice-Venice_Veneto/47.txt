I was really looking forward to this stay. The St. Regis service is nothing special at all. Our butler from the first day who provided Prosecco was the friendly and very customer service oriented. He was the best experience of the hotel. We were told we had an upgraded room the room although new and nice it was a basic very small room that was difficult to open two cases at the same time. The housekeeping was good for the first two nights the last 3 we did not get turn down service, water replenished or coffee. Also there is a distinct odor that was overwhelming as you enter the room. I would not stay at this property again.
