Spent three nights in this luxury hotel. It has a perfect central location with stunning views. The bedroom was comfortable and the room servicing prompt and efficient. There is a good restaurant and, if the weather permits, you can have table on the Grand Canal waterside. The staff are uniformly excellent and always remember your name; nothing is too much trouble. All of this is reflected in the room price but, if you want a really special stay, the St Regis is perfect.
