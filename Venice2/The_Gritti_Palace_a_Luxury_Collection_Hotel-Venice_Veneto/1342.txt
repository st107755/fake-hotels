It was a wonderful experience staying at the Gritti Palace. We really appreciate all the attention paid to every little detail, room, service, food - everything was just right.   We especially enjoyed dining on the terrace of the hotel's restaurant - Club del Doge, breakfast by the canal with lovely singing from the gondoliers passing by, very exclusive and romantic. We also had very memorable dinner experience thanks to all the extraordinarily friendly waiting staff. A huge thank you to you all for making our special dinner so unforgettable.
