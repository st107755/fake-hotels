We stayed for 3 nights at this beautiful, romantic hotel. I love hotels with a history and The Gritti Palace has all the stone stairs and ornate decorations one would hope for in historic Venice. The service was excellent. Room service was spot on which is not often the case and the location could not have been better. It is located about a 5-10 min walk from St Marks Square which was perfect as it was close enough that we felt everything touristy was immediately accessible yet it was always such a pleasure to walk down the exclusive street to the quiet square outside the hotel. Like an oasis of calm. The position on the Grand Canal was perfect also. Very close to the bridge to cross the canal, next to a gondola stop and right by the taxi buses. We chose to travel by privateâ€¦
