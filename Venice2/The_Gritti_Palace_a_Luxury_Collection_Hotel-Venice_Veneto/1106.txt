I stayed at the gritti palace with 2 other family members (my parents) and I was truly impressed. When we arrived by water taxi a bell man immediately took our bags and led us inside. The lobby is like no other, it is truly a palace. When we were checking in the concierge was extremely helpful and nice. She gave us an option of 2 rooms because she thought that the roll away bed would fit better in another room. Then she proceeded to personally show us the rooms and give us a quick tour of the hotel. The room we choose was perfect with the room itself the size of my living room back home in Seattle. The room was stocked with comfortable ornate furniture and nice firm beds. The marble bathroom had a wonderful walk in shower. The room also came with a small set of speakers perfectâ€¦
