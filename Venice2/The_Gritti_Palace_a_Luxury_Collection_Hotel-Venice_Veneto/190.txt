It was not hard to imagine living there in the 15th century as a Palace. Looking out onto the Grand Canal from our hotel room it was everything I thought it would be and then some. This hotel sparks the desire to find a carnival outfit and join in or you really are missing out. The staff was incredibly welcoming and the location was perfect. All our tourist sites were within walking distance. Splurge on a room with a view. The decor was elegant and soft, claw bath tub in the actual room, not bathroom, yet in this hotel it looked sexy. The linens were of superior quality and the hotel itself was clean and well maintained. A true piece of art.
