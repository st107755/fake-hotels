The location of the hotel and the view from the restaurant are the best in Venice.  Our room and bathroom were beautifully decorated and clean. Overall we had an enjoyable stay. The breakfast on the terrace and the view were so enjoyable that we didn't want to get up to go explore Venice. The only negative side was the high price. However, I would go back if will be in Venice again.
