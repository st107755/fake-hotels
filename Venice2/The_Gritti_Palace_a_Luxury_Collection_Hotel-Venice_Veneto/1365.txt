Italy is amazing but Venice is like another world... On the pictures everything is really amazing but when you get there you cannot turn off the smell from the canal. This was the worst problem I had while there.  Our Hotel was on a great location, staff was really nice and helpful...  They recently renovated and they did a stunning job. The best thin in this hotel is the Venetian style where ever you look. This is great place to stay.
