We stayed at this beautiful property for 6 nights in March.  From the moment we arrived until the time of our departure, everything was wonderful.  The service, food, attention to detail & atmosphere could not be better. We were fortunate enough to have fabulous weather during our stay in this amazing property in the magical city of Venice.  Also fortunate to eat the delicious food specially created for us by Chef Daniele Turco, drink the cocktails specially created for us by the head barman & appreciate the extremely professional service provided by Maitre dâ€™ Angelo & his team, along with the Riva Terrace team, run by Paolo.  We must also compliment the reservations team & the concierges. Needless to say, we will be back!
