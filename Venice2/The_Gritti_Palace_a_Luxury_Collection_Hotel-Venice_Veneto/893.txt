Wow. Wow. Wow. If you want to make your trip to Venice super special then you must consider a stay at the Gritti Palace! Where do I begin.... The rooms are fabulous! The friendly staff upgraded us as we had a small baby. Our room was large and luxurious. The bed was a super king with the softest, comfiest pillow top and enormous cuddly pillows.... Ahhhh 😀😴 The beautiful blue marble bathroom was magnificent, with separate bath and shower. The smell of Acqua Di Parma products always wafting in the air.... ahh 😍The incredible terrace and breakfast - enjoy starting everyday with this excellent breakfast. Huge buffet plus menu items and as many yummy Italian coffees as you like. All while overlooking the grand canal. I was in heaven!!! The staff are excellent - attentive, helpful…
