We stayed at The Gritti Palace for 3 nights.  We took a cooking class with Chef Franco Sanna and it was fantastic!   He spent a lot of time with us, we had a 4 course meal with wonderful wines and had so much fun.  He is a wonderful chef and patient with us.   We laughed and so much fun!  Well worth the time and money!   We will do it again on our next visit!
