If there was ever a hotel I wish I could have stayed in, it would be this one.    I had read a little about this hotel prior to my visit to Venice, and decided to add it to my itinerary.  We briefly passed by for coffee and nibbles, which we enjoyed canal side - a memorable experience.  The whether was beautiful, the view breathtaking, and the coffee tasted great.  We couldn't have asked for more.  I have no doubt we'll visit Venice again, and I definitely intend to stay here for at least one night.
