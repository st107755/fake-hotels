The hotel was top notch! the rooms were fantastic! clean, excellent Venetian style d√©cor.  We extended our stay by an extra night just to stay in luxury.  The restaurant and bar is right on the canal with an amazing view.  Breakfast is a bit pricy, but very good.  We had drinks there at night several times and you cant beat the view as well as they had a musician one night. Very romantic! I would stay here again.  We stayed on hotel reward points with another couple.
