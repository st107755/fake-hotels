This place can not be beat for service, location, and elegance!  Came here with my family (my parents first trip to Venice) and wanted them to have a wonderful experience and chose Gritti Palace of course and it delivered! The person who checked us in to room 223/225 acknowledged our SPG platinum status but also gave my parents a comp breakfast as I told him that it had been my mothers dream to visit Venice!  Wow we love this place.  The food , the service cannot be beat and we highly recommend!
