From the moment we arrived via water taxi the Gritti palace did not disappoint. The 2 ladies at registration were warm and friendly. We received a very generous room upgrade which only enhanced our stay. The concierge were efficient just not warm or engaging. The restaurant was outstanding as was the bar and staff. Thank you for such a memorable stay.
