Never thought I'd stay here,  but fortunately we did.   If you have not heard of the Gritti Palace,  research it.   We had a beautiful corner room and a large bathroom with double vanities,  as well as a separate shower and a large tub.  The walls and floor of the bathroom are all marble.  The room was quite spacious, with a desk,  a credenza with a mini refrigerator and a settee.   Each day they gave us 2 complimentary bottles of water.   At night you can put out a pair of shoes, which they will polish for free.  The concierge are most helpful. The lounge along the Grand Canal is great for sitting and watching all the boats pass by.   If you want to treat yourself,  stay here.
