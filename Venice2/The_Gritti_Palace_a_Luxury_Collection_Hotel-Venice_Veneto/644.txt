My wife and I were upgraded to a room with a view of the Grand Canal; my daughter had a beautiful room just down the hall.  Everyone was very courteous and addresses us by name during our six days there.  Luca, one of the concierges, found us excellent places for dinner and was very helpful recommending things to do and how to get there.  If you can do it, rent the Il Doge - the hotel's Riva yacht - for half a day or the whole day.  We visited Murano, Burano and Torcello on Il Doge with captain Marco.  It's a great day - especially when he takes the boat at full speed!
