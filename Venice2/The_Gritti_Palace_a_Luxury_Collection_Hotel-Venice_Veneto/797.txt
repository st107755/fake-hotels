Our daughter was touring Venice with her school choir so my husband and I thought it an ideal opportunity to support the tour and also see Venice for ourselves. This hotel didn't disappoint. From the minute we stepped off the water taxi to the minute we left it was absolutely perfect. The rooms are stunning, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean and well equipped. The service in the bar was excellent and staff attentive. Although we didn't have dinner in the hotel the breakfast was incredible and it was impossible to not find something to like. This was our first time in Venice and I can't imagine returning and staying anywhere else. It certainly isn't cheap but well worth every penny spent as it will leave us with many wonderful memories  for a long time to come.
