Beautiful hotel no matter what. Perfect location, fantastic canal side reataurant, experienced staffs. It has all. I pick this hotel the best in Venice for everything. My third visit this time. This hotel was renovated in 2010 and my 2 previous visits were before the renovation. They restored all the antique furnitures in rooms, re-decorated rooms, improved bath rooms.and, more importantly, doibled the rate. Is it worth the money? It depends. At that rate perfection is required. One of the reasons I like to stay at this hotel in Venice is the restaurant. Eating at this canal side restaurant in the evening is a great joy. The hospitality at the restaurant was a little disapointing this time. Staffs were not very attentive. Want to return of course though.
