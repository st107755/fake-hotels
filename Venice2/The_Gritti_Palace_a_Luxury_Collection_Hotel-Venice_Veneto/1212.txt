We stayed here for four nights at the beginning of June 2014 and as everyone else says it was terrific.  The staff were attentive, from the front desk, the room maid and the waiters.  The chef de concierge obtained tickets for the opera for us when they could not be found any where else! Every morning, watching the boat life over breakfast in the early morning sunshine was enjoyed with high quality food.  The same high quality was at dinner and the early evening cocktails on the terrace bar were immaculate.  Yes, it was expensive but you get what you pay for!
