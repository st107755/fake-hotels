Excellent location, service, amenities, etc.  Booked a double and a triple room for me and my family for ager our Mediterranean cruise. We chose the Venitian style rooms and we're very happy with both Rooms. Both rooms were close together snd similar but at the same time different in style and olors. Both had very nice marble bathrooms.  Service was excellent including breakfast and the location is perfect.
