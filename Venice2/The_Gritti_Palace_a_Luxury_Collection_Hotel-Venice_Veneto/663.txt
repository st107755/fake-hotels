We were here only for one night after a cruise and found it to be lovely. My only negative is that breakfast doesn't start till 730 in the morning. Nice buffet but for early risers it is late. We were upgraded to a suite and it was awesome. Very roomy and well laid out. Beautiful lobby and excellent concierge help too. We ate a late lunch in the restaurant and it was very good too. Worth the cost to stay here.
