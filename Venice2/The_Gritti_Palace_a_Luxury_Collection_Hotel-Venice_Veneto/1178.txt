I'll try to make this quick since I'm still in Venice and I like easy to read reviews when I'm looking.  The Gritti Palace has made my stay in Venice warm and comfortable. It is the perfect combination of luxury and warmth, not stuffy like many others.  Pros 1.Hotel Itself...Beautiful 2.Room.....I was awed by the the decor and architecture.....beamed ceilings, Murano chandelier...even the binders and notepads match the wallpaper, such attention to detail.  I usually like more modern, but not this time. Quiet for sleeping. 3. Check-in....Easy and smooth.  Our hostess was warm, but quick getting us to our room after a late flight. 4. Housekeeping....room very clean.....turn-down also very good. 5. Concierge helpful with directions and arranging last minute private boat, the bestâ€¦
