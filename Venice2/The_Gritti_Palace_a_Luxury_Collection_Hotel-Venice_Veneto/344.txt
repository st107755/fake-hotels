The only negative thing I could say about this hotel, is that we had to leave to check into another hotel in another city.  Upon check-in we received a honeymoon upgrade to a room on the Grand Canal, with a bottle of Prosecco chilled in our room next to beautiful pink roses (the flowers throughout the hotel were the most beautiful arrangements I've seen).  The room was gorgeous and I was definitely impressed by the heated floors in the bathroom - perfect during our winter trip!! The breakfast buffet was plentiful and the terrace outside of the restaurant was the best view in the city - we sat outside for a glass of wine even though it was quite chilly! This hotel is highly recommended for traveling to Venice, you won't be disappointed.
