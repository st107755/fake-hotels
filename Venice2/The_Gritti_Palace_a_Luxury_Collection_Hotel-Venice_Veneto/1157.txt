The Gritti Palace lives up to it's reputation for luxury and service.  A big thank you to the concierge Claudio for all his help and recommendations.  We took a Gondola ride right from the dock of the hotel as well as hired a private water taxi for a 4 hour tour including Murano and Burano (a little pricey but well worth every penny...thank you JeanLuca)  The only negative comment is for housekeeping and turn down service. They just tossed my nightshirt on the bed in a heap and threw the pillows haphazardly on the bench at the foot of the bed (trivial but surprising at a hotel of this caliber).
