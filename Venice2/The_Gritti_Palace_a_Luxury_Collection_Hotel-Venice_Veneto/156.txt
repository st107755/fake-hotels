I wanted to love The Gritti and give it 5 stars, but it's not quite there. The pricing is very high. It's fair to say that if you have to come up with an average room price on average date, just to get an average benchmark, the rooms here are basically $1,000 USD per night give or take. At that level, absolute perfection is expected.  We found that overall the facilities are lovely, the rooms nice, the location excellent, the feeling is old world in most ways. We had a great tour of the hotel art and antiques from the head concierge Ivan Schultz, which we do recommend doing...20 minutes well spent.  The reasons why I can't give 5 stars:   --lobby tends to get crowded or hectic feeling, lots of people moving in and out or around - this is not befitting a level of graceful luxuryâ€¦
