We stayed here to wind down an SPG-trip through Italy having come from the St. Regises in Rome and Florence – what a way to end the trip. The Gritti is absolutely gorgeous. The service was very warm and helpful. The room was magnificent. And the location was terrific, close to a vaporetto stand as well as walking distance to most major sights in Venice (although it’s such a small city I’d imagine most hotels are close to the main sights!).    The only minor complaint was that the bar decor and service were a little subpar compared to all the other spectacular service and grandeur.    Despite that, we were very sad when we had to leave this place!
