I booked two nights at The Gritti six months ago with Platinum American Express on a 10 day visit to Italy. I had to pay 100% up front. Close to 3000. 1 month before going.....I HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OUT OF MY ROOM BY HOTEL.....because, because.... get this....” a wealthy man bought out the hotel for the night”. NOW.....I am forced to buy a hotel room of any comparable canal location ( not the Marriott sister next door ) for double the price. OUTRAGEOUS......and such a sign of times, this hotels commitment to travelers is horrendous..... Both American Express and Gritti should be ashamed of themselves.
