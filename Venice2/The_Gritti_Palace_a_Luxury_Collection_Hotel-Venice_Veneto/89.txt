I can’t say enough about the beauty of this historic hotel. We spent three nights and enjoyed every minute of our stay. World class service at every level, check in, concierge, bell men, wait staff, all very accommodating. Breakfast was very good. Awesome location, St. Marks square is less than a 5 minute walk. It’s on the canal which offers fantastic views but it is loud so be prepared if you are a light sleeper.
