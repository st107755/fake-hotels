We checked into The Gritti Palace in the full knowledge it was going to be expensive and it didn't disappoint! - Our room was in the Venetian collection, it was rather small and there was no separate table only a chair, it was also rather dark as the decoration was quite imposing and the light was restricted as the room faced a building only about 50 feet away. Having said all that the service was first class and the staff very friendly, courteous and efficient, and our room was also spotlessly clean. The food is well presented and served but don't expect budget prices as this is a first class hotel but you will be treated like royalty as everyone is special to the well trained staff who always have a kind greeting and a smile.
