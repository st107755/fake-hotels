Wow, we went to Venice once again and as always she was beautiful, however our experience was taken to new levels by staying at the Gritti Palace in the heart of Chic Venice, but getting a FREE upgrade to stay in their premiere suite inclusive of its own gold plated lift, surrounded by great works of art and a view over the grand canal. This hotel was breathtaking in every way, especially if you love Venice.
