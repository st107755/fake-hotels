We booked this hotel using Marriott points.  On arriving by water taxi (recommended vs walking from the train station) the reception agent Carlotta spent 30 minutes with us first showing us the room, advising on the best attractions and restaurants in Venice and then following up for us on a restaurant at our next destination - Florence. The rooms are beautiful with spectacular bathrooms.  The restaurant and concierge staff are super friendly and very efficient. This hotel is listed in the Marriott Luxury Collection for a good reason. Fantastic!
