Hi me and my partner stayed at the Gritti 16th October for 2 nights. This was my 3rd time to venice and It was the best.   Gritti Palace is a top 5 * property with outstanding Service.  We stayed in a deluxe Junior suite , which was spacious and comfortable.   Breakfast on the canal was something I will always remember, Amazing.  Great continental Choice. and the Prosecco for Breakie was a bonus  Basic Cooked breakfast.   Location - 10min walk from St marks Square.  Near Gondola Ride.   overall fantastic would recommend you stay here.
