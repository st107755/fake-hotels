Pics don't do this place justice and they do a pro job at check in, with the bellman, and the service staff. My room was spotless, the location central and the view from the terrace spectacular. The furnishings were luxurious and my room which they upgraded graciously was spacious and perfect.   If I had to ding them for anything it's that they weren't able to put themselves in the shoes of their guests. We had a horrible travel day full of traffic and road delays of more than 4 hours, doubling the time it should have taken. After arriving after 10pm we were tired and starving. We packed a small bag as we weren't staying long and only had the clothes we were wearing, which didn't meet the attire standards for the restaurant in the hotel. all we had were shorts and polo shirtsâ€¦
