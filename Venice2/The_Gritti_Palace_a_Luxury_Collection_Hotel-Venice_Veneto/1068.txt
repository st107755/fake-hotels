We stayed here for 3 nights for our 10th wedding anniversary.  We treated ourselves to a grand canal view room.  The room was a good size for venice and very luxurious - we definitely had a great view, although I would have preferred slightly windows - but is probably the more expensive option! The staff were great from check in and throughout our stay, whether in the bar, restaurant, spa or concierge the service really was faultless in being welcoming and helpful at all times. We used the spa twice for treatments and it was great. The prices in the bar and restaurant are high, but the view makes it a price worth paying. Not a hotel for every day or ever budget but definitely if you want to treat yourself and feel pampered!!
