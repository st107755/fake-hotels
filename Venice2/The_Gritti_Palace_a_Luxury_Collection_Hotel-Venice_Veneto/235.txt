This Hotel would certainly rate in the top 5 for the best Hotels in Venice. The restoration, attention to detail is incredible. I especially love the products inside the room the lovely welcome with fresh fruit and chocolates.  The A/C in this very very unbearable and hot time is the best in all of Venice! The Riva bar has the most excellent staff to make cocktails and service.
