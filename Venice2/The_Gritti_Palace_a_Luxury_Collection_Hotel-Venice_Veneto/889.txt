My husband, son and I spent two nights in Venice and loved every second of it.  The view, location, restaurant and service were flawless. We arrived by water taxi and spent the afternoon taking in the view from the bar terrace on the water and enjoying a delicious operative.  We walked everywhere and loved every detail of the hotel.
