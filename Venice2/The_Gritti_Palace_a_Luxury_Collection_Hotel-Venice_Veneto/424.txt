Venice can be quite busy with tourists. Gritti Palace is ali g a canal, but away from the crowds. The staff is spot on. This is a gem in a city which which itself sparkles. In the morning I opened our windows slightly, to the singing of gondoliers below our room. Carlotta M. assisted us in the hotel. She is Venetian, and made us feel so welcome . When we first arrived off a water bus, a Venetian man helped us to navigate the winding streets to the hotel. He told us that he thought the Gritti was the best.
