We stayed for two nights.  Everything about this hotel is 5 star from the service, the building, the decor, the staff.   Breakfast on the deck was gorgeous overlooking the canal.  Perfect location.  The restaurant for dinner was phenomenal.  Drinks at night on the deck was beautiful with lights of the Duomo and Hotel across the water.  The entire experience was just amazing.
