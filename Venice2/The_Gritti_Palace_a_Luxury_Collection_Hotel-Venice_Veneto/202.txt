We have been to many places and great hotels but Gritti Palace is the best we have ever been to. It is beyond five stars. We stayed in Giglio Prestige room and it was beautiful and spacious! All of the staff were wonderful and provided pfirst class service. Breakfast was delicious on terrace and location is great too right on Grand Canal with view of La Salute! We also went to spa for a great massage, tasted wine in their wine tasting class and spent a half day at epicurean school where we had one of the best meals of our life. Special thank you to Chef Franco and Paulo for the best culinary and wine experience!!! Thank you Gritti Palace for the trip of a lifetime!   Ps- any negative reviews are over critical and snobby visitors because Gritti Palace is perfection!
