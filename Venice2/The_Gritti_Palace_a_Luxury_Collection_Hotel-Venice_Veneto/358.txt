Gritti is as good as it gets! Beautiful,stylish and elegant, all the very best attributes of Italy in one stunning location. Conviently placed for central Venice this wonderful Hotel has it all,  a former palace bought tastefully up to date. Sumptuous and luxurious ,-as a guest you are made to feel very special by Pedro and his staff , nothing is too much trouble. All this is done with an easy charm ,not forced or false. Many of the staff have been there for years and it all clicks into place like a well oiled machine. Rooms are well appointed with great bathrooms ,lashings of beautiful marble. Breakfast is tremendous lovely fruit, pastries, hams,cheeses, and great cooked options too. Five stars are not sufficient for this hotel -outstanding. Hope to be back,thank you!
