This intimate hotel is so well appointed you will feel you are in another time, but with modern comforts.  The staff is perfect, everyone remembers your name, and is on call to be there to assist with any matter.  We were in a jaw dropping suite, The Coppa Suite.  Our favorite spot was the bar area on water level of the lagoon.  Sipping wine and soaking up this fantastic (but crowded) town!!  We only ate breakfast and one lunch on property.  No rave reviews on lunch, but the breakfast is well done!!  I will come back to Venice and to The Gritti!
