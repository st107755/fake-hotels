It would take just too long to list all the amazing things we enjoyed at The Gritti Palace. Our arrival on the water taxi, the service, the friendliness of the staff, the room, the location, the restaurant and it's amazing professional, but friendly staff. Our stay at the Gritti was pure indulgence. The hotel has character and history but every modern luxury you would expect of such a deluxe hotel. Perfect location for exploring Venice with the Vaporetto just around the corner, and with a really helpful concierge team to guide you on your way. It certainly is expensive, but absolutely worth every single penny. I would go as far as saying it's probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in.
