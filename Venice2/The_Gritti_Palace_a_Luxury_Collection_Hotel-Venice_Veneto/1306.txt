This is a wonderful hotel with beautiful public spaces and luxurious rooms. It's big enough to offer all the facilities you will ever need but small enough to feel friendly and cosy.  All staff members are unerringly helpful and charming.  Highlights are the wonderful bar and the very civilised breakfasts.  We spent four nights here and enjoyed it immensely.
