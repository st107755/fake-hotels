The Gritti Palace has every right to call themselves the best hotel in Venice. The arrival at the Gritti via motor boat directly to their private dock was very exciting! Unbeatable location, great knowledgable staff, beautiful rooms. Our room had a great view of the grand canal. It was spacious, beautifully decorated, and spotless clean. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a dream come true. Great bathroom products. The bar is expensive but worth the experience! They have achieved the perfect balance of old beautiful charm, modern amenities and comfortable atmosphere.
