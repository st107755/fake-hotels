We went to celebrate our 5th anniversary and had a brilliant time all in all !!! Only had a bad experience where 100 euros went missing from my bag which I had left in the room and the receptionist and the manager did nothing to get it checked or to compensate us for the loose but instead brushed the whole subject off by saying the staff would never do anything like that and we should go to the police if we need to make a complaint which was shocking to me as that is definitely not why's I expected from a 5 star hotel!!!   Food was absolutely perfect for dinner and breakfast!!! The staff in the restaurant were brilliant and the location and the rooms were perfect. Other than bitter taste due to this incident we had a great time ....
