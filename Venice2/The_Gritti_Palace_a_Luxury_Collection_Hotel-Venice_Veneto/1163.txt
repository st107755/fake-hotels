My wife and I stayed here in August for a few nights whilst visiting Venice. Everything about the hotel is superb and we will never forget the wonderful breakfasts on the terrace watching the busy canal traffic in front and overlooking Santa Maria church. Our Venetian room was sumptuously decorated and was of adequate size. It did not have a view but we knew not to expect one with this type of room. We visited the other luxury hotels nearby and The Gritti was by far the best.
