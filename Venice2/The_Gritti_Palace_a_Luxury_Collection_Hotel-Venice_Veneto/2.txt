The cocktail bar waiters will give you just a scanning menu without asking whether you have a device with which to scan.  Cocktails are not special although the decor is as pretty as it ever was. There is a feeling of cost saving.  Even their hot chocolate was this and lukewarm where it used to be thick, and creamy and piping hot.   Pity.
