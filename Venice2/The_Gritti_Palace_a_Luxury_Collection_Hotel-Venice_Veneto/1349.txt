We checked-in to our room and there were two double beds pushed together (we were supposed to get a king). We called and told them the problem, which they said would be fixed when we returned from dinner. Four hours later (and later that evening) we returned to find nothing had been done. At $1,000/night you think they would go out of their way to make perfect? On top of this, the air conditioning had power save on it. We put it on high, but it was still very hot.  Would not stay here again!
