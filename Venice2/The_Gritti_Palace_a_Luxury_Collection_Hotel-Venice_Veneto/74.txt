This was a beautiful hotel. The decorations are upscale and gorgeous (sometimes a little much). For those debating with the JW Marriot and the Gritti, it depends on what you're looking for. If you have the time and money, I would highly recommend doing both. I stayed 6 nights at the JW and 2 nights at the Gritti. The Gritti is right in the city of Venice and has a great view of St. Mark's basilica on the breakfast terrace. The food is absolutely incredible, would highly recommend the chocolate muffins and croissants. The service is impeccable. I had a leak in my first room, so they gave me a free upgrade to the princess suite and then room service delivered my bottle of wine from the old one to my new one without asking!
