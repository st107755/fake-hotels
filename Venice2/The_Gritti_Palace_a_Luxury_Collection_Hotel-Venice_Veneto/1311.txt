Check in was so smooth with sense of easy and luxury. I was escorted to the room. Room orientation was perfect. Dinner reservation was offered.   Service at restaurant was very good while food tasted and presentation was lower than expectation compared to other places in venice.   Breakfast service and buffet line was lovely but hot items ordered per menu were so poor. Pancake was from microwave. Poached egg came on very hard bread.   Housekeeping always smile and finish the room perfectly especially the bathroom. She understood perfectly what time to come in for the service. This type can be called luxury and accommodating service.   Concierge service was professional. They knew every restaurant i wanted to go plus helped to check whether the restaurants opened. Tableâ€¦
