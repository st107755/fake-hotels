My husband and I were on our honeymoon - this hotel made us feel like it! We were on a two week trip with various hotel stays and were reminded why we love Starwood. From the moment we checked in until the moment we left, we hardly needed to think about anything. Giorgio, with customer experience greeted us at check-in, acclimated us to the hotel and made sure we had dinner reservations. The entire front desk staff was wonderful, but Michele in particular was great.  He gently encouraged us to ensure we had train tickets booked in advance for our departure (as they typically sell out, which they did), then booked the tickets for us, printed them and scheduled our cab.  The staff made the experience, but I would be remiss not to mention the beautiful hotel.  The room was gorgeousâ€¦
