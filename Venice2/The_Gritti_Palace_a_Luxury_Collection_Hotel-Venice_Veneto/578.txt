The Gritti Palace is my home in Venice. Located near the entrance to the Grand Canal across from Longhi's San Salute, the hotel was once the home of the Gritti Doge. With the recent renovation - raising the floor several feet to counter Aqua Alta and refurbishing every room, the Gritti is bear perfection. I'm fortunate to stay in a suite on the canal. Just open the doors and hear the water and the gondoliers. It's magical. Of course, that is the fantasy Venice, but it's also real. The staff at the hotel are universally helpful and friendly. One concierge had to help me twice because I kept leaving my key in the room. Breakfast is served on the terrace, the canal right by your side. In the evening or late at night you can catch a grappa and an espresso at the Riva Lounge. Lunchâ€¦
