We only stayed one night on a stop over in Venice on our way to Croatia.  We would have loved to stay at the Gritti Palace for many more nights!  Every person we encountered was very welcoming and polite.  We had lunch on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the cathedral Santa Maria della Salute.  Our lunch was delicious, and the view second to none.  Our room was a suite which was old school lovely.  The bed was so comfortable!  One thing to note, they do not have an iron in the room, but they do offer 2 items per day of complementary pressing.  We sent one item to be pressed and had it back within 20 minutes!  Our suite had a side canal, not really a great view, but we were ok with it.  What was wonderful was the gondolas would go by our room and we had our window openâ€¦
