We stayed at the Gritti Palace for 9 nights in June and the hotel experience was splendid.  We arrived from Marco Polo airport via a water taxi to the hotel's dedicated dock and there was a porter there immediately to take our luggage and the head porter walked us to the sitting area for check-in.  It was around 2pm local time.  Then we were comfortably seated at the reception desk with Roberta who checked us into our room.  We came with our 2-year Little Bun and Roberta took an immediate shine to her.  She had Little Bun sit on her lap while she entered our info and explained the hotel to us.  We've never seen this kind of affectionate warmth before from any other hotel we've traveled to with Little Bun.  Throughout our stay, most hotel employees were very warm and friendlyâ€¦
