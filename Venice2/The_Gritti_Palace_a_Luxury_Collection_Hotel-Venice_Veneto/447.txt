Beautiful Hotel, with great staff, great concierge with good ideas of where to go what to see and where best for lunch and dinner, we went on to Rome after Venice and they knew the concierge in the Hotel De Russie and had helped plan our teip there as well, breakfast was nice and dinner was beautiful, we were upgraded to a lovely room as well, a great experience
