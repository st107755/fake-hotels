A beautiful hotel by the Grand Canal and just a five minute walk from St. Mark's Square and the Basilica. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The style of the rooms are contemporary venetian per se. Great in-room entertainment system - but keep note that it is one of the priciest.  They have a spa using Aqua Di Parma products. The bathrooms are always refreshed with Aqua Di Parma bath products and soaps.  The only downside I would say is their breakfast. However, you can always have breakfast in one of the great Italian cafes close by the hotel. Do make sure to skip breakfast if you choose to visit this hotel.
