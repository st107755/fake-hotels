We stayed for 3 nights in a Venetian room which was furnished perfectly and the attention to detail is fantastic.  The public spaces are very grand which made us feel we were staying somewhere special. The hotel has a corridor of signed photos of famous guests which just added to the occasion. Worth taking your gym kit and using the small fitness room before heading for the high quality breakfast. The staff are very attentive and immaculately dressed and the views of the grand canal whilst eating breakfast is special and memorable.
