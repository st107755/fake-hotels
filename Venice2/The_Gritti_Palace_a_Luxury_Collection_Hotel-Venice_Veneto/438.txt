This was our final hotel as part of a Tauck tour of northern Italy.  It was certainly one of the best with its lovely furnishings and beautiful rooms.  We especially enjoyed having breakfast and lunch on their great "patio" overlooking the Grand Canal.  The prices are not for the faint of heart, but the food, service and especially the ambiance are all superb. The location of the hotel is wonderful for seeing the sights of Venice.  It is hard to find fault with this hotel if you don't mind paying the high prices!
