The Gritt’s manager and staff make this hotel exemplary. Yes, the location, food, and beautiful decor make this a rated 5 star hotel, but the test of a true 5 Star hotel is their assistance during a difficult issue. Sadly, my friend suffered a horrible accident off the hotel’s site and I can’t say enough about how helpful, warm, and sincere the entire staff were to us. The manager, Maurizio Figuccio,, not only thought of relataed issues, he took care of them.  For example, he took care of canceling our flight, hospital transportation, box food for hospital stay, arranging doctor visitation, Believe me, I never could have managed such a difficult medical emergency in a foreign country where I don’t speak Italian without Maurizio’s help. Thank you to the entire Gritti hotel!
