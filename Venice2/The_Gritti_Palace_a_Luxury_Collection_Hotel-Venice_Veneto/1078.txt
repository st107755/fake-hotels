My husband and I booked this hotel because it was an SPG property! I instantly fell in love with this hotel. Venice itself is such an unique and romantic destination and the Gritti Palace adds to the charm of this city. We were checked in promptly, everyone was sooo nice  and the hotel is so beautiful and charming.  Everything closes down in venice after like 9 pm, but my most favorite memory is sitting outside and enjoying a drink a long the water on the hotel's front porch. It was as romantic as it could get. If you;re going to Venice- there honestly is no better place you could stay.
