There's nothing like arriving via water taxi and having your bags lifted out upon arrival at the Gritti Palace. From the moment we stepped on the dock service was first class. The hotel was recently renovated. We could open the windows to hear the gondoleers singing throughout the day and in the evening we enjoyed a romantic birthday dinner on the water - where the staff pulled out all the stops thanks to the quality service of the Gritti palace and the perks of staying at a small luxury hotel. By far one of the best Starwood affiliated hotels we've been to. We also greatly appreciated the concierge's recommendation for dinner to include the free water taxi to Hotel Cipriani from San Marco for another memorable dinner.
