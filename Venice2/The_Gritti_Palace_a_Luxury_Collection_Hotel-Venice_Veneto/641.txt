An incredibly beautiful hotel! We arrived at ten in the morning in a private water taxi to smiles and greetings from the staff. The setting on the Grand Hotel is amazing. Things only got better! We were quickly checked in and as the very pleasant receptionist walked us to our room she informed us she had a surprise for us. We had been upgraded to a Grand Doge Canal suite!!! This has to have been the most beautiful suite we have ever stayed in. It is furnished with beautiful Venetian furniture, Old Master paintings ,and murano glass chandeliers. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was roomy with a very nice rain shower and Acque De Parma products. The staff at this hotel is superb and very welcoming. Umberto at the concierge desk booked a wonderful guide for us.Wish Iâ€¦
