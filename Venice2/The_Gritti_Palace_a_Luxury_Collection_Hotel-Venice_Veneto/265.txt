The room was fantastic.  We had a large suite that was completely restored, with a beautiful marble bathroom.  They delivered a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates.  The restaurant was fantastic too.  Everything was great until the last night and there was a water sprinkler leak at 1 AM.  It ruined my fiancee's sleep and our last day there.  For our inconvenience, they offered 20% off our food bills, which amounted to about 80EUR.  Not what I had in mind, then they reluctantly issued another 10,000 SPG points.  Their rating went down from 5* to 3* in my book.
