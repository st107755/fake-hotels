We usually prefer a more casual, understated style when selecting hotels. I don't care what my preference normally might be, this is just pure decadent luxury. They do what they do, and they do it quite well. I can ignore the snooty men who checked us in and helmed the concierge desk. I don't need to be validated. I do want to say that the young woman who handled our check out was lovely. She is a native Venitian and had recently returned to Venice after living in Florence. She was professional, yet warm and friendly. We were only there for one night, but it was a welcome respite during an very busy trip.
