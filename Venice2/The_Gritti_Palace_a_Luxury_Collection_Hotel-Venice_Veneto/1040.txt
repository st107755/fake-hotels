Could not fault this hotel in terms of decadence, opulence, sophistication and location.  Breakfast in the sun, overlooking the Grand Canal is probably the best in the area. Staff very professional.  Accommodation, food and drink good, but lavishly expensive, although you know this when you book.  I felt atmosphere was lacking in this hotel, the bed & pillows not comfy and for those reason alone I would not return to this hotel.  At least we can tick off we stayed at the Gritti Palace!
