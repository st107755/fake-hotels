My partner booked the Gritti  palace for an anniversary weekend in Venice and it was perfect. Recently redecorated, the interior is stunning, in keeping with its history.  Our room overlooked the church and adjacent square and was beautifully decorated with embroidered material on the walls. The bathroom was spacious and finished in pink and grey marble. The only minor fault was the bed (very wide) - it was two beds put together but there was a dip in the middle where they met. As is typical there are no tea or coffee facilities in the room (shame). Location is great, based on the grand canal, and there is a lovely bar which is on the front of the hotel so you can sit and watch life pass by on the busy canal. It is very close to the alilaguna stop called giglio which is usefulâ€¦
