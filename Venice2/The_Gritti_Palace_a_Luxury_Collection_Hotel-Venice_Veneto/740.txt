Grand Hotel with a long history in Venice. Well appointed in classic style, and rooms well sized and every amenity to hand. Beautiful interiors. Level of service is good as you may rightfully expect, and were very attentive throughout. Dining on the deck will remain a highlight, or indeed simply watching the world pass you by on the Grand Canal with a chilled glass of wine? Beautiful location next to a Gondola station and easy to find. Close to all the sights. Breakfast excellent, but did not dine in hotel on our three night visit.
