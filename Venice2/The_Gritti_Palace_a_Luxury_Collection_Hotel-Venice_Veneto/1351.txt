All the reviews are right, this is absolutely a first class establishment. The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Venice on the Grand Canal, its rooms and interiors are gorgeous and in pristine condition (just refurbished of course), public spaces and rooms are always spotless clean and service is as attentive and efficient you'd expect in such a place. If I had one caveat, it would be the restaurant. While certainly very decent, we would have expected a slightly higher caliber for a luxury hotel. But being that the hotel closed for over a year during the renovations and just reopened, it might be that the restaurant is still finding its groove. All in all, our stay at The Gritti Pleasant was blissful!
