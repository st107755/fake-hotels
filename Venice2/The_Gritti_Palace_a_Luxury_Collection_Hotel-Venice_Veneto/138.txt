Classy luxury is hard. Lots of places try - especially in Venice, one of the most high end tourist destinations in the world. But the sheer depth of history and quality of service at the Gritti is unsurpassed. A demanding clientele keeps them on their feet, and though the prices are breathtaking its worth it - something that's hard to say about anything else in Venice. I stayed in the Maria Callas suite, full of antique furniture, beautiful paintings and (a rarity for a hotel of this age) perfectly incorporated modern bathrooms. Also - 6000 euros a night. If you have it, spend it on this.
