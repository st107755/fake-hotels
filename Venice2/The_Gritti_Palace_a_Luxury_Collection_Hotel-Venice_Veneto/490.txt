Arriving by boat, this hotel is magical, it takes a day just to absorb all the history in the rooms let alone the rest of the hotel.  Its well positioned in a quiet area on one side and the Grand canal on the other.  The rooms are well provisioned and the suite we had was very well stocked, and we were given a wonderful bottle of champagne.  We stayed for the New Years celebrations which were breathtaking.  The bar serves excellent cocktails and the restaurant served some incredible meals.  Service overall was very good.
