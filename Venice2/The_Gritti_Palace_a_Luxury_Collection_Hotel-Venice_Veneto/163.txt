Riva lounge is located next to the restaurant club del doge on the same terrasse with the same lovely canal view. The lounge also belongs to the gritti palace. The lounge has a fresh and modern look, an upscale place but less formal as club del doge. The bellini is very good and their cocktail list is huge. I loved the bar menu which is avaliable from 12.00 -24.00 and has a good choice from salads, pasta and dessert, the price is about 30 euro for a plate. I prefered the menu to the one at club del doge which has a strong focus on seafood and fish and is very pricey (for dinner). Riva lounge is a wonderful place either for a cocktail or a lunch/dinner or both. And you get  much more for the price than at club del doge (at least for dinner).
