Amazing place!!!! Simply Amazing!   I stayed in a small suit and the rooms were sublime! Staff couldn't do enough! Decor and ambiance is luxurious! Breakfast on the canal was the best I've had...EVER!   But equally great for a drink on the canal, staff are friendly and down to earth! Don't be worried, just walk in and ask for a drink at the bar, yes it's â‚¬20 a drink, but for the setting, location and extras whilst drinking it's worth every euro! You will remember it forever!
