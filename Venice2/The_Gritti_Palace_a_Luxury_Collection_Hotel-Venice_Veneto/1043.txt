The hotel of my honeymoon! :) Very beautiful Venetian interior, wonderful breakfast with champagne.  Concierge at the top level. Our room came out the side of the canal. There were not as noisy and we were able to sleep well. Highly recommend this hotel to all honeymooners! :)  P.S. It is expensive one, but there are all hotels same category very expensive in Venice. The Venice is expensive itself!
