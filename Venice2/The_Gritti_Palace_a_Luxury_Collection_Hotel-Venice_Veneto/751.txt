This is a traditional "Palace" by the Grand Canal. The public areas are beautiful, our bedroom a Giglio bedroom looking out on to the side of the hotel was spacious and well designed. The marble tiled bathroom was terrific with two basins, a large shower cubicle and a separate bath. The toiletries were Aqua di Parma. Lighting was outstanding.  Service could not have been friendlier or more discreet. A top class world leading hotel of the old fashioned kind. Wonderful
