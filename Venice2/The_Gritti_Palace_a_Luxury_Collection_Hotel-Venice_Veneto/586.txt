Flawless in every way!! Friendly and helpful staff:-). Nicest suite I've ever stayed in, and I've stayed in nice places!  Can't wait to go back! We would have been happy eating at their restaurant for every meal, but we enjoyed amazing dinners out and about.  Wonderful shopping walking distance.   We loved going to the glass blowing island and the Lace island. When to a wonderful Opera a stone throw from the hotel.
