We spent three days at the Gritti Palace in late October. It was an amazing experience. Great rooms,great service, great location!!!! The ambiance was unequaled. We spent many hours eating and drinking on the beautiful terrace watching the activity on the Grand Canal. I would recommend this hotel without reservation.
