I'm an avid Starwood fan and typically stay in Starwood hotels while traveling for work several times monthly. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to reserve a room at The Gritti Palace using a reasonable amount of SPG points.   Our room was quintessentially Venetian and more spacious than expected. Beautifully appointed with Murano glass, marble, upholstered walls...   The staff provided exceptional service. That isn't always the case when using points, but we felt welcomed.   I highly recommend The Gritti Palace. It's an experience like no other in Venice. The views aren't bad either.
