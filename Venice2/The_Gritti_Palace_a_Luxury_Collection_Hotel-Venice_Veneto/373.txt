My wife and I spent three nights there last week, and had a wonderful experience.  The location is ideal (and is right by one of the traghetto spots along the Grand Canal).  The furnishings are gorgeous. The bar is killer. And the service was splendid. I can't account for the experiences of some of the reviewers who sensed arrogance or rudeness--our impressions were quite the opposite.  The only meals we had there were for breakfast, but those were great.  The place has a charm that really won us over.    Yes, it's pricey---but if it's in your budget you should give it a go. (A celebrity fashion designer was staying there while we were--if it's good enough for him.....).   Anyway, we hope to return someday.
