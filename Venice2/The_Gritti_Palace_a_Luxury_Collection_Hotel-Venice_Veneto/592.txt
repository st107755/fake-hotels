We had a lovely stay at the Gritti Palace. We were on our honeymoon so we were willing to splurge, and that probably made a difference as everything at the hotel (transport, meals, etc) was very expensive. That said, the hotel itself is beautiful and our room was lovely. We arrived early in the morning and used the hotel water taxi service which was beyond easy and a great intro to Venice. We had an easy check in and while our room wasn't ready, everything was handled so we could enjoy the city. We had a meal in the Club del Doge restaurant on our first night which was pricey but solid and the view/experience was amazing. I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone traveling to Venice.
