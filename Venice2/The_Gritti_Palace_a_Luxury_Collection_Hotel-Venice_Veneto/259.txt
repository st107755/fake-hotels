We were here end of May. This hotel went above and beyond any stay we have ever had. It was the perfect end to an already amazing vacation.   The room has high ceilings, and provided a spacious feel, even though the room wasn't all that big. The size is adequate though. Everything from the sheets, to the chandelier was top notch quality. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom was floor to ceiling marble. Amazing shower head and luxurious toiletries. What more can you ask for?   The Gritti is located right on the grand canal, occupying one most prestigious address. Can't beat the location. The restaurant was delicious! I can't fault them for anything. Lastly, the service. The hotel went above and beyond to take care of everything. It was the most pleasant stay.
