The location of this hotel was great---walked all over Venice. Rooms were very spacious! The bar and breakfast buffet were both outstanding, with great views of the grand canal.  Concierge was very helpful with good restaurant advice, as well as interesting places to visit. We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel.
