Venice is an odd, slightly crazy and definitely busy city. The huge influx of tourists and cruise ships can impact almost everything you do. BUT at Gritti Palace none of this matters. It is a sublime hotel with exceptional staff, especially in the restaurant. The breakfast team were outstanding but at lunch, right on the Grand Canal, it was like being a rock star. This is a wonderful place to soak up the splendour of Venice and avoid the crush that happens around St Mark's. The rooms are wonderful along with the bathroom and linens. My room was noisy due to staff prep early in the morning which was the only negative. Worth every cent, it is a fabulous Italian experience. Thank you.
