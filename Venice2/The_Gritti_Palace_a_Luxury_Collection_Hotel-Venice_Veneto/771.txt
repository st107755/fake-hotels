Just great.  Perfect place to stay.  Pulled up by High Speed Water Taxi.  Bags simply taken straight through.  First thing - forget about tips.  You have already paid top dollar; they know this.  They will just give you first class service.  All the rooms are great; superbly appointed.  Lots of little complimentary things.  Breakfast is just the best.  Cocktails on the terrace simply made the trip - ooo expensive, but by that stage you are in hook line and sinker. Perfect view, service and drinks.  Ahhhh Venice!  What a place.   Hotel Gritti - what a hotel
