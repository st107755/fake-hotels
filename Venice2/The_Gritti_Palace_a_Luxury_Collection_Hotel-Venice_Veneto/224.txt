The hotel is amazing. Great experience from the moment you step off your water taxi. It’s as nice as can be. Fully restored with all the charm intact. Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.   Rooms were really well furnished with beautiful marble bathrooms. We had two because of being with our three boys. One was an upgrade to a suite which was super nice. We were on the interior which meant we looked out on the canal at the back. This was actually great because you could watch and listen to the gondolas going by below you if you opened the windows.   The concierge staff was super helpful. We ate at the restaurants they recommended and each spot gave us a drink or something on the house. We also had cocktails each afternoon and breakfast in the am on the hotels grand…
