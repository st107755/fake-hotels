Hard to imagine a better location for a hotel in Venice, as it's located five minutes walk from Piazza San Marco, six minutes from the Accademia Bridge, seven minutes from the Rialto Bridge. The service was impeccable, great breakfast. The downside was that the bathroom which was recently updated is not well thought out. The toilet is in a niche, without a door. If one has to use the toilet, the rest of the large bathroom is unusable. A sliding door is needed. Also, the shower should have a grab bar for safety.
