After a long refurbishment the gritti is once again the top in town. Back to its original splendour with a magnifient location, a good service and nice amenities is the place to be in town. I have not tried the new aman but for sure this is a place where you want to be Back. Breakfast is breathtaking, an incredible moment before starting a day
