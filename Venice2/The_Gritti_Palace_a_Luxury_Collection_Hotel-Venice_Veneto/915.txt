I was lucky enough to spend 4 nights at this SPG property and it was wonderful! From the room which was decorated like a palace...Murano glass fixtures, fabric "wallpaper," marble bath and every need thought of. Very attentive and friendly staff in a great location. High end shopping is just out your door. Do note that you can only get to the hotel via a water taxi but I suppose that's Venice! Highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind the price.
