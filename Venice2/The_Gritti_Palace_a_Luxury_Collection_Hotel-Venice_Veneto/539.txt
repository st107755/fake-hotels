I heard so much about this Hotel and quite honestly, had very high expectations BUT never ever expected it to be so beyond my imagination!!! The Gritti Palace is an old Palazzo and it's just stunning visually but the best part is their staff, wow - they really made me feel at home immediately and thru out the stay!!   The suite on the 2nd floor didn't have the front view of the Grande Canale but a cute view over a side canale with a sliver to watch the larger one. The location is the best, just a stone throw to Sant Marco Piazza and the Doge Palace together with all major shopping. If you turn left instead towards Accademica another part of Venice is unfolding, my favorite!   Roomservice - Great! Breakfast buffet had a wonderful spread and a beautiful setting, worth everyâ€¦
