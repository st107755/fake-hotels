I stayed for 3 nights at the Gritti Palace in Feb 2016 and the hotel was kind enough to prepare a special suite room for me and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Arrived during the high tide and rainy days, soaking wet after getting off the boat and was greeted with wonderful Venetian hospitality. The room was very beautiful, a different kind of beauty compared to the Danieli though, but equally splendid. Hanged out at the outdoor cafe the next day after late breakfast, and it was very breathtaking.. The level of the hospitality and room and amenities were top notch! Highly recommended hotel in Venice.
