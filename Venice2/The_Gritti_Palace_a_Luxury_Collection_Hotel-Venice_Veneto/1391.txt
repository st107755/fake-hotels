In one of the most spectacular cities in the world sits one of the most spectacular hotels. A former renaissance palace from the 16th century. Original priceless antiques and art everywhere and in rooms. Our room was on the grand canal and had a small Juliet balcony. Quite romantic and astounding view. Restaurant on the grand canal is awesome. Have breakfast there and watch the daily life if the locals on the grand and side canals. Expensive but worth it. An experience like none other.
