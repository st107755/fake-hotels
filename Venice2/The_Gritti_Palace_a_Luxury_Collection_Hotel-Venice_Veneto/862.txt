This hotel is simply amazing.  I know it costs a lot and I didn't pay (Starpoints), but it could be worth the splurge. That said I probably wouldn't pay 1000 Euros especially if I wasn't SPG platinum (in order to get the other benefits), but 600 or so I would and I suspect most people that stay at the Gritti don't have a budget constraint.  A few of many highlights.  -Amazing location -Never once felt like a second class citizen because I was staying on points -Confirmed a suite upgrade (SPG 75 benefit) -Chocolates and Wine waiting in my room upon arrival -15 minute free foot massage given at the Aqua di Parma Spa -One of the best breakfast locations anywhere and really high quality stuff -Lovely bar with a great (albeit expensive) collection of champagne by the glass -Free shoeâ€¦
