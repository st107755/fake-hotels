What a beautiful hotel! We were upgraded to the Royal Suite and it was the most magnificent room with a long balcony over-looking the Grand Canal. The suite was richly decorated with brocade, velvet, Murano chandeliers and gilt-framed paintings yet it all felt fresh thanks to the recent renovations. The marble bathrooms were amazing. The hotel terrace is the best place to dine along the Canal and the Aqua di Parma Spa is just icing on the cake. Service was excellent. Would visit Venice again just to stay at this hotel again!
