We went on a two week trip and stayed in 5 different 5 star hotels along the way. The Gritti Palace by far was the gem of them all. The Venetian Style room we had overlooking the canal was breathtaking. We had breakfast and lunch at the hotel almost everyday. We decided because everything else we had eaten at the hotel was so good that we would have our engagement dinner at the gritti, it did not disappoint! The service at the hotel from top to bottom is what keeps the prestige of The Gritti Palace at its best. This is a true 5 star luxury hotel. If you have the opportunity, stay at the Palace. I promise you, It will be a stay you'll never forget.
