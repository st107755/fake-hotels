It's everything a hotel should be - great location, beautiful rooms and wonderful staff. But the best part is breakfast or cocktails on patio overlooking the Grand Canal with a gorgeous view!! So wonderful to watch the many boats and gondolas going by. It's also across from the Guggenheim museum and you can take a water shuttle from the stand just outside the hotel and take the boat right across to the museum.
