Magnificent, but only 4* if u count value & practicality. Beautiful, luxurious, elegant. Efficient and charming staff to check you in (Carlotta was both beautiful and charming) Lovely canal front bar and restaurant. A bit stiff and overly formal. Doorman doesn't open front door. Suite is so full of antiquities and trinkets there's no place to put anything.  Yes I had a lovely visit. I appreciated the excellent complimentary red bottle of wine and two fine wine glasses. But it's just too formal for me and 1140 euros per night is no bargain. Kind of like a Stepford wife beautiful to look at and perfect, but I did not feel the love.
