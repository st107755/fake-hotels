From the moment you enter you just know that you are staying in an exceptional hotel. The staff are so polite, attentive and relaxed you cannot help but to feel completely at ease. The decor is Venetian and very ornate. Our room was immaculate (with complimentary wine) and the bed was very comfortable. The restaurant overlooking the canal allowed us to watch the world go by while eating exceptional food and enjoying exceptional service. The hotel is conveniently located only a few minutes walk from St Marks Square and Rialto bridge. Our stay was worth every penny!
