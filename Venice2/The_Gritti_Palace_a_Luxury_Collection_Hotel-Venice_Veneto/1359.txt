Most travellers would be so frustrated having a flight cancellation on the eve of their flight, not me. We had been waiting for a delayed flight only for it to be cancelled completely!! Our port of call was to return to Venice and find somewhere to stay for the remaining night. As it happened The Gritti Palace had some amazing last minute rooms up for grabs at around a 60% discount! It was such a bargain. The hotel itself is mind blowing, we took a water taxi to the front door entrance and disembarked the water to rest on the beautiful terrace which looks out to the Grand Canal. The hotel is splendid with mirrors and lighting made from Murano glass throughout the building. Bedrooms are second to none, very large and extremely comfy. We didn't have a room overlooking the canalâ€¦
