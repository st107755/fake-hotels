This hotel is perfect. That simple. The location is superb and right on the Grand Canal. There's a reason why it's the most prestigious in Venezia (or #2 to Cipriani?). It's a grande dame in every way and totally worth of that title. The rooms are gorgeous with all the accompaniments you'd expect in a super luxe hotel. Gorgeous silks, bathrooms, marble etc. etc. And of course it is a palace. So you feel like you're more in a "home" vs. a hotel. The serve is what you'd expect; hushed luxury all the way. And the bar is of course a treat for an after dinner aperitif which you'll need given the superb food which abounds. Get a water taxi to and from for your trip; it is expensive but given that it'll take you 2 hours or more each way, I think it's worth it and an awesome experience.â€¦
