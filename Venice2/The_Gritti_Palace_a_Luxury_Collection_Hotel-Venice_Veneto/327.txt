After a 20 minute water taxi ride from the airport we pulled up at the Gritti's private dock. The bags were whisked away and we checked in. The greeting really was very friendly and we even received a room upgrade with views over the water which was much appreciated. There room was fabulous with an enormous bed, high ceilings and a beautifully appointed bathroom.   The food was excellent although breakfast is expensive. For what we ate it would have been cheaper to eat a la carte rather than going for the all inclusive buffet option so check out the prices before  you pay.  Both my wife and I had lovely massages at the Spa.  This hotel really is 5 star. The attention to detail and levels of service are top notch and I would definitely stay again if in Venice
