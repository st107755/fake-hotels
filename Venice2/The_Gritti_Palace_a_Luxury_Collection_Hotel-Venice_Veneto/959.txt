What more can you say that hasn't already been said. We had a fabulous 2 night stay here to celebrate my wife's birthday. From the moment we arrived on the jetty we were well looked after. Beautiful rooms, great service and having breakfast on the terrace watching life on the Grand Canal was just perfect. Thank you
