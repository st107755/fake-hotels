My husband and I signed up for a cooking class to celebrate my husband's birthday.  It was one of the best presents I've ever given him!  My husband cooks--I don't (lucky me!)--and we both had a wonderful experience with our teacher, Franco, and one other couple.  We made an appetizer of dried cod (called Baccala), risotto with scampi (a must-have in Venice when they're in season), poached sea bass, and a grand mariner souffl√©.  It was so much fun, and so delicious.  Franco was warm, knowledgable, highly skilled and authentically Italian!  If you go to Venice, stay at the Gritti. And if you stay at the Gritti, take the cooking class.
