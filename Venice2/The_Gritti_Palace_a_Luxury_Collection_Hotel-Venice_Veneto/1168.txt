Everything about our stay at the hotel was lovely- breakfast on the terrace is an incredible experience and the rooms are very tasteful and the location is very central for San Marco island. The only downfall to our stay was a very rude guest service personal saying our check out was at 10am. I have stayed at luxury hotels around the world and never encountered a 10am check out. We asked for a late check out ( even 11am would have been appreciated) but were not given any other options. Why on earth a hotel would need 5 hours to turn a room is beyond me but it left a sour taste to our experience here. 10am is very unreasonable in a 5 star hotel.
