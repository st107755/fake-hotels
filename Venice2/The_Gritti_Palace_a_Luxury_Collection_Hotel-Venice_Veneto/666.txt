This hotel is certainly the height of luxury, with exquisite decor throughout. The rooms are and  beautifully decorated, with modernised bathrooms, luxurious fittings and comfortable surroundings.  The staff are very helpful and friendly, without being overbearing.  The wonderful terrace on the canal must be enjoyed with a Bellini in hand.  Location is very close to the main attractions of Venice and easily accessible from the canal vaparetto.  We enjoyed breakfast, although the cost was steep.  Rooms are not cheap at his hotel, but it is a once in a lifetime experience to stay in one of the old palaces on the canal. It was a wonderfully romantic stay for us.
