This hotel is simply perfect. I came to Europe for a birthday trip, and this was by far my favorite location. The location is great, just step off the boat and you're at the hotel. The service is absolutely fantastic, from the concierge to the bellman. The food on the deck is great, but a little pricy, even for a 5 star hotel. The rooms are great, very Venetian. Overall, if you going to Venice and looking for a hotel to stay in, look no further. The Gritti Palace is a wonderful experience for anyone and everyone.
