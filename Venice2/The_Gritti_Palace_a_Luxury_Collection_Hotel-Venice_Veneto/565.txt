This property has undergone a multi million dollar renovation and it shows it.  It is full of Murano chandeliers and wall sconces to the point that one does not know where to look first.  In addition it sits on the Grand Canal and its outdoor restaurant and bar are not to be missed. If you can afford it, you will always remember it fondly.
