Even if you do not stay, visit the bar to have a drink by the Grand Canal and spot the celebrities.  Our room was excellent and spacious and the staff (especially the concierge) were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  No problem if you only speak English.  If you go by boat the it has its own docking station.
