The best part about this hotel is the restaurant, and dining right on the Grand Canal.  It's one of those perfect Venice moments to be served by waiters in white jackets while watching the boats go by.  Venice can be a real zoo, but this hotel is sufficiently away from the hoards but still close enough to the sights.  The service is outstanding, and what you'd expect of a hotel of this quality.  The decor is also fitting of the Venice vibe, somewhat gothic, and quality all around.   Because it's right on the Canal, it's an easy water taxi to the airport and cruise terminal.
