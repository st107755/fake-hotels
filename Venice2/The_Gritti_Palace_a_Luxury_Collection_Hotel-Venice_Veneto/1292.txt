I've recently been to The Gritti Palace for a "honey-moon" type trip to celebrate my 24th Wedding Anniversary and had the most amazing experience in relation to services. Before I chose the hotel for the special occasion I did a lot of reserach and noticed that The Gritti Palace had a lot of excellent comments about the level of services. This drove my decision to choose The Gritti Palace and I can tell you I can only corroborate all the good excellent comments I've read before and obviously I had to add mine too! I very rarely make a review but made sure I spent the time to do this one. Trust me it is worth spending a bit more to stay at The Gritti. Although I have always loved Venice I used to say that level of services were not really great as there is more demand than supplyâ€¦
