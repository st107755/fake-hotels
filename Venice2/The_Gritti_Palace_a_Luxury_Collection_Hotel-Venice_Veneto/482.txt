We visited this Hotel yesterday and it is every bit as good as the best reviews indicate. Acknowledged by the barman when we entered the bar and sat in the bar terrace overlooking the Grande Canal. Drinks promptly arrived with some nibbles. All the bar staff great as of course is the lovely setting. Moved next door to the Terrace restaurant for lunch and blown away with the service, setting, menu choices and "big" wine list. The Restaurant Floor manager was fantastic as were the support staff. Di had the salmon whilst I had the tasting platter - brilliant simple food served brilliantly. Next up was the lobster pasta and the pork chop with once again fantastic. Excellent wines by the glass selections for both courses. Then the "big" wine list as I wished to try an aged Toscanaâ€¦
