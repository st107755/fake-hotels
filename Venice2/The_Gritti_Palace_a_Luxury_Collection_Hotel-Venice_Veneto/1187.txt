We booked to stay at the Gritti Palace in Venice for 2 nights and wished we had stayed longer. The room although situated at the side of hotel looking over a courtyard was nicely appointed with excellent amenities and some very nice touches, (lovely complimentary bottle of red wine) in a venetian style, suitable for our stay. The staff were very friendly, courteous & efficient, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfasts (included in our package) & evening meals were delightful. The Ma√Ætre d was excellent and evening meals were orchestrated with style & panache, and right by the Grand Canal, you could not have asked for any more. Thoroughly recommend staying at the Gritti Palace.
