What an outstanding renovation work they have done. From arrival to departure, they will care to all your needs. They will have those special attentions and little gifts that make you feel like you are being pampered. There is no better place than the floating terrasse on the grand canal to enjoy the sun, a lunch, and aperitif, and escape the crowds at the end of a day of visits. Venice is an amazing place and museum city, but it gathers large crowds, and the Gritti will give you a wonderful hideout to settle and feel like you are a part of the city.  Have a wonderful stay
