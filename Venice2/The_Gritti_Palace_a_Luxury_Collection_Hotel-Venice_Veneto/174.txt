My wife and I just finished a four-day stay at the Gritti Palace. Many reviews here praise the hotel’s location, guest rooms, restaurant, bar — I heartily concur. All are immaculate. I wish to underscore the quality of the staff, from the way we were received upon arrival by water taxi (a must) to the friendly, expert help from the concierges. A highlight was the half-day cooking school. Franco is a master. The Gritti exceeded our expectations, which were high.
