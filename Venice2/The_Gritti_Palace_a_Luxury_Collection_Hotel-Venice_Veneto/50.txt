I stayed at the Gritti Palace with my husband in August and it did not disappoint.  From check in to check out the hotel staff did an amazing job.  Did I mention this was the 1 hotel I have always wanted to stay at, which was made possible with Marriott Marriott points.  The location on the grand canal was easy access to everything.
