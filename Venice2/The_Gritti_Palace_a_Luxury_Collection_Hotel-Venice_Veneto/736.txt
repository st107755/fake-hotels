Wonderful hotel with a staff and service that is simply excellent in every way. One of the best hotels I have stayed at. Had my family there to celebrate a birthday, and it could not have been better. The hotel has a total control over every detail, and I found them fantastic at organizing pick-up and tours. You would think that with this standard, they would be more expensive than an "outside" company, but this is not the case. Use them as much as you can, Its worth it!
