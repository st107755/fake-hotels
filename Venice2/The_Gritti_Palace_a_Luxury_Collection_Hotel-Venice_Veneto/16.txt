The Gritti Palace lives up to the 5* billing with great staff in all areas of hotel that made our holiday so special. The bar staff ( Andrea especially),  Restaurant team , reception and cleaning all do a fantastic job of making everything amazing without being overly fussy.  Perfectly located for St Marks square, excellent shops and only 10 minutes from the Rialto bridge. Amazing value for money, yes itâ€™s not cheap but it better to pay a little more and experience the most wonderful hotel In Venice!! Thank you so much for a truly memorable stay.
