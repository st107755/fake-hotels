We stayed three nights here and cannot speak highly enough of the hotel. Excellent service, a beautiful building and very good location.  The breakfasts were very good indeed, dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the terrace bar on the Grand Canal was a great spot.  There is a reasonable sized and well equipped fitness room.  We were upgraded to a suite which had a great view out on to the Grand Canal which was so good that we ordered room service one night just to enjoy the setting.  We've been to Cipriani and Danele and I think the Gritti is much better.
