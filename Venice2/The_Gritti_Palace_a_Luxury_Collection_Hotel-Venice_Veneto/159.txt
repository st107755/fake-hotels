LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!  You can get to everything easily, the views are spectacular and the service is unbeatable.  Our room was beautifully decorated, the hotel lobby was gorgeous, the bar area was elegant and fun.  Gondola dock right at the hotel for easy transfer to and from airport and restaurants.  Truly my favorite hotel in Venice -- and did  mention how awesome the hotel staff is!
