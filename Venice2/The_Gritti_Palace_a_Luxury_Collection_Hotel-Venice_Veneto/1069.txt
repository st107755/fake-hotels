We stayed here with my daughter and her boyfriend for 3 nights in January, 2015, for my Birthday. What a glorious hotel, so elegant, charming and welcoming. It is high end, but it felt so comfortable, easy to stay in and to enjoy it's beautiful amenities and setting on the Grand Canal. You could not feel out of place here unless you are uncomfortable with yourself! Our bedroom had a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal, and we were within easy walking distance of St Marks Square and the gorgeous Doges Palace and across the water, the Guggenheim. Harry's Bar was also near by, great for Bellini's!, and a handy gondola stop right outside the hotel should you so desire! My daughters room was not canal view, but so beautifully decorated this did not matter. Ironing service came backâ€¦
