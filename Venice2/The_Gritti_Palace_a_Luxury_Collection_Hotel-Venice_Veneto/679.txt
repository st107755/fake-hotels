The Gritti Palace is a superb hotel.  We traveled as a family (2 young adult children) and had two rooms.  The location is perfect and the food excellent.  The waitstaff was exceptional - pleasant, responsive and capable.  The concierges were terrific, arranging lunches, dinners, airport boat transfer, etc.  Finally, my son left his sport jacket in the closet of his room when we checked out - I had an email from the concierge the next day with a DHL tracking number and his sport jacket arrived 2 days later!
