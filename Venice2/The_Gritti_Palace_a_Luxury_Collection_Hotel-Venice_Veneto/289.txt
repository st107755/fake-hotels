Our stay was exceptional. The view from the terrace dinner restaurant is as outstanding as the service and food. The headwaiter is excellent and does his utmost to please. The concierge team are very knowledgable and helpful and organised some great trips for us.  Our room was very well designed and luxourious. Every detail has been well planned and is well executed in this hotel.
