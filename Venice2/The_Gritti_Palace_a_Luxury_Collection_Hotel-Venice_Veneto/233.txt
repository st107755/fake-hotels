Stayed towards end of July on SPG points as Gold level guest.  We were treated fantastically by staff and they gave us a 1st floor room which was our preference.  The room quality was superb and the location was fantastic.  The A/C quality as some have mentioned isn't exactly going to get you chilly, but it works.    The rooms were well apportioned and well updated.  High class stuff all the way.  The Riva bar was outstanding. You need to be on the lookout for a table outside as they go quickly in the evening.    We only ate breakfast once, as gold there is no free breakfast. It was offered at 41E per person per day, but honestly the a-la-carte menu was plenty and represented a fantastic bargain all things considered.   Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
