If one visits Venice,and YOU should,a hotel that adds to the experience should be the choice. Our lavish,and I DO mean LAVISH,suite on the Grand Canal,meant it was always showtime,with the throbbing day time life on the most interesting waterway on planet. The night views were fabulous also,with the churches and boats. The FOOD in the included breakfast buffet was to tax the imagination.and to dine there on water added to the wonderous ambiance.  The evening dining,which we did once,was superb. I must say,the concierge was TOO much. Straight out of central casting in manner and appearence,dashing,with true Italian flair. He helped us greatly,arraqnging speed boat,etc. We dealt with another fine guy also at the desk,who did great by us.  To US,the Gritti IS venice!!   â€¦
