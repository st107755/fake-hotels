My husband and I stayed for one night in August to start our two week Italian holiday and the Gritti was by far the best hotel we stayed in (including the Hotel Caruso in Ravello). Arrived via private water taxi, no need to book in advance, short walk from airport to docks 110 euro and taxis are there waiting. Paid for the most basic room and was upgraded on arrival to canal view which was amazing and made the experience with the gondoliers and hustle and bustle of the grand canal to look out on. Superb service from check in to the waiters to the concierge. Had lunch at restaurant which was worthwhile-pasta a little salty but good overall, if you book on whatahotel.com will include $100 food and beverage credit for this. Breakfast that was included was the best we had at anyâ€¦
