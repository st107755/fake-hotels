When you go to have lunch at a luxury hotel And you ask for a Caesar salad you are trying to get something simple but really well done. In fact is a simple dish that it’s supposed to be more o less the same all around the world and if someone tries to innovate you except the best. Well I hadn’t. Boiled small pieces of chicken (leftovers?) instead of “grilled chicken breast” promoted at the menu, tomato (?), no dress at all and pieces of cheese (?) instead of Parmesan. Really disappointed.
