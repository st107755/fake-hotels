Stayed here with my husband 14-16 April 2016 On arrival we were welcomed by the fantastic staff and immediately upgraded. All the rooms throughout the hotel are fabulous. the restoration is marvelous. All the staff are friendly and extremely helpful.  I just can't fault it at all.  We felt so at home there.  I had the best sleep in years.  Thank you Gritti Palace.
