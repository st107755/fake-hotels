The Gritti Palace is likely one of the most memorable hotels. Many many years ago, my parents stayed here and came home raving. All these years later, we decided to try the storied Gritti Palace, and expected it to be lovely. Beyond!  The friendly staff greeted us and check in was easy and informative.  (Helpful since we had a very long flight from Los Angeles) Our room faces the river and the decor is absolutely stunning. The photos do not do it justice. Silk upholstered walls, elegant furnishings and the marble bath stocked with Acqua de Parma product...molto bene! I'm in love with the Gritti Palace. If you can treat yourself to this beautiful indulgence, you will not be disappointed and will remember it always. You will be treated with care. This is truly 5 star luxury.
