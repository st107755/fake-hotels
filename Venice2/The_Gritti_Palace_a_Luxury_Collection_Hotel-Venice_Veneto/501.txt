Deserting the Danieli for once, we chose its rather grander sibling and were delighted with the welcome, the beautiful suite, the public areas, the service, the location and indeed the whole experience.  It was extremely hard for me to fault anything. (Perhaps the gym was a little smaller than I would have liked, but this IS Italy!)  I was taken with the attention to detail: for example, the second lavatory in our suite was clad with dramatic floor to ceiling marble slabs which were matched perfectly so the grain from one met up with the grain from its neighbour.  And the washbasin was carved from a single block of marble (or was it perhaps basalt?).    Expensive but sooooo enjoyable. (The restaurant, Club del Doge, is reviewed separately.)
