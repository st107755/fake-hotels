This hotel ,and it feels rather crass to describe it in such mundane terms ,is a rather special place.    This is a luxurious classy hotel which comes with the smooth service you would expect . Its simply beautiful dining room and bar are stunning stuffed with antiques class and an old money old world feel. The terraces on the canal are perfect for drinks or any meal. Drink in the beauty all around you and enjoy the central location which makes getting to the opera or Guggenheim easy . A gondola ferry right beside the hotel takes you across the Grand Canal for â‚¬2.  Room service is very reasonable too. This hotel makes you feel that you have made it and life is glorious. It's not cheap but if you can manage it just go. Life is too short and you won't regret it.
