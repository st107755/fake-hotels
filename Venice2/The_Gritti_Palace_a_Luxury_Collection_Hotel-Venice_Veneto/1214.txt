My wife and I did a two day break in Venice staying at the Gritti palace for the first time. We had a deluxe room overlooking the grand canal. Probably the hotels best feature is the superb terrace overlooking the canal, we could have sat their all day drinking Bellini cocktails and just watching the gondaliers and life go by. The breakfast (continental buffet included) and dinner (try fresh fish if they have it) were excellent and the service impeccable. Internal decor is very Venetian with beautiful ornate glass everywhere. Only two negatives - the coffee was a bit stewed in the morning (recommend you go for the restretto and hot milk which is freshly made) and the room was a little expensive for the size (although being Venice everything is expensive!). Overall a lovely hotelâ€¦
