So, let's just get the imperfections out of the way: we had to wait quite a bit for our room, and the restaurant delayed our dinner order by an hour and got it wrong, making one of us have to order something else.  You could be wondering: then why on earth would I give it a 5 star?  Because they more than made up for it.  It is an incredible and historic property, with unbelievable rooms, service, location, and just Venetian perfection.  We could not have stayed at a better place.  Having breakfast on that terrace is like nothing else.  The art in the place is awe inspiring.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else now when we hopefully return.
