We visited Venice to celebrate our Ruby wedding and what a visit it turned out to be staying at this amazing hotel.The location is breathtaking overlooking the Grand Canal, the service faultless and everyone so friendly and helpful.We were blessed with glorious sunshine which just added to the beauty of this glorious city.
