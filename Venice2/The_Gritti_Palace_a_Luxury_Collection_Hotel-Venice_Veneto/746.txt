Sometimes it is worth blowing the bank - a stay at The Gritti palace is one of those occasions. The location is unsurpassed (make sure you get a water taxi from the airport to truly appreciate it) and the service magnificent.  A room upgrade to a suite was a wonderful bonus with one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have experienced. The decor befits this amazing building.  Having breakfast on the terrace overlooking the grand canal is true luxury.
