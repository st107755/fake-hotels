My wife and I stayed here for three nights.  Upon arrival we were expertly escorted into a secondary room, welcomed by management and informed of the logistics of our stay. Our room was overlooking the main canal and each morning it was truly delightful to look out on to the scene - we also very much enjoyed the experience from the deck eating breakfast - something to remember.  The room itself was lavishly and ornately laid out. The breakfast display and quantity was excellent. Staff were very pleasant and helpful at all times. If you arrive from the train station you can easily and at minimum cost catch the river taxi service - it's about four or five stops down the canal. Everyone dealing with tourists knows this hotel so there is no issue with directions.  Take on board thatâ€¦
