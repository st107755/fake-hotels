The Gritti is exactly what we expected and wanted in a temporary residence in Venice.  The staff attentive and informed, without being overbearing.  The room overlooking the Grand Canal was well worth the rate.  My wife and I spent four nights at the Gritti and I wouldn't change a thing.  The breakfast was the best we've had in Italy.  Wonderful location near San Marco Square, and near the Academia bridge.  Easy access to everywhere.  Perhaps the only drawback is that it is not a very lively place when it comes to interaction with other guests.  It seemed that most of the guests kept to themselves while we were there during Carnival, which was a little surprising, but not entirely unexpected in a high end hotel.  We definitely recommend this hotel, and will absolutely visit itâ€¦
