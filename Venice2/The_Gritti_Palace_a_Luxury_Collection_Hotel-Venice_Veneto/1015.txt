We visited the Gritti Palace Hotel for lunch today, the restaraunt is outside, level with Grand Canal,what a fantastic setting, with the Gondula's and the water taxi's. This weekend was the boat festival and very picturesque. The food at restaraunt was extreamley good and the service superb. Venice is a beautiful city, but very expensive and very busy, many places to explore and certainly a walking city.
