It has been really well refurbished and the rooms are excellent. You pay a very hefty price - E1200 per night for our room: very spacious but no view.  Some service was good and friendly but then there were two episdoes of dreadful service and sadly we witnessed others having similiar experiences.  Our second drinks order at the bar that didnt arrive for about 30 minutes and a breakfast order which was not only wrong but delivered about 40 minutes late (after the maitre d had twice had to chase it up).  The service was so bad that I dont think I could recommend it.
