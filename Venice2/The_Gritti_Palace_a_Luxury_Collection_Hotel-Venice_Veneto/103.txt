Beautiful in every detail and the service is excellent. Breakfast on the Grand Canal is a treat for the senses. Housekeeping is excellent and the concierge desk is there to assist you with all your questions and reservations. Each time we visit Venice it is heartbreaking to see the water damage to the buildings, but still perhaps there is hope.
