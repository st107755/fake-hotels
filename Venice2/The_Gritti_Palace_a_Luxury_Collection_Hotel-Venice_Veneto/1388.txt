Before i used my Starwood Points for a Hotel in Venice I checked the Reviews,  I had stayed at the Hotel Daniel  a year earlier an wanted to try The Gritti Palace.  After reading some reviews I started to just book the Hotel Daniel instead.  But since they had just finished a complete remodel of the facility i decided to give it a try.  I am glad to report that not only is the property remodeled it is better than new with all the new wireless, TV''s, showers etc , but it still retains all of the old qualities that make it special.  And to those reviews that say the staff is stuffy and rude is not with i encountered.  All i can say is it was the most friendly and efficient staff I have seen in  a LONG time.  Everyone spoke to you as you passed,they know your name at the frontâ€¦
