My family and I stayed here on SPG points.  I am a platinum member and the Gritti Palace treated us like royalty.  The suite we stayed in was unbelievable.  All marble bathrooms, a museum-like sitting room with balconies overlooking the Grand Canal.  This hotel truly is a palace and the room was the most beautiful, opulent and comfortable I have ever been in, anywhere.  We'll remember our experience here forever!
