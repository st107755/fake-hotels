I have been to the hotel three times and every time I've been treated as royalty. I love its location. Not too far from San Marcos Square, but far enough to avoid the crowds. It is also next to one of the main condole embarkation points. It is so enjoyable to sit at the edge of the Grand Canal while enjoying dinner and especially breakfast. The rooms are very nice. Obviously some are better than others. I have never had a room on the Grand Canal itself but I understand they are beautiful.
