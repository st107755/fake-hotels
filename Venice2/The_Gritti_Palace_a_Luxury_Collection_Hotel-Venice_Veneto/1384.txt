We have just returned from three days at the Gritti Palace which we enjoyed immensely.  A lovely hotel in a super location, and the staff are uniformly excellent.  The restoration has been very successful. This is one of the best located hotels on the Grand Canal because it fronts directly on the water (others look towards the water over busy promenades and waterbus stops) and also has a terrace, and the view from it would be hard to beat.
