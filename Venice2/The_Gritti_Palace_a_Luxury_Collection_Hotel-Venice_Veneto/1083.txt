This review is a tough one because I thought I had already seen the mountain top (Portrait Firenze).  Guess this is just a different mountain top because this hotel rocks from start to finish.  The check in was incredibly detailed and highly personal.  The entire process took well over 20 minutes.  Huge kudos to, Pierluigi Boschian.  He was incredibly meticulous in every detail, the history of the hotel, the spa, the key process, the window locks, just everything, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The room was entirely Venetian, totally ornate.    Not my thing, but it grew on me rather quickly.  The bathroom was very nice, again, ornate with all white marble, but very nice.  All Acqua Di Parma amenities, a very nice touch.  The hotel location (Grand Canal) was perfect as well. â€¦
