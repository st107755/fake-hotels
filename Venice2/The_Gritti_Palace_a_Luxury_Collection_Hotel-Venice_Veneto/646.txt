My wife and I returned for our second visit this year to celebrate my retirement but this time we came with our daughter to show her Venice. We had connected rooms overlooking the square which were gorgeous. Eating on the terrace was wonderful, exquisite food and great service and the best location. We adore the hotel, the ambiance, the service and the people. We will be beck very soon.
