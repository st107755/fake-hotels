Stunning hotel. Take a water taxi from the airport (it's about a 10 minute walk to the taxi but the hotel can arrange a car to the taxi if you have a lot of luggage which is helpful). The hotel has a fantastic restaurant and bar and some of the most helpful staff we experienced throughout our trip. The rooms are very traditional with beautiful decor and nice marble bathrooms. You could splurge on a canal room but with the stunning views from every location it doesn't seem worth it , unless you plan on spending lots of time in the room.     Thank you again to all the staff!    Note: SPG members get 10% off @ the restaurant and a lot of the benefits are welcome here.
