I usually don't write reviews, but I thought this time I should as I was impressed from the moment I stepped in. The suite we had was one of the best suite I ever stayed, level of details and finish are amazing, marble bathroom is stunning. The Concierges are top class and gave very good advice and top restaurants. Spa is top notch. Will definitely recommend it!!
