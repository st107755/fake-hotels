I read lots of review before booking so I had high expectations.. They exceeded them!  As a Gold Starwood member they were steps ahead of me with upgrades and all that goes with the status.  I didn't have to remind or ask.  The location is perfect, the decor is divine, the staff is top notch.  The price? Got more than I paid for.
