Our room and the accommodations were all wonderful.  The staff spoke English and we have to take a moment to acknowledge our concierge Ivan, who went out of his way to make our entire Venice Trip unforgettable.   Most points in the city were easily walkable and despite the rain, worth every mile.  Be sure to stop in the lounge for a cocktail and a spritz - you won't have better olives anywhere else in Italy!
