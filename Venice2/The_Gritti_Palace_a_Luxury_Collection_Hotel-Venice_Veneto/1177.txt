My beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal would have been enough to make me love The Gritti Palace. The breakfasts, dinner and drinks on the terrace let you enjoy the present, while imagining the conversations of the writers and artists who came before you. The excellent staff and concierge will make all things possible. And the location could not be better. With all the cruise ships, it is better not to be too close to St Marks.  The Gritti Palace is an easy walk to anywhere and very close to a vaporetto stop.  Ne plus ultra.
