There aren't enough adjectives to describe what an elegant, beautiful, and completely luxurious property the Gritti Palace is. The concierge and staff in the hotel's bar and dining facilities are top notch. Rooms are incredibly gorgeous in design, and peacefully quiet. The location of the hotel is perfect as well, within walking distance of a wide array of amazing sites that Venice has to offer (San Marco, Guggenheim museum, the Academy, etc).  I especially loved the terrace on the canal where we spent countless hours enjoying several bottles of wine and champagne while soaking in the incredible scenery. I hope to return to Venice one day and will definitely stay at the Gritti.
