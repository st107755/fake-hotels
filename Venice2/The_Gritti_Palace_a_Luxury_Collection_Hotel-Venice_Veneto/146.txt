The only way to arrive at your hotel in Venice is via a boat transfer from the airport or train station.  Arriving at the Gritti Palace, the reception and service you receive from the staff is overwhelming.  Once checked in, they escorted us to our lovely suite (upgraded with 'Suite Night Upgrades').  The hotel holiday decorations were so lovely.  The bar was great to take a break from sightseeing in the afternoon.  The breakfast buffet was very plentiful.  The best thing about waking up in Venice is hearing the gondoliers singing along side the hotel each morning.  Thank you for an amazing stay Gritti Palace.
