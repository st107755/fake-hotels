Stayed for just 2 nights for our anniversary and we given a free upgrade from the Venetian room (which I was looking forward too) up to the giglio prestige room. And it was amazing. Large, clean luxurious with 2 huge wardrobes a massive stunning bathroom with separate bath and walk in shower.   All the staff were amazing from the check in ladies to the concierge team. I cannot praise everyone enough.   We ate at the restaurant on one night for our anniversary and the food was up there with the best we have had around the world. A special thank you to the chef for our Happy Anniversary extra dessert.   The location is perfect right next to all the designer shops and literally a 5minute walk from st marks square.   Make sure you book a private water taxi from the airport so gladâ€¦
