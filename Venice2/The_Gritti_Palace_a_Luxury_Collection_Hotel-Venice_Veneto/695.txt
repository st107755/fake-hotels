This is a luxury hotel with premier service. It was close to everything you'd want. The view from the restaurant is spectacular. Breakfast overlooking the canal in perfect weather was great. All transport was arranged through the hotel making it a seamless experience. Get reservations in advance if you want to do dinner at the hotel on the canal. But we had a very nice meal at the restaurant just outside the hotel.
