One of the great hotels.most amazing service and food! Comfort beyond belief . Away from most people but still in main zone. You have to pay but it’s worth it if you want.love it and will return....the boats are James Bond, everything you could hope for,Vinicius isn’t cheep but great to see. The airport is a shambles but if you allow plenty of time say 4hours your ok. You will pay €20 per drink .well done to the hard chore...
