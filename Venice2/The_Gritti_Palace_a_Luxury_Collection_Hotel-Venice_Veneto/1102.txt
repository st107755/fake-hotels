We visited Venice as a family group, three couples and one child, and The Gritti Palace was a splendid base from which to explore the city. It sits on the Grand Canal and enjoys a terrace deck on the water's edge where one can take coffee, dine or just relax and watch the action on the bustling canal. The hotel is very comfortable and houses many fine paintings and interesting photographs of the city.  The service is very good and the food offers many Venetian specialities. A recent refurbishment took place to coincide with flood prevention work by the city. This has apparently eliminated the risk of flooding at the hotel, which was a problem in the past and resulted in water inundation on the ground floor.
