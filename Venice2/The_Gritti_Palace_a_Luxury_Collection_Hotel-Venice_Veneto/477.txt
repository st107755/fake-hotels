I really do not think you can have a lovelier view of the grand canal than we had from our room.  I found the bathtub in the bedroom a bit bizarre but the view was spectacular.  We had just come from the Plaza Athenee in Paris and the service did not quite measure up to that standard, but that is a pretty high bar.  The canal side restaurant is also wonderful.  I think I might try something else the next time I am in Venice but there is really not much to fault here, particularly if you want the view.
