First, this gorgeous place has private water taxi drop off right at the front door.  This is a big deal in Venice as you will see many visitors dragging their heavy suitcases across the peninsula.  Staying at the Gritti is like a first class sleep-over at an art museum. This place is beautiful and the staff carefully cater to your every need. If you want to really spoil yourself, then upgrade yourself to the Patron Suite with a step out patio overlooking the Grand Canal.
