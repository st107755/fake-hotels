Beautiful hotel, tasteful oppulance if there is such a thing. Very welcoming and down to earth staff considering the surroundings. Stunning room, not massive but wow.  The breakfast was quite magnificent and I was mighty pleased it was included in our deal if you know what I mean!  Highly recommended.
