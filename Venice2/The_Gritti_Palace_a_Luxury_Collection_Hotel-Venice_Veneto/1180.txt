A five star experience at a 5 star hotel. We had a lovely room, extremely spacious by European standards. Luxuriously appointed bathroom and amenities. Super comfy bed. Staff and concierges all wonderful. The Gritti has a cooking school and we spent a morning taking lessons with the executive chef, Daniele. If you want a break from all those Tintorettos, highly recommend. You will not be disappointed at The Griitti.
