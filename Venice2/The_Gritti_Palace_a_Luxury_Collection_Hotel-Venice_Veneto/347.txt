Sometimes, one can get surprised by the level of luxury, even if the expectations are high to begin with. We were lucky enough to get upgraded to suites even though we reserved our rooms by SPG points, and Max made our stay one to remember for a lifetime. Walking to the Spa/Gym, one can see all the signed celebrity head shots, and it's easy to understand why. Thank you Gritti Palace!
