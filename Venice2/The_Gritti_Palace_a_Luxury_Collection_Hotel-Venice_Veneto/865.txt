My husband booked this hotel as a surprise 50th birthday treat . The whole 3 day experience was unforgettable.The Management and Staff went above and beyond what we were expecting and we had an unforgettable stay. On the day of my 50th Birthday we returned to our room to find a bouquet of 12 red roses from "the Gritti Palace Staff" which was very thoughtful.  The hotel is steeped in history,and is wonderfully opulent and luxurious . Nothing but excellent comments for The Gritti Palace and its Staff .
