Stayed at this hotel for our time in Venice, and the style and warmth of the staff could not be equaled. They upgraded us to a suite for our anniversary, and Umberto at the conceirge desk had all the right choices.  It was elegance, service, fantastic location on the Grand canal, and a very short walk to San Marco Square and all the history. Breakfast on the canal was amazing, and you had the whole city at your fingertips. It will not come cheap, but this hotel is one of the finest in Italy.....Loved every second!
