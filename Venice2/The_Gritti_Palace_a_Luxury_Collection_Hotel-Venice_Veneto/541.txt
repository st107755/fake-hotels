Gritti Palace is without a doubt one of the best hotels in the world, both on location/property and service. The hotel is moments away from Piazza San Marco yet on a quiet spot, you will sit on nice antique chair with a drink when they check you in, and they will then walk you to your room and deliver any elite member amenities. Most rooms are suites so you will have a nice room regardless, and the service is next to none, they will learn quickly what you want and what your patterns are. The breakfast is divine and plentiful and the views are stunning. Don't forget to try the cocktails in the bar, they are excellent
