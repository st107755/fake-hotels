The Gritti Palace underwent a major renovation and continues to represent one of the finest luxury hotels in the world. Nothing is compromised in the hotel which features hundreds of photos of celebrities who have visited over the past hundred years. Aside from these photographs and the modern amenities, I really felt as if I were traveling in a different century altogether. This is indeed a palace. The building is glamorous and gorgeous, and the service is commensurate with what you would expect for the price. I recommend booking a corner suite overlooking the canal. We had pouring rain for 2 out of the 4 days we stayed at the hotel, and were thrilled to be "stuck in our room" drinking vino and looking out over the canal through the 12+ foot floor to ceiling doors.
