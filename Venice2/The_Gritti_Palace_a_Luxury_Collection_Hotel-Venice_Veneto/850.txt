A fantastic service from start to finish with all staff always going just that little bit extra - the concierge were fabulous. We stayed in the Coppa Volpi suite which was amazing! Lovely Acqua di Palma products in the bathroom.   It's a great location - just a 5 minute stroll to St Marks Square.  One of our favourite things was to sit outside at the end of the day, before getting ready to go out to dinner, on the side of the Grand Canal having a drink with beautiful views & just watching everything going on.    We booked our river taxi through the hotel which included transport from the airport terminal to the river boat terminal. Definitely worth doing as it was so quick!  Can't recommend highly enough.
