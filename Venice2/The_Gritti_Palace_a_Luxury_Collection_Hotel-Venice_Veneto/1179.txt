My husband and I spent two wonderful nights at this luxurious hotel located right on the Grand  Canal.  The service and room were wonderful, but it was extremely expensive.  Normally we would not splurge for a room like this, but as it was our 40th anniversay, we decided to use our starwoods points.  We were not disappointed at the quality of the experience.  As the food was pricey, we chose to eat at some of the local resaurants, of which there were many.
