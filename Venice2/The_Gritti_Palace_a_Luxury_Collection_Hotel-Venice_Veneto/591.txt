From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel welcome. Room was perfect and breakfast and dinners great, albeit expensive. We used the Blitz transfers and had a half day tour on the private boat Il Doge with Marco. Excellent in every way. If there is a criticism it was the rat that ventured onto the open air terrace, an issue in all of Venice.
