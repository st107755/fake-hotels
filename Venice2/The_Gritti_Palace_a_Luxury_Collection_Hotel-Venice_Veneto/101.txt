Gritti Palace is by far the most spectacular hotel in Venice. From the moment you arrive, you know you are somewhere very special. Each and every member of the staff goes above and beyond for the guests. We were checked-in by Carlotta who went out of her way to to make sure our trip was perfect- the Gritti Palace is very lucky to have her. The room was absolutely spectacular. I cannot say enough about this beautiful place. I hope to be back very soon.
