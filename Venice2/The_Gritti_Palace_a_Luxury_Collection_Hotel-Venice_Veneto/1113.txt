We loved our room 218. It was a prestige room which looked out over the adjacent square and had a Grand Canal view if you looked left. Big high ceilings and windows and a lovely marble bathroom with double sinks. The staff were adorable and professional. Just the right type of helpful. Our bed was amazingly comfortable with lovely sheets. There were lots of treats in the room on our arrival: wine, chocolate, snacks. Our breakfast wasn't included but we were never charged for coffee or sparkling water which we had brought to us in silver service wherever and whenever we wanted in the hotel. Reservations were made for all our meals. Our quick holiday was amazing because Venice is amazing and the Gritti Palace made us feel like VIP visitors there with the ultimate secret respiteâ€¦
