This hotel is beautiful. From the minute you arrive you know it's special.   The fairly recent renovation has been done sympathetically and to the highest standard. It's opulent to say the least!   The location is perfect, close to St Marks but far enough away to be in a quiet area.   Although on the pricy side the bar area is amazing. Sitting on the Grand Canal with a cocktail watching the world go by will be an experience I won't forget.   The rooms are well appointed and the Acqua Di Parma toiletries are lovely.   The staff are professional and very helpful.   I can't fault this hotel. If you're coming to Venice stay here if you can. It's perfect.
