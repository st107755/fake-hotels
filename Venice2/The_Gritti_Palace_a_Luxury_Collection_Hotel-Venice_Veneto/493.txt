I'm lucky enough that I have stayed in a lot of nice hotels over the years, so it means something when I say that my stay at the Gritti was the best hotel experience I've ever had.    The Gritti is ... perfection.  {sigh}   Where do I start?  The room was bigger than expected.  In old hotels, the rooms are often itty-bitty and odd in shape because they've carved up some old building into a bunch of miniature rooms -- not so here.  (And no, we did not have a big fancy suite; just a regular room).  Our room was comfortably spacious, with closets completely kitted out, a nice desk, windows that open (!!) and a big bed .... oh, that bed.  So comfortable!  And the pillows!  To die for!  And super soft sheets!  It was heaven.  Then there's the bathroom in floor-to-ceiling marble. â€¦
