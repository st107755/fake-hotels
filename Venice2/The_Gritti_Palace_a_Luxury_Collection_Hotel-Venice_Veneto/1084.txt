On New Years Day - when it would be thought that not everyone would be at the top of their game - we arrived here for lunch without booking.   The attention to service and customer satisfaction from the moment we stepped through the door was amazing. The restaurant leading out to the (unused on this day) terrace used to be called the Doge's Restaurant but, after renovations am not sure if the name has remained the same. The whole place was warm, welcoming and beautiful to look at, especially with the Christmas decorations and, understandably, the normal menu was not available and instead we were offered a buffet. Saying that does it no service at all! This was no normal buffet, this was a Gritti Palace special and lost none of the attention to details they are rightly known for.â€¦
