One of my new favorite hotels. From the moment we pulled up in our water taxi, we were steeped in elegance. The staff was very nice and welcoming, from the person meeting our boat, to the frond desk host, to the concierge.  The lobby is beautifully decorated and our suite was simply breath taking! It truly was like staying in a palace. Room service was great and the restaurant and bar overlooking the water were so beautiful. We took our three year old and would considered this property to be kids friendly. The stuff was kind to my daughter and accommodating to any special food request. I was sad to leave, but I am already looking forward to my next stay.
