From the moment that your private water taxi pulls in to the waterfront door, (just spend the money 110 euro and enjoy the 25 mins of beauty and security of your luggage) you are whisked away to a hotel like none, We went for my daughter's birthday and they treated her like a little Princess. The morning breakfast collection is amazing and you are able to be seated looking at the gondolas and may even get serenaded a time or two. Even the hotel shampoos etc are all top of the line, this is not normally a topic I find worth mentioning but mama mia Acqua di Parma seriously, yeah thats right seriously awesome. Do not be surprised to see a few movie stars or big names staying at the hotel or just coming over to eat. If you plan to eat dinner at the hotel please make reservationsâ€¦
