Seen this fab hotel after riding the traghetto gondola crossing and knew it had a good reputation so went in for a drink on the sunny verandah facing the canal, we had a hot chocolate which was amazing and a latte and enjoyed the complimentary biscuits with it, we watched a cruise liner pass in the background and listened to the gondola singers. Wifi didn't work at the hotel, so that was disappointing, loved the pictures & signatures of hollywoods greatest on the corridor wall on the way to the rest rooms
