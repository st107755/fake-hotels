We decided to take a private taxi (60 Euros) from the train station to the Gritti Palace - boy, was it worth the money! The route is through the grand canal (great sights) but also through some smaller channels, so we got a spectacular view of Venice by private boat. It was amazing. That taxi ride set the tone for this entire stay. We arrived right at the dock in front of the Gritti - of course there was a uniformed gentleman there to greet us, unload our luggage and give us a hand out of the boat.  I do not have one single gripe about any aspect of our visit, and, if you knew me, that is an amazing accomplishment. The Gritti Palace is over-the-top elegant and romantic, and service is first class all the way. Every single staff member was warm, welcoming, helpful and courteous.â€¦
