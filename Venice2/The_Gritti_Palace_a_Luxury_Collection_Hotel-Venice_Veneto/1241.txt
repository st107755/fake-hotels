If you are only going to Venice for a couple of days, go to the Gritti. It is totally glorious. Friendly and elegant in equal measure. The most amazing experience of the Grand Canal from the terrace - better than actually being on a gondola! Cocktails to die forâ€¦ A really generous feeling hotel with such a superb level of service that their guests do feel 'honoured'.
