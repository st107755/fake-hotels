Loved our stay at this storied hotel in Venice. Hotel was able to accommodate us with connecting rooms - perfect for a family with younger children.  Gorgeous public rooms. The terrace is the most beautiful spot in Venice for cocktails and the bartender mixes a perfect Bellini. Central location close to all but not in the middle of all the crowds. Loved every second of our stay. Best service imaginable - upon leaving and arriving at the train station I discovered that my nephew had forgotten his passport in the hotel safe. The concierge together with housekeeping were able to locate the passport and had a water taxi rush it to the train station in time for our departure only a half hour later. It was extraordinary service and much appreciate. - Danielle Dobin
