Sister hotel to the Danielli & much quieter location near the Rialto ,with great service , great staff & great food . This will definitely be our next choice in Venice as less crowded , more preferred location (away from the tourist hub in & around San Marco Square )  Very friendly staff & much smaller hotel to the Danielli .
