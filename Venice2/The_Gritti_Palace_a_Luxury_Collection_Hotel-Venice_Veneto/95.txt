Beautiful hotel but has no bottles of water to give out for guests going on walks and no iron and ironing board (claims safety issues while every other vote has them).  Also, there seems to be understaffing in check-in (had to wait for someone to come and check us in) and in wait staff at restaurant.   Is this a Marriott problem or just a local lack of sensitivity .
