Could not fault anything.  Amazing memorable time at the Gritti. Been to Venice so many times but my stay here has been unique and magical. Thank you to all the staff who were incredibly attentive and went out of their way to make our stay unfussy and enjoyable. Particular mention to Michele on the front desk.
