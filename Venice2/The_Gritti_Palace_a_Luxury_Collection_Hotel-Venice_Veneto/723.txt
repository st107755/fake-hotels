Getting treated to smiles on arrival is a great great feeling My daughter absolutely enjoyed walking the corridors looking at pictures Some have considered the Palace to be more adult than family I didn't find that to be true The staff is certainly happy to entertain  The only difference maybe in the formal sit down restaurant where it is certainly not advisable to have toddlers or infants Plush bedding wonderful granite bathrooms and a lovely renovation job. Getting to the hotel on the 1 line is a breeze and it's a short walk to the Salute Accademia and St Marks Deserve all the five stars
