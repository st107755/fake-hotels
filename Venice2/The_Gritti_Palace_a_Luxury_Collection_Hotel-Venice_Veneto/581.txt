      We stayed at this hotel prior to the renovation, and had a beautiful room with two windows overlooking the Grand Canal. This time, although the room charge was much higher, we were given a room whose sole window is partly obscured by an enormous bathtub. Although this might appeal to honeymooners, we are hardly that, and would have preferred two windows overlooking one of the world's most glorious views. Next time we will stay at the new hotel across the canal.       The bathrooms have been renovated, and are fine.        Almost all the staff are very courteous and helpful.
