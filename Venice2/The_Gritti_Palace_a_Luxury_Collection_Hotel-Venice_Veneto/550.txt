Stayed at the Gritti Palace for my wife's birthday in October and from the minute we arrived to the minute we departed we were treated so well. We were upgraded to a suite which was stunning, breakfast on the terrace was wonderful way to start the day and a night cap overlooking the Grand Canal the only way to finish it. A big thank you all the Gritti Palace's exceptional staff who made our say in this beautiful hotel one that we will remember forever.
