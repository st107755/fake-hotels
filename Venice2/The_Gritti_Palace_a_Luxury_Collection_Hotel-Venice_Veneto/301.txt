We spent two nights at the absolutely beautiful Gritti Palace hotel.  Staff were gracious, and the service was outstanding!   Centrally located on the Grand Canal with a private dock, gondolas are right outside, and the Vaporetta stop, steps away. St Marks Square just a 5-10 minute walk, with many shops/restaurants along the way!  Our room was elegant and spacious, as was the marble bathroom!    We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, with a wide variety to choose from, and the sights/views from the Terrace directly on the canal were spectacular!  Great way to start the day!  We were fortunate to attend an evening event on the Redentore Terrace, the food/drinks were amazing and the view was absolutely breathtaking!  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
