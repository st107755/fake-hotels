We arrived in Venice a bit worn out, having travelled from New York. We were also not met by our appointed transfer. All that faded though when we were whisked by water taxi to the hotel.   This is a fabulous hotel. The rooms are lovely, the beds are comfortable.   We had breakfast included. Breakfast is served on the terrace, watching all that goes on on the Grand Canal. The food was great, the fruit was juicy and sweet and there was a lot of choice of breakfast items, including cooked food.  Where this hotel really shines is its staff. Nothing is too much trouble. We spent a lot of time asking for help as my husband's apnoea machine stopped working. We bought and had shipped another. It turned out that although the website was in Italian, the machine was in fact in Israel. â€¦
