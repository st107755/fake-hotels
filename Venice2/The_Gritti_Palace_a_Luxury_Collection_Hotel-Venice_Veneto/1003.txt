The Gritti Palace is a really beautiful hotel with much historic charm but also fully up to date following a recent complete refurbishment. The location is excellent, set on a canal and only five minutes walk from St. Mark's Square. We stayed in a Venetian room which was of an adequate size and decorated in a traditional manner with wood paneling , glass and mirrors. The bathroom was comfortable and well equipped. Service is friendly and highly efficient. The bar has an attractive outside terrace where you can enjoy a cocktail while watching the boats on the canal.It is expensive but it is a real Venetian palace.
