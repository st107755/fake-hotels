Probably the best position in Venice with breakfast enjoyed outside with views of the Grand Canal - which lights up at night like a Christmas tree - quite beautiful!  We were given a room upgrade to a suite (we booked a canal view room) and found champagne and fruit in our room.  They quite spoilt us - no idea why, except they seem to treat all their guests extremely well.  Our first visit here, won't be our last!  Staff are unbelievably courteous and pleasant, they simply can't do enough for you.  Bar area is magic with staff who remember your order from the night before and dinner in the restaurant was exceptional.  The whole place was recently refurbished and looks fabulous.  Go on treat yourself!
