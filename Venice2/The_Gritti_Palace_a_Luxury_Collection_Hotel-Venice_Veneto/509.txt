For the full Venetian experience what better place than the Gritti Palace. Not cheap but so nice to sit at the side of the Grand Canal outside the Bar Longhi and watch the gondolas and ferries go by. Service in the Bar Longhi was superb as were the cocktails. Room was great, concierge could got excellent tables at nearby restaurants, everything was 5*. You get what you pay for. Definitely something for a special occasion but the single night was worth it for the experience. Love the signed photos lining the ground-floor corridors near the foyer of past celebrity guests from Claudette Colbert and Elizabeth Taylor to Angelina and Brad and the kids. Wonderful and attentive staff. Even if you do not stay, try the Bar Longhi.
