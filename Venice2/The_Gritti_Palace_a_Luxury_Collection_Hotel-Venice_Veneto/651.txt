My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at the Gritti Palace. We were welcomed with a bottle of Prosecco and fruit in our room. We stayed in the Grand Canal room which was just amazing with high ceilings, venetian furniture and all marble bathroom. If you stay here book a room facing the Grand canal. It is worth it. We were able to watch the fireworks from our room on the day of the Redentore feast. Breakfast on the terrace facing the grand canal was great with just enough choices. The staff were very friendly and the hotel has a wonderful luxury boutique feel. It was also easy access to all the places we wanted to walk to. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Highly recommend!!
