...I will be moving into the Gritti Palace!  It's not often that your anticipation of a highly rated experience not only meets, but EXCEEDS expectations. The Gritti Palace accomplishes just that. Please believe the hype surrounding this Luxury Property.   Every. Single. Detail. Exquisite.  Without being pretentious.   Service was friendly and top notch  (although if I had to make one criticism we found the service in the lounge to be surprisingly slow).   Thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Cannot wait to return (now... off to buy that winning lottery ticket)!
