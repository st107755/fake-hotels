..... In every way. Perfect location. Away from the insanity of Venice but close enough when you want to take it all in. Fantastic head to toe restoration. Fantastic staff in every area of the hotel.   Had a wonderful and romantic dinner with Truffle dishes in season in their restaurant overlooking the Grand Canal. Breakfast as well.   (Don't waste your time at Harry's- eat and drink here)  Keep in mind that quality is remembered long after price is forgotten.    And don't forget to arrive and depart by water taxi at their own dock.
