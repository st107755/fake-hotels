We stayed 2 nights at The Gritti Palace in late April. Overall, we had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Our Giglio Prestige room was a a little small (typical of Venice hotels) but beautifully decorated and met our needs. It is only a 5-10 minute walk to Piazza San Marco but was far enough removed to feel private and quiet. Service was exemplary; not particularly warm but the concierge and front desk were gracious and competent in all our interactions.
