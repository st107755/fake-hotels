Mary Poppins was practically perfect but the Gritty IS perfect in every way. Incredible restoration of this beautiful palace. Perfect Location. Rooms are beautifully decorated in high Venetian style and extraordinary comfortable. The staff are uniformely charming,warm and informative. The bar on the is an absolute must for tourists and upscale locals alike. And breakfast directly on the Grand Canal is a dream come true. Expensive but worth every Euro. I am already dreaming of my next visit.
