As old Gritti clients, we'd not been back for a few years as the hotel had become seedy and staff was a little rude. THAT'S OVER.   Major capex has begotten a proud staff and the place is terrific.   We always prefer the size of our room to its view. Thus we skip the canal view in favor of the view of the city......no big deal as we are always out during the day and can't see outsisde at night anyway.   Wwe were in 326 and thought it was beautiful.   Yes, Venice is a sinfully expsive place and the Gritti is beyond expensive........but for 3 or 4 nights......what can I tell you. The trick is to forget about it.
