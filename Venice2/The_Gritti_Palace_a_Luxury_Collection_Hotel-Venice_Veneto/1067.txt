This hotel is truly gorgeous and the services offered are excellent.  Decorated to feel like the Doge palaces of days gone by, the decor is excessive and over the top--and perfect for Venice.  The place truly emanates with a sense of time and place, it always lets you know that you are in Venice.  The balcony overlooking the Grand Canal is perfect and very romantic, especially at night.  The restaurant was great and Bar Longhi was elegant and fun with a live musician.  Finally, the service they offer for airport transfer was tremendous--private boat, cab waiting, porter who leads you to check-in and skips the line.  Stay here if you have the occasion, it's worth it!
