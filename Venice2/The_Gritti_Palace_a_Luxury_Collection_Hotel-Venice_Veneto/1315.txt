Our Italian Escapade vacation ended at The Gritti Palace.  It was the perfect way to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary.  Our beautiful room overlooked the Grand Canal.  The beautiful white roses were an amazing way to help us celebrate.  The outstanding service and delicious food served to make our celebration complete.  The fabulous room overlooking the canal made us feel so special and gave us wonderful memories.  I recommend The Gritti Palace for every special occasion.  Thank you so much for making our stay extra special!
