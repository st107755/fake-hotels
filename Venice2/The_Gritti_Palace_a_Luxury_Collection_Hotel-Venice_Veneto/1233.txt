The white glove service each  morning was wonderful. It was not pretentious, but most relaxing, with perfect views of the traffic on the grand canal. Very nice buffet, and loved my eggs to order. The staff at the front desk was always very helpful. We did not have a room overlooking the grand canal, but a fun look out our window to the canal below with the gondolas going by.
