I popped in for lunch and cocktails on the terrace with my partner, it was lovely inside and had a beautiful view of the grand canal, the drinks and food were great. I give the review an average one due to the fact the service is sloppy, plates and glasses being left on table for half an hour not acceptable also not a great deal of attention on people sat outside i appreciate the lads are working hard but 2 people catering for 30 outside not helping, could do with more waiters on hand. and a black hair was found on my potatoes of my beef fillet dish it was changed for a fresh one swiftly but still not nice, they need some training in a michelin star restaurant in england i was expecting precision service for the price i left feeling a little disappointed.
