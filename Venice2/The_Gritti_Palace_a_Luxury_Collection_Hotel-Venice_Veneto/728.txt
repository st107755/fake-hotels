Lovely hotel on the Grand Canal. We had a roomy suite, extremely comfortable.  Fresh flowers every day, chocolates - view of the Grand Canal.  Staff was very friendly.  Loved having breakfast outside on the Grand Canal and loved their new outdoor Riva Lounge. Had a great lunch out there and good spot to wind down with tea/coffee and a yummy dessert after a long day of sightseeing.  Special place - hard to leave.
