We just spent 3 nights in The Gritti Palace after new year day. We found this hotel is the best for us. It is romantic, it is elegant, it is luxurious and staffs are professional.  Location was fantastic, although you can basically walk to everywhere in venice, but an recognisable path is very important. It is around 5 mins walk from S.Mark square, where we can enjoy morning coffee and newspaper, late afternoon hot chocolate and of course Saint Mark's Basilica. we put visiting Saint Mark's Basilica to the last day morning, after visiting, we still have time to enjoy a glass of champagne at The Riva Lounge before lunch. Then have lunch in Club Del Doge. In the mean time, hotel staffs arrange our transportation to the train station. Everything was smooth and well organised.  Room,â€¦
