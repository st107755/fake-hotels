The Gritti Palace staff were very helpful and attentive during our recent stay.  It is centrally located within Venice making it reasonable walks to San Marcos square or to retail shopping or the Rialto local market.  Views of the Grand Canal from the restaurant and bar are very romantic.  Took a cooking class with Chef Franco, delicious and memorable.  Got some cooking tips, plus had a great meal.  Only knock was the ATM in the hotel overcharges for the exchange rate, about 6% more than it should have been.  Definitely will stay here again.
