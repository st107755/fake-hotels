Great location, beautiful hotel, stylish rooms, excellent service!  We stayed here for 4 nights and couldn't fault the place.  Friendly staff and lots of lovely little touches that you'd expect from a real 5 star.  Ok its expensive, but let's face it Venice isn't renowned for its reasonable pricing.  Its a special place set in a truly magical city and if you get the chance to go, I'd definitely recommend!
