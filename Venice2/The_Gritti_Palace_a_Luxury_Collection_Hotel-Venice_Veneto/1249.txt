They say first impressions count well you could not fail to be impressed with the entrance to the hotel if you arrive by water taxi. The staff were very warm and welcoming and speedily had us settled in our room which was very elegantly decorated with a complimentary drink awaiting us. The setting for breakfast is stunning as the terrace looks directly on to the Grand Canal where over a sumptuous breakfast you can watch the boats and gondolas pass by a few feet away. I cannot add anymore to all the other reviews the hotel has which sings its praises, believe every word a truly remarkable hotel and a fantastic experience to have stayed there.
