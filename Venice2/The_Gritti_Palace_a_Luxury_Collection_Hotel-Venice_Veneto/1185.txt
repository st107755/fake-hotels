We had a fabulous stay at the Gritti Hotel recently.  The location is superb, and the entire staff was exceedingly helpful.  Our room overlooked the Grand Canal and the view just cannot be beat - the room itself was gorgeous from the wallpaper, bedding to the ceiling medallion.  The bathroom was updated and the size impressive (especially for Europe!).    Evening drinks on the veranda overlooking the Grand Canal was superb.  A great way to watch the gondolas float past.  Breaking on the outdoor patio was amazing as well.  We cannot wait to return!  One note - if you are coming from the US bring your own electricity converter in order to charge your cell phone/i-pads  Hotel does not supply them due to the age/type of construction of the building.
