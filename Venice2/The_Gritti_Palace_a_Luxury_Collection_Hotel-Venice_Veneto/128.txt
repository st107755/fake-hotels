We stayed here for two nights and I wish it could have been longer. The staff are friendly and incredibly helpful; the position of the hotel is amazing, the food exquisite and Venice in March was just perfect. A truly unforgettable experience from the delicious breakfast in the morning sunshine to a glass of prosecco in the bar over looking the Grand Canal at sunset.
