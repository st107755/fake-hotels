This was our first stay at this hotel, and it exceeded our expectations in every respect. From check in to departure everything was perfect. The property is beautifully renovated, and the staff is world class. The housekeeping is impeccable, and the hotel has a great fitness room which I'm sure is not typical in Venice where space is so valuable.  We can't wait to return.
