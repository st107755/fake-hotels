Our family stayed at the Gritti Palace for two nights and we had an absolutely fantastic time. The staff are super friendly, the decor in the lobby is very nice and the rooms are beautifully decorated. We had breakfast and dinner on the terrace, the service was very friendly and our meals were delicious, we look forward to our next visit!
