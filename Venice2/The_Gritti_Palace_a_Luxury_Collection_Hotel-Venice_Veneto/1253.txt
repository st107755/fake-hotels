A daily afternoon respite at the Grand Canal bar overlooking the bustle of the waterway is a must. Attentive waiters see to your every need serving nibbles and cocktails! A place to see and be seen...and what a glorious interior design the lobby holds! The new Waris Ahluwalia boutique is quite a curiosity.
