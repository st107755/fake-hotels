Nice hotel...very pretty but service lacks value.  Rooms are quaint but truly too small to enjoy.  Random note...bathtubs are in the bedrooms.  Room was not ready upon arrival. We were not offered water or any sort of greeting upon arrival.  It was if the staff feels one should be privileged to stay here.  Rooms are very pricey.  Concerige was not friendly nor very helpful.  The location is great and bar nice.  Restaurant food was just okay.  We really felt like this experience could have been much, much better.  We have stayed at hotels all over the world and we're actually unimpressed with this one. The beds were very comfortable but room cleanliness wasn't the greatest.  The shower wouldn't drain so water flooded the bathroom floor even after a short shower.  There was globsâ€¦
