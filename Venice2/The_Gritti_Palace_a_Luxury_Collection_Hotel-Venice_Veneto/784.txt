For our one week visit to Venice the Gritti Palace combined the location, comfort historical setting, and expert advice we wanted. Located on the scenic Grand Canal next to the Gigio stop. Bar and restaurant located on the canal, overlooking the S. Maria della Salute church. A few minutes walk to San Marco or Accademia. The friendly concierges helped us navigate and explore a variety of options.
