My first trip to Venice and both the city and the Gritti Palace exceeded all my expectations. The hotel is newly refurbished and is beautifully done. The service is immaculate, warm and friendly, without the superciliousness of similar establishments.  The bar and the restaurant alone  is worth a visit with the grand canal providing a stunning backdrop. Stay there whilst you still can, once they have re-established or rather re-enforced their reputation following the refurbishment it will be tough to get in.
