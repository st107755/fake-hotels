My mother, sister and i checked in to this hotel in june. We were immediately amazed by our beautiful room, when we arrived to our room the windows were open and we could hear singing from the gondolas going by. The concierge we amazing and got us reservations to a beautiful restraint with a table on the grand canal. He also set up an entire boat tour or the three us us around the islands in venice, which was AMAZING. I stayed two nights and could not have had a better stay away where in Venice!
