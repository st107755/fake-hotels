Just a perfect place for a long weekend; the hotel after its renovation is really top notch; friendly service, very detail- oriented without beeing too intimitate; very nice Spa environment and the rooms are the sbsolute highlight! Venetian style combined with latest technology which works; wonderful terrasse with great views and a fantastic breakfast buffet - congratulations to the Gritti team!
