4 days at the Gritti Palace in October 2016. It's wonderful and the location could not be better! Apart from being a beautiful hotel, and our room being very nice indeed... we really loved the position of the hotel right on the waterfront in the Grand Canal. No one can walk in front of the hotel and so when you are dining (breakfast and evening drinks for us) there can hardly be a better place to sit and enjoy Venice. The Riva bar was fabulous and we enjoyed evening drinks here with plenty of heat from the electric heaters. This meant we could enjoy breakfast and evening drinks outside even in late October.
