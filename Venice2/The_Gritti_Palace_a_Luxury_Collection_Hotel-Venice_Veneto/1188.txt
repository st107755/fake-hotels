When you go to Venice you want the Venetian style rooms but let's be honest you want them to be clean and updated.  The Gritti is the perfect mix of modern luxury and classic Venetian style.  Giovanni at the front desk was very welcoming and helpful and for you Starwood members they have very good SPG recognition.
