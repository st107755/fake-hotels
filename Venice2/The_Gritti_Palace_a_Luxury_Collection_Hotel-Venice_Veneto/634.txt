We stayed at Gritti during our honeymoon and have been blown away by its splendour and opulence. Combined with impeccable and personal service the hotel made our stay truly special. Having had a privilege of staying in other great hotels worldwide (e.g. Raphael, The Savoy, etc) this hotel nonetheless is now our front runner epitomising  a true marriage of old class luxury merged with 21st century service. The Senior Concierge (Ivan) took great care of all our requests with impeccable professionalism and personal touch that just amplified great qualities of this magnificent hotel. Our dinners in the hotel restaurant overlooking the Grand Canal were fantastic with great food and excellent service. The hotel team take great pride in providing exceptional yet nonintrusive service.â€¦
