The Gritti palace is a superb combination of old age elegance and new age convinience . The staff was eager to please and very gracious . The location was in the heart of the city. There were gondolas right outside .  The rooms were gorgeous . The bathrooms were marble floor to ceiling and the spa soaps were devine . I would return to this hotel
