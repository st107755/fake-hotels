Our second trip to Venice -- last time we stayed at the Cipriani -- and couldn't have had a better time. My wife and two sons stayed in a two room suite and were treated like royalty. From the moment we checked in every need was addressed with kindness and precision. Not a single hotel employee from the front desk people to the concierges, to the maids to the wait staff was anything but perfection. Our suite was pristine. The hotel restaurant had the best food we'd tasted in Venice and our private boat ride to Murano and Borano was handled perfectly. The hotel isn't cheap but that's Italy in the summer. The location is perfect and the hotel delivers, decade after decade. You will not be disappointed.
