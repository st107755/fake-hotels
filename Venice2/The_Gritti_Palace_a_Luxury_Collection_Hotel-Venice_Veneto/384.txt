My husband and i stayed for 3 nights, everything was above our expectation in terms of food, the room size and furniture and the service which was excellent.   I was at first hesitant whether to stay at Gritti Palace or the Belmond Cipriani, but after paying a visit to Cipriani i was sure and glad that i made the right choice. Dont get me wrong the hotel is bigger and has a pool and nice garden, but it was so quite and not as lively as the Gritti.
