If I could resume the Gritti experience with one person, it would be Angelo. He is the nicest waiter you can have and will provide the best service !   On the other hand ... the view offered by the palace is one of a kind. Take the time to at least have a coffee on the terrasse !   Although if you « can », try a boat ride in the hotel’s Riva .....
