We arrived much earlier than I reservation and the hotel was very busy. Our bags were lost so we really wanted a room to be able to clean up a bit and relax from a long trip from the States. In no time, the hotel staff were able to accomodate us and make us feel extremely welcome.  As soon as our bags arrived they were sent to us immediately. The rooms, food and service were great. Location to all sights is perfect. I would highly recommend.
