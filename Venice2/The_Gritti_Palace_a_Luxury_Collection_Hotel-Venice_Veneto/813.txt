Let me start by saying the hotel is beautiful.... However, the staff needs to realize that not all black people are criminals and deserve to be treated with Respect! I will never stay at this hotel again because of the racism here. It is sad because the hotel is extremely nice and upscale. However, the staff needs a lesson in cultural differences and racial tolerance.
