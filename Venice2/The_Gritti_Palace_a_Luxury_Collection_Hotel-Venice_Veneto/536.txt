There's no place in the world like Venice. When we traveled to Venice, we wanted to make sure we stayed at one of the very best and this hotel definitely is one of the nicest hotels. We had a friend who worked for starwood book the room for us so we got a room quite small and not with a terrible view but the design of the room along with the service made us quickly forget that. I do warn that you stay away from the casino that looks like a bank. My husband gambled there and we were followed out but a strange guy out the back entrance. We quickly cross back through the casino lobby and took a boat back to our beautiful hotel.
