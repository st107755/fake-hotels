This is one of THE places to stay in Venice (along with the Cipriani).  Overall, you probably will not be disappointed.  Pros:  Decor, luxury, location. You just can't beat being right on the Grand Canal.  Cons:  Service.  If I were paying that much money, I certainly would not want to treated so disdainfully.  The service staff overall does not speak English very well (or are they just faking those very thick accents?) and look "annoyed" any time you approach them.   I make an exception for the restaurant wait staff who seem to understand customer service.  The breakfast is fabulous and dining "canalside" really is a memorable experience.  Personally, I'd find a friendlier place and just splurge and take a meal here.
