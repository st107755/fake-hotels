I stayed for, alas, only one night recently.   The hotel was perfect in every way.   All the staff went above and beyond what one would have expected.  The room was overlooking the Grand canal.    breakfast consisted of very extensive buffet with eggs etc to order.    I promise that you will not be disappointed if you stay.
