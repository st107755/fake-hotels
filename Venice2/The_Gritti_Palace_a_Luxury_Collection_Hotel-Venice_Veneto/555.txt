We stayed at the Gritti for 5 nights the first week of November to celebrate our anniversary.  From the moment that we checked in, we were absolutely pampered.  The room, the lobby, the restaurant and bar were all just incredible.  We ended every night with a drink outside at the bar and marveled at the amazing view.  It really couldn't have been any better.
