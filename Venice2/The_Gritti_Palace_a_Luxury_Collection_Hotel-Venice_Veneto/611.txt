Celebrating 25 years of marriage. My husbands first time in Venice. Our room had a bottle of champagne and a dozen white long stem roses from the manager to wish us well. Every staff member treated us like royalty. Eating out on their restaurant over looking Grand Canal was our highlight. Gondola's were ready and waiting just steps away from hotel. Room was stunning. Our favorite concierge Ivan was helpful at ever turn. We will go back for sure.
