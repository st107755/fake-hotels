i stayed at the gritti palace as part of my honeymoon in april 2015. it was a beautiful hotel with great customer service. the hotel is pricey-but the rooms are spectacular. i was upgraded to a large suite that had two washrooms and three balaconies. the room even had a door bell. the hotel was helpful in arranging sight-seeing and made us feel like welcomed guests that mattered.
