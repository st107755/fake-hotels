If this is your first time in Venice, you need a hotel that has top-notch service because getting around is complicated. They provided 5-star advice. Let's talk logistics: We hired a private boat at the airport (120 Euros and worth it). Upon arrival at the hotel, they completely took over our stay. When we departed, they arranged our boat and driver to Cortina. It was so simple. The driver met us at the dock. It was totally stress free. Take lots of cash for tipping. They have 6 gorgeous suites facing the Grand Canal, we had a corner suite and felt like royalty. There are tons of little touches like gorgeous drinking glasses in the bathroom, books on the coffee table and an impressive sound system (it's warm and home, yet posh).
