Stayed at the Gritti Palace for 4 nights.  Excellent service throughout and a beautiful hotel. It is in an excellent location for most of the important sights.  Breakfast on the open air restaurant was lovely with an excellent veiw of the amazing church opposite and a wonderful selection of food at the breakfast buffet.
