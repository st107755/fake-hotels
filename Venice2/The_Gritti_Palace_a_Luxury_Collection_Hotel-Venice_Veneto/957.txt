We have stayed at other hotels in Venice, and this is the one we will return to. Airport pickup- A true gentleman met us in airport, and escorted us in car drive 3 mins to dock for water taxi. Absolutely worth the money. Concierge- Helpful with tickets to Doges, evening dinner, water taxis and even provided glue to mend sunglasses. Rooms- Not really any view but very clean and elegant. Most importantly in June, great air conditioning! Restaurant- Breakfast and lunch on terrace was amazing to watch boats on Grand Canal. Room service was also very prompt.
