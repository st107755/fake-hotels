I don't know if the Gritti Palace is the finest hotel in Venice but if not, it surely comes close. My wife and I stayed 3 nights there in early July. We have promised ourselves a stay there ever since our first drinks on the terrace over a decade ago. Now, the hotel has taken 18 months to re-invent itself and it certainly shows.Fresh from this major refurbishment it looks a dream - even the public toilets were a fantasy in silver grey marble. Our room was modest but had every necessary facility and a huge bath (more beautiful marble). The staff were welcoming and helpful and the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal as magical as ever. It is not cheap, of course, but well worth saving up for a very special experience.
