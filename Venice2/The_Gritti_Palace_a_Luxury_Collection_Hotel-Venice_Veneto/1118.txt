As an SPG Platinum (100+) member, I've stayed in a lot of hotels in the last years, but the Gritti Palace in Venice was for sure on of the best so far. Great stuff, nice rooms and a proper Venice style interior. It is obviously from a price point of view in a different league to a lot of average hotels, but once in a while you need to do a trip like this. Fortunately we had fantastic weather (18° end of October), so the breakfast in the morning outside at the terrace was already a highlight on its own. The area is great and in my view fortunately not in the crowdie markus square area, but still well placed to reach the main attractions. For sure a recommendation if you plan to travel to venice and in my view THE top hotel in Venice!  PS. Make sure you get to the hotel at night…
