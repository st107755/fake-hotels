I was here by in invitation otherwise I could not afford it since this is for me a very expensive hotel. We arrived from the airport by watertaxi by the entrance of the hotel. What a beautiful and luxurious hotels. The room was very nice and the Aqua di Parma soap and other items in the bathroom smelling so nice. If you can afford it this a wonderful hotel and great location. If possible have your breakfast ourside and enjoy the view.
