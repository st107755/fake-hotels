We ventured her because we were expecting best. You really can not fault the location, canal views of course. We were surprised the waiter got the order wrong after all, you are charged forteen euros each just to sit down. Overall the veggie food was ok but as I am paying over the odds anyway for my lunch I feel cheated by the extra price I was charged just to sit in the restaurant, I did not encounter that anywhere else in Venice
