This was one of the highlights of our trip to Venice. It's always been one of my ambitions to have cocktails overlooking the Grand Canal. Alas, we couldn't afford to stay at the Gritti Palace Hotel but this is definitely the next best thing!  A wonderful pre-dinner experience. Definitely worth a visit to this iconic Venetian landmark!
