We stayed here for 3 nights in late April 2015 as part of a British Airways holiday. We were put in a fantastic suite the like of which I have never seen before. Beautiful marble, paintings, furniture, etc. The service was wonderful - in fact everything about the hotel was wonderful. Very nice staff. We would go back at the drop of a hat if we could get the same deal again.
