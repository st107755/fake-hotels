My husband and I were debating if we should stay here or not because how expensive the hotel is but we thought why not it's a once in a lifetime trip, when will we go back to Venice. I am so glad we made the decision... this hotel makes you feel so royal!!!! From the moment you walk in to the moment you check out!!!! My favorite part was the bathroom the Italian marble and Aqua de Parma products!!!! We had dinner one night at the restaurant and I must say we were unprepared and didn't realize it was a butler service type of restaurant.  If your planning an amazing dinner for your loved one be sure to go there. This was well worth the money!!!!
