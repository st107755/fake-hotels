The Gritti palace is located in Venice Island proper, where all of the touristy sites are located.  Walking  distance to San Marco, Rialto , etc. And right beside the Grand Canal.  The lobby is very impressive and elegant with intricate architectural details.  Their breakfast is typical Italian, but the beautiful dining area elevates the experience.  I love taking my time sipping morning coffee in such a luxurious surrounding.
