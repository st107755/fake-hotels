In anticipation and trepidation we returned to the Gritti for the first time since its reopening.  Would it have been ruined by changes to its essential character under the guise of refurbishment?  No need to fear - it remains the ulitmate Venetian destination combining opulence with discretion.  Its prize assest, its staff, seem simply to have returned after a lengthy holiday and even a curious incident in the night time was perfectly handled.  One reviewer once headed their conribution "Gritti not greaty".  Well in my book it's perfection.
