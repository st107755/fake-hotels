Gritti Palace is top price and top end; it has everything you'd expect from a high quality hotel - nice rooms, good technology (wifi, good film catalogue for the kids) and highly professional service, but what turned good into great was the terrace.  Sitting on the terrace, looking out onto the Grand Canal during breakfast, drinks and dinner, was a joy.  We were lucky with the weather, and there are wall heaters, so even when it got a little chilly we were warm and cosy.  Great stay - would stay there again with no hesitation.
