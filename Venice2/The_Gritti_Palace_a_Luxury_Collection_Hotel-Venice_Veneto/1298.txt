My wide and I had a very brief one night stay here in December 2013 (room 310). The hotel underwent a major refurbishment, reopening earlier this year, and the place looks great. The location on the Grand Canal is hard to beat, a few minutes walk from St Marks Square. We arrived by water taxi, which pulls up directly to the hotel. There is a terrace overlooking the water, and a bar and restaurant on the ground floor. Our room (suite) was lovely, looking out over the canal. It was very well furnished, with free wifi and complimentary mineral water and wine provided. The room had a smart bathroom and comfortable bed, this room having a generously sized lounge as well. The staff were friendly and spoke good English. Of course all this does not come cheap, but nothing does in Venice.
