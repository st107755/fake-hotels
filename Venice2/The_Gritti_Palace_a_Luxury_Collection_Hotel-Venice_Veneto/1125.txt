We stayed here at the end of a 12 day trip to Rome, Florence and Venice. My first impression of the room we were given was great disappointment. It was along the small canal with 2 small windows, no sunlight and the view was a wall of the building across the small canal about 12 feet away. In the morning the canal is used by utility boats to deliver supplies and take away garbage so its very noisy. I suspect that there are about a dozen rooms that have this problem and the hotel only uses them when its very busy. The manager sensed our disappointment and after one night a much better room facing the square was found and we were extremely pleased. Kudos to him for doing this but the first room should be just be classified as a standard room and priced accordingly.  Everythingâ€¦
