A lovely hotel, beautifully decorated and in the a perfect location. We were very lucky to have excellent weather and sat outside for our breakfast every morning .  Staff were very helpful and service was excellent. We had a ' Gigglio Prestige room' which was specious and  beautiful. The only downside was that it was on the first floor, a bit higher up would have been nicer .
