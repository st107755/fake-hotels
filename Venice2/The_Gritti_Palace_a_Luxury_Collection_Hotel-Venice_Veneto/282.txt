Absolutely fabulous from start to finish! The hotel is perfect, the service is first class. Our concierge Ivan was incredibly helpful and advised us on a itinerary plan that would suit us for the days we were staying and nothing was too much trouble! The break was seamless not a single hitch! I would recommend to anyone considering this incredible destination. 5 ⭐️
