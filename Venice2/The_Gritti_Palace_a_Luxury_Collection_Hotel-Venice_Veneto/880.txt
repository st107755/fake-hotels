My husband and I booked to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and as a result of this the charming concierge upgraded us to one of their prime suites (room 211) overlooking the canal. The view was simply staggering from our balcony and throughout our stay the staff were friendly, efficient and extremely welcoming. The terrace area on the canal is unbeatable, be it for breakfast, dinner or a drink.  Our thanks to all the staff for making our anniversary weekend such a truly memorable experience.
