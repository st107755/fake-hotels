My husband and I stayed at the Gritti Palace for 2 nights and had a lovely room overlooking the Grand Canal. Everything about the hotel was faultless. It's beautifully decorated, has a superb restaurant and an equally fabulous spa. But more than anything what really stood out for us was the wonderful service we experienced. If we come back to Venice, I would definitely stay here again. I would highly recommend this hotel.
