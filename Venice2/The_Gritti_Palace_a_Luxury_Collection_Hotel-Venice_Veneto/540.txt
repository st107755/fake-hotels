If you want to have the top in town you have to stay at the Gritti. Very close to San Marco square, located on Gran Canal it has been completely renewed almost four years ago. Outstanding rooms with very kind and efficient staff. Don't miss an aperitif on the Gran Canal terrace. Not a budget hotel of course, but it worth every single euro you will spend.
