We stayed at gritti palace in July, lovely hotel, very well run and maintained however unless you've recently won lotto or inherited a couple of billion dollars be careful eating or drinking in house. We ordered 4 gin and tonics without considering the cost, when I got the check I almost had heart failure at $168 euro, that's around $250 NZD. Ridiculous. Great hotel, but the same G & T 200 ft up the road cost us 4 euro each. I'll let you decide but be warned.
