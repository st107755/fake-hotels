The Gritti Palace is exquisite! From the finest of rooms and suites, to the phenomenal food and drinks at the waterside restaurant and terrace, to the wonderfully attentive staff! We come back year after year and we're always impressed, yet feel at home. Mauro & Paolo are our fave servers. Ivan is an incredible concierge who knows THE best places to visit! Thank you once again for an incredible stay!
