Wonderful hotel on the canal. From the rooms, marble bathrooms, large comfy bed to the fantastic open veranda where breakfast was served this rated our best hotel yet. The service is also what rates this highly, all members of staff were great. The breakfast with fresh fruit and breads and eggs Benedict was exceptional. I only have one negative and that was my dinner in the dining room, I had rock fish and a chocolate desert both disappointing, the fish was bland. I therefore think the meal was very overpriced but my 3 dining companions really enjoyed theirs.
