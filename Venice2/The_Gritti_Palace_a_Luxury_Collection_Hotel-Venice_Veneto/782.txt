The Gritti Palace is a place where EVERYTHING is just right.  Great location, great staff, perfectly manicured property, lovely rooms, bathrooms, fixtures, artwork - you get the picture.  Like many hotels in Venice, you need to pay extra for a Grand Canal view.  We did and it was worth it!  This hotel is pricey, but if you want it PERFECT, you have to pay a little more, and for us, on a romantic vacation, it was totally worth it.
