Look up perfection in the dictionary and this hotel should be pictured. Stayed here some years ago and was excited to see it after the renovations. From check-in to check-out, service was top-notch, the room was excellent and it was the best experience we have ever had at a Starwood hotel. Starting the day with breakfast on the Grand Canal with the best cappuchino I've ever had in Italy to the evening turndown and drinks on the Canal, everything was what you would hope the hotel to be. It blew away the service we got at two St. Regis locations we stayed at in other parts of Italy. If you can afford it, it's worth every euro.
