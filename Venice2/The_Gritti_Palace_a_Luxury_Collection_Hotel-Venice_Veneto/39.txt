We arrived at the Gritti Palace for a quick drink and ended up sitting on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal with the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in site for nearly 2hrs. It was just lovely! The atmosphere was perfect, everyone was is good spirits, the service was 5* and of course, the view was spectacular! The cocktail menu is fabulous, the bar snacks are delightful and the food looked/smelt amazing! Highly recommend, it's a must visit for me.
