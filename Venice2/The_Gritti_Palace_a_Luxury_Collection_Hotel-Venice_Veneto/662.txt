I can't say enoug wonderful things about this hotel. We had a standard room with no view, but I knew this going in. The room was comfortable and decorated beautifully with heavy draping and chandeliers. The Acqua di Parma toiletries were a nice touch. It was the perfect place to spend the first few nights of our honeymoon. The location was very convenient to all of the major attractions. Easy walking distance to San Marco. We stayed here using SPG points, and although we probably weren't the hotels target demographic, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They arranged a complementary visit to the island of Murano, and walked us up to the front of the gondola line outside the hotel when the line was long. I felt very welcome and not out of place at all. Several peopleâ€¦
