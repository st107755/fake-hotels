I think this is a beautiful hotel, at a beautiful location.  It's the people that knock a star off this for me.  Some were good, some were meh.  Francessca at breakfast was awesome.  Other than that, not a lot of anticipating needs or proactive hello's.  Besides that all was fine and very pretty.  If you are just dropping stuff off and going out the whole time then this is great.  If you want to interact with staff a bit, just don't have huge expectations.  Still a wonderful couple of days there.
