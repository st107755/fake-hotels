Stayed here during the recent floods/ storm and felt extremely lucky to be in such a truly amazing hotel! We had booked using points and were upgraded to a lovely suite which had everything we needed. We enjoyed wonderful breakfasts,lunches and dinner on our last night. The bar was such a great place to be and the level of service throughout the hotel was all you could hope for. Thank you.
