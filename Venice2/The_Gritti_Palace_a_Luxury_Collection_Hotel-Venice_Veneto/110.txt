What can I say but the Gritti is simply the best.  Their location on the grand canal is amazing.  The private water taxis pulls up to their dock.  Their restaurant is an outdoor patio that is on the canal.  Being Marriott platinum, my breakfast was included - what a fantastic way to have breakfast!  The staff couldn't do enough for you.  The rooms look like a palace and are wonderfully decorated and comfortable.  If you are going to splurge, this is the place to do it!  I highly recommend.
