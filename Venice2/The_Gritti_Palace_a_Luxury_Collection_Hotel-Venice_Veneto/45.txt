We stayed at the hotel mid September and used points for our entire six night stay. I booked this before the point structure went up so felt I really lucked out here.  I am a lifetime Titanium member and were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  The hotel was fairly booked and the manager really went above and beyond juggling things around to get us into our suite.  We did not have a canal view but we were not in the room enough to even care.  A bottle of prosecco and chocolates were waiting for us when we entered the room and another day we were given a fruit platter.  A pleasant surprise and very nice. The extra space in the room was very welcome as we had much luggage as we were being away for over three weeks..  The hotel concierges were EXCELLENT before we arrived answeringâ€¦
