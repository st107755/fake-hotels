From the lobby, to the rooms, to the location- It is truly breathtaking! AMAZING location on the Grand Canal with incredible views and only a short walk away from San Marco Square and all the sights you want to see! Everything that you want to do it only a short distance away! The rooms are luxurious and special and the staff go the extra mile to accommodate you and make you feel welcome. It is extremely clean and stays very true to its 5-star luxury rating- everything is top notch. My husband and I never wanted to leave. The beds are SO comfortable and suites are SO nice, we didn't want to leave the room. Venice in itself is trulyâ€¦
