Stayed here for two nights. Had amazing weather and a great time in general. See below why i would only give it 4 stars:  Very nice things: - breakfast terrace is gorgeous  - great location  - Masi welcome bottle - concierge suggested us some nice places including the rooftop of the Bauer (despite being a competitor). That’s very professional!  Areas to improve: - no coffee maker in room/suite - in room ac control is illuminated all night (after being annoyed by this hotel kindly fixed it) - staff tends to give younger guests (I am 33...) attitude. Got weird looks when i walked out of the gym. Even when wearing a blazer i was several times asked if i am really a guest at the hotel when i wanted to go to the bar.  - even in suite the ceilings were very low.   Lots of kitsch in…
