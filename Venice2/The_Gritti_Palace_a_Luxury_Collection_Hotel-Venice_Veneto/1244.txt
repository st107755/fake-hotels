While the hotel is a short walk from the action of St Marks square it is in no way a negative to the elegance and charm of this gem.  In fact it was nice not being in the middle of everything and being able to retreat to a little slice of heaven.  The hotel has recently undergone a renovation and it feels like it did when it first opened except with all the modern conveniences.  It is truly a jewel box of a hotel with wonderful service and a delicious restaurant.  While not cheap by any standard it does deliver on what a luxury property should be.
