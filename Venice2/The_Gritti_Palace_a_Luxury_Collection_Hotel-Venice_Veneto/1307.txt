Superb location right on the Grand canal and opposite the much Canaletto  painted Salute church or to give it its correct name 'Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute'. The hotel has a floating pontoon dining area from where you can watch the water traffic go by. Water taxi's will deliver you to the door. Every time I am in Venice I make a point of dining there, lovely meal Rose champagne and a bill to match, what the heck though it's worth it for the view and the atmosphere. Around the corner is Harry's bar. You have to go around the back of the hotel and back to the canal to get to it. The hotel I believe has been updated since I last stayed in it. aircon would be a big plus at certain times of the year.
