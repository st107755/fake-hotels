The renovation and restoration has been done amazingly well. They have brought back the historic elegance and charm of truly Venetian design, culture and style. Truly amazing place. A proud Italian signature heritage style luxury hotel.  Design and attention to detail matters in every luxury hotel, especially a hotel with historic relevance. This hotel and staff epitomize elegance and brilliance.  Your stay at this hotel will no doubt be truly magical. Exceptionally good food. A huge range of wines and drinks. An evening with a shot of  single malt on the rocks by the river is something I recommend to fellow travellers.  Congratulations to the General Manager. This is an outstanding hotel.
