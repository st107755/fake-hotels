My wife and I visited the Gritti in 2011, before the renovation.  The work was very tastefully done to preserve the hotel's charm and it is still just as beautiful as 2011 if not more so.    The service remains phenomenal.  I inquired with the concierge about a tour on the hotel's new Aquariva "Il Doge", which was temptingly parked directly in front of the terrace where we took several (excellent) meals.  They took pains to accommodate us and the children - for no charge - on a perfect hour-long tour of the lagoon and a few high speed runs that the kids loved.     Nowhere else we would rather stay in Venice.
