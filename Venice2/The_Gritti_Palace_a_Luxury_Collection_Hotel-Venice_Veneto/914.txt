This hotel was amazing. The room was incredibly spacious, the bath was heaven. The location was unbelievable. It was right on the Canal and our water taxi from the train delivered us right to the front door.   Their restaurant/bar is not to be missed as it sits right on the canal. A great place for a night cap with a spectacular view of the city.   While this was by far the most expensive spot we stayed in Italy, it was worth every penny. No detail was missed and the staff was very helpful both before our trip and during.   Everything was within walking distance - St Michael's, shops restaurants. Everything.
