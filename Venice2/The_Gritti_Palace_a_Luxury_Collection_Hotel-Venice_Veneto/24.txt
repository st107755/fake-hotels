We came here just for a night and it is definitely not enough. Loved the interiors of the hotel such as paintings, decoration, lightings and the food selection during breakfast was wonderful and tasty. The lady who help check in and out of my hotel stay was very nice and helpful (brunette lady wearing spectacles, sorry could not remember her name!). Thank you for the room upgrade to suite which me and my wife loved it! Again, one night was not enough to fully enjoy the room and hotel facilities. We will definitely return soon!
