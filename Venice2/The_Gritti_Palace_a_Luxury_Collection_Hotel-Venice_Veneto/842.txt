The Gritti Palace is one of the best hotels in the world...bar none.  The location is excellent and the staff here is first rate.  I cannot find fault in anything.  I was expecting smaller rooms but was pleasantly surprised.  The rooms were excellent and the beds were extremely comfortable.  I have been all over the world and this has become one of my instant favorites.
