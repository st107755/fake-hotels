This place is gorgeous - we had a fantastic room on the grand canal and the views were breathtaking - our suite had a fabulous lounge area and a super quiet side facing bedroom, lovely bathroom etc.  The hotel is very close to everything you need and we walked most places but it is near both a tranghetti stop (to get you across the canal) and a water bus /taxi station. Breakfast was lovely and in a glamourous room and we had a drink every night in the cozy bar before retiring to bed.  It was too cold to sit outside but it will be even more magical when the outside terrace is open.  Staff were fantastic and remembered our names from the very first day
