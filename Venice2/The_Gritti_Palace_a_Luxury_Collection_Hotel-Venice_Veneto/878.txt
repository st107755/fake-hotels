Hotel itself is very nice. Location is excellent. Problem is the food. Prices are exorbitant and the quality sub par. My dinner cost over 300 euros. Soup was so BLAND it was tasteless. Main course was a pasta, nice but definitely not worth €50. Deserts though good ranged from €20 ~ €40. Overall a HUGE disappointment for their restaurant.
