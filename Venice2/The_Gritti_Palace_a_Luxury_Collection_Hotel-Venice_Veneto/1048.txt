The view across the Grand Canal to Santa Maria della Salute, gondoleirs singing beneath the window, the incomparable confort, unobtrusive impeccable service, excellent food in the restaurant combined with good value, why stay anywhere else (if you can afford it). The only minor drawback is the small foyer which, when full of loud talking Americans, can be claustrophobic.
