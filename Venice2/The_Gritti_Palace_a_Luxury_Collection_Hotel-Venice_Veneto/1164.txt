We had a wonderful stay at the Gritti Palace for my birthday. Booked through the BA website which gave us a great deal (including breakfast). Service was excellent and even included a complimentary birthday cake. We chose to eat our dinners out and the concierge recommended and booked a lovely restaurant which had a great atmosphere and wasn't too pricey. We'll certainly be back once we've saved up some more pennies.  Oh, just one tip, there are mozzies in Venice so don't do what we did and open your windows at night - just use the air con!
