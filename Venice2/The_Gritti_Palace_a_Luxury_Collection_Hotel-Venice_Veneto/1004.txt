We stayed for 3 nights in May to celebrate our Silver wedding anniversary. We couldn't have picked a better hotel. Classy, top service, friendly staff, fantastic central location on the Grand Canal with an amazing restaurant terrace. The stunning spacious rooms are crammed with antiques and genuine Venetian features with luxurious toiletries and comfy beds, with fabulous Egyptian cotton linen. Cannot wait to return to my little Venetian slice of heaven. Would thoroughly recommend. Not cheap, but then what in Venice is, and totally worth it!
