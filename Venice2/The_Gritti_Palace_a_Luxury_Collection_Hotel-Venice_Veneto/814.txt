We stayed for four nights in a cold but stunningly beautiful January. The staff were fantastic. The concierge knew everything and everyone, his recommendations were all great. The restaurant and bar staff were very attentive and talented with cocktails. The food and wine list were top drawer. We ate so much we had food comas. Twice. Our room was large, pretty and lovely and warm. A real treat between epic sightseeing and wonderful art. We'll be back next January.
