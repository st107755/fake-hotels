This was a short romantic getaway for us and The Gritti Palace did not disappoint. Newly refurbish but yet unchanged, The Gritti is possibly the most romantic hotel I've ever been in and I'm not alone in this assessment.  Our suite while extravagant was very comfortable and not stuffy.  Breakfast or lunch on the terrence overlooking the grand canal is something you have to do.  It is magical watching the boats and gondola go by and not be transported to a different time.  The staff are extremely attentive and make you feel like an honor guest.  If you want a hotel to fall in love all over again with your special someone then this is it.
