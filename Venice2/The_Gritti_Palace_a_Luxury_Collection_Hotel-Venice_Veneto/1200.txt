We ended a 3-week trip to Italy with a few days at the Gritti Palace.  Words can't describe how great an experience this hotel is.  Its a bit pricey for sure, but worth the splurge.  You'll never forget it.  We've been to the Cipriani and the Danieli before and the Gritti Palace tops them by a country mile in my view.  You're in the middle of Venice, but not quite in the midst of all the crowds.  The bar right on the Grand Canal, across from a grand church, is incredible.  I never wanted to leave!   The staff were super attentive and responsive, which is not the most common thing in Italy.  The rooms are the highlight, however.  They are so well appointed and so comfortable that our kids begged to stay IN one night and order room service.  Arriving at the hotel by water taxi atâ€¦
