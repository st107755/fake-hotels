Simply one of the best hotels out there. Every second of the stay, from entry, being escorted to our rooms, our requests for buckets of ice and helping us with our arrangements back to the train station, handled with the utmost care and friendliness. Never encountered such helpful staff, and the room was absolutely gorgeous, with amazing amenities (acqua di parma!)! The bath was big and the sheets comfortable. Despite us not appearing wealthy (because we aren't, thanks credit card points!), we were treated like royalty, a concern we had coming here and not fitting in with the normal clientele. If you can afford it, do it!
