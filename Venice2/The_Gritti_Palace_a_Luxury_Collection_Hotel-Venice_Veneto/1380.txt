This recently renovated hotel was a wonderful place to stay in Venice.  The view of the Grand Canal is of course lovely, and fantastic shopping and San Marco are within easy walking distance.  The service was consistent and excellent.  We also appreciated that the interiors nicely blend a more historical style with modern conveniences like high-speed wifi.  This hotel is part of the Luxury Collection of Starwood Hotels, which is also great.  All around an excellent experience, will definitely be staying here again.
