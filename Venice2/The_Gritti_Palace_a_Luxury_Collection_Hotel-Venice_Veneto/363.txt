Stayed over two nights last week for a mid-week break before visiting Vicenza.  The property lived up to our expectations.  We were met in the arrival hall and fast tracked to the pier at the airport and then whisked to the property in 30 mins, highly recommend this service.  We arrive before midnight and checked in by the concierge, assuming the receptionist were occupied.  The suite we had was beautifully renovated in 2013 and was very quiet.  The highlight of our stay was the breakfast served on the terrace, the waiters don't encourage to eat outside, but you are more than welcome to enjoy coffee or a glass of Prosecco.  The temporary Ponte Salute was very handy for us too!  Grazie Mille Gritti!
