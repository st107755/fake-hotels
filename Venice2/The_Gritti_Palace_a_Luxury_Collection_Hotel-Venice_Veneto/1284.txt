We stayed here on way back to UK following a skiing holiday in the Dolomites (Jan 2014) The hotel interior is immaculate & beautifully opulent, our room also, so feels very Venetian! Location is perfect, a very short walk from shopping & attractions & has a gondola station at front door & direct access from canal to hotel. The view is the very definition of Venice but you get you drink it in peace from the hotel's private terrace. We were struck by how friendly, warm & helpful the staff were. We felt so welcomed by check in staff (Massimo?) & our 2 year old loves her little Lion which he had delivered to our room as a gift for her. Overall a lovely relaxing, laid back visit. The service felt very personal, like a family hotel & they clearly have a lot of pride in their hotel &â€¦
