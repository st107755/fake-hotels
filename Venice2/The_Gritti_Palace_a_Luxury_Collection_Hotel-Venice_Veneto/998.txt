The Gritti Palace was perfect.  The hotel is on the canal, with two restaurants, one for lunch, one for breakfast and dinner.  Both have amazing food and the joy of canal side dining. The staff were great, with prompt and very polite service, even as we walked in with three kids in tow.  We had rooms 229 and 230, adjoined by a hallway, making it a suite.  Rooms are huge, balconies overlooking street with canal at end, lovely wood floors, luxurious beds, loads of towels, welcome bottle of wine, marble bathrooms that are huge and beautiful.  This hotel is very comfortable, very quite, the perfect spot in Venice. The doors usual actual keys, yes, metal keys, we haven't seen this in years!  I cannot say enough about this place, I loved it. Concierge was very helpful, unsure of hisâ€¦
