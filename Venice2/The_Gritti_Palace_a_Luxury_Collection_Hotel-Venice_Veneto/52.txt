Stayed in this hotel during busy season in August 2019.  From check-in to check-out the hotel exceeded my expectations.  The decor is traditionally Venetian - cast those minimalist wishes aside for your stay - with amazing attention to detail in every room and area.  Had an amazing lunch on the Gritti Terrace with beautiful views out to the Grand Canal.  Finished off an amazing stay with a personal water taxi back to Marco Polo airport which took about 40 minutes.  I'm still dreaming of my visit to this hotel!
