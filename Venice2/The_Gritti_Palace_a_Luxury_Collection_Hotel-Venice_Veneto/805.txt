We have been to Venice four times now and this was by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The decor was wonderful. The staff all polite and very accommodating Our room faced the canal - it was a good size , exquisitely furnished with a lovely bathroom. The breakfast buffet was superb - food was delicious and service was very good. The spa was to die for, just what we needed after a hectic day sightseeing.
