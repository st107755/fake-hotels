We stayed for 3 nights mid February for a treat. The bedroom was beautiful and quiet. Breakfast superb but recommend it being part of the overnight deal. Atmospheric bar though very expensive. Fabulous outside area on the Grand Canal where the boat taxi picks up to got to the airport. We did'nt eat in the restaurant preferring to eat out and highly recommend Ristorante L'Opera 5 minutes walk away Campo Sant'Angelo - we were amazed how many youg people were staying considering the price.
