"+" * Wonderful location, beautiful rooms * Offered a free upgrade which I thought was a lovely touch * Very private luxury hotel unlike the Danieli which feels like Hilton * Very helpful concierge * Wonderful Riva bar, great view  * Aqua di Parma toiletries  * Great and quick room service, very tasty!  "-" * Pricey bar with the average of 12 EU for a 0.3 Moretti beer and cocktail starting 20 EU. Service and presentation are wonderful though! * Keep in mind you can not ask for an iron and will have to order pressing as a service. This might also take time.
