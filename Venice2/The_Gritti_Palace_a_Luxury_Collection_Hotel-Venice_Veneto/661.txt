The Gritti Palace Hotel rests at the Grand Canal with spectacular views matched by the wonderful service and staff. Close to everything but in your own world during the time you are not out and about the city. The rooms are spacious with all the amenities you could ask for except for television channel selections, which are limited. Fortunately, there is so much to see and enjoy in Venice you won't care. Relaxing at the Grand Canal waterside bar or restaurant is the perfect way to end a memorable day! A can't miss choice.
