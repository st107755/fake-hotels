From the moment we arrived - everything about this hotel was pure perfection.  The woman who checked us in (Roberta?) was wonderful.  Our room faced the canal - it was sensational, large, exquisitely furnished with a soaker tub and an amazing bathroom.  The restaurant was terrific-  breakfast buffet was the best of the trip and dinner in the restaurant was superb - food was delicious and service was incredible.  The gym was clean, and better than most.  The spa was absolutely sensational - we had really wonderful massages. Staff was terrific and knew us by name. Hotel is near San Marco and not as crowded - also right near the Vaporetto stop - very convenient. We cant wait to return.
