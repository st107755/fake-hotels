Great location and an amazing property. But, I have to give it 4 stars because we were very disappointed with our room check in due to dirty dishes, open drink bottles and food containers when we entered our suite. This should not happen in a 5 star L hotel. I expect things to be perfect! Otherwise, our room was large and luxurious, and the bathroom and bed were amazing. We really enjoyed the staff! Enjoy the front deck of the hotel over looking the Grand Canal.
