This is just an amazing hotel that also takes great care of SPG Platinum and Gold members. The hotel, the service, location is just superb.  The only thing that I could possibly point out is that breakfast can have little more choices but not a big deal as it is. You simply can't beat breakfast on the terrazza over Grand Canal.
