This was one of the 5 best hotels I have seen in the entire world.  Great location with truly beautiful furnishings in the rooms and common areas. Bathroom facilities were modern.  Temperature controls were great. Breakfasts were delicious.  The price tag was one of the 5 highest I have ever paid but if that is not a problem for you, you will enjoy the Gritti Palace.
