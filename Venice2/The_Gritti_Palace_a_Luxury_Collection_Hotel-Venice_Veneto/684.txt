The Gritti Palace is, as the name suggests, the former palazzo of a doge of Venice, Andrea Gritti.  Located on the Grand Canal with spectacular views from the breakfast veranda, the entire property is filled with period art and exquisite furnishings and is impeccably maintained.  A small (but friendly and unobtrusive) army of hotel staff were there to serve our every need. The concierge provided consistently excellent advice on everything from restaurants to gondola service.  Naturally, none of this come cheap but you will get value for your money.  If you are looking for a world class sojourn only a few minutes walk from the heart of Venice, this is the place.
