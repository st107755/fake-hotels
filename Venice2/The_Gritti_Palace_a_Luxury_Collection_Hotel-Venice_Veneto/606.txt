This is a beautifully decorated hotel that enjoys one of the best locations on the Grand Canal.  It's on the cusp of being superb and, whilst there's nothing in particular that one could justify complaining about, there's a distinct lack of attention to the small details that make a good hotel a "great hotel", especially at the prices charged.  The concierge team is excellent and worthy of special mention.
