Venice is magical; the Gritti Palace is also.  Beautiful room, great size.  Staff friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Lovely breakfast, and we enjoyed drinks and snacks one evening in the bar which was also delicious.  Great recommendations from the concierge for dinner.  The hotel organised pick up from the train station with a private water taxi was an exciting way to arrive and well worth the cost.  Highly recommended as a place to stay.
