Definitely a luxury hotel.  The cafe on the canal is the perfect place to start the day.  My only complaint was the old fashion key.  We only got one and had to remember to leave it a the desk every time we left the hotel.  Having the gonadaliers sing below the window made it very special.  It is a beautifully restored old historic building.
