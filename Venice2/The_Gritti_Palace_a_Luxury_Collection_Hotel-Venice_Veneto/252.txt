From the second my mother and I entered this hotel we were treated like royals. Staff was happy to take our bags while we were taken to check in.  The woman checking us in was friendly and conversational, she escorted us to our room to show us around.   The room was beautiful, a huge bathroom, comfortable bed and an obvious attention to detail in the decor. A small box of chocolates and a bottle of red wine awaited us which was a very nice little treat to enjoy after a day of exploring.   The hotel is easily accessible by the water taxi and a very short walk from the water bus stop.  My mom and I did most of our exploring by foot from this hotel and were able to get to all the spots we really wanted to see easily.
