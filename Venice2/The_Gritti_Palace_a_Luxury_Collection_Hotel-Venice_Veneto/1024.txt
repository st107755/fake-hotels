The Gritti Palace is just a wonderful, wonderful hotel. I can't think of a more romantic, memorable setting right on the Grand Canal with amazing views. Nothing is too much trouble and even when we caused a minor panic by disappearing into the city for several hours with phones turned off, and our travel company was urgently trying to contact us, everything was dealt with calmly and professionally. While we were in Venice it was my partner's 50th Birthday and, totally unprompted, the hotel presented us with a bottle of wine and a huge delicious dessert cake - and the waiter even sang happy Birthday in Italian to my partner !!!  The hotel isn't cheap (like most things in Venice unfortunately) but it is a once in a lifetime experience that we will remember for ever.
