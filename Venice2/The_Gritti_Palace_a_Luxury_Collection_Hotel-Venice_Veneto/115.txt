My spouse and I stayed at the Gritti Palace for 3 nights.  Arriving by train from Milan, we were greeted at our carriage by a hotel staff, and escorted to our waiting private water taxi.  On hindsight, for 190 euros, we could probably had done away with the meet and greet, and just paid 65 euros for the water taxi.  It was pretty easy to find the water taxi stop.  But, of course having someone from the hotel handle our luggage and sending us on our way was really nice to have.    The water taxi docks right at the doorstep of the hotel, where our bags are taken care of, with the lovely doorman helping us off the boat.  This is truly a luxury, not many hotels have their own private dock.  First impressions, this is a beautiful hotel, and this was clearly going to be the beginningâ€¦
