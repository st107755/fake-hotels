Honestly this place was fantastic. Absolutely beautiful, wonderful service, all without being obnoxious or pretentious. The rooms were luxurious, the location is fantastic, and the concierge is otherworldly; I was particularly impressed that he was able to recommend a broad range of restaurants, many of which were off the beaten path, at a variety of price points, and was able to get last minute reservations at all of them. Everywhere he sent us was fantastic.  Can't say enough how much I liked this place. A true luxury masterpiece (and can be booked with starwood points!!)
