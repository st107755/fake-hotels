We stayed in the hotel which is all you'd expect , just perfect , lovely rooms , made to feel special by all the staff Breakfast Might seem expensive at 53 euros but location and atmosphere view and quality of the food more than compensate , as does the prosecco ! Fantastic place to watch the world go by , Cocktails excellent value at 21 euro including olives nuts etc...for a great view ..
