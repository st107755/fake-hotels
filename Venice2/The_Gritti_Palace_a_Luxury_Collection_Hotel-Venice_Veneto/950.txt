We came to Venice because of my wife -- I didn't want to go back.  I was so wrong.  And the Gritti Palace proved me wrong.  It is everything I could want in a hotel: refined, impeccable service, right on the water, amazing views, good food... the list goes on and on.  In the room, we marveled at the appointments -- lucky enough for a suite upgrade -- and then realized the beautiful gold leaf wallpaper was... fabric.  Our last day there, we had to take a water taxi, which alighted on a dock adjacent to the hotel.  It was the closest I've felt to being a movie star. By all means, go.
