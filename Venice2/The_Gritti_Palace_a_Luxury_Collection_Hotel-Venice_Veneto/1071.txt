This hotel is certainly on my top 5. As soon as you arrive, you can feel the warmth of the customer service which is second to none. Also, the entire lobby smells of Aqua di Parma since they have the SPA running there. (The trick is someone spraying the perfume every now and then in the main areas.)   Close enough to St Mark's Square and other main attractions. Gondola taxi right next door. Lots of restaurants around.  SPG Members are very well treated here. I got upgraded to a Suite which was fantastic.  The SPA is one of the few Aqua Di Parma ones in the world (also the tolietries!) and I would definitely recommend. The gym is small so don't expect much there.  Breakfast was plenty but I had better options on less luxurious hotels. Did not try the restaurant but had a drinkâ€¦
