Probably the most spectacular room I have ever seen, let alone stayed in.  Like most of Venice, the hotel is in an historic building, but they have managed to provide modern amenities, quiet comfort and anything else you might need without sacrificing any of the old world charm.  Particularly impressive was the bathroom with exquisite marble and a shower that would comfortably accommodate people well in excess of two meters tall.  The staff was friendly and helpful, arranging a transportation to Murano for a tour of a glass factory and then to Burano in addition to suggesting restaurants and other activities.  We were sad to leave.
