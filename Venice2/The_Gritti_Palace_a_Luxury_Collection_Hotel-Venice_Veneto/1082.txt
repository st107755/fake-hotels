What a grand hotel! What amazing service! This hotel oozes with elegance and grandeur! It is right on the canal. Old world elegance. Right off the vaporetto stop through a narrow alley. A short walk to St Mark. You cannot beat the location. Looks across Santa Maria Salute. Bar DiLonghi is amazing. Go there toward the evening and take photo of everything lit up. The place is simply magical. It is not cheap but then nothing in Venice is cheap. Nothing in Venice is like anything else in the world so yes, please splurge! You can start at the Gritti. Staff bends over backwards to please you. Housekeeping staff cannot do enough for you. Jiovanni at check in was so kind. I emailed the hotel before I arrived and received nothing but professional and helpful replies. Before I walked inâ€¦
