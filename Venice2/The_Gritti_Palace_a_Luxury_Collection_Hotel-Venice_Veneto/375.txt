Our room, although on the expensive side was luxurious for Venice.  There have been improvements made to the bathroom, but it is on the small side.  Extremely high ceilings and lots of very luxurious d√©cor.  This hotel is only a short walk to St. Mark's square which we love.  The restaurant is lovely both for breakfast and dinner.  Right on the canal which makes it very romantic.  Venice is pricey, so just go for it.  We loved every minute of our stay.
