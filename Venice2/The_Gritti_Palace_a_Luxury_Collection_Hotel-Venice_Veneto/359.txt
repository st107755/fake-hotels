Thank you Gritti Palace for making our first visit to Venice unforgettable. From arriving by water taxis we were treated as old friends. We appreciated the upgrade and were blown away by our junior suite. Everything about this hotel exceeds expectations. It's the small touches that make this hotel stand out. ie Mouthwash in bathroom. On the Grand Canal we spent time drinking cocktails watching Venetian life pass by. A short walk past designer boutiques and you are in St Mark's Square. We loved getting lost and discovering Venice. The hotel was always easy to navigate back to. Being a smaller hotel meant personal attention was impeccable.  We have promised ourselves a return visit. Thank you
