We had two perfect nights at the Gritti, the Head Concierge Ivan and his team were unbeatable. We had an upgraded room which was spacious, spectacular, and a beautiful bathroom. But what made the hotel was not the glamour but the genuine desire of all the hotel staff to please, to anticipate. We lunched and dined overlooking the canal. The hotel is away from the terrifying Venice crowds but easily accessible to what you want, the spa and fitness room more than adequate. We will return!
