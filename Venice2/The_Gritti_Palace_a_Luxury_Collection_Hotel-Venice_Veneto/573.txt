A lot of positives about this hotel.    The location is stunning and far enough away from the main tourist spots to be comfortable.  there is a gondola stop for crossing the canal right outside the front door if you want to go to the Guggenheim, etc...  5 minute walk to St Marks. 10 minutes to the Rialto ( a little hint - go left to go to the Rialto - nicer walk).    The staff is the right combination of supportive and confident.  Not sure how to explain it but they are wonderful.  We flew in early from Philly - not even sure our room would be ready we were treated to an available room and an upgrade to the La Fenice suite which was a huge room with sitting area, guest 1/2 bath and a balcony.  We still feel really lucky!  I would recommend that suite to anyone - very veryâ€¦
