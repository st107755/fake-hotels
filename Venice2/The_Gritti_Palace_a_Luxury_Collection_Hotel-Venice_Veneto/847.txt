We traveled to Venice and stayed at the Gritti Palace in November 2015.  I have stayed in many luxury hotels and I have to say the Gritti was in my top two.  The service at the front desk, the concierge and the restaurant we superb.  There we fresh flowers in our room upon arrival as well and a bottle of wine and champagne.  After the first day everyone in the hotel knew our names as greeted us when leaving in the morning and returning in the evening.  We will definitely stay here again!!!
