The Gritti palace from the moment you arrive is something special Stunning decor in reception a warm welcome and views that stay with you  Having breakfast whilst wAtching the Grand canal full of gondolas the bus and people a view of the church at Maria unfortunately can't remember wonderful Our start was bumpy with a lunch where we waited for half an hour and our food didn't arrive together So as I my way I requested to speak to the manager her response was perfect Full of apology  We were not charged for lunch  And after that the staff and service was great Mybirthday dinner with the best seats outside and lovely cake food of my choice off menu  Gritti is not cheap but worth every penny  Also don't need a canal view room as sit there for meals we had a quite room at the backâ€¦
