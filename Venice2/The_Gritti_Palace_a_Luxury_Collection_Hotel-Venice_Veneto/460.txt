This hotel faces Grand Canal at the end of street.  It is quiet and comfortable.  The concierge desk was extremely helpful in arranging excursions and restaurant suggestions.  Our room was clean, spacious and tastefully furnished.  Their lobby is extremely comfortable to sit and the outside terrace was gorgeous watching Grand Canal.  We sat there watching busy canal traffic and enjoyed quiet romantic evening scene.  This is a gem hotel in Venice.
