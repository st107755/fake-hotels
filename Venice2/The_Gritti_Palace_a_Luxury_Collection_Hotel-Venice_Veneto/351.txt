Simply stunning. The most romantic hotel in the most romantic city in the world. From the location to the staff there was nothing that could have been improved upon. The moment we checked in, we knew this would be special. Being SPG Platinum and traveling on points, I feel we were treated like rockstars. We were escorted up to our giant suite upgrade and given a tour by the front desk. An expansive suite with a bathroom that was 100% marble complete with heated floors. The staff was beyond friendly and there was not a single time that we had to open a door for ourselves. A warm and sincere greeting each and every time we came in contact with someone. The best hotel of our 10 days in Italy.
