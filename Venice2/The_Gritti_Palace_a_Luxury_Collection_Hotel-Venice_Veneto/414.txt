Hard to add anything new to what has already been mentioned by numerous other reviewers.  This place has FANTASTIC views, staff and rooms.  The service is truly exceptional in all areas.  Nothing better then enjoying a meal at any time of the day on their terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  The rooms are truly opulent and you feel special from the moment you awake to the minute you turn in for the night.  My family loved their recent stay and cannot wait to go back !
