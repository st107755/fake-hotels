One night only and well worth the splurge.  Stayed here prior to our Cruise and the Hotel is exceptional, staff is amazing. Check out the bar, it has an amazing view on nights the terrace is not used for Dinning. A special thanks to Ronina who checked us in and made us feel welcome from the moment we entered the Hotel.  Very close to Plaza San Marco, so it made it easy to get around.
