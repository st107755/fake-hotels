We stopped by for a drink at the outside bar after a long way of wandering around Venice. The views of the Grand Canal and San Salute are magnificent and the service is perfect. My 19 euro bellini was delicious. We expected the high prices but there isn't a better place to sit and enjoy the view. Next time, we'd like to stay at the Gritti which was sold out on this trip.
