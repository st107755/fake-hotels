Oh my goodness-I stay in so many great hotels and it just felt like a privilege to be at the Gritti Palace.  From the point of organizing a private taxi to the hotel for €120 to the guest only breakfast with an unrivaled view... well the place was just exceptional. You are on a first name basis with everyone from the moment you arrive. I’m just incredibly grateful for the time that we spent and it is already in my contacts for future visits.
