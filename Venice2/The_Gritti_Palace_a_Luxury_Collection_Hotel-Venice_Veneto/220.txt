I had the privilege of staying at the gritti palace. I arrived at Venice Airport which is New and pretty amazing. Walking from arrivals to my water taxi a beautiful sarranella . Whisked to the Main canal and arrived at the Doc right in front of The palace. As soon as I stepped inside the lobby I felt transported to another world. The decor the ambience can only be described as sumptuous. Went directly to my stunning room. The Hotel had a complete refurbishment not long ago. Air con, stunning fabrics, just amazing. The spa on the main level was fantastic. Steam room , massage etc.breakfast on the dock was simply lovely. The Private roof terrace had an uninterrupted view of Venice which is one of the most amazing terraces I have ever seen.The staff , attention to detail, nothingâ€¦
