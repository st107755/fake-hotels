The Gritti Palace is one of the better hotels in Venice, not only because of the venue but also because of the location.    Centrally located a within walking distance of the Piazza San Marco you cannot go wrong as far as location is concerned. The hotel itself is as are so many hotels an old Palace and the interior exemplifies this. The room was quite large by European standards, but then I would hope so for the price. The room itself was lavishly decorated with antiques and the bathroom was well stocked with Acqua di Parma products.  Overall a very pleasant place to stay when spending time in Venice.
