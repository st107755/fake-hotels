Upgraded to Presidential Suite upon arrival, so that put us in a great mood right off the bat, but it didn't disappoint from there. Everyone we met was helpful and friendly. Breakfast buffet (included) was generous and good, but it was the setting on the grand canal watching the boats and gondolas that really set the restaurant apart. I liked being able to walk out the door and walk to pretty much every restaurant, museum and shop (some of the other luxury resorts require ferry, which takes a lot of time, I I preferred to take that time hanging out in the suite or the beautiful lobby).   Skip the spa. It was clean and relaxing, and the treatment was fine, but not outstanding. That's my only knock on the place at all.
