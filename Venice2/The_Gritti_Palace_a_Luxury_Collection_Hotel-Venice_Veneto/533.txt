The hotel is simply amazing.  My partner and I stayed here this past Christmas and the stay was magical - the hotel/room and especially the staff.  From the moment that we arrived till we left - everyone was gracious and extremely helpful.  I want to single out the staff of the bar - they were the epitome of what you expect from a luxury historic 5 star hotel.  I will always stay here when I am in Venice...worth every penny!
