My wife, 21-year old son and I stayed at The Gritti for 3 nights in September and loved everything about it.  The staff was kind and accommodating, our room was nothing short of spectacular as it looked out onto the Grand Canal, and breakfast each morning and apertivo each evening sitting on the Grand Canal was majestic.  We loved everything about our stay at The Gritti and cannot wait to return,.
