The rooms are stunning.  We were traveling with another couple and each had very different decor, both very beautiful.  Neither of us had views of the Grand Canal unfortunately, I doubt many do.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant on the canal is a perfect setting for taking in the views of Venice. Location is great for walking to local attractions, shopping and restaurants.
