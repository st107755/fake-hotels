Had a fantastic stay at The Gritti Palace last weekend. The staff was super attentive, loved the history of the rooms and lobby/bars. Itâ€™s in a very central location and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great couples get away. The breakfast was awesome but the real perk was the attentiveness of the staff. Top notch all the way. Thx and look forward to coming back!!!
