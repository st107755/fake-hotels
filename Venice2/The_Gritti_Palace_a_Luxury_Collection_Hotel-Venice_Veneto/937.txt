We were on a trip around France and Italy (Antibes, Venice and Lake Garda) and stayed in Venice for 1 night at the Gritti Palace. We chose the hotel from the TripAdvisor reviews.  We had a very nice stay with 3 concerns but would stay again.  1) When we checked in our room was not ready so as a compromise they upgraded us to a suite. The suite was amazing and far better than the room we booked but when you are only staying for 1 night your room should be ready on time. 2) We had dinner in the restaurant and the terrace is amazing, right on the grand canal. However when I booked i specifically had asked for a table right on the edge of the terrace on the canal. We were given a table 1 row away. Sounds like a petty gripe but you'd expect such an expensive restaurant to tell youâ€¦
