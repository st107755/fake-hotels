My friend brought me here for a birthday meal /celebration on my first trip to Venice. Everything about the restaurant and terrace was just perfect. A great spot to watch the world go by and enjoy beautiful food. I had the Hemingway risotto - a dish that has been on the menu for 80 years, a buttery, creamy rice dish with lobster and scampi followed by turbot cooked with tomatoes and orange which was delightful. A few cheeses for dessert and a lovely little cake. All around us people were enjoying the summer sun and ask dusk turned to darkness the terrace lighting added a special touch. Definitely recommend. Thank you to our waiters Valentino and Giovanni you were so thoughtful and attentive.
