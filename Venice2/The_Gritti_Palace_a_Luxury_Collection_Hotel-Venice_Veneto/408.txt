Interesting how I see so many people leaving reviews for coming to Gritti Palace to have meal and drinks, yet me and my best friend were turned away. We were told we couldn't come in or prebook and that they didn't have a terrace at all, which is ridiculous as I did my research before hand and upon recommendation was told to come there for a meal and drinks. Disgusting behavior. I have never been made to feel so undermined and embarrassed in my life. Thanks a lot Gritti Palace for your ignorance, turning customers away, making me feel like I wasn't worthy of coming to visit your hotel and the biggest one of all for the lie you told me.   A place with that behavior is a 0* for me, regardless of your "luxury" status. Honesty goes along way.
