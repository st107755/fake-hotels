Just leaving the Amazing Gritti Palace from a 2 night stay in the landmark room (211) Cannot recommend the hotel enough, all the staff were friendly and helpful, location perfect and the room AMAZING!!!  We had a couples massage which was really good  Food was beautiful and the eggs benedict are a must   It was my husbands birthday whilst there and the little touches they done were lovely  We try and visit Venice yearly but have never stayed in The Gritti before, we will now not stay anywhere else   Thank you so much Gritti for making our stay magical
