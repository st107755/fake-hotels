Simply put, the Gritti Palace is one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever visited, and a true gem in the heart of Venice.  My wife and I spent two beautiful nights in a wonderful suite on the 4th floor overlooking the small side canal last weekend as part of our 5th wedding anniversary.  We arrived late the first night, around 8pm, but as soon as we stepped off the water taxi we were warmly greeted by members of the staff and our bags were swooped away while we were shown to the reception desk for check in.  Both my wife and I are SPG Platinum members, and status recognition is excellent.  The whole front desk staff from the General Manager on down do everything possible to make you feel welcomed and at home.  Not only is the hotel richly appointed with lavish furnishingsâ€¦
