We stayed at the Gritti for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience.  The staff were very attentive, the property was in excellent condition and the outdoor deck is captivating.  Just loved have breakfast on the deck as well as afternoon cocktails.  Our room was smaller than others, but we managed extremely well.  The bathrooms were all marble,  had a double sink vanity, great amenities and the towels very plush.  I would  not recommend a  room with a Grand Canal view, as you get much activity day and night making sleep challenging.  However, if view overrides peace and quiet, you can get none better that a Grand Canal view.  There are trade offs.
