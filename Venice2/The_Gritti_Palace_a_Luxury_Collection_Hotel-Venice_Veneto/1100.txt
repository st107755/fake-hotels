My girlfriend and I went to Venice for a 4 day shopping trip from December 8th to the 12th . We stayed at The Gritti Palace . Our stay there could be described as totally OVER THE TOP w/ the most beautiful silk covered walls ; the most helpful and attentive concierge staff and delicious breakfasts and lunches . Obviously the location is perfect next to St. Mark's square but it is the service from all that truly makes the difference ! I would heartily suggest if you want to visit Venice that December is a great time to go , no high water , no crowds , easy to secure reservations and the beautiful feeling of Christmas in the air . My best , Lydia Shire
