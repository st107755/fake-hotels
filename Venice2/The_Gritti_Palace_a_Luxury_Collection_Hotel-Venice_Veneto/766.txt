Me and my wife stayed 2 nights at gritti palace. The interior beauty of this hotel is remarkable. Rooms are more than beautiful and the location is perfect. Breakfast is very very limited for a five star hotel in this range and we were so disappointed. The hotel needs young and fresh staff in some parts specially the concierge which was not so helpful and was low energy. After all I recommend this hotel for a pleasant stay in venice...
