The Gritti Palace is superb all around. The location with a private dock allows tremendous water taxi access. We stayed as an SPG gold and had breakfast included in our rate. Lovely to sit outside enjoying breakfast with the sights/views directly on the canal. Room service was speedy and delicious too. Concierge team made several great recommendations for restaurants and sights. Upgraded rooms put us right on a side canal to be able to see/hear gondoliers each evening.
