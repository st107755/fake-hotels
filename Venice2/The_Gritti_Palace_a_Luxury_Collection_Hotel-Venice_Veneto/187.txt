We were just so thrilled to have chosen this beautiful place for our stay in Venice..right on a major canal...luxurious rooms, and spectacular bar and restaurant..not to mention, a great staff..    The location is perfect to visit other shops, restaurants and must see sights..   Be sure to sit in the bar and enjoy watching all the hustle and bustle of the Grand Canal!  Many thanks for making such a memorable evening...
