I have dined and drunk at The Gritti for many years, whether it be the winter or the summer when you can enjoy the divine terrace on the Grand Canal.  The service is divine and there is no other place to be in Venice. When I stayed every attention to detail was taken care of. When I was last here (July 2014) we had a lovely lunch on the terrace and it was extremely nice to be away from the hoi polloi in a luxurious environment. When I come back to Venice to stay this will be the place, no other.  As the caption clearly stats, Roger Moore is a fan for a reason!
