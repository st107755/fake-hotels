This hotel was positively fabulous.  I cannot praise it enough.  The rooms were spectacular and the views are even better.  The restaurant was delicious any time of day, with truly some of the best views in Venice. I stayed here with my family and my parents.  Everyone had a fantastic time and had nothing but great things to say about this place.
