We stayed two nights in this beautiful hotel.  Our room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was magnificent!  St. Markâ€™s Square was an easy walk.  We had communicated with the concierge prior to coming, asking about how to get to Murano, and learned that one of the galleries provides free transportation to guests of the hotel.  What a nice surprise!  We booked our stay with SPG points and while we did not have a view of the canal, the luxury of the room more than made up for it.
