This magnificent palace welcomed my entire family and treated each individual royally. As we entered our rooms we felt as if we had gone back in time. Carved flowers appointed the beds and wardrobes and most of our rooms overlooked the canal. We also were surprised with bowls of fruits and cheese plates. The terrace afforded us the most relaxing place for a drink or a most sumptuous continental breakfast but not like any that you get in the states. From juices to eggs to meats and so on, it felt more like an elaborate brunch. The Gritti Palace is a true representation of Venice. It is originally from the 16th century and a lot of the palace is still original despite the many restorations. You will not be disappointed.
