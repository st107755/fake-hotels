If you want to enjoy Venice like the Doge's, you should definitely stay at the Gritti Palace.  I chose it because it was recently renovated, and that it is located right on the Grand Canal.  The public and private spaces are beautiful.  The outdoor terrace where they have a bar and dinner/breakfast have unmatched views.  Its absolutely breathtaking. From the moment we arrived until we left, the staff was excellent all around.  I can't wait to visit and stay at the Gritti Palace again.  Its so nice when a location exceeds your already high expectations.  Nice work.
