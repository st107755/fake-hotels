We stayed in the G.P nine years ago and quite frankly it was great but needed a face lift. Now, nine years later the newly refurbished palace is stunning.  Situated on the grand canal is this beautiful hotel.  Breakfast is superb, service is excellent and the decor is simply out of this world. Upon arrival there is champagne in your room, aqua de Parma toilettries and robes/slippers to wear after a long journey or walk round the island.  This Hotel is immaculately clean and in a prime location for tourists. Situated ten minutes walk, if that, from st marks square.  We found the drinks in the hotel bar quite pricey but if you know this before you go you won't get a shock! The bar is a must as the decor is very Italian and the hot chocolate is delicious!  Go to Venice and stay inâ€¦
