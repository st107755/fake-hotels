Our first trip to Venice and the Gritti Palace was stunning. From the arrival by water taxi, breakfast overlooking the canal, an absolutely delightful restaurant, a beautiful room and extremely friendly staff, I would not stay anywhere else.  Perfectly located for all the major attractions, yet extremely quiet.  I thoroughly recommend this hotel as the very best that I have stayed in
