The Gritti Palace is five star in every way. From the minute our water taxi pulled up to the pontoon we were treated like film stars. It feels very refined and special. The staff are all excellent. We had a beautiful corner room overlooking the square at the back. We drank our bottle of welcome prosecco with some chili nuts. The furnishings are so plush and the bed was without a doubt the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in anywhere. The Aqua di Parma products smell fabulous too. Highly recommended. Oh and a benchmark facial in the spa too!
