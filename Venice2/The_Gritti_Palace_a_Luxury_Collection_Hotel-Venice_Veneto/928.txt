The hotel is strategically located near the local attractions and very close to the Giglo station where you can get the vaporettos to the airport or get around the city. The hotel is beautifully furnished with rich upholstery, art and lovely flower arrangements.  We saw many pictures of famous movie stars who stayed at the hotel too. Our buffet breakfast was on the terrace next to the Grand Canal and it was a fantastic spread of cold meats and cheeses, cereals, pastries, bread and fresh fruits. The hotel staff were very friendly even though we used points for our stay. They made us fell very welcomed. What a great stay.
