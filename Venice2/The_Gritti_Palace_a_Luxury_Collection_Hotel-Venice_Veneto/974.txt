We just loved it! We were looking for somewhere to eat, late afternoon and believe it or not we couldnt find anywhere in the area, but then we stumbled on the famous Gritti Palace....words fail me! The staff were just excellent...the Hotel amazing...and we had an excellent table for four on the terrace over looking the busy Grand Canal. it just doesnt get any better than this! Believe it or not we the men had Peroni beers and the ladies a lovely bottle of Rose wine...and together we all had the famous Griiti Palace beefburger with fries...yes in VENICE. We had, had enoough pizzas! What a fabulous way to relax and just enjoy life. Fantastic...cant wait to return!
