Great location and amazing view of the Grand Canal. Didn't stay at the hotel but would love to in the future as the standard rooms were fully booked and other rooms were expensive and above budget. Went to Riva for a sunset drink. Really neat place on the water-level right on the Grand Canal. Probably more expensive than other places in Venice. Chic people but not very friendly staff.
