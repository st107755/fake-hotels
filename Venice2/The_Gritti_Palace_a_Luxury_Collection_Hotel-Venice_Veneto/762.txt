We had a beautifully decorated large room with an incredible marble bath, overlooking the Venice canal.  Stayed 3 nights in Venice.  Can't say enough fantastic things about this hotel, loved every bit of it!  Breakfast was incredible, don't know why other critics were complaining about it. Service, cleanliness, location - all makes this a 5 star luxury hotel. What a way to start our 12 night journey, first time in Italy!
