We stayed at the Gritti for two nights and it was absolutely amazing! The hotel is beautifully restored to its historic conditions and the rooms are fantastic, with the most comfy beds ever. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is perfect, at just a few minutes walk from the main square. The restaurant has a beautiful terrace overlooking the water and the hotel bar serves amazing cocktails, so this is definitely worth a try, but inside the bar is amazing as well. Lunch and breakfast are rather expensive, so we mostly just went out for this, but still; I would highly recommend staying at the Gritti for a nice weekend in Venice!
