4 nights at the Gritti and loved every minute of our stay.  The lobby, bar, patios, and restaurant all stunningly beautiful and the views of the grand canal as you have coffee or tea on the patio is truly priceless experience.  We were upgraded to a lovely suite one of the nicest we stayed in all of Italy.  The bathroom and walk-in closet was simply over the top amazing.  I think we photographed the entire place just for wanting to share the memories with friends and family.  The front desk staff, concierge, bellman, waitstaff, bartender, everyone we had the pleasure speaking to was fantastic.  The negative - honestly really?  If someone finds negative with the Gritti they have issues...  If there was a negative it was 4 nights felt like 1!  We wish we would have been able toâ€¦
