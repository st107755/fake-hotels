I and my other half decided to go to Venice during 'low' season as we've been told that during high season it really is high. I didn't want to be overwhelmed by others so decided to go and stay at the Gritti Palace. Upon arrival via private water taxi, we were greeted by the 'doorman' such nice friendly people. We were escorted to reception where they were very thorough in explaining everything to us. The room was upgraded due to its limited occupancy which was a nice plus! The restaurant had great food and breakfast was superb!
