We cannot thank Pedro and the staff enough for our wonderful experience. We were generously upgraded us to the Punta della Dogana Patron Suite overlooking the beautiful Grand Canal, with a connecting room for our children and we immediately were in heaven! The breakfast was amazing, the outdoor bar was relaxing and the club sandwiches were to die for!! It’s a must when you visit Venice! This is our new ‘go to’ hotel for our future stays in Venice and would highly recommend it to everyone. You can only stay in Venice for 3 days at the most generally speaking, but when staying at the Gritti Palace Hotel, weeks and months is not enough!!
