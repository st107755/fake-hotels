Once in a while its worth sinking into the lap of luxury that hotels like the Gritti specialise in. Now a part of Starwood but no matter that We arrived in Angelina in the Tourist from the airport by motor boat and from the time we first set foot in the Gritti the service was impeccable as were the facilities To dine al fresco over the bustling Grand Canale is breathtaking To breakfast with the sun rising over the San Marco and Doges Palace is fantastic Save up and treat yourselves
