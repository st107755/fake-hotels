Myself and wife stayed here for three nights on our recent trip .. fantastic hotel. We are both SPG platinum and stayed on points; we also used suite rewards and were upgraded to a suite.  I definitely recommend coming in by water taxi. On approach, the hotel building exterior isn't alot to look at but once you arrive, it was fantastic.  I would say amazing service throughout the visit (check-in, the restaurant .. everything). The room was nice, though not really as big as I thought it may be. As well, no patio but it was still nice. Amazing bathroom with wall to wall marble ... We also had breakfast included which was very good .. nice spot out on the patio overlooking the water. We really enjoyed our stay, and enjoyed the hotel but it is quite expensive to stay here and foundâ€¦
