Having stayed at the Gritti twice before this was my third stay but the first with my two sons 15 and 9. I was wondering how the recent refurbishment would have changed the Gritti . Well from my family’s experience they have managed to retain all off its style and charm. We stayed in room 103 for 5 days and this was perfect in all ways  large, scrumptious decoration, great bed and stunning bathroom and free Wifi essential for the modern kids. My 9 year old son normally hates showering at home but he was captivated by the walk in shower, had difficulty getting him out! Now its when can we get one at home. My sons were fascinated by all the signed pictures of the famous who have stayed at the Gritti. The terrace pontoon is the perfect place at any time of the day to just sit back…
