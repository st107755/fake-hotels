Six of us stayed here for a weekend and we all loved it. The hotel is in a fabulous location with magnificent views. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend it and would love to go back. If I was being really picky I would have liked a bigger bedroom as found it a little small but other than that wonderful.
