I stayed at the Gritti Palace for one evening as a SPG gold member. The place is charmingly elegant yet decadently luxurious. The staff is patient and helpful. In addition to spending 30 minutes with us at check-in and offering us a selection of rooms, they chartered a direct private taxi to the prestigious Cenedese glass factory at no cost in order to ensure we had an authentic murano experience. They were also gracious enough to provide a generous exchange rate on our US dollars. A great experience all around
