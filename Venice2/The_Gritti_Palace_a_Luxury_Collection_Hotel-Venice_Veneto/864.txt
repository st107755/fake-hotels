We stayed here for several nights during our visit to Venice and adored the ultra luxury comforts offered by this hotel. The staff was above and beyond helpful, starting from the porters to the front desk and the management. Breakfast was lovely, and everyone very attentive, with a large variety to select from. Our anniversary was truly spectacular because of our stay here and we felt truly pampered.   Make sure to come here for after dinner drinks or gelato. Our last night, we happily discovered that they make the best Irish coffees and Frangelico with coffee, which we sampled as well as their gelato. Perfection!!!
