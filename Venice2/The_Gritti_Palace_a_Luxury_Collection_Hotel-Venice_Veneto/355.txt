From the moment of arrival to check out this hotel delivered impeccable service, attentive staff and beautiful elegant accommodation.  We had two adjoining rooms, fabulously decorated and every detail thought through.  The breakfasts were incredible.  We ate in at the restaurant one night and enjoyed a wonderful meal overlooking the grand canal with full silver service and superb food.   The location is excellent for accessing the main attractions and also the water bus, taxis and gondolas.  Thank you everyone at the Gritti Palace for making our family break perfect.
