Was greeted by an incredibly friendly front desk staff member who made sure my short stay had everything I needed. They arranged for a last minute tour, last minute laundry service, dinner reservations, everything! The room itself was fantastic and absolutely beautiful with a stunning balcony over looking the canal. Truly a fantastic property with an amazing staff!
