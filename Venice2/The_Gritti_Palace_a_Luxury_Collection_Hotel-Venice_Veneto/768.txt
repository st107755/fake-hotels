We had a truly wonderful stay at The Gritti Palace. From the moment we arrived right outside the entrance, in a private water taxi we were greeted with efficiency and whisked to our room with bags in tow. The decor was perfectly suited and the high ceilings a bonus, the bathroom was divine with luxurious salts and soaps.  We dined at Club Del Doge which was very enjoyable, I wouldn't say the food is out of this world as others report but it is worth a visit. The staff were most helpful and happy to accommodate our requests. We would most certainly return.
