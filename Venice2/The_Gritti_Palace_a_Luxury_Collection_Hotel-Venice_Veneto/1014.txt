My wife and I stayed for 4 nights to celebrate a special anniversary. The hotel is exquisite from its location to the quality of the rooms and decor. The staff are charming and knowledgeable. A particular highlight was the private cooking class with Chef Franco which produced some of the best food during our stay in Venice. Push the boat out(excuse the pun) and go for a room with balcony and Grand Canal view and savour the experience morning and night. Sublime!
