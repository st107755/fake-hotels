The Gritti Palace is truly outstanding; great location, friendly & professional staff, beautiful room, great food and wonderful view of grand canal.  We stayed at two hotels in Venice, the Gritti and Centurion Palace right in front of it (across the canal). What a different experience. The Gritti is a true five star hotel, simply the best. We will definitely come back to this hotel when we visit Venice. Dinner at the restaurant was one of the best meal, the Hemmingway Risotto was really delicious! Less than 10 minutes walk to St. Mark square. Acqua di Parma toiletries in the room was a nice surprise. We saw pictures of celebrities who stayed at the hotel, including Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. It was the best hotel we stayed in this trip and we stayed at many fine hotel,â€¦
