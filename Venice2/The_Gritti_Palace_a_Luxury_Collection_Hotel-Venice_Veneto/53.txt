We just returned home from our stay in Venice at the Gritti Palace and I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The location on the grand canal and the exceptional staff and amenities are beyond great. The place is absolutely beautiful and spotless clean. The atmosphere and luxury here is palpable. The rich history that the hotel has is incredible as well. The view from the terrace restaurant is simply perfect for a truly Venetian experience as the gondolas and water taxis travel the grand canal. The breakfast buffet is simply beyond belief and the staff is friendly and attentive to your every need. There is simply no other property that can match the Gritti Palace in Venice.
