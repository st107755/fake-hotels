Very nice old world luxury hotel. I am a concierge level SPG member and used multiple suite upgrades on our recent Italy trip. However, we were not prepared to find ourselves in the â‚¬9,500 per night Terrazza Redentore Suite for several nights! Probably unfair to base our review on this amazing experience, but we were smiling from start to finish. Every detail conveys opulence, down to the heated towel rack (take that, St. Regis!) and the mouthwash. Only word of caution to future guests would be to make reservations at the restaurant in advance to avoid having to go elsewhere.
