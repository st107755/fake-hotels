The Gritti Palace is one of the very nice, classic luxury hotels in Venice, located right on the Grand Canal and within easy walking distance to St. Marks Square, the Rialto area, the Peggy Guggenheim and Accademia museums, a vaporetto stop and a traghetto stop. Beautiful rooms, very good restaurant (reviewed separately) and bar as you would expect from a very upscale hotel. Not one negative thing to say about it...except for one very useful tip. If you value your early morning sleep DO NOT accept a room overlooking the small side canal. First of all, it's so narrow that you can't even see it unless you open a window, lean way out and look straight down. They upgraded us to a suite on that side (very nice) but (and this is the "second of all") a seemingly endless parade of boatsâ€¦
