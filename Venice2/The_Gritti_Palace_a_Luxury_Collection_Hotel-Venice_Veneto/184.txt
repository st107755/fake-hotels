This is a beautiful property in the heart of Venice. Was upgraded to a room with a view of the canal which was awesome! The breakfast for the elite members had a wonderful spread with excellent options. By all regards its a top hotel. The only issue I had was with one particular member of the concierge staff who was very rude and started to argue with me. It was definitely off-putting. Had to deduct one star for this because a hotel of this nature should be better than this. The issue was brought up with and handled by the hotel manager who was very understanding.
