While the hotel is beautiful I am not sure I would stay here again. It was extremely expensive and not worth the cost. It was my birthday and our anniversary so we really wanted something special. Being Platinum Am Ex and Starwood Gold got us nothing. We normally get an Am Ex platinum upgrade but certainly not here. The Grand Canal view in the bar/breakfast areas are spectacular. I had a ham and cheese sandwich in the bar for 22Euros that was horrible. Concierge service was fabulous.
