The Gritti Palace is incredible, and it's impossible to compare, because there's nothing else quite like it. No expense was spared in the renovation. Everything is museum quality, and you really do feel like you are staying in a private palazzo, yet with none of the inconveniences of a historic property.   We had built up a giant pile of SPG points, and were able to cash in on a Giglio Prestige room for 5 nights - thanks SPG! We received a handicap accessible room on the first floor, in front the elevator. I would speculate that our room may have been the least favorable of its type, but it was still glorious. The ceilings are so high that they make the floorplan seem smaller than it really is. And our bathroom was almost the size of the bedroom. There aren't enough superlativesâ€¦
