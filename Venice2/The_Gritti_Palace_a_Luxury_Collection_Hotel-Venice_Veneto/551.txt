Venice has many Palaces and an even larger number of hotels that pretend to be Palaces.  We have tried many of them and the Gritti always holds a particular place in our heart as it excels in all dimensions.  Superb location on the Grand Canal, very close to the Academia bridge, La Fenice and San Marco, fabulous views from its windows and balconies, superb restoration with rooms rather large and huge bathrooms with all necessary amenities, excellent beds, top service both from the hotel and from the restaurant and the caf√© personnel, lovely terraces on the water and this je-ne-sais-quoi that top hotels have and others don't.  A must!
