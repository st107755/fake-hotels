On our recent trip to Italy the Gritti Palace was hands down the most expensive hotel we chose to stay at, but the experience was worth every penny.  Its location is unbeatable, and sitting on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is simply amazing.  Whether it's watching sunrise through the fog as you eat breakfast, or enjoying a Campari spritz in the early evening and watching the boats go by as the sun begins to set, being there somehow crystallizes the experience of being in Venice. As noted by another reviewer the bar and restaurant prices are high, but the atmosphere and views made it well worth the money to us. The rooms are beautiful, and service was superb.  When we return to Venice we will definitely stay there again!
