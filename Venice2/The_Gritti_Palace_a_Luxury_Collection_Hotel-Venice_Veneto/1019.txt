The hotel is a number of old mansions-- there is a beautiful patio overlooking the water-- breakfast is served outdoors when possible-- beautiful spot for dinner and drinks as well-- rooms are not huge but well appointed and spotless-- restaurant was very good but for the price expected a little more
