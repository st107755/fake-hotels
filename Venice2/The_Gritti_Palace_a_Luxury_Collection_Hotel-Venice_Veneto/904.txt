I have stayed here six or seven times over the last 15 years but only twice since the major renovation a few years ago.  The older version was a bit too heavy on decoration and felt very old. With the renovation it feels a bit more cozy and the modern updates such as b and o stereo in the suites and flat screen tv's and beautiful bathrooms make a huge difference. The front desk staff are great particularly Giovanni and Federica who looked after everything we needed to make our stay a most enjoyable one. We loved our time there. Don't miss out on a pre dinner drink outside overlooking the canal.
