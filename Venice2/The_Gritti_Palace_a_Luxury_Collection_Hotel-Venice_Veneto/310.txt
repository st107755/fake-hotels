Simply the best way to experience Venice. The location is fabulous, the staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are large, comfortable and beautifully appointed. One canâ€™t go wrong with this one.  The breakfast spread is sumptuous and good. The views from the room are also lovely. There are some nice restaurants around if one wants to dine out. All on all we had a great stay.
