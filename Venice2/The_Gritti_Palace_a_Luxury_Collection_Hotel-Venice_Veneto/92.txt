The best in Venice from location to service to in room comfort and amenities. Fresh flowers, top shelf Acqua Di Parma toiletries, bow wrapped robe & slippers with spa treatment reminder. Central location close to sights and shopping so the last thing you want to do is spend time in the room but this was THE most comfortable bed I have slept in. Breakfast and dinner on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. Dinner a bit pricey but setting is amazing under the Venetian lights.
