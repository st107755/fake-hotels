This was a very special treat and our expectation was surpassed, watch Richard E Grant on the making of the Gritti - it gives you a flavour, but only a flavour! I simply fell in Love with the Gritti and its values - my wife was given roses in our room on her birthday. Great location, awesome rooms, sheer luxury and worth every penny - arrive and leave by water taxi, even more James Bond!
