this is my second time in Venice , the first time was few years ago in Danieli and this time was the Gritti palace. its a beautiful hotel with beautiful location and amazing restaurant which i highly recommend . concierge is very professional my only point that 2 persons as receptionist is kinda short to service all the guest taking into consideration each receptionist would escort the check in person to his room so you could except atleast 20 minutes for check in or check out. other than that the hotel is really nice and id definistly recommend it.
