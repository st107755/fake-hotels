We had a fantastic three days at the hotel, it being Easter Venice was packed but there was nothing nicer than coming back to the oasis of the Gritti Palace. From the moment we arrived by water taxi arranged through the hotel we were made to feel like VIPs. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was sumptuous with an amazing bathroom with full sized bath and Aqua De Palma toiletries, a bottle of Merlot was waiting for us and complimentary water left each day. We ate in Club le Doge twice and had very good meals , breakfast was taken on the terrace in the sun wathching the world go by on the grand canal. We made a lot of use of the bar terrace again overlooking the canal , enjoying a bottle of wine watching the madding crowd go by. My only negative is that they let non guests useâ€¦
