We really researched hotels in Venice thoroughly. They all seemed overpriced and outdated or aged. We stayed at the Gritti on points and were extremely happy. The room was beautiful. The hotel is in a great location close to shopping and SanMarco square. It has a nice lounge right on the canal to take in all the sites of Venice. We loved it!
