What a wonderful hotel!  Opulence, but no bling.  Classy but not snooty.  I would never spend this amount on a hotel, and visited this using (my girlfriendâ€™s) SPG points.  The experience was fantastic from check-in to check-out.  Check-in was easy and friendly, housekeeping staff were very friendly, the concierges were excellent.  And the place itself is amazing.  Beautiful rooms, ours with a view over the Grand Canal, lovely furnishings, great bathrooms with excellent toiletries.  Everything perfect!
