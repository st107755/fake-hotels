We stayed in a canal view room (number 312 -lovely) for two nights at the end of a trip for our 25th anniversary. The whole experience was faultless from start to finish with charming staff, a beautiful room and stunning views. We also had dinner in the Clud de Doges which involved the best risotto either of us had ever had. The view from the terrace on a sunny day, Bellini in hand, is one of those things you will never forget. Heavenly!
