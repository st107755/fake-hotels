Ok, biases on the table. I am a platinum SPG member and a big Starwood fan. And this place still impresses. Only other luxury collection hotel I'd put in this category is the Chatwal in NYC.  From check in to check out  everything was perfect. Very elegant decorations, though not my personal taste. Imagine if your grandmother won the lottery and had a great designer. Comfortable and sumptuous.  The location is perfect and the suites, we stayed in the Costello suite, are perfect.  Can't wait to come back!
