Amazingly located, historical hotel. Right on the water, with a terrace so nice you could risk missing out on everything else Venice has to offer. Also makes it very convenient for arriving/leaving as the boat can drop/pick you right at the hotel.  Great room, friendly and helpful staff, easy check-in/out procedure, all round wonderful hotel
