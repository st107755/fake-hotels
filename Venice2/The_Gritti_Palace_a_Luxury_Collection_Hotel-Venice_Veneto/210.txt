We have stayed at virtually every grand hotel in Italy and The Gritti continues to set the impeccable standards for luxury, excellence, and grand Italian style. We experience an almost indescribable atmosphere of historical elegance from the moment we walk into the stunning lobby, that most other hotels can only envy.   It is as close to “living art” as any hotel can be. Magnificently appointed rooms and suites, a superb restaurant on the Grand Canal (with a world class wine list featuring many northern Italian gems), perhaps our favorite bar on the planet, and a location close to St. Marks and world class shopping but far enough to avoid the clutter. Pamper yourself and create a memory for a lifetime. That is the Gritti.
