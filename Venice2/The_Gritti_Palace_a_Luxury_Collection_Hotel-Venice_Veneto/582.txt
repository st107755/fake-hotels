Fantastic 5 star luxury hotel right in the middle of Venice. From the hotel lobby to the individual hotel rooms, the decor is beautifully antique and well maintained. While some hotels then often feel dusted and old-fashioned, the Gritti manages to mend the old decor with modernity thanks to the youthful and friendly staff.   The exclusive trip to Murano island and the private glassblowing demonstration (both complimentary if you stay at the Gritti) are to be highly recommended.   Overall a fantastic stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who can afford it :-).
