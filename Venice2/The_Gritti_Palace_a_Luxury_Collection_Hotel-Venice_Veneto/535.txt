We went just before Christmas and got very lucky with the weather so we extended by one night!  Arrival: - Whilst the line 1 boat (from train station) doesn't drop you off directly at the hotel doorstep it is a mere 60 seconds away and very convenient (private water taxi will take you to the doorstep)  Rooms: - The newly refurbished rooms are classical (old school), extremely comfortable and spacious. Plenty of space for your luggage. King bed was hard to get out of in the mornings! The bathrooms are very nice as well. We got upgraded to the Giglio Prestige Room and on extension moved to the Venetian room which is smaller but still very nice. There was enough light entering the room but most of the day was spent outdoors anyway.  Service: - simply fantastic. Right from check-inâ€¦
