We have just returned from a 4 night stay here. This hotel was everything we had hoped it would be and more. Upon arrival we were given a room upgrade as it was my husbands 30th. Then on his birthday a lovely bottle of prosecco was left in our room from the hotel. The room was beautiful and spacious and the hotel staff were always happy to help.  If you are pondering whether to spend out and stay here when in Venice I would highly recommend it. We have nothing but happy memories of our stay.
