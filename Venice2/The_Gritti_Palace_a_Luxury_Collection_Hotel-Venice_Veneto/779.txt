Stayed at the Gritti Palace and it was really great. The room had a great view of the canal and was beautiful decorated with Murano glass details. Everyone there spoke English which was helpful for me because my Italian is not great. The staff were so helpful and accommodating to anything we needed. Breakfast on the terrace was incredibly beautiful (weather permitting). It is also a great location. Close to a water bus stop or a quick gondola ride to the other side.
