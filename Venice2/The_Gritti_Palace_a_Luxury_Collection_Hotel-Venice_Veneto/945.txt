We stayed for only one night and, if being honest, I would not choose the Gritti for anything longer than a couple of nights. The location is perfect but it is very expensive and better 5 star value can be obtained elsewhere in the centre of Venice. It was, however, wonderful to stay there and to have drinks on the terrace overlooking the grand canal. A once in a lifetime experience.
