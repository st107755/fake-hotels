We had a room with all wooden walls and paintings but no view on the canal. The room was quite small but beautiful and you dive into the atmosphere of different times.  It is a perfect location for the trip to Venice and even if the service and the hotel is not what it used to be it remains one of the most beautiful places in Venice.  It is very easy to get around from there, walking of by taking the boat of course.  For Breakfast I am a bit particular and like to just walk out early and find some authentic places for a real italian coffee or espresso.  April is a good moment to visit Venice, it's pleasently warm, sometimes a bit rainy but just what makes the city appear more dreamy and beautiful and April is the perfect spring time before the mass tourism starts.
