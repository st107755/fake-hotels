Perfect location near water transportation and walk to shopping and restaurants. Our room and bath were very clean and comfortable. Their restaurant's outdoor area is right on the Grand Canal. A lunch was very good. They will arrange for airport and ship transfers as will as private water taxi service to just about everywhere except Hoboken.
