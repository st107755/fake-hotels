It really is hard to beat the Gritti Palace.  From the moment you arrive by water taxi, it just doesn't quit.  The staff and waiters are so helpful.  Drinks at the bar at sunset overlooking the canal was amazing.  Leaning out your window to hear the gondolier sing on the canal below your window, and then exchanging bravos and grazies with the people on the boat - it was an experience.  It's reputation is well-earned.
