It's really stunning as an interior and location - one can hardly dream of a better place in Venice. Quiet, comfortable and clean. The front desk guys were slow and ineffective, the two (out of three) concierges were not enough helpful and expedient, breakfast was overpriced and disputable. The only restaurant - besides the most desired view - offered nothing to be remembered. But the bar and its terrace were really worthy!
