Lunch on the terrace of The Gritti looking out over the Grand Canal towards the Salute on a sparkling sunny Venice day is one of life's great pleasures and especially so if the lunch hour can be extended to two or more hours. The service is immaculate and the food and wine outstanding. The activity on the Grand Canal provides the backdrop to a wonderful experience. Begin with a Bellini and conclude with a luscious pudding wine.
