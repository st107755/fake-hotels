This is one of my favorite hotels in the world. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is friendly, and there are excellent amenities.!What I love about the hotel most, is it is consistent. Many times you go to a hotel and itâ€™s excellent one time and not so great the next. I was very pleased that both of my stays were equally phenomenal. I have stayed here with my four-year-old and without. They were very friendly to my four-year-old, but it is a very nice hotel and I would recommend it for a fairly well behaved child. If you get a chance to stay here, take it.
