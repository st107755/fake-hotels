Gritti Palace is a beautiful hotel in a great location on the grand canal.  Service is impeccable. Hotel is a beautiful old building that has been restored and updated with all the modern comforts but maintains its historical perspective.   The restaurant outside on the grand canal has beautiful views and good food and service.  Hotel is less than a ten minute walk to St Marks square.  We are SPG gold members and were automatically upgraded.  Love the SPG hotels, always clean, good service and a great experience.
