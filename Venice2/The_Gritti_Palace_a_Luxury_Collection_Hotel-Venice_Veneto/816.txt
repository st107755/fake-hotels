Stayed at the Gritti Palace alone for a weekend, in a perfect suite overlooking the Grand Canal, great great (yes twice) furnishings, bedding, adornments, wall material of silk from Italian artisanal company, other guests discrete and staff that are that really great combination of anticipating your need and welcoming but not familiar. The public spaces are absolutely fabulous and are all recently renovated, as are the rooms. Really stylish, swish, but that true boutique, small hotel that you happen upon once every so often.     Position on the Grand Canal almost opposite Peggy Guggenheim Museum/gallery, with cross-canal gondola at the door and a vaporetto (ferry/bus) 20 metres from door, a three minute walk to San Marco, it is luxury heaven.  All in a quiet, discrete locale. â€¦
