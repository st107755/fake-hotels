I stayed at The Gritti Palace in Sestriere Suite for a short break and I had one of the best experiences in terms of room amenities (Acqua di Parma)and sparkling wine on arrival.Great breakfast service from the restaurant manager Enrico during my stay at the Club del Doge terrace,who was attentive to my request.The spa experience was wonderful and i didnâ€™t want to leave this hotel.
