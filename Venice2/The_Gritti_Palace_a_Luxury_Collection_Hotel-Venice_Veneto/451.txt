The Gritti Palace earns its position as a "palazzo."  Every aspect of the hotel is luxurious: the rooms, common areas, food and location.  Guests are attended by an extraordinarily gracious staff.  As a Starwood member, we paid with points and yet we were afforded an upgrade to a sumptuous suite.  Points aside, The Gritti Palace earns its position as one of the best hotels in Venice.
