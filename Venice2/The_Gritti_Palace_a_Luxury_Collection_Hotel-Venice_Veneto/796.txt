We rather decadently arrived on the Orient Express into Venice and then by private water taxi to the Gritti - definitely the way to arrive!! The rooms, service and location make it worth the expense. One of the highlights was having breakfast outside (in the fantastic sunshine at Easter) beside the Grand Canal. Also enjoyed having a nightcap outside(fortunately they have outdoor heaters!!!) and watching the world go by.
