Pros Elite Recognition: Elite status recognized and due benefits delivered. Love it when hotels deliver on due elite benefits.  Location: The location is superb. You are right on the canal and minutes away from San Marco Square. Great eating joints nearby, coffee places etc.  Hospitality: Excellent hospitality all around. Everybody was great.  Breakfast: The breakfast is very good. Good number of options for vegetarians.  Riva Lounge: Loved sitting on the deck of the Riva Lounge for drinks. The view from the deck of the lounge is breathtaking.  Areas of Opportunity For the Riva Lounge, would be great if they offer preferred table reservations for house guests. This would resulted us in visiting the lounge much more often.
