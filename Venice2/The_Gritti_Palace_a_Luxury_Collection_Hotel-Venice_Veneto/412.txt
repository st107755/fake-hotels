Simply the best hotel with the best staff, best views, best service and the best rooms in the whole of Venice. Arrived by water taxi and immediately greeted by some of the most professional staff I have encountered for quite a number of years. The hotel transported us back 29 years to our early courting days. (Mind you leaving our now teenage sons at home for this trip helped), as it is has a seriously romantic vibe and the location and hotel itself cannot be recommend enough.
