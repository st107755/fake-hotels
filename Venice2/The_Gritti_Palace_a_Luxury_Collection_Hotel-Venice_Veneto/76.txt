Amazing hotel and bar. Felt privileged that many a list celebrity’s have walked the same lobby lol  Man standing with a bird of prey which I thought was strange thinking why would people come to an amazing hotel to pay to have a picture with a bird... then realised he was just there to use the bird to scare away the pigeons #amazing  All the staff very friendly and try their best to meet your needs. €24 a cocktail.. but they are world class!!!
