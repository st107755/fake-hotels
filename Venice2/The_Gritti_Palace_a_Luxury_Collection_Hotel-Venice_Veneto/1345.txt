Outstanding service....wonderfully accommodating, regarding a room upgrade, during a busy time for them...They seemed genuinely happy to do this for us...Their concierge service is wonderful...Their veranda on the Grand Canal is simply divine..It is spacious and seems perfectly situated on the canal...The rooms are elegant and the air conditioning was perfect.....I have stayed at other hotels in Venice, but this hotel seems the way to go..It just has it all.Thanks!
