We stayed here on the first night of an extended honeymoon.  We decided to change our flights to leave a day earlier and I was rushing around trying to make a reservation at a hotel so we had somewhere to stay on our first night.  In my haste I had made it for the day we left the states instead of the day we arrived.  Many hotels would say "oh well" you are out your points and money for the night.  Not so at the gritti palace, it felt like a true start to our honeymoon, they even let us pick which room we wanted to stay in and walked us up to both.  Breakfast was wonderful and the hotel is centrally located.  The only strange thing about this hotel is leaving your actual room key at the front desk and picking it up when you come back.  Would definitely stay here again.
