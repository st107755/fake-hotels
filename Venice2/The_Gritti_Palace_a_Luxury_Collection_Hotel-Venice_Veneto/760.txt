Spent three nights in this lovely Hotel  Bedroom very ornate lots of mirrors and paintings Decor throughout well thought out Very good room service very clean Whole Hotel very ornate.  Restaurant and bar staff smiley and very helpful  Concierge very helpful when planning day's events  As a base it is very well situated in the middle of Venice Breakfast outside on a floating pier so almost in the water. Glass front to stop any wind and heaters on standby in case of cold weather We visited lots of restaurants which were all in easy walking distance of this hotel If you want to go to Venice then this is defiantly a hotel to consider
