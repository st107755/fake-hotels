Wonderful hotel, the location is excellent and so is the staff.    The concierges is very helpful too.  We arranged a pickup at the train station and that was worth it.  A porter was waiting for us at our train car and we were very pleased with this service.   The boat taxi was a nice way to arrive at your hotel and I think this is the only way.  The only disappointment is that there is no coffee anywhere to be found at the hotel unless you want to pay 10 euro per cup!  That seams a bit crazy when you consider almost every other hotel in Europe has coffee in the room or at least in the lobby.
