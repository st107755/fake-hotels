I got blown away by the service and stay at this hotel. All the travel and status came to good use as we got a nice upgrade to a great suite. A suite at this hotel is palatial and you will get a majestic feeling by the end of the day. I would highly recommend room number 210. It has a great view. Thank you Gabrielle for taking care of us when we arrived late night.  We got up to a nice sunny day and the breakfast right on the water was memorable. We only got out of the hotel for a Venice view by 1 p.m in the afternoon. This is one SPG hotel that you would want to keep coming back to again and again. A BIG thank you from everyone in family.
