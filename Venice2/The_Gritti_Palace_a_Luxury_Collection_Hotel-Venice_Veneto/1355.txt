“Just opened after a 15-month amazing restoration, the Gritti Palace is more grand than ever (it was in need a of re-do). All the rooms have been revamped as well as the hotel’s art and antique collection. A little yet lovely Acqua di Parma spa has also been added too. This place is so Venetian-glamorous, it feels like living in a 15th century palazzo – only with all the modern luxuries we’ve come to expect from the best. From the moment we checked-in the entire staff seemed to know our name – no matter who we passed they would greet us with a smile and ‘Good afternoon, Mr. & Mrs Wood’ The location is ideal, on the most stunning stretch of the Grand Canal, a five minute walk from St. Marks but far enough from the bustle that you never feel part of that touristy crowd.”
