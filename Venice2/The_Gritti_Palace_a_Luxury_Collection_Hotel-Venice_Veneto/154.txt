The location on the Grand Canal is perfect. The concierges were all very helpful and friendly.  Pedro who checked us in was so friendly welcoming and fantastic! The rooms are great they are large in size but very old world style so it is a matter of taste ( see photos on hotel website) Bathrooms are large, clean and modern. Agree with one of the other recent commentators that the lobby was a bit too chaotic with a ton of people and seemingly business people coming and going all the time. A few weird things.. they did not give out water bottles at the front desk or concierge so asking for water ( to take with us for the day) sometimes became a project which I found odd. At one point we had to order the water to room service?! Also they did not leave a bottle of water at night atâ€¦
