I visited the Gritti Palace to enquire about the perfume collection launched by the Gritti family having been told on the phone they stocked it. I have rarely been greeted by such impolite concierge staff, they seemed irritated and annoyed and threatened a police enquiry. The reception staff were marginally more polite but clearly disinterested. As one of the supposed great hotels of the world they need to work on customer service.
