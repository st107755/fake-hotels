This was my first time staying here and I can not say enough about how luxurious the property is and how amazing the staff was.  The location itself is perfectly situated for most of the locations on must see lists.  I dined at the restaurant twice and both times found the food and service to be fantastic.  I would highly recommend staying here should you have the opportunity.
