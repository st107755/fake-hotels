My Wife and I spent a weekend at the Gritti Palace and it did not disappoint.  The room was beautiful with decadent furnishings.   The staff were brilliant and very helpful.  As you would expect the local surroundings were always going to please, the glass blowing and architecture were unbelievable.  Will definitely return.
