Third time we've stayed here, not found a better hotel. Superb large old venetian style rooms with murano chandeliers, acqua di parma toiletries, excellent quiet air conditioning, excellent location, just off st. Marks . They take the effort to remember you from previous visits, complimentary wine and chocolates, change the sheets every night, meet you at their own pier outside and take your bags from the water taxi, call the taxi to check without you asking, they can't do enough for you, simply the best service. You cannot find a better place to have breakfast, super food; bucks fizz if you fancy it and sitting outside next to the grand canal watching the gondolas go past, fabulous. The only issues were the lack of view from the room and the rather expensive drinks at the barâ€¦
