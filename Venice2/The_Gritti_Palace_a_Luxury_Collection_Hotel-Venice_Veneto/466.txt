The Gritti palace is the true definition of luxury.  The lobby is stunning and has many seating areas.  The rooms are larger than most Euro hotels.  The sheets felt like butter and the pillows are the finest down.  We ate breakfast every morning on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  BREATHTAKING!  This property is pricey, but worth every penny.  It was our 30th anniversary and worth the splurge.
