We stayed three days and had a superb stay. We ate in the restaurant on the second night sat on the veranda, looking out on to the Grand Canal and believe me it doesn't get much better than that. Hotel staff polite, attentive and the hotel needs to be seen to be believed! A Vanitian Palace second to none in a position that cannot be beaten!!  This is something I would recommend to all considering this standard of hotel. Wow!!
