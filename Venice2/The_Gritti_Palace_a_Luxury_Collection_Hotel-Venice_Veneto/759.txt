A very elegant hotel where things are done properly and with understated luxury. There is no pomp or ceremony, but you are in no doubt that the fabulous staff are all there to make sure that your stay is as comfortable as possible.  Breakfast on the terrace by the Grand Canal is an unforgettable experience, and the main Restaurant staff and food are beyond anything we have experienced before. Our room was comfortable and very well equipped. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
