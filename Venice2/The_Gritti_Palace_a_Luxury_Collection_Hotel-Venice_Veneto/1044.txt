Having visited Venice last year and finding it absolutely charming, we arranged a follow-up trip this year with friends who were visiting for the first time. I had read excellent reviews about The Gritti Palace and, when it appeared as one of the available hotels in a BA weekend break offer, we didn't hesitate to choose it. And I'm so glad we did as it was wonderful.   It's worth arranging a water taxi from Marco Polo as, not only do you get to fully appreciate the approach into Venice, but also because it takes you (via some of Venice's unseen backwaters) directly to the hotel's private mooring, where you are met by the doorman. The warm welcome at check-in set a standard for the service, which, I have to say, was exceptional throughout our stay and this alone would be goodâ€¦
