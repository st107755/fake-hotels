We flew to Venice as one of my dearest friends 50 before 50 adventures and of course The Gritti Palace just had to be done. Style, class, refinement and location, location, location. Situated just along from San Marco with a prime spot on the grand canal it makes a perfect place for dinning on the terrace, watching all the boats on the canal. We were looked after by two of the loveliest friendly waiters one could hope to meet Giovanni and Valentino who joined in the spirit of the occasion, bringing cake and candles, we all know you can be the snazziest hotel in the world but if you don't have great staff then nights like this are easily forgotten. Brilliant all round go I hope you enjoy it as much as we did Xx
