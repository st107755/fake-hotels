I have stayed in many hotels, and many of the nicest ones, and often my preferred style, is the more modern, open, Asian hotels.  This is the complete opposite, but is an extraordinary experience.  It really IS a palace. The rooms are completely different from anything I have stayed in before.  The service is absolutely impeccable, yet also friendly, rather than stuffy or snooty - I would give it 6 stars if I could! My husband and I went on a BA Holiday and whilst I am really no fan of British Airways, I do think that their holidays offer the chance to stay in some amazing top, top hotels, for quite a reasonable deal - I can't IMAGINE what the rates would be, were I trying to do this myself.  I am sure we were in one of the "cheapest" rooms in the Gritti, but we still wereâ€¦
