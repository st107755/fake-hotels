The location of this property on the Grand Canal cannot be topped. The service is exceptional in every way. All the staff were friendly, courteous and do everything they can to be of assistance to fulfil any needs you may have. They make you feel as if you are a VIP and the only guest they have. A truly luxurious hotel with beautifully decorated rooms and enormous bathroom with every amenity. Extremely comfortable bed and lovely sitting room. Having drinks at night on the canal is a dream come true. Loved this hotel!
