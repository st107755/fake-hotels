I can't imagine a better hotel experience in Venice. The Gritti's location is central but quite, the staff is exceptionally well trained, the rooms and common areas have been beautifully renovated and, not to be ignored, the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever experienced. We have visited Venice several times but this was our first stay at the Gritti. We will certainly be staying here every time we visit in the future.
