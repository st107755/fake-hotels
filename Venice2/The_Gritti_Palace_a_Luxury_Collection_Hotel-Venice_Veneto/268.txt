Booked the pick up from train station to hotel cost euro180.. I don't know if its worth it!. Upon checked in I was told we got upgraded and asked us choice of our newspaper we did asked for English newspaper.  Checked in the room, don't know whats the difference of the room I booked versus the room they gave us. seems no difference.  Stayed 2 days didn't recited any newspaper at all. Mentioned upon checked out, but seems no  reply. They provided water taxi to some places free of charge ... like Murano and burn and so on...  Bought stuff in Murano , a lot of stuff and cost a lot of money, in fairness its really beautiful.. they will ship all the orders we purchased and lets see if its smooth...  OverAll, expensive and if I will come back I will book Cipriani or Aman,...
