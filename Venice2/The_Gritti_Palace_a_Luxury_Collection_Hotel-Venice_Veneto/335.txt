This is one of the grande dames of Venice, so no surprise that it is an elegant, beautiful, sophisticated hotel.  In addition, the service is refined and discrete and the location is perfect (away from the crowds near San Marco and the Doge's Palace -- i.e. where the Danieli is!).  Was there in February so no chance to enjoy lunch outside on the terrace, but still enjoyed breakfast in their intimate main restaurant and drinks in the small elegant bar.   This will be the only hotel I will ever stay at in Venice when I return.  Magical in every way !
