One of the best locations in Venice - wonderful having the private terrace to enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner - or just drinks. A great benefit to be able to escape from the crowds and have nothing between you and the Grand Canal. A lovely (if expensive ) breakfast - dinner  a little more mixed - wonderful service but the food seemed varaible. One gripe - please turn off or vary the piped music - it stayed the same selection for 4 days at every meal. You escape this on the terrace of course. Bedrooms and bathrooms excpetionally well-appointed and comfortable - as you would expect. Try to secure one that at least is overlooking the side canal - much nicer than facing onto the piazza side of the hotel. Bag a Grand Canal view room or suite if you can afford it! Well worth takingâ€¦
