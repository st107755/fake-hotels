The service and facilities at the Gritti Palace are first class all the way!  Our room was a suite overlooking a canal with the most comfortable bed, Murano glass lighting and bar wear, and a full set of Acqua Di Palma toiletries. The concierge recommended and arranged reservations for us at exemplary restaurants such as CoVino and the hotel's own renown Club Del Doge, as well as events including Musica a Palazzo operas and tours at Murano glass factories. The bartenders at Bar Longhi serve up the best cocktails the city, especially those of their own creation, and kudos to Mirko for recommending the outstanding meat restaurant Trattoria Da Arturo to us!  The staff never missed a beat and satisfied our every need!
