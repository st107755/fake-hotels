One of the better hotels we have stayed in-it was a combination of beauty and the welcoming nature of the hotel. Warm colors and staff! From the beginning, Sylvia made our arrival perfect. Antonella made our following morning a delight, along with her team. The view, the ambience - one of the best sleeping I have ever done in one of the most beautiful locations in the world. That was the only issue-the room was so comfortable - we didnâ€™t want to leave! We shall definitely return!
