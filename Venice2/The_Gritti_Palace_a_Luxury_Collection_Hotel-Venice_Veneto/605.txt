Beyond beautiful hotel.  Breakfast along the grand canal can't be beat.  All the staff was very nice and friendly.  A few were a bit stuffy but always pleasant.  The receptionist staff always had big welcoming smiles.  The bell desk/concierge were helpful and especially Michele (not sure of spelling) but he was pleasant and very helpful with any questions we had.  We were upgraded to a large room and it had to be one of the best rooms I have been to in Europe.  The bed was so comfortable - it practically enveloped us, we just may purchase the pillowtop & sheets.  The hotel is only a 7 min walk to St. Marks and Venice is small enough so that every point is easily accessible.
