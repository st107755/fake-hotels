We've stayed in great hotels all over the world- and this 1 was right up there with the best! Old, and authentic- very ornate decor, grand chandeliers, old master pictures, but it all looks right in that setting. Staff friendly and informative. Restaurant and bar served excellent food- at a price! But Venice is like that. We were upgraded to a canal view- lovely. Location was great too. 5 minutes walk to San Marco; close to shops, restaurants, piazzas, gondolas; everything. The downside? Can't think of 1, and when we return to Venice I would definitely stay here again.
