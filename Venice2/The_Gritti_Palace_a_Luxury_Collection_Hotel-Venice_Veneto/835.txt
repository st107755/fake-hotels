From the initial welcome right through to checkout everything at the Gritti was faultless. We were offered an upgrade to a suite but decided to stick with our canal view room as that was our main reason for choosing the hotel and the view is indeed superb. The location is central but fairly quiet and within two minutes from the vaporetto, although a private water taxi to the hotel's private dock is not to be missed. Can't wait to stay again!
