From the moment we arrived in a water taxi we were treated like royalty. The Gritti Palace is like walking into someone's beautiful old home.  The staff were excellent from the front desk to housekeeping with an extra thanks to the concierge desk. Everyone spoke excellent english and were great to deal with.  Our room was a corner king with a huge marble bathroom overlooking the street below. Not a canal view but that is what walking around the city is for.  The hotels location is great, just a short walk from St Marks, nice shopping and dining.  The prices are expensive, but as we soon found out, just about everything in Venice is.  The quality of this property would be hard to beat anywhere, We would return !
