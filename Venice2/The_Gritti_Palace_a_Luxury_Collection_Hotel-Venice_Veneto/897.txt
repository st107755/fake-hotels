Excellent location, beautiful hotel dripping with gorgeous history. Definitely the best hotel in Venice. The bar is absolutely fantastic; have an incredible drink as you gaze at the water and landscape. The waiters are superb. Concierge was subpar, and rooms are on the smaller side. Also, they said they upgraded us but didn't pay any attention to our specific room ask (room with a Grand Canal view).
