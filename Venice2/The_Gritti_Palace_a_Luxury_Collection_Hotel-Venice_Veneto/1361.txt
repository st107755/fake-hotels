We moved here after one night at the Luna Hotel on a bed which was the equivalent of sleeping on a concrete sidewalk.  What a pleasant change.  The entire hotel is fresh and clean, having been just remodeled and reopened this past February.  The beds and pillows are supremely soft and the service impeccable  Stop looking and book it- you won't be sorry.
