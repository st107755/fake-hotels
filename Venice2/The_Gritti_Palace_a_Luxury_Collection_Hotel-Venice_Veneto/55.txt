We strayed at this hotel for four days.  It is the most mesmerizing place in terms of luxury and romance I ever styed in.  The location was superb, the service is to[ notch, the restaurant and terrace is breath taking. I  recommend taking the water taxi and sit at the back of the boat for a better view of the island it fells as if you are going on a cruise. I also recommend to go on an  adventure by getting lost between the city ally, eventually you will find your way and have the most of the city view doing so.
