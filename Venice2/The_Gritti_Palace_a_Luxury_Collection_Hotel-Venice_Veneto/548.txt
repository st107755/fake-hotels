Although we stayed elsewhere on the island, the Longhi Bar and the Riva patio lounge are musts for any visitor to Venice. Excellent service, signature cocktails, comfortable old world charm and ambience coupled with unbelievable waterfront views of gondola / water taxi " traffic" and historic treasures making for a great place to relax and unwind. We look forward to returning.
