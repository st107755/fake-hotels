We spent 2 nights at the Gritti Palace in Venice. We flew into the Marco Polo International Airport in Venice from Atlanta. From there we got on a water taxi that took us directly to the Gritti Place dock. From the moment we arrived you could not ask for better service. Giovanni at the front desk was excellent ! He welcomed us and addressed all our concerns. We stayed there before we took our cruise, which left from Venice. The hotel is located right on the Grand Canal and eating breakfast on their deck over looking the Grand Canal was phenomenal !!!! I would go back and we were a family of 4. We had 2 rooms next door to each other. A place once you go, you will never for get it !!
