we have always wanted to have drinks in this famous hotel but felt sightly apprehensive due to the grand reputation . We were made to feel welcome and completley at home by nico and christiano l it was very special and possibly the highlight of our time in venice . The prices were quite high but not silly  ie quality bottle wine around 50 euro we would like to thank staff for a lovely 2hrs and can honestly say it was worth every penny   thanks
