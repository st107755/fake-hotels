Excellence personified, We where greated as if we were the only people in the hotel by the manager. We were taken to our room and our lugage was already there. The bed room was beautifull with not paper wallpaper but padded brockade, the bed was huge and very high off the ground. The bathroom was huge and all done out in marble as was the walk in shower. Service was excellent if a little expensive and drinks on the terrace were very romantic overlooking the Grand cannal. Breakfast was out of this world both with food and service, as was dinner, but that was very expensive and the menu a liitle limited. All in all one of the best hotels I have stayed in.
