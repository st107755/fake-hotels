The Gritti has been compleetly refurbished and looks great. The rooms are beautiful and all spaces in the hotel look real old but greatly restored where needed. The guests are a real international mix.  Location is the best. Can not be beaten. Some staff are really very good. The breakfast staff could improve as could the breakfast itself. If the weather is good reserve a table at the Terras. If we can afford we will certainly be back.
