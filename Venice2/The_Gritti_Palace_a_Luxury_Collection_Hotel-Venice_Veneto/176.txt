The Gritti Palace is by far the finest experience we've every had at a hotel. It is perfectly situated on the Grand Canal. The rooms are gorgeous and spacious, and the public spaces were lovely. The breakfast was outstanding- fresh, top-shelf produce, pastries, and meats- in a lovely room where you could watch the gondolas bobbing by the windows. Service was always impeccable. We look forward to returning.
