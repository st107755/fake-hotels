Having stayed at the Danieli on a previous trip to Venice, we chose the newly reopened Gritti Palace.  It would seem impossible to improve upon this selection.  Service was outstanding as expected.  Our suite was amazing, with hand painted murals on most walls.  A spiral metal staircase in the living room, lovely sitting room, and bedroom with several window overlooking the Grand Canal.  Our stay was short but we were able to enjoy dinner at Club Del Doge.  Our table was on the rail on the Grand Canal....the food was among the best in the world and the service impeccable..Although the price makes The Gritti out of the reach of many, it is something to be appreciated by those are able.
