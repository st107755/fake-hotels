We went there on our honeymoon and it was just spectacular. I've never met such a nice and attentive staff, they went out of their way to make our visit perfect. The hotel itself is an amazing building with very comfortable rooms with an amazing shower. I don't think any other hotel in Venice can come close to this in terms of service, hotel and location. It's the perfect stay.
