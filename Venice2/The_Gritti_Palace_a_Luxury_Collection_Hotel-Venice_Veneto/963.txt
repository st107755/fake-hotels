One of the best hotels we have ever tried. Everything was perfect. The rates are clearly expensive, but the service, rooms, location, style and atmosphere were all outstanding. Perfect spot to visit the city, with a spectacular view on the canals. Did not try the restaurant. We will surely dream about coming back!
