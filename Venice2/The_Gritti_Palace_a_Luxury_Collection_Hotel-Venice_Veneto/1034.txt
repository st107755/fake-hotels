We booked the Gritti Palace for two nights on SPG points to celebrate our wedding anniversary. As per what seems to be the policy with SPG on points we did get a room in a maze of hallways towards the back with a view of a side canal if your neck was craned, but it was lovely nonetheless and we had no complaints. The hotel was well-appointed, the bathroom and amenities were top-quality, the room very large - exceptionally so by European standards, and the bed wonderfully comfortable. Free wifi was a huge plus as well. We appreciated greatly our free bottle of wine and water provided by the hotel. The location is perfect, and the staff discrete and pleasant. We did have a few drinks at the bar but did not eat any meals at the restaurant as the prices were as to be expected fromâ€¦
