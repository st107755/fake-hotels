Only stay two nights but the hotel is top shelf. It's right on the grand canal and Piazza Giglio, just a short walk from St. Mark's Square. We caught a gondola right outside the hotel for the obligatory ride and basically went around the "neighborhood". Hospitality and service is old school attentive.
