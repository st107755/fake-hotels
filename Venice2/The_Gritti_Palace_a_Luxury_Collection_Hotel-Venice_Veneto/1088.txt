From the moment you arrive, you realise you're somewhere wonderfull, for a start the location on the Grand Canal is superb! You are close to everything you want to see.  The rooms and service are incredible (but certainly not cheap) and the food and location dinning on the terrace right in the Grand Canal for dinner is second to none.   If you're truly looking for a romantic experience, then this is the place of your dreams.  Try to book a room with a canal view if you can.
