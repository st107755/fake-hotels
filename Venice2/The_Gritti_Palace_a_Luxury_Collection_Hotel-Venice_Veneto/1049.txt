If you are going to Venice and can possibly scrape up the money to stay at the Gritti Palace you will never regret it. It was one of the most memorable places that I've stayed in all of my travels. It's just enchanting. I could have sat on their veranda facing the Grand Canal all day and just watched all of the boats and everyone go by. It's a lovely, lovely place. If you can't afford to stay there at least go there and have dinner on the veranda or at least a drink in the late afternoon or early evening.
