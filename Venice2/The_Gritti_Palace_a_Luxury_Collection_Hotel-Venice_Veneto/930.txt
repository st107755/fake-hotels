Brilliant location, service and food. Stayed three nights and eat breakfast and dinner on the terrace which was great. Rooms finished to a very high standard and pubic spaces are very appealing. Only negative was noisy American guests on second night who were in room beside us. Service is attentive without any attitude. Overall a great stay.
