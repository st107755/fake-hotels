This is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff was exceedingly polite and attentive, the building was beautiful and clean, and the food was delicious. Although the hotel did flood during a heavy rainstorm, the staff was prompt and efficient in dealing with the problems. The next morning, I couldn't tell there had been a flood!   The concierge gave wonderful recommendations for restaurants-- and they're not all pricey! It's good, basic, Italian cooking where the average Italian person would dine at night. I'm sure they can also recommend event restaurants, but my mother and I wanted plain Italian cooking. They nailed it!   The staff was discrete and helpful. The maid service was efficient and quiet. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.
