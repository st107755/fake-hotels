My husband and I stayed at the Gritti Palace for our anniversary.  It was a wonderful stay.  The hotel is so beautiful and the decor is gorgeous.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  The service was also very nice and the staff helpful.   I will always remember this perfect stay and add the Gritti Palace to my list of top hotels in the world!  Cant wait to go back.
