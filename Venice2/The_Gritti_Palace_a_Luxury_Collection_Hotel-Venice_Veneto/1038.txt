took my daughter to venice for the first time, so wanted a nice hotel with good facilities in close range to all the sights. Were greeted on arrival and taken to our suite which was beautiful. The breakfasts and food and drinks at the bar were very good and people were very attentive. Would definitely stay here again maybe the Hemmingway suite!
