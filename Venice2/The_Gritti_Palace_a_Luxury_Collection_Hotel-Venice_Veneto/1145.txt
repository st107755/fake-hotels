Life just doesn't get any better than breakfast or drinks on the terrace of the Gritti Hotel.  The room was absolutely beautiful, spacious and exquisitely decorated..  The bathroom was marble, and quite large.  Even though I did not have a canal view, I loved my stay here.  Best hotel I've ever stayed at.
