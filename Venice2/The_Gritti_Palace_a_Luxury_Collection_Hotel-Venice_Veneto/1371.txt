On a sunny afternoon where on earth can beat lunch at one of the outdooor tables at the Gritti? The views of the traffic on Grand Canal may be matched at the Regina but the food and service at the Gritti are unsurpassed. Of course its expensive but all top end eating experiences are going to be so - and its great value which is more important. My sole negative is that (as with all the "grand" Grand Canal hotels the menu states that prices include vat and service. Staff at all these hotels state that the money is kept by the hotel and not given to staff. Why this deception and why not say "service is left to the customer's discretion"? None of the hotels' management have ever explained this.
