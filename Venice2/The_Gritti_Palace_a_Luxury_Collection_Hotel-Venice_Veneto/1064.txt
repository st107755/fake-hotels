if you want everything to be perfect and have high expectations for your Venice trip then stay at the Gritti.  the hotel combines old with new (only underneath) and the staff , location , rooms are really another category above other high ends in Venice. here everything is perfect , from check in to check out , very hard to find any flaws. thoughtful staff and great rooms ... even better bathrooms.  first time for us in winter times.  will be back.
