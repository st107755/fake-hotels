I am a titanium elite member of Marriott's Bonvoy. Booked 3 nights at The Gritti Palace in early June 2019 and in this both instances, I was denied of my privilege:   1) Suite nights - tried to use my suite nights but wasn't granted.   2) I went to my friend's room and realised that they had Aqua de Parma toiletteries throughout their stay whereas my room, it was a different set of shower gel, shampoo, body lotion and hair conditioner.   Why such double standards, I wonder?
