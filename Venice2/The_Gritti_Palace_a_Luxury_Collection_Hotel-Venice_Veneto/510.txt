It is a beautiful hotel with friendly & professional staff.  We were upgraded to a Grand Canal Room which was lovely and the bed was very comfy.  Dining at their Club Del Doge Restaurant was an absolute pleasure.  The Wait Staff were terrific in guiding us through the menu and were particularly helpful in explaining their wines.  It snowed during our stay which simply capped it off.
