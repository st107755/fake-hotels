we have stayed at this property two times now. both experiences were great. the suites are spacious, the staff very friendly and accommodating, the food great and is also in a very good location with great views from the rooms and restaurant terrace.  As a SPG Gold member and booking this property via American Express FHR, they upgraded us several categories both stays, this was a very nice perk.
