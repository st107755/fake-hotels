My wife and I stayed at the Gritti Palace for a 3 day birthday treat in January and were impressed. The staff were very friendly particularly front desk and restaurant. We were upgraded to a very large room overlooking the Giglio church with a lovely floor to ceiling modern marble bathroom. We enjoyed the complimentary birthday prosecco. Bed was unusually comfy for Italy. Compared to the Danielli, which we stayed at previously, Gritti is less grand but more homely and less busy with passing tourists. Location is great, near upmarket shops and a 5 minute stroll to Piazza Marco. If you get a chance spend some time watching the world go bar at the hotel bar overlooking the Grand Canal. The restaurant is nice but very expensive and there are better choices elsewhere.
