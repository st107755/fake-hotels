Everything was perfect about our visit. We were celebrating my parents' 50th wedding anniversary. We had interconnecting rooms (#229 and #230). They were 2 huge rooms with amazing bathrooms. It was like we had our own apartment in a palace in the middle of Venice.The front desk staff were exceptional as were all of the concierges at the desk. The concierges work hard to make your stay perfect. They can arrange anything. The breakfast each morning was exceptional as was the location on the Grand Canal. We cannot wait to return.
