Everyone told us this place was overpriced and we would not be happy. Yes it is overpriced ($12 for a cappucinno $50 for breakfast buffet), but the rooms are drop dead gorgeous, the bathrooms are modernized and good sized, the staff is very friendly and the location on the grand canal is perfect.  The spa is small and the gym is a joke, but you are in Venice and will walk for miles.  The concierges are great with reservations and the service is attentive.  Spend the money and treat yourself to an old world historic property with old world service.  Just don't eat here or touch the minibar
