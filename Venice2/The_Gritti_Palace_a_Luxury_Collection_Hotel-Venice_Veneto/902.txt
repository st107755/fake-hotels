The hotel is the definition of elegance, history and luxury in Venice. Once you walk through the door you feel like a doge walking into his palace thanks to the attentive staff who are there to bend over backwards to make sure you feel like royalty and the glorious antiques that decorate the whole hotel. The room we stayed in was a Giglio Prestige Room and it was fabulous! The room was massive with plush bedding and high quality furnishings. It was also well air conditioned so we were not scorching during the oppressive midday sun. The food was delicious... The food in the bar was delicious and Evan authentically Italian which is a rarity in a lot of hotels. Breakfast was mouthwatering with food been served on the terrace. This served as a tranquil area for eating as you couldâ€¦
