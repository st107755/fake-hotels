Spent three nights at the Gritti Palace this month and it was wonderful.  The bedrooms were luxurious, the bathrooms spacious and practical.  The bar, restaurant and bar food was amazing.  Not an inexpensive stay but if you are staying for a special occasion then this is the place.  The service from every department was , as you would expect from this grade hotel, absolutely excellent - nothing was too much trouble and everything done with a smile and efficiency.  You can walk out of the front of the hotel straight on to a water taxi, take the side door and you are next to the waterbus and gondolas and an 8 minute walk to St. Marks Square.  A fabulous stay.  Enjoy!
