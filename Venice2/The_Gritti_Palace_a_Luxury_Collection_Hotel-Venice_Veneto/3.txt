We have been fortunate to have visited Venice nearly a dozen times in the last 35 years with our last 6 stays in this hotel.  The location is one of the best next to the Grand Canal and opposite the church Santa Maria de Salute, (which is beautiful at night when lit) yet only a few minutes walk to St Mark's Square and the rest of the city.   It is also very peaceful as not on a main thoroughfare,  but has a Gondola and a traghetto  (public gondola type boat for crossing the canal)  next to it.    The hotel is very luxurious in a typical "old"  Italian style , staff are very friendly and helpful .  Due to Covid the restaurant/bar menu are very restricted at this time only.
