We stayed at The Metrpole in January.  What an absolute delight. Walking through the crimson corridors adorned with the owner's collections was quite magical.  Our floor had a massive collection of old 'bedheads', quite 'Alice in Wonderlandish'. Our room was changed in minutes, once we informed them that our wifi was not working ( important when you leave children at home), not to mention an upgrade.  We travel quite extensively, and on this one occasion I want the staff at The Metropole to know that we're planning another stay in April.  Also, many thanks for the lovely bottle of Prosecco and the delicious nibbles you sent to our room for our anniversary.
