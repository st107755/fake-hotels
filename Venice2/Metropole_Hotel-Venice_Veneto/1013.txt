My Husband,17yr daughter and myself loved staying here.The ambience set by the hotel made you feel as if you had stepped back in time.The Hotel was full of antiques and antique collections and the outdoor garden area where breakfast and dinner were served was quite beautiful.The small lounge bar was almost moroccan in decor and a favourite place of ours before going to dinner.The staff at reception were very helpful and friendly.This hotel also has a fantastic position.We caught a water taxi right to the hotel door and it was only a short walk to St Marks Square.Our bedroom and bathroom were very spacious,the bathroom was very well appointed and looked brand new.We would definitely return to stay here.
