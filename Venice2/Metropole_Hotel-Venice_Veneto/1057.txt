Stayed at the Metropole in February 2003. Booked a junior suite and was very impressed. The hotel is very atmospheric, the staff are very helpful and the restaurant was excellent. The breakfast buffet was fresh and substantial. A very memorable stay in a very memorable city. We will be booking a break in Venice again and the Metropole will be one of the highlights of our stay!
