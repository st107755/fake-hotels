The hotel's location is excellent; just a short stroll to San Marco.  The Metropole has its own water taxi stop. This is very good for people who prefer not to pull heavy suitcases through narrow, crowded streets. I think the bigger boat from the airport stops just 2 bridges along from the hotel.  The room was of modest size and nicely decorated with that lovely deep red colour. There were interesting displays of antique collectables in the lobby.  The restaurant looked pretty nice but we always ate lunch and dinner in town. Breakfast was fine in a pleasant room..  The price was slightly cheaper than Monaco and Grand Canal and below that of Londra Palace. There's nothing to choose between them on location.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.
