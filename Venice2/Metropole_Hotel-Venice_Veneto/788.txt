we stayed here to enjoy the" real " venice, we were not disappointed.This family owned hotel was a short walk from the tourist areas of St. Marks,but also convenient to wander the less well known areas. We had a generous  breakfast at the hotel in the private gardens, which were calm and peaceful, ready for a days exploration. The hotel has various eccentric collections on display, from corkscrews to ladies fans. The bar lounge provided views over the lagoon and on the side was the landing stage replete with the decorated poles.Antiques are everywhere, if you like modern decor this hotel is not for you. The restaurant was a bit pricey. so we enjoyed the nightly quest to discover a good eatery, we were spoilt for choice.Our tip would be go to the fish market Saturday lunch time,â€¦
