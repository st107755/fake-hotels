We spent two nights here and loved this hotel. We arrived by water taxi and entering the hotel from their dock on the canal is a special experience. The decor is so unique and you are embraced by this exotic and luxurious atmosphere. The room was great and also very quiet. The unique decor of the hotel is fun and while not my taste, seems totally perfect and in character for visiting Venice. The breakfast buffet is excellent and we also enjoyed having cocktails on the terrace. The primary reason you'll want this hotel is the location! While on the lagoon, it is a 5 min walk from the crowds you'll encounter closer to S. Marco square. You are conveniently close to the action but not in the middle of the commotion. Venice was very crowded but we felt we could always find sanctuaryâ€¦
