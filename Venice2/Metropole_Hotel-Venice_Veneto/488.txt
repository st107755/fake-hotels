Our family of four had two adjoining rooms, with one overlooking the lagoon and the other overlooking the side canal. The rooms were well appointed and of reasonable size.

As others have mentioned, the street directly outside the hotel can be extremely busy during the day (from about 8am), but it quietens significantly in the evening (from about 7pm).   While the hotel is reasonably close to St Mark's, it is also well located for those seeking the sanctuary of quieter streets in the Castello region.
