The Metropole has a great location in Venice. The staff was very helpful. The lobby had a nice smell every time you entered. Our room was nice. The decor of the whole hotel is interesting. The breakfast had a nice variety but lacked an omelette station. Overall we would recommend this hotel. Venice is a unique city and getting around by boat everywhere makes it interesting.
