This is the fith/Sixth time we have stayed at the Metropole, it is in an excellent position and the staff are always very helpfull and welcoming. We were awarded an upgrade on previous occasions but this time we were in one of the smaller rooms at the back but apart from the view the room was fine. We will not hesitate to return.
