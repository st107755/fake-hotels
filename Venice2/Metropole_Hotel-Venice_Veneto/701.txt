We were booked to stay 3 nights in a family room, having read reviews we were really excited. We arrived and found the reception to be dark, dingy and musty smelling. Our family room was awful, very dreary looking with plastic bath and poor quality finishes. The curtains were very dusty and tired, and the overall ambiance was depressing.  We asked if other rooms were available and were shown much better rooms, we were offered 2 rooms to accommodate us. The manager was very lovely and tried to be helpful, but this hotel just wasn't for us. At €600 for the night, it was not good enough!   We went to look for somewhere else to stay and, having done so, checked out. We had to pay most of the first night fee, which was painful- it was a late check out, and the staff were as helpful…
