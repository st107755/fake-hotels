The outstanding restaurant two Michelin stars in 2010, is the best of Venice and maybe Italy ...We chose this hotel compared to other 5 star hotels in Venice just for his restaurant. The buffet breakfast extremely rich and varied, included in the price of the room while in other hotels of Venice is a supplement to the unreasonable pricing (100 â‚¬ for 2 at Bauer! Whatever its composition, is a breakfast, so do not exaggerate). Great location and excellent value for money.  the charm of the place and very elaborate decorations throughout the hotel, kind staff,  The family suite has one bathroom and lighting of the hotel is a little inadequate for our tastes.
