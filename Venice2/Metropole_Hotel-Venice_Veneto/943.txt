Stayed at the Metropole in November 2008 for 8 nights and found it a great place to stay.  For the first night we had a room without much of a city view but were changed without question to a higher city-view room at no charge.  Good basic restraunt - with great Vietnamese style coffee - and a buffet breakfast with variety. The refurbished rooms would be 4 1/2 star back home.  It is an interesting 10 minute walk to town centre, but a walk in any direction will find things of interest to a traveler.  We mostly walked the city but there are taxi's out-front and attentive staff that were happy to help.  All up a great stay and would recommend to give it a try.
