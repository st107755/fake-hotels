We had very high expectations and they were met in the entrance and oriental themed lounge by the entrance but we were disappointed by the size of the rooms.   Service was good as you would expect in a classic 5* Hotel.  It was the first time we had stayed so close to St Marks Sq. so the location is good for the classic Venice views across to San Giorgio Maggiore and the entrance to the Grand Canal.  However we had a dinner in the Met restaurant as part of a package and sadly it was the most disappointing meal I've ever had.  It really let the whole hotel down.
