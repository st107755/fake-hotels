A truly gorgeous boutique hotel in a great location. What more could you ask for?  From the moment we arrived to our departure the hotel staff couldn't of been more helpful or courteous. The suite we had was out of this world and seriously made me giggle due to the numerous golden cherubs adorning the walls and directly over the truly humongous bed which of course was a four poster made of marble columns and on a raised platform.  You absolutely must try the hotels hot chocolate which is quiet something else served in a silver tea pot and of course the cocktails in the hotel bar where Devine.  A trip to this hotel of this couldn't be more deserving of a private water taxi too and from the airport . Seriously James Bond .
