A hotel with mountains of character and charisma. A million miles from the chain/brand hotels that you can find across the globe, this is a unique oasis of friendly stylish calm perched on the grand canal with excellent views and unbeatable convenience for all of the best that Venice can offer....2 minutes from its door on foot, or however long you like by water taxi from the hotel's private jetty. This was our second stay, prior to embarking from the Venice cruise port.....we again found it relaxing and enjoyable from beginning to end. Don't waver, just book it, you will remember the experience with a smile....whereas how many of the top brand chain hotels stay in the memory for very long?
