This hotel is different and unique. It may not be everyone's style, but I really liked it. It has a bohemian flair. The sitting area downstairs is comfortable and a nice spill over area for jet lagged travelers. The bar is trendy and a bit expensive, but again comfortable, wit great service. The room we had was excellent- large, with a decent bathroom, window over a small canal.
