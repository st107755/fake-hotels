This hotel fits the bill for a family with older children. The decor is opulent and stylish, and the location - near St Mark's Square, on the waterfront is perfect.  We did not try the Michelin 2 Star restaurant as we did not think the children would appreciate it enough - but there were reasonable restaurants within walking distance. The breakfast was excellent, and the staff were friendly and welcoming.  Really enjoyed our stay.
