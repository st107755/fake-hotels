This is an incredible hotel on the Riva  degli Schiavoni. It is approximately 200 meters from St Marks Square but far enough away to be quiet. It is a "funky" place with loads of antiques all over the hotel.  The staff were extremely helpful. The buffet breakfast was the best we have ever had and the prices, for Venice, were most reasonable - provided that you did not want a room overlooking the St Marks basin.  Whenever we visit Venice in future this will be our first choice hotel.
