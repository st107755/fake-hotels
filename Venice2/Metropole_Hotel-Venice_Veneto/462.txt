The location can not be better... It is just a few meters from the San Marcos square. The building inside and outside is very beautiful, taking care of all the details.... One of my favorite moment is when I arrived and one person that is working in the hotel went along with me.... He explained to me some information about the furnitures that are in the hotel (old figments that now are part of the decoration of the hotel), but he looked that was proud of working there!   The service is best in class and always they were super attentive!
