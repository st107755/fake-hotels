Luxurious hotel, lobby looks lovely, however the rooms look like out of a Dracula movie and the beds were very uncomfortable. Staff at reception were helpful, but other staff did speak very poor English, which was a bit of a letdown for such a hotel. I would definitely not go back, as it was overpriced and lacked good service and the rooms were not up the standard for a top class hotel.
