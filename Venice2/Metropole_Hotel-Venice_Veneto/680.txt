My wife and I visited Venice for the forth time with this being our second consecutive stay at the metropole hotel.we had a lagoon suit again and was not disappointed . From the moment we arrived the attention by staff was superb.reading other reviews about the decor and smell it couldn't be further from the truth the ambience and decor is what I would expect from this type of hotel worth a treat and will be back.  Just a thought bottle water should be freedom the mini bar.
