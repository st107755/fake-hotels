My now wife and I got married in Venice and stayed at the beautiful hotel Metropole who also arranged a reception for 26 in their beautiful courtyard. I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. The beautiful detail is everywhere you look and is both ornate and stunning. Mr Bon the hotel manager looked after us personally and the restaurant and bar manager Lucio deserves a special mention for giving us his time and for the simply amazing 5 course reception lunch that was served in the courtyard which had been decorated with white flowers and drapes. Our room was wonderful and the service we received throughout our stay was of the highest standard. We travelled on to other hotels in Italy during our honeymoon none of which compared to Hotel Metropole despite being of similar priceâ€¦
