Indeed, very nice, Venice & the Metropole. Kind staff, good service, a romantic atmosphere, great location. Even the food was excellent. And so was the Bar. We will definitely return. I have been to Venice before, at the Londra Palace and the Giorgione, but the Metropole is now my favourite hotel in Venice.
