The title of my review says it all. If you are coming to Venice for the first time it's the perfect place to explore from. The rooms are nice, staff attentive and you felt looked after. The place itself has a lot of quirky character and charm. The breakfast courtyard was great, easily the best quality breakfast  selection we had in Italy on our tour and the breakfast staff were lovely. I can't stress how good the location is.
