We recently stayed here for 2 nights for our honeymoon.  What a wonderful hotel!  The building is simple great with all the old feel but new functionality.  Staff was helpful in every way we asked and the breakfast was delicious and comprehensive.    Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.
