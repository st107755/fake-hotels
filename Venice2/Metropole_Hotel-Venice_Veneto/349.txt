A beautiful, unique hotel. Classic Venetian ambiance. Romantic-lushly decorated rooms.  Beautiful collections to see on every floor. We were welcomed warmly and sincerely.  Wonderful breakfast buffet and excellent restaurant recommendations. Our special thanks to Alvisa and Stefano for their patience as we tried to speak Italian and for taking such good care of us.  We will return!
