The hotel has a perfect central location and is charming inside,full of quirky antiques and red materials.I have to say however that this is by no means a 5 star hotel as promised, I booked a superior delux room with a lagoon view, for a special occasion and was so dissapointed, the room was tiny and overlooking the sea taxi ticket office on the lagoon,which had a flag pole outside one of the windows.I asked for another room but was told I would have to pay even more money for a suite, which after viewing, was certainly not worth it.Overall it just is not special enough and does not at all deserve its star rating, after checking out, you even have to pay a 30 euro tax to help them pay towards the up keep of the museums and galleries,not good, you really felt like a number andâ€¦
