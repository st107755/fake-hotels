I can’t recommend this hotel enough, I had a fantastic stay with my boyfriend. From the moment we arrived, the concierge staff were beyond friendly and accommodating. It was a perfect experience. It’s in an ideal location without being too central in all the tourist madness! The rooms are lovely and Venetian style. We had an excellent stay and will 100% go back! Also completely recommend including breakfast in your visit as the food was delicious!
