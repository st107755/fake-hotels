Spacious room with four windows overlooking the lagoon. Great location in the heart of everything but within steps of quiet neighborhoods to be explored. Staff were fabulous, very friendly and accommodating. Cheers to Angelo who makes a superb martini. The Oriental Bar is a must for any true martini drinker.
