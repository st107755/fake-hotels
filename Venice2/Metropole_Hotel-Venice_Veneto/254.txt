First trip to Venice and so glad we stayed here. The location was brilliant (couple of bridges from St. Mark's Square) so great for walking and a water bus stop right outside the front door. (There is also an entrance at a canal side door if using a water taxi!) Best of all were the wonderful staff - so friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was delicious, a great selection in nice surroundings. Room was a good size, comfortable bed and lovely soft towels!!  Decor in the whole of the hotel was beautiful. Thank you for giving us a lovely experience of Venice
