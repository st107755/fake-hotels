Wonderful location!  Take the expensive water taxi to it for sure.  5 blocks from the square.  Gondolas out the front door.  Our room was under 200e and was great - the room on the side canal with the balcony!  Very classy facilities, marble bathroom, nice room, great bar, it was terrific!  Take a water taxi all around the grand canal - it's even better than the gondola.  We loved Metropole.
