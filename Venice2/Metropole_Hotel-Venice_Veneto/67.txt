The Metropole is in a fantastic location - just far enough away from Piazza San Marco and the heaving crowds and with its own landing stage for the water taxi. The hotel felt a bit like an antique emporium, full of collections of various kinds. The rooms however did not match a 5* rating being cramped and rather tatty and with poorly set out bathrooms. We did use the bar one night but the drinks were exceedingly pricy, even for Venice.
