I stayed here with my boyfriend for 3 nights in August.The hotel was lovely and very near san marcos square. I asked for aroom with a side canal view and got it. I was delighted as we had a balocny overlooking the canal for no extra cost.Also there are only two rooms in the hotel with a balcony which made it even better.I think our room number was 246. We didnt eat in the hotel as it was quite expensive and very quiet.The staff were friendly and very helpful.The hotel has its own water taxi stop. We didnt use it as there is a public water bus stop directly opposite the hotel. The only negative thing iis the walls are very thin and on our last night we could hear the people next door making alot of noise.!!!!!!
