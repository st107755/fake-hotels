We stayed for two nights here for our anniversary and loved it. It’s not the biggest grandest place, but it’s beautifully done and the service is excellent.   A special mention for the Concierge, Guliano, who went out of his way to help in the friendliest way possible.  You have to arrive in style to make the best possible start, so arrive by river taxi via the Grand Canal to the side entrance. You feel like Celebs!  Definitely worth the money.   The rooms aren’t huge and lack things like tea making facilities, but it’s a minor detail in such a well positioned spot.
