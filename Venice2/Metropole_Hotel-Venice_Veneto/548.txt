We went to Venise on my last birthday and stayed at Metropole. What a nice place!! Decoration is perfect and makes you feel like in a museum! We booked through their website and got our breakfast included and we are very happy we did! They also organised our free journey to glass blowing factory, and it was a nice experience too! The first two nights we had no special view and after doing all Venise on foot and boats, was really good to change the room with the view on the channel and opening it in the morning we saw a wonderful cruise ship tendered.We got a nice present from the administration on my birthday - two prossessos in their nice bar.  I highly recommend this hotel for a special event or a romantic journey to the unforgettable Venise, as their staff are veryâ€¦
