My wife, her brother and I visited Venice in February. We had nothing booked in advance. At the front we saw the Metropole. It looked beyond our budget. We met a pleasant man at reception-possibly a manager. He quoted an off season rate which while good was still a bit beyond us. He then agreed to give us 5 nights for the price of three as it was off season and he had plenty of rooms. Well done him-half a loaf is better than nothing!  The staff were helpful and courteous. Anything we asked for was provided and the hotel itself is very pleasant. The room for three was large and spacious. It is in a terrific location right by the sea and a quick walk to the likes of Marco square etc.We can only say thank you for a lovely hotel, professional management and a very good rate.
