The Metropole Hotel is a gorgeous 5 star hotel with a Michelin Star restaurant. Opulent decor that won't disappoint. We ate at the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the culinary experience. It was also the first time we encountered a water menu !! We had the accompanying wine tasting with our meal and can recommend this. The sommelier was so knowledgable and it was clear he loved his job. Service by the waiters was exceptional too. For after dinner coffee we sat in the gardens, which were beautifully decorated.....I would certainly recommend eating here
