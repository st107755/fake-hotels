We travelled to Venice and enjoyed our stay at the Metropole Hotel immensley. The Old World charm gave it a very comfortable feel with out being too over the top. The staff were very helpful and fluent in English which was also a great help to us and they gave us some great ideas of what to do and where to visit whilst in Venice. We would recommend the hotel to other travellers and would indeed look forward to staying there again in the future.
