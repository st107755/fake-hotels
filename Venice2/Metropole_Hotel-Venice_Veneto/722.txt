Beautiful hotel . The atmosphere is lovely the minute you walk in. It is furnished with  antiques, lovely plush furnishings, and feels very cosy and even smells nice. Really interesting to walk around inside the hotel looking at  all their antique collections. All the rooms are furnished differently and ours was really comfortable overlooking the side canal.  The only complaint  was about the shower, it was over the bath, which was quite small, and it  was difficult to use without flooding the bathroom! The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good, a varied selection. Again the dining room was beautifully furnished and the garden is a lovely oasis in the middle of the city. The hotel is centrally placed just a short walk from St Marks Square, right byâ€¦
