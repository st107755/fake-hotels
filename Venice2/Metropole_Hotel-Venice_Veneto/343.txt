We stopped by looking for a cool place to escape the throngs. We were almost the only people in the bar. Bruno proudly proclaimed that if his martini was nit the best we ever had, then they would be free. They were the best. Lots of theatre and care taken in the presentation and preparation. Expensive but worth it. Next time we will visit for dinner!
