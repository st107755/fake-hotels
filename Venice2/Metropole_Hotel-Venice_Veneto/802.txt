The hotel is perfectly situated just past Piazza San Marco although it is a very busy tourist route. The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with all the facilities you would expect - Minibar, TV, Hairdrier, safe and plenty of storage space. It had a large comfortable bed, which was turned down for us later that evening when we went out for dinner. Breakfast in the morning was a continental buffet style and very over priced for what was available - anything extra was supplied in the menu but you should expect to pay â‚¬5 for a bowl of cornflakes. Overall we had a great trip to Venice and staying in this hotel only added to the alure of the place although breakfast prices were a laugh.
