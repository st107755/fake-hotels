We had one night after our cruise to stay in Venice and blew our budget on this beautiful hotel.  The room was gorgeous.  The antiques around the corridors were most interesting.  We did not eat at the hotel, but the concierge guided us to a restaurant on the canal as it was very late.  The view was over the garden which was fine as we spent little time in the room.  My girlfriend and I just wanted to shop and explore.   It has a lift but we still had a few stairs to climb to our room.  The porters carried all our luggage into the room so that was good.
