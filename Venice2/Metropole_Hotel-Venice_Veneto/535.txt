The Metropole is not cheap but worth every penny and really great value. Within easy walking distance of St Mark's  Square. It overlooks open water towards the LIdo. Close to all the water taxi and public transport stops. An easy walk from the water bus stop to/from the airport. The rooms are superb, classically decorated, quiet and very comfortable. Their restaurant is excellent with plenty of local dishes. Breakfast will set you up for the day. Their bar has great atmosphere and does great cocktails. The staff friendly, helpful and very multilingual. Their own restaurant was closed one night and we were directed to a very comfortable local place. Again good value. Venice is expensive but not the rip off some people talk of, with the exception of coffee in St. Mark's square.â€¦
