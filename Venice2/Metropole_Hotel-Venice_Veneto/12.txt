Having spoke to our travel agent a few times before we were due to travel and being told it was “safe” to go ahead with our holiday, we decided not to. We booked via a well known brand who tried very hard to get our booking moved to an alternative date but the hotel refused to help us. We lost out money in the end, it is very sad to see the devastation in Venice but would have thought this hotel would have been more accommodating with reservations people had.
