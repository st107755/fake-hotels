We just returned from Italy, and the highlight of our trip was staying at the Metropole in Venice. In addition to Venice being a wonderful and enchanting city, the Metropole was just over the top. Pulling up to their lobby in a water taxi made you feel like you were royality.  The rooms were decorated with care and the service was excellent.  We can't wait to go back!
