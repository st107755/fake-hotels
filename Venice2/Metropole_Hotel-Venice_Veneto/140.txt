The Metropole hotel is old and has very dark interiors.  The room was small and the walls were thin (I could hear my neighbor's television).  The bathroom is small but modern with nice amenities.  The staff is wonderful and willing to help.  It is located on a busy area but you do not hear the people once you are in the hotel.
