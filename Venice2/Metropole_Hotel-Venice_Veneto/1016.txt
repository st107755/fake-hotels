Spend 5 nights at the Metropole, was not disappointed in any way.  The furnishings in the rooms and in the public areas are fantastic, staff were helpful and friendly.  Location-wise, my husband & I found the Metropole ideal - close to all the main attractions & vaporetti stops but peaceful inside.  Has excellent views too.  Would recommend this hotel unreservedly.
