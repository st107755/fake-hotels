Stayed here last week, fantastic hotel & location. Staff are all excellent especially in the bar were we ate each night. Special wedding anniversary was made even more special by complimentary bottle of Prossecco. Never been to a hotel were rooms are serviced twice a day. Breakfast was especially nice in the garden. Will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Venice
