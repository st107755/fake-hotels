We went for New Year's and a few days in January to our incredibly disappointment due to  substandard conditions! The hotel staff has no concept of customer service and the hotel is overpriced and definitely not worth a repeat visit.  It is rare that we feel that we have been robbed by a hotel. The many issues included booking (and paying) for a double bed only to find two beds pushed together which were quite uncomfortable. When we mentioned we had paid for a double room, the front desk took the attitude: "tough luck." We also splurged on the New Year's Eve dinner. The hotel allegedly has a one star michelin chef.. at a price tag of $1500 for two we were shocked that the food was barely edible. Again, hotel staff never bothered to ask why the plates were cleared and the dishesâ€¦
