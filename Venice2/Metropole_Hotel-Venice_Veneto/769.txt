Excellent location, tho in the heart of the tourist area, but the rooms are quiet, and ammenities excellent.  The best feature of the hotel is the front desk staff who are very helpful and accommodating - and the bartender, who makes the best martinis with the right amount of flair that I have had anywhere in my travels - and that is saying a great deal!
