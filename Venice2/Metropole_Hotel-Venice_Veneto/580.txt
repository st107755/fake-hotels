stayed here for 2 nights in August. Arrived by private water taxi. The hotel has its own little jetty. Met by concierge, who took our bags. Checked in very easily, all facilities explained. The staff/service are great here. Nothing is too much trouble, very eager to please.  The location is perfect, not in the middle of town, but on the shore line and close enough to get around very easily. the decor is lovely, the breakfast room is in a little courtyard out the back. The room we had was just the right size and very comfortable. I will definitely stay there again when visiting Venice in future.
