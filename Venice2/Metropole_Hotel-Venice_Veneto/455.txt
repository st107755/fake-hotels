We were staying here for 3 nights and the airline lost 2 of our travel mates bags.  The hotel staff were very accommodating - letting us use the house phone to call the airline every day (sometimes for 20 minutes). The staff in the bar were friendly and made us feel very welcome (even at 1am).    The hotel is clean and the rooms are well appointed although nothing spectacular.   They have a laptop in the 'living room' area which was great for looking up directions to restaurants, checking email, etc. There are many interesting antique collections to view in the lobby area.  The hotel is located on the Grand Canal so it is in a good spot, not far from St Marks.  Breakfast was included, which you can have in their lovely garden.  All in all a nice stay.
