We had a wonderful weekend stay at the Metropole. The rooms were absolutely gorgeous, luxurious bed linens, large flat screen tv on the wall, wonderful bathroom with a great european soaking tub.  It was hard to believe we were able to have such luxury with the great off-season rate we got.  We stayed on the 4th floor (there was an elevator) and our room had a lovely terrace, where we could sit outside and see the canal.  The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, and the location couldn't be beat, just steps from St. Mark's Square and almost next to the Ducale Palace.  When asked, the concierges were helpful with making restaurant reservations and suggestions.  We would definitely love to stay at the Metropole again.
