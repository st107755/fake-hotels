We stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon.  All staff were extremely helpful & polite. Rooms were beautifully decorated & very quiet considering the perfect location only 2 minutes from st marks square. The breakfast was wonderful. It was in the hotels garden & had a wide & varied selection. Some of the best pastrys which were freshly made. Very good selection of fruit, meats cereal. Would highly recommend & would stay here again.
