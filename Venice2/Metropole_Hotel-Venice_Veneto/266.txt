A beautifully designed hotel incorporating traditional Venetian touches with luxury details. We stayed in two different rooms, our favourite room was their top floor deluxe double which had a small balcony over looking the lagoon. All of the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly, nothing was ever too much trouble. We enjoyed some lovely cocktails in the Oriental bar and experienced great service by all the barmen. I would definitely recommend booking a private water taxi to make use of their private landing. Location is great and gives you good access to see all that Venice has to offer.
