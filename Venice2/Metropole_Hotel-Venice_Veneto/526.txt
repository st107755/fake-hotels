We had a wonderful stay at the Metropole. We arrived by private charter boat at the hotels private jetty and were warmly greeted. The staff are very attentive without being overbearing. The suite we were in even had a small but delightful balcony and the room was beautifully furnished. The bed was soooo comfortable. The location is great for all the touristy stuff and when in your room with the window open, far enough away to escape the chaos and noise of the Grand canal. The Oriental bar is a fabulous retreat from the hustle and bustle and the food in the Met restaurant is superb, (though extremely expensive). Plenty of help with excursions etc from the staff in the lobby, they even have maps available.
