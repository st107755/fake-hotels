This is an old style hotel with steps to and inside the room we stayed in. The location is great, steps away from the water taxis and 2 bridges (5minutes) away from piazza San Marco. The staff is friendly and helpful. Hotel offers free boat transfer to a gallery/store/glass blowing place in Murano.
