I'd never stayed in a 5* hotel before, so maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been, but I was disappointed with our room, the size of the bed plus as little extra room as possible which I thought was a feature limited to the more budget hotels. Also, although I had reserved a double room, what we got was two twin beds, with separate bed covers, pushed together - disappointing for my boyfriend and I who like to sleep snuggled up together. Also, it took a rather hot and sleepless night before we discovered that the air conditioning only worked with the fan on 'max' - all lower settings were in fact off.   Other reviews talk of the helpfulness of the staff, and while this was definitely the case for some, at other times we had considerably less helpful service,â€¦
