We stayed in July 2006.  Positives:  Location is great--very close to San Marco square and close to the Vaperetto and Aliguna water bus stations for convenient access to everywhere else in Venice.  Breakfast buffet was good.  Negatives:  Room was very old and dated, and not clean.  There was a black moldy looking substance that extended around the room between the walls and ceiling.  The air conditioning vent also had this black moldy substance.  Bathroom was small and dated--old tile floors.  Overall, the hotel looked very old and tired.  Air conditioning did not work very well, with the room feeling humid and warm.  Add to that the damp smell of the room which made for not a very enjoyable stay at the hotel.  Venice, on the other hand, was very nice.
