Apart form the good location (very close to Piazza San Marco), there is absolutely nothing appealing in this hotel, which certainly does not qualify as a 5 star and not even a 3 stars We were supposed to be picked up at the airport, after I agreed with the concierge a 235 euros transfer. It did not happen and we had to take public boat which is fine but long and  spoiled part of our day.  Then there was no AC in the hotel and the temperature in the room was unbearable. We have been told that normally in October the temperatures are not that hot...finally the following day, the AC worked again  The room are dusty and small. the hotel lacks severe renovation...  Finally the breakfast is simply bleak  Not worth the price at all for such a low quality
