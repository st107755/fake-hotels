The hotel is situated in a perfect area, close to St Marks Square, but also close to the less expensive restaurants/bars etc if you walk the other way. The service is fantastic and the receptionists etc cannot do enough for you. We stayed in one of the junior suites and it was beautiful. Really rustic Italian, four poster bed, beautiful bathroom. The minibar is quite expensive so be careful with that, but then what isn't in Venice!   One thing to remember is the tax they charge when you check out - don't leave yourself with not enough money!  I am glad I stayed here - if we visited Venice again I would stay here again definitely.
