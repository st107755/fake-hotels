Three friends and I stayed at the hotel for two nights in August.  The hotel was not the most modern we stayed at in Italy over ten days, but it was charming.  We all had rooms overlooking the canal.  The rooms were well appointed, but the beds were not extremely comfortable. Everyone's favorite part of our stay was the lavish breakfast served in the courtyard each morning. There was a huge buffet with wonderful food in the lovely garden. The hotel helped us to coordinate a private guide to walk around Venice, and they arranged a complimentary boat to a Murano glass factory. This was the only hotel on our trip that still used an actual key to get in the room rather than a key card.  The location was very convenient to Piazza San Marco and watching people and boats on the canalâ€¦
