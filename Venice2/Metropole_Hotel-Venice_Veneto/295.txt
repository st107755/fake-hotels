Wow this is an amazing beautiful hotel. The decor and all the antiquities displayed throughout the hotel are breath taking. We loved our room with a partial view of the canal. The staff is very professional and helpful. It has beautiful gardens in the back with sitting areas everywhere amazingly decorated. The continental breakfast was delicious and everything was very fresh. Different kind of fresh fruits, pastries, cheeses, cereals, eggs, bacon, and delicious cappuccinos. The hotel is well located close to everything. Highly recommended.
