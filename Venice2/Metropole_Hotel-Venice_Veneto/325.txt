The Metropole Hotel is located on the promenade overlooking the lagoon.  It is in the San Marco area and is a fantastic location for restaurants and shops all within easy walking distance.  St Mark's Basilica is a max 10 minute walk away.  The hotel is beautiful inside, almost like a museum show casing the many collections of its private owner(s).  Staff in all areas are exceptionally friendly, professional and eager to assist you in every way.  The hotel has its own private boat entrance for your arrival/departure.  If you can afford a room with a lagoon view it is well worth the cost.  Rooms are double glazed so you will not be disturbed by the water taxi port outside or the hustle and bustle of the many tourists on the promenade.  Otherwise, you can choose a garden view roomâ€¦
