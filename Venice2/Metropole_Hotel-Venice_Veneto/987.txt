We stayed at the Metropole from April 17-21.  When we arrived they upgraded our room to a Canal view.   I thought the hotel was  very dark and somewhat morbid.  Many antiques and uncomforable old furniture.  After one night in our Canal view room  we asked to be moved to a quieter location.  Being on the 1st floor, with no air conditioning and unable to open the windows since anyone could have looked into our room,we were very disappointed in this hotel.  The noise level was almost deafening due to the hordes of people  walking by our room or the toot from the vaporettos which was leaving every 15 minutes up until midnight.  They changed our room the the 2nd floor overlooking the small canal.  We still had a view of the Grand Canal, but now every 10 minutes a speed boat passedâ€¦
