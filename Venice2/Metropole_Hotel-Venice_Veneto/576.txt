based right on the laguna in Venice, the location is perfect and the staff know absolutely almost everything - we asked for another small table and electrical outlet in the room, and they accommodated us superbly - helped us with the television etc - okay so the breakfast menu is a bit over-priced but they offered a smaller selection for a more reasonable price. but highly recommended
