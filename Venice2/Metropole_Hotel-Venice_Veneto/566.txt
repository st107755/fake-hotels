We have just returned from our stay at the Hotel Metroplole and what a wonderful hotel it is. The location is fantastic, overlooking the lagoon and just steps away from the Doge's Palace and St Marks Square. Concierge arranged for us to be met from the cruise terminal, at our request and the arrangements ran so smoothly. They also arranged our water taxi for the return, again, everything was fantastic, all the staff could not do enough for you. The hotel has a very welcoming atmosphere and is extremely comfortable. If you are thinking of going to Venice, I would highly recommend this hotel.
