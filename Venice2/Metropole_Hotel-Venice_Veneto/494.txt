This is a truly lovely and historic property, overlooking the laguna, ideally located for Venetian holidays. Entering from streets jam-packed with people, The Metropole is immediately a haven: dark, quiet, and romantic, with a wonderful ambience. Fascinating collections of artifacts make every nook and cranny fascinating. Wonderful private gardens with adjoining breakfast seating. The staff is excellent throughout this property.
