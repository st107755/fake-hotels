What a wonderful hotel . Just recently stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate a special anniversary . It was wonderful . Staff were lovely especially in the bar and breakfast areas. Very friendly . The bedrooms cosily decorated and quaint.  The decor of the hotel was really interesting . Very warm and cosy like taking a trip back in time.   Breakfast was very varied and tasty .Only negative was it was a little cold .  It's location is spot on . Two min walk to St. Marks square . We had a room with a balcony.. Stunning. We were surprised on our 2nd day with a bottle of bubbly "complimentary" for our anniversary delivered to our room . Nice touch .  Linen and housekeeping was of a high standard .  We will definitely return here again soon .
