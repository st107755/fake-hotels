Venice is clearly a ridiculously expensive city so was pleased to find the Hotel Metropole. It is situated close to the main Square but far enough not to be affected by the noise. The interior of the hotel is fantastic, lush and everything you would want and expect from an  Italian hotel. The rooms were very nice, each individually decorated. The bathrooms were fine, no complaints and breakfast was decent too. The lounge area looked v inviting and the bar equally so though we did not avail ourselves of those facilities.  My only disappointment was the meal in the Michelin star restaurant - it was very pretentious. It was a little irritating being presented with a 4 page water menu at the start of the meal that had lots of chemical symbols but absolutely no description to helpâ€¦
