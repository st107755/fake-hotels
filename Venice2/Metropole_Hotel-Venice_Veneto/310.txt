I stayed for half a week in the Metropole. Fabulous, just fabulous! I was welcomed by the antiques in the lobby and crimson opulence everywhere. It is only two minutes away from the Danieli, so I would make a stop by Danieli for aperitif or night cap in the evenings.   There is not much else to do in Venice itself after 8pm, so it is quite handy that Metropole has a wonderful restaurant where I enjoyed truffle dishes and beautiful wine.  I would give the hotel 5 star but my room was really small and rather basic, not exactly 5-star standard. That said, other amenities in the hotel make up for it and over. Will come back!
