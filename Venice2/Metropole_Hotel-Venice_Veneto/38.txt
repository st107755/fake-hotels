A truly unique hotel with beautiful old style furnishing and an iconic series of collections on display (corkscrews, fans, nutcrackers, etc).  Our room had a huge 4 poster bed, and was extremely spacious.  Quality amenities provided and spotlessly clean.  Wonderful service.  heart buffet and a la carte breakfasts. Very highly recommended.
