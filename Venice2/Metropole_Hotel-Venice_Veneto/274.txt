We loved this quaint hotel in the heart of Venice. Just a few minutes walk to St Marks Square and the Doges Palace right on the canal. The hotel has its own jetty and was really convenient as we had arrived in a water taxi from a cruise ship. The very obliging staff were there to meet us and we were into our room in a flash, even though we arrived early. The hotel is traditional and quirky as it is decorated with fantastic antiques.  We took the free water taxi to the island of Murano where we purchased the world famous blown glass items.
