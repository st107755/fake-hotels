we stayed for five days at the metropole and are very happy to have done so. Nice and helpful service, professional staff, problem-solving director (he even tried to book us an entrance at san marco using his own credit card and made sure we didn't have to pay our internet access when it seemed not to work for us).  The room (a junior suite) was comfortable and permanently checked-up (when we left after a short rest during the day everything was put in place and changed when we came back, it feeled we had a private butler).  Perhaps one small detail but to us it matters: why ask for 8 euro at breakfast for a real orange juice? The rooms are not that cheap i suppose... we like our juice in the morning and got it in many other and simpler hotels... a detail to change i would likeâ€¦
