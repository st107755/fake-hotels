My husband booked a 5 day holiday as a surprise to celebrate an important anniversary.  I didn't want to complain about the room we were given, so we stayed put in what was obviously a basic one.  The wall-to-wall red decor was oppressive and the general standard a bit tired. The canopy of a four-poster, heavy drapes and the narrow window, which looked out onto a wall a couple of metres away, made it dark and gloomy.  There was too much furniture.  The bathroom was stocked with towels, robes and toiletries, but they were no better than you'd find in a 3-star.  The room was clean.  Overall, I would prefer the basics to be right, rather than have the quirky features like museum collections or having the bed turned down.  Small details like efficient bar service, sufficientâ€¦
