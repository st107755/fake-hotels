Unfortunately, we were ignore by the concierge when we arrived.  Then the bell hop kept us waiting so we had to ask the front desk to bring our bags up.  Then, they didnt even do that -- after waiting 20 minutes for our bags, my husband found our bags in the middle of the lobby, unattended, and brought them up. On top of that,  my Amex agent told me that we were promised a complimentary dinner at a nearby hotel as part of the package, but they never gave it to us.   We left the hotel inside of two days.....we were promised adjacent or adjoining rooms but were on separate sides of the floor, not even close.
