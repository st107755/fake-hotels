This hotel was the first stop for my wife and I on our honeymoon. The room was a bit tighter than we would have liked but the staff and service were very friendly. We were very happy with its proximity to St. Mark's Square and the ease in walking to many of the main attractions within Venice. The staff was also very help with directions and assisting with any request or question you have.
