A cool and very welcome haven from the bustling streets of Venice.  Take a break from sightseeing and shopping and relax and enjoy a drink and nibbles in this small but charming lounge.  Didn't have the opportunity to stay in this beautiful hotel on this occasion as this was only a day tour, but next time in Venice will definitely put this top of the list.
