My wife and I have just returned from the Metropole hotel after a 4 day break celebrating a special occasion and what a way to celebrate !! Everything from arrival to departure was excellent. The staff could not do enough for you, the location was fantastic and the hotel itself first class. We were upgraded free of charge to a junior suite which was fabulous. We will definitely be returning next year.
