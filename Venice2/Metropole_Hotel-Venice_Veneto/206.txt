My mother and I stayed here for a 3 night stay.  This was a fabulous hotel with old style glamour.  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and made us feel special.  Nothing was too much trouble from making sure we could have an evening meal from the Oriental Bar in time to go to an evening concert to helping us book tickets to the opera.  The meal in the Met restaurant was amazing and again the staff could not have done more to make the meal special.  The rooms were spacious and had all the modern touches without ruining the ambience of the room. The hotel is located about 10 minutes walk from St Marks Square making Venice so accessible.  A great location to see Venice. Would recommend this hotel and definitely plan to come back.
