Spent 3 nights at the Metrópole in Sept. Lovely hotel. Although the rooms are small every detail has been taken care off. Enjoyed the antique furnishings throughout the hotel. The staff is incredible...very courteous and professional...You must visit the Bar! Great ambience and good music. Thanks to our porter Egor -very polite and helpful. I would definitely stay at the Metrópole again.
