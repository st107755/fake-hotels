We booked Metropole because of its great location within the city.  It is just steps away from St. Mark's square.  It is a dark hotel but does not lack charm and you are definitely well taken care of.  The breakfast, while expensive if not included with your room, was excellent - especially since you sit in the garden area to eat.
