Arrived by private water taxi which was a nice experience! The hotel is lavishly romantic with plush velvet chairs, silk walls and candles everywhere. We stayed in room 119 on the first floor, the hotel is opposite the ferry dock so therefore a lagoon facing room has the disadvantage of the noise of the ferries which start very early. This aside you are well placed for a base to easily get to many of the must see attractions. There are no tea or coffe making facilities in the room which we found surprising. Breakfast for us was a disappointment, especially when we found fruit flies on the cold meat platter! The staff are very helpful, especially the bar staff in the Oriental Bar where nothing was too much trouble. We would probably not return to this hotel due to its positionâ€¦
