Before reviewing this excellent hotel I wish to bring to the attention of potential visitors to Venice our experience with the private water taxi transfers. We paid £112 each way for these transfers -  from the airport to the hotel service provided equalled that paid for.  However on the return journey we were transferred as part of a group ( not private) and the reason given was that private transfer were suspended between May1 and 10 because of a city ordinance!!! Unbelievable what companies expect the public to believe.  These private transfers can be purchased either at the airport upon arrival or at your hotel for around £80 - represents about 30+% saving!!!! I believe The Metropole represents the luxury of past centuries, for example  wallpaper in the bedroom was replaced…
