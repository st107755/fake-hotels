We booked a balcony room with a view over the lagoon. Large room with sauna, large balcony with table, chairs and a lounge chair. If you take a water taxi from the airport, there's a side canal entrance. Saves dragging luggage over 1 bridge-although this is doable if you're traveling light! Very convenient for the vaporettos- several stations. Easy walking distance to the main square which is very lively into the late hours, and a safe walk back. Michelin star restaurant. Friendly, helpful staff. Highly recommended.
