This hotel is located a few minutes walk from piazza San Marco. Right in front of the canal. Water bus, water taxi and gondolas just in front. The hotel itself is very clean, decor is simply beautiful. The staff is always there to make sure you have everything you need, mind you the service can be a little slow. We had a regular room and were very satisfy with it. Big enough, bathroom was neat and clean and the room itself very well furnished. I have nothing negative to say about this place as we were very pleased. This hotel is pricey, restaurants, drinks, etc. so I wouldn't recommend for those on a budget. But there are lots of places near by where you can eat and drink.
