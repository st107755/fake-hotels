I have stayed here before and the hotel and staff are perfect.The rooms are very comfortable with great products in the bathrooms and everything in the hotel is warm and comfortable.The oriental bar is one of my favourite anywhere.The restaurant is excellent and i have to mention that breakfast was unmissable. Great hotel , staff and management
