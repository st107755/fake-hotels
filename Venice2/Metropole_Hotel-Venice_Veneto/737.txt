Good points.. Very swish hotel that is very conveniently situated near St. Marks square. Staff are very accommodating and helpful. Highly recommend the Oriental Bar for cocktails and free nibbles ( Le Peschiole are a treat.!!)  Very interesting family collections of cork screws,fans & crucifixes on each floor. Lovely garden to spend a warm evening sipping cocktails. We visited Murano and if you stay here you can get free trip by water taxi which saved us €120..!!!!!  Not so good...... We had a nice room overlooking side canal. Room was very warm and air-con did not work. A porter was sent to our room whom informed us the air-con was turned off and he could leave the window open..??? We had breakfast included which was ok but not worth €30 each.!
