Pleasantly surprised by this beautiful hotel.  Close to St. Mark's Square and vaporetto stops.  We had a small but cozy and charming room, nicely appointed and quiet.  The Main Salon is elegant and great bar.  We had a group dinner on the patio which is charming, a little expensive but when youre in Venice everything is expensive.  I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.
