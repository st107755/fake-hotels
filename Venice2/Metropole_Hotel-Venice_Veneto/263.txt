We stayed in a family room in the Hotel Metropole. There were welcome gifts for our kids and a lovely note from the manager upon arrival. Each floor has a different collection of antiques to be explored. The daily breakfast had fantastic selection and wonderful service. The staff set up the same table for our family each morning. The concierge recommended several excellent restaurants for dinner during our stay, as well as a complimentary water taxi right from the hotel to Murano.
