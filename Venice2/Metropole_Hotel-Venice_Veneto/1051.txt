Let me first start by saying that if your going to Venice, it would be a shame to miss out on this lovely, romantic hotel that is only surpassed by its service. It is just steps away from Saint Mark Square and can be accessed directly by the water taxi or you can take the water bus (much cheaper) to a stop that is only a short walk. The Metropole appears to be less than a 4-Star hotel from the outside, however, once you step inside you will immediately know that you've chosen wisely. The antique and silver decor creates a cozy and romantic atmosphere that feels very "Venetian." They also will give you a free boat ride over to Murano, however, you will only get to see one glass factory. You would be better off to go independently if you really want to shop around. Make sure thatâ€¦
