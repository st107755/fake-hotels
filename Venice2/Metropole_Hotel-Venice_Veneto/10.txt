I stayed in this hotel during my trip to Italy this past October. The weather had been seasonally warm, and when I checked into my hotel room, my room temperature was extremely high. I spoke to the hotel receptionist who informed me that the building was too old, ad since they already shut the air conditioner off, there was nothing they could do. I asked them if I could lower the thermostat but they told me that was not an option. For dining options they have a Michelin star restaurant however, when I made the reservation and went there for my dinner, I had to wait 45 minutes just to get a pasta dish. I had to miss my evening engagement even though I asked the server to expedite my order. When I spoke to the manager, he apologized for the service and gave me a free dinner.
