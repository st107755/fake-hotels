This was our second visit to the Metropole, fabulously situated on the main lagoon promenade, 5 minutes only from St Mark's. The Metropole has a 500 year history, an amazing mix of Victorian/Byzantine ambience and good old fashioned service. Thomas Mann stayed here (writing Death in Venice) as well as Proust. In short, it is a classy, atmospheric place, packed full of antiques, rich fabrics and lovely touches like a proper turn down service in the evening.  We chose a de luxe room with a lagoon view: it was not large, but it was perfectly formed. Well, almost! In the marble bathroom with all as it should be and lovely Gilchrist and Soames toiletries etc, the main shower didn't work. We mentioned it to the staff, who said it would be dealt with immediately: but nothing happened.â€¦
