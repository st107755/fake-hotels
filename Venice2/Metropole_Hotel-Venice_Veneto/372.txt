we just stayed here for three nights. the hotel is loaded with old world charm. the staff- from front desk, to restaurant, to bar- were very helpful and professional. it was very clean. the breakfast was fantastic. the bar is so charming. the only drawback for me was the location. i tried to find a hotel not in san marco. this is not there but it is right next to it. too touristy. so crowded. filled with tourists and guys trying to sell you selfie sticks etc.
