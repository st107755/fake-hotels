The Metropole boasts a spectacular location combined with exceptional service. Every aspect of our stay exceeded our expectations. The staff are warm and welcoming. Of all the rooms we enjoyed in Europe, this was the largest. We had a great walk-in closest, sitting area, raised sleeping area and fabulous bathroom completely tiled in mosaic. We also enjoyed the air conditioning - a rare find in parts of Europe! We can't imagine staying in any other hotel in Venice - The Metropole is PERFECT and truly made our visit to Venice unforgettable.
