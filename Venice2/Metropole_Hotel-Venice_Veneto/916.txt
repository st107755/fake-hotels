Just returned from my 4th stay at the Metropole.  Great location and a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are always interesting (check out the Angel Suite), the bar is very welcoming and the breakfast staff a pleasure.  Don't let the nasty bald man at reception turn you off.  All the other reception members are great.
