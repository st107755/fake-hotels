We travel to Venice each year to dine at the Metropoles restaurant.  Usually we take freinds with us- once again we visited recently and were not let down.  We love the food, the walled garden, the staff are unassuming and unintrusive but always helpful.  We have always found this Hotel to be an oasis in a mecca of mayhem and people.  We have stayed in the past and have been more than happy with our stay and service. The staff are always courtious and polite.  Thankyou.
