Just returned from a lovely stay in Venice. The hotel was excellent I found all the staff extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel had lots of charm and character and was situated in a great location . Just a few minutes from st. marks square and bars and restaurants. We also enjoyed a complementary trip to the murano glass company  which we really enjoyed. The room was lovely decorated and had everything we needed. We would love to return to Venice and would definitely stay at the metropole perfect !
