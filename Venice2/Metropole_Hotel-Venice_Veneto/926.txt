Pros: - location (5-10 mins walk to San Marco Sq, and right on the waterfront) - lovely old world charm, and interesting curious throughout the hotel - the tranquil courtyard for breakfast  Cons: - the standard bedroom was a bit small, and the bed was not a double but in fact two singles made-up as a double. The room was however nicely furnished in period style (excluding the LCD tv) - although the hotel is on the lagoon, the bar and restaurant don't have a great outlook (due to small windows) and the lobby area is rather dark.  Tip - if you're taking the waterbus from the airport to the hotel (as the "timetables" don't always run as advertised), it's worth bearing in mind in addition to Arsenale (the stop recommended by the hotel) the hotel is also only a few mins walk from Sanâ€¦
