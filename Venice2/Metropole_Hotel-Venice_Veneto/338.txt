Fabulous staff and very nice room.  We are on the 4th floor with a large terrace.  Lighting in the bathroom is wonderful.  Bathroom is unreal!  Bed is super comfy.  You call for room service and delivery is in 20 minutes or less.  Very quiet.  Lots of storage space for clothes.  The staff is remarkable.  Breakfast was included and very good.  Buffet style.  Beautiful hotel.  In room control of Ac.  This is important for guests in the summer months.  Free boat over to Murano which includes a tour of a fantastic Venetian glass factory.  I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel.  I will never look for a different hotel in Venice.  401 is the best!
