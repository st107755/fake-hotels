Fabulous hotel in a perfect location right on the Grand Canal and a short 5 minute walk from St Marks square. The staff were wonderfully friendly and attentive, the rooms clean, luxurious and very comfortable. We were there over a birthday and had complimentary drinks at the bar and enjoyed relaxing in the oriental style lounge for a couple of hours. I cant find anything to criticise .We would certainly stay here again
