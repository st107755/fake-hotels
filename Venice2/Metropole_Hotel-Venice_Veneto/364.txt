Three friends and I spent 5 wonderful days in Venice- but were very disappointed with the hotel. The initial rooms were very basic, with over-the-top baroque decor, little or no ventilation and very old bathrooms. After complaining, we were upgraded to larger suites, but with the same decor- which did not match the photos on the website. The service was ok- however we found the front desk staff not very helpful with providing tourist information - which turned out in several cases to be wrong. The breakfast was not very interesting although most of the staff was helpful and enthusiastic. Whilst I understand that many hotels in Venice retain the old fashioned baroque style, it may be time for a renovation, as it had the feel of the Addams family house, which did not appeal to us.â€¦
