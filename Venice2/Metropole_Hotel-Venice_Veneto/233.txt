We returned to Metropole for the second time and it is the best five star hotel in Venice! Location is great, right on the grand canal and close to piazza san marco. The hotel has a very stylish and cool ambience with great attention to details (same feeling as Costes in Paris). The owners amazing collections are on display and the service is brilliant. The suites are all gorgeous and the breakfast yummie. The guide michelin star restaurant of the hotel, the Met, is divine and the bar cool! We really love this hotel, so much more original than the traditional luxury hotels, like Danieli. Best hotel in venice! We will soon be back!
