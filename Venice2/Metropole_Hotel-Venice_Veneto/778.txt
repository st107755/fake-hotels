This was the second time we stayed at the Metropole in 21 years and it is even better with time. Senior Bon, the manager, is incredibly helpful and kind.  The rooms are all different and gorgeous, some with balconies, some with garden views.  Staff is so helpful, multi-lingual. Be sure to take a water taxi to their private canal dock.  Two lovely places to eat.  Location is outstanding- near St. Marks square without being too crazy and close to vaporetto stands.  We absolutely loved it and would recommend it again.
