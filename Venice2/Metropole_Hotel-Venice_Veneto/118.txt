This is a beautiful hotel, the decor is eclectic and the staff beyond compare. From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble. We were two ladies of a certain age and did rely on the concierge for concert tickets, water taxis and on line flight booking. Every request was greeted with a real desire to help, all of which made our stay completely stress free. We had a junior suite which was spacious, comfortable and quiet with a very useful dressing room. The only draw back to this hotel is that there are beautiful objects throughout which are very distracting when you are in a hurry. The restaurant was not open in the evenings when we visited so we had to eat in the bar which was not ideal.
