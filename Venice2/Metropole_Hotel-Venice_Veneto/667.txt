We spent an evening in Venice after our cruise and wanted a centrally located hotel that was upscale and capable of offering a special experience! Initially we were met with great service at the front desk. The clerk personally showed us to our room and our bags were delivered quickly. Unfortunately, the room overlooked an alley, the floors were crooked and the bed was only about a foot off the floor. Most disgusting, the pillows were made of some type of rubber material!  We then decided to tour a bit, we came back and having looked around the hotel, we thought it very unique, filled with antiques and a restaurant that seemed to be very welcoming. Apparently, the hotel rates the restaurant highly. We booked supper and thought we would go into the bar for a drink before dinner!â€¦
