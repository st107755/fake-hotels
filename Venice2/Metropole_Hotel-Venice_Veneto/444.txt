My family of four recently stayed at the Hotel Metropole. The service was outstanding, second to none. We had a Junior Suite and our two boys ages 20 and 22 had a double room. A delicious breakfast buffet was included every morning in the garden. What a great way to start each day.   The front desk staff was awesome always ready to help and recommend restaurants and sites as was the wait staff in the bar/lounge.   Location is great---walking distance to all.   I would highly recommend a stay here on your trip to Venice.
