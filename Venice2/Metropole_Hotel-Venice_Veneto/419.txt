The hotel is decorated beautifully, the breakfast is worth every penny and some, the staff at the front desk and the bell boy were more than helpful at all times throughout our stay and housekeeping works hard to keep your room perfectly stocked and clean. A perfect end to a perfect trip. Cant wait to go back!!
