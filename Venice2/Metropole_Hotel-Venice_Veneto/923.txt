We had two nights in Venice at the Metropole Hotel, perfect location, on the water, the view is amazing, the restaurant, fantastic, a perfect place for a cafe or romantic dinner overlooking a beautiful city. The rooms are well done with opulent venetian beds, curtains and modern bathroom in white marble. We were pleasantly surprised with Metropole and will recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice.
