We were only at the Metropole for one night before going on a cruise. We have plans to return to Venice and stay longer at the Metropole again. It was such a unique hotel! Every inch was filled with museum quality items. We enjoyed just walking around and exploring the halls. The room was extremely clean. Its location was right next to St. Mark's Square. We look forward to staying for an extended time when we return!
