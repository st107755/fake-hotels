We had a wonderful experience a couple of years ago in December at this bar. We had the tea service which came with a generous selection of petit fours, olives and other snacks. It wasn't cheap (what is in Venice?), but we felt it was well worth the price. We returned this past week for carnival and hoped to repeat the experience. Mistake. We were told there wasn't any tea service because of a hotel party, so we ordered a tea with a side order of snacks. The tea was excellent. But the snacks consisted of one half of a tramezzini cut into 6 tiiiny pieces and exactly 8 cookies less than one inch in diameter. The cost for the "snacks"? 16 Euros! Even for Venice that felt like a distinct rip-off. Service and atmosphere are lovely.
