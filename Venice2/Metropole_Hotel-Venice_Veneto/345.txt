Certainly an amazing place to stay. Not only has it got an amazing location (very close to San Marcs square ), if a little noisey sometimes as the water bus stop is quite close (benefits to that too!! ), the   hotel has a different theme to each floor and doubles as a bit of a museum. Curious things to discover on each floor and they encourage you to discover.   The hotel also features a Michelin star restaurant. Attention to detail is second to none. Nothing is too much trouble.   If you want a massive, new hotel look elsewhere, but to my mind I wouldn't stop anywhere else.   One thing I would say is becareful when you book, I thought I had booked bed and breakfast but got there to find apparently I hadn't. The breakfasts at the hotel come very expensive. But close by you willâ€¦
