Wonderfully high standards of housekeeping and attention to detail.   Unable to fault anything about the Metropole. Get a good deal with Voyage Privee.  Take the hotel's speedboat to Murano.  Enjoy the Michellin starred restaurant and the hotel's delightful lounges not to mention it's perfect location .  Absolute joy!
