We somehow managed to end up in Room 403 - apparently Lenny Kravitz stayed her one time don't you know?  All I can say is it was a magical room, with a secret rooftop terrace, a steam shower and a view to die for.  The hotel was very proud of its 1 star restaurant but we didn't try it - mainly because there's so much more to see in Venice for so much less.  Pricey is the best description of this particular haunt, but if you can afford it you'll find no better striking out point for the delights that Venice has to offer.  Service was first rate, and the decor transported you back to a time when Venice was the trading centre of the known empire.  If you want to see Venice in style, you can't go wrong with a few nights at Hotel Metropole.
