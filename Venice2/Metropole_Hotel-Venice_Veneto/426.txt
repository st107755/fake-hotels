Arrived at the railway station on the Orient Express and were met by private water taxi which took us to the hotel steps. The hotel was beautiful, full of lovely antique furniture and fabrics. The staff friendly and helpful and the room was fantastic. We had a lovely room with views over the lagoon and the hassle and bustle of the water front. It was quiet, well insulated from the outside sounds at night. Again beautiful fabrics and a very large comfortable clean bed. We ate in the restaurant the first night as part of my birthday treat and had the tasting menu with accompanying wines this was all wonderful and you can see what they have the Mitichlin star status. The breakfasts were great, all you could want was available. All the staff were helpful friendly and made you veryâ€¦
