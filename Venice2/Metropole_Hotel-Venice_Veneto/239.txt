Wow what an unusual hotel! We stayed three nights here on a rainy October weekend. The staff was amazing and our room was upgraded to a junior suite. But the dark red wallpaper  and decor was oppressive. The owners have taken their antique hobby too far and the hotel was jammed with their unusual collections.  We did enjoy the buffet breakfast and wished the weather was better to have enjoyed what looked like an amazing courtyard and gardens.
