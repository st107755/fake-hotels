We had an absolutely wonderful time in Venice over the Christmas holidays and this hotel was a lovely, luxurious base in the heart of the Grand Canal. The bed was super comfortable, and the rooms and hotel are beautifully decorated with the most incredible collection of fine art and antiques. We really loved the Oriental Venetian style. The Oriental Bar with the excellent DJ made the most delicious custom cocktails. The only negatives for us were the small bath and lack of shower pressure, but really not a big deal. I think we might try for a slightly quieter location next time, as although it is really fun to be in the heart of the touristy Grand Canal, it is quite noisy with the ferries coming and going at all hours. Also, the wifi did not work in the room, only in the publicâ€¦
