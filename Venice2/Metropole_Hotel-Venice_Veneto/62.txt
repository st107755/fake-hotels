This hotel has a mystic atmosphere from the very first moment you enter in. All the hotel has a very imaginative decoration, including the rooms. We liked it for its uniqueness. Our room was large enough and exceptionally beautiful decorated. The only pitfall was that it was looking to the small pedestrian road and with another high building close to it, the room in the day (without lights) was gloomy. The garden is really picturesque. The breakfast was simple and fine with us. At the dinner the food was really tasteful and the service was excellent.  In general, the service was very good. It is very well located in the centre of Venice, about 5 minutes walk from St. Mark's square and on the Grand Canal.
