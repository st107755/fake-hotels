We stayed for 3 nights, the rooms were beautiful, the staff were exceptional, and the decor was great, very atmospheric, lots of candles and displays. It is expensive, we had the taster meal, â‚¬440, but it is Michelin star, so you get what you pay for. If you want something special stay here, if you just want a nice weekend in Venice stay further in, there are just as lovely hotels that react on the main drag.
