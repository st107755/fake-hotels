we are staying here now. There is a real old world feel to this place. A little faded but still quite comfortable with high ceilings and very polite and efficient staff. ate at the bar yesterday while waiting for our room to be ready and the staff there were very pleasant. seems to be right in the middle of the touristy area so its easy to walk around and get to things. Our room was not ready when we reached there at noon so we sat around at the bar waiting which could have been total torture since we were so sleepy. nevertheless, the air conditioned bar with the snacks hit the spot and our rooms were ready about an hour and a half later. so far so good.
