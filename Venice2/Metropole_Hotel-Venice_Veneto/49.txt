We had 3 nights in this beautiful hotel.  All the rooms are unique and there are lots of private collections around the hotel belonging to the family that own it.  All the staff were very friendly and took time to remember your name, room number and what you drank for breakfast.  The location for exploring Venice and the islands was perfect. We would definitely stay there again.
