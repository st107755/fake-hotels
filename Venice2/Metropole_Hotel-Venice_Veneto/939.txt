My husband and I spent 7 or 8 nights at the Metropole over Christmas 2008.  We were absolutely delighted with our room, and the accomodation in the hotel. We found the staff consistently helpful when asked. There restaurant recommendations (from someplace very fancy for Christmas eve and Christmas day dinner....to a very simply neighborhood place to get some fresh fish) were right on the mark.  I have one complaint, and one complaint only... and that was during a period when Venice was expected much rain and flooding, when we needed an umbrella we had to purchase one from the hotel -- that was surprising to us from a hotel of this caliber.  Putting that aside, we will likely return to the Metropole for our next stay in Venice.  Oh - almost forgot... internet connections only inâ€¦
