My wife booked this hotel as part of a surprise return visit to Venice and obtained a great rate for our two night stay. We really enjoyed it and hope one day to return. The hotel location is good, a few doors along from the Danieli and a short walk to the Doge's Palace and St Mark's. We arrived by water taxi direct from the airport and were met at a neat little private dock on the canal on one side of the property. The Riva di Schiavoni in front of the hotel is very busy with tourists, even in March, but we discovered if we followed the passageway by the side of the hotel in less than 100 yards we were away from the noise and bustle, and could explore the real Venice in peace.  The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming, upgrading us to a suite, and arranging an excellent tourâ€¦
