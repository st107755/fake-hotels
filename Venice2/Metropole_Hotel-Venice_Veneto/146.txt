I travelled here with my mother in September   This was a very expensive hotel and I feel it was worth the expense if you are looking for something special for a few days  The staff are friendly and helpful and the location is very good - 5 minute walk to st marks and water taxi straight out the front  It is very over the top decorated -perfect for ritzy venice -and very comfortable -my only suggestion  -an iron in the room would be handy for travellers  Overall I would recommend this hotel
