the lobby of this place is amazing...very Eastern motif.  The room was lovely with a canopied bed and a window with a partial view of the water and tiled roofs.  My only complaint was that the TV didn't get any international stations and we were in the midst of some heavy news.  The staff was absolutely lovely and the breakfast was amazing - but it should have been included in the price of the room,  the outdoor dining area was a beautiful, beautiful garden.  But the location was perfecto..
