You can't beat the location.  We were disappointed in the both the cleanliness and need of updating in the room.   If you need a water taxi, walk down to the canal and negotiate your own rate.  We were charged 100 Euro for very brief ride to the cruise ship terminal.  The hotel staff arranged this for us  stating "On Sunday, they only let certain water taxis into the harbor".  The cruise ship staff was shocked when they learned how much we were charged.  We had no idea how close it was and should have walked down and arranged our own rate or taken the public water taxis.   We felt the hotel staff lacked integrity taking advantage of tourists.
