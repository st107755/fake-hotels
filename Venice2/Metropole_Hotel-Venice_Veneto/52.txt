Fantastic location, right on the Grand Canal, opposite the San Giorgio Maggiore church. Reception staff very welcoming. Downstairs reception rooms are very spacious, with a lovely garden at the rear to enjoy cocktails, coffees or a spot of dinner.  Our room on the 2nd floor was a little tired looking compared to the rest of the hotel, but for the amount of time we spent there, it didn't really matter. The area around this hotel is expensive as its the main tourist spot close to St Marks Square, but if you wander down the side streets off the main walk way you can find some decent priced restaurants. Would come back again.
