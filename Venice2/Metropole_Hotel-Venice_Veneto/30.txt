We stayed here for 24 h, got 2 nice rooms. One room had a nice balcony with a view to the water.  The water taxi brings you directly from the airport to the hotel. The hotel has a very nice yard where u can have a drink or have breakfast. From the hotel you can walk to the most touristy areas of the city. The rooms are clean and nice.
