Metropole Hotel in Venice with excellent and very courteous staff service. The garden area was perfect for having a quiet meal and drink. The garden also caters for smokers. The rooms are very comfortable and bigger than what you would expect. Would highly recommend this hotel for a holiday in Venice which is very centrally located.
