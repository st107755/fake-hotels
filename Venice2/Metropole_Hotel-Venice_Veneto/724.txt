Do you like old stuff? Like old gothic lamps, candles, and body armor? The Metropole is floor to ceiling with this stuff, like they used to have 5 hotels and had to downsize into just one.  It's certainly unique, but don't expect luxurious.  The (tiny) rooms and bathrooms haven't been touched or upgraded in at least 40 years.  It is worn down and showing its age.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fun experience and the service was quite friendly.  I just expect more at $550 (pre-tax) per night.
