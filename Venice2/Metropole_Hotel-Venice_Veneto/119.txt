You can reach The Metropole by water bus from the airport (15 Euros per person, tickets can be bought at machines while you're waiting for your luggage to arrive on the carousel).   Get off the water bus at San Zaccaria, then a short walk to the hotel.   Or take a water taxi, which the Hotel will book for you (for 200 Euros).   (If you are in a party of 5 or 6, the water taxi (booked for far less than 200 Euros at the airport) is good value and willl save a lot of time.)   The ground floor is beautifully decorated, with a good bar and a lovely lounge.   Antiques to be admired in every area.      We booked a suite with lagoon view  -  the view was stunning, but the room was more a double than a suite, although it was nicely decorated.   Good supply of toiletries and towels.  â€¦
