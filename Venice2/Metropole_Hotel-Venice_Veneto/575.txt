Fantastic service as always, views fantastic from the room, breakfast was wonderfully enjoyed out on the terrace as we watched Venice wake up.  Breakfast is one of the best we have ever head, beautiful fresh pastries and breads.  Only negative is that the hotel and the rooms are starting to look just a little tired, and dated.  But this will not stop us visiting again, hopefully as part of our honeymoon!
