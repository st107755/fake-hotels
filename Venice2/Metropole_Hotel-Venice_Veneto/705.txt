I've stayed in many hotels in Venice and will return to the Metropole on my next visit.  The most beautiful blend of eclectic and luxury.  The garden oasis in the back is a beautiful escape from the hectic streets of Venice.  The service was top notch! Breakfast buffet was sumptuous and of the highest quality.  Location is central yet you can escape the crowds through the back streets.   Stay here!
