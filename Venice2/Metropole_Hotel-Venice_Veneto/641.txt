I stayed in a junior suite. There was a bedroom area that was open onto a separate seating area with a desk, chairs, small sofa and a larger TV than the very tiny TV that was in the bedroom area. There were windows in the bedroom area and in the sitting area. The room faced a narrow alley so even with the drapes fully open, there wasn't much natural light in the room during the day. On the upside, with the shutters closed, the room was pitch black and perfect for sleeping any time of day.   The bed was firm for my taste but comfortable. The bedding was very high quality with four large down pillows. There were extra blankets in the closet.   The bathroom was huge with a large soaking tub. The shower is above the tub, not a separate stall. The water pressure was good and hotâ€¦
