There are some good things about this hotel which I will mention in fairness. But I must start with an explanation of the low rating. it is based on how they handled the fact that we left two days earlier than planned. We originally booked for eight nights through American Express but a month ago decided to leave two days early to travel to Florence. I have no idea whether American Express failed to make the adjustment (who knew we changed our plans because we booked the Florence hotel through them and obviously can't be in two hotels in two different cities at the same time) or whether there was confusion on the hotel end. The cancellation policy for this hotel is 48 hours prior to arrival.  I guess this gets us to the existential question of the meaning of the wordâ€¦
