If I could I would give this hotel 10 stars.  The staff was amazing from the minute you walked into the hotel.  They remembered your room # every time you came to the desk.  Its location was close to the Doges Palace and St Marks Square.  The hotel was quaint and gorgeous.  It had so much original character. I wish we spent more than 3 nights there.  Ir was just lovely.  Breakfast buffet nice as well.
