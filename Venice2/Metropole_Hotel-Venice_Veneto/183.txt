We stopped here for the night while on a cruise and were not disappointed.  The rooms are appointed old Venice style, but cool and sheik. Not an inexpensive room (at over 500+ Euro), but being right on the waterfront and close to everything (as most are in Venice) was perfect for us for the night.  The food was good downstairs and the bar service was great too.  Indulging a night here and there it felt romantic and like going back in time.  It was very cool for us to enjoy, however short.
