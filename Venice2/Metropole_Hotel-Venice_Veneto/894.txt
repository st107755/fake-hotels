The hotel is in an excellent location, within a few blocks from San Marco square and right of the water bus lines making it easy to get to the hotel without having to hall luggage around. The room we stayed in was very nice. It had its own balcony with great views of the lagoon and canals of Venice. The bathroom was up to date and modern. The room was very spacious for European hotels, but could of used some updating. We used points to stay here, so I am not sure if it was worth the $500 a night pricetag that would have been the rate. Best thing about this hotel was location - could easily walk everywhere and for getting around, you can't beat being so close to the water bus lines.   My only negative here would be the staff. When we checked in, they had two reservations for us.â€¦
