Jump on a water taxi from the train station and head down the Grand Canal.  You will end up at the door to the Metropole with a very good staff waiting to help you.  We loved the location and the benches out in front on the Canal.  The desk help was very nice and accomodating.  Our first room wreaked of cigarette smoke and they kindly put us in a junior suite.  Although we really didn't spend much time in our room, it was fabulous!
