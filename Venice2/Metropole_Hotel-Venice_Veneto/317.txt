We stayed her for our first child free break ever! It was stunning. Venice itself is beautiful and this hotel was not a disappointment.   The staff are wonderful and so helpful, the rooms are lovely and quite big considering its Venice! We ate at the MET one evening and it was fantastic, especially Matteo who made sure our experience in a Michelin star restaurant was a great one!   Our room was a little late at check in and as means of apology they sent a bottle of sparking wine to the room :-)   All in all a beautiful hotel, fab central location and lovely staff! Would definitely visit again.
