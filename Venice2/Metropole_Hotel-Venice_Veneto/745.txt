This is a delightful hotel just along the waterfront from St Marks, filled with an eclectic selection of fans, bookends, corkscrews and other collectibles. The service was impeccable - none of the smug superiority of some top end hotels, just courteous, considerate and perfectly professional. Nothing was too much trouble, nobody minded that we lingered over breakfast or wanted drinks from the bar late into the night. We had an excellent off season deal booked directly from the hotel website that included breakfast, which is normally not included. Do treat yourself, it really is worth it!
