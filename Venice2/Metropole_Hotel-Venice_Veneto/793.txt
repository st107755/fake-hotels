We stayed at the Metropole for 3 nights July 18th - 21st July.  First impressions of the hotel is that it has a very Gothic feel to it which was refreshing.  The staff were all friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble for them.  The food was lovely and the breakfast catered for your every wish.  I would definately stay here again!!
