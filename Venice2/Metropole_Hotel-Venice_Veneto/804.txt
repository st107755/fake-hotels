The Hotel is nicely located and the reception areas are very well decorated. We had to take a water taxi from the Train station that cost about 60 Euros, but we arrived easily. The room was "TINY" with no space to move. The hotel did not provide tea or coffee making facilities. Upon asking the staff they appeared not to understand what a kettle was! We felt it was a bit much. In the city of romance, we found our bed to be two single beds joined together! This was disappointing.  The ambience of the hotel is great, but we were happy to be there only for one night. It was definitely not good value for money and should not be considered unless you have no other options.
