Really pleasant hotel, staff could not be nicer, breakfast excellent and staff always smiling and helpful, coffee amazing .  Did have dinner at the 1 star Michelin restaurant, and I should have taken notice of the reviews I had read, 600 Euros for 4 of us, we did have bubbly though, food was nice but not wonderful and went away hungry.   Location of the hotel was great, just a short walk from St Marks Square.  We had a lagoon view junior suite, ours was on the top floor and I think the floor was quite new, our room was quite beautiful, done in lacquered wood like a luxury boat.  The hotel arranged pick up from airport, taxi onto limo boat then to hotel, what a way to arrive.  Would definitely suggest anyone to stay there.
