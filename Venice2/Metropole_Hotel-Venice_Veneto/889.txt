For the most part, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel, just not Venice in particular but that is outside the scope of this review. We arrived in Venice via plane, and then took a water taxi to our hotel.  It was raining, but lucky for us, our arrival was painless as the hotel was right on the grand canal and there was actually a dock that got us directly to our hotel.  The hotel is very grand, with the lobby and common areas on the main floor creating almost a museum like display with all the antiques and artifacts.  It was definately an older style hotel, so if you are into modern this is probably not the hotel for you, although the garden in the back is beatiful and serene, which is rare to find in Venice, especially along the grand canal! The rooms were a good size, for Veniceâ€¦
