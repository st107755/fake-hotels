Stayed here for three nights. Visually stunning with a museum like feel on all floors. The staff are excellent. Close to St Marks Basilica and the Doge Palace ( 10 minutes away) Expensive to eat at €35 each for breakfast and €165 each for evening meal - but by the time you have walked around at breakfast to find somewhere you may as well pay it and start the day. Would go back there again.
