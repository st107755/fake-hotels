Let me say up front that this is a very expensive and elegant hotel.  We, however, had an unpleasant experience.  We were there in the middle of September and the weather was unseasonably warm.  The central AC had been turned on so we were had no choice but to open the windows because the room was terribly warm.  Consequently we fought mosquitos all night and when we reported this to the front desk we were told there were no mosquitos in Venice; well something left huge welts over me not to mention kept me awake all night.  No mosquitos in a hotel surrounded by water in warm weather?  So we got no satisfaction from management who just wouldn't believe that we had mosquitos in our room.  Thank goodness we were only there two nights because I didn't sleep at all and had at least 6â€¦
