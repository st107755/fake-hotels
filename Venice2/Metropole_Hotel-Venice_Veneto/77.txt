WOW, what a GREAT bar, the Oriental Bar!  On our first night in Venice we walked past the Metropole hotel and I knew we needed to go to this bar!  It did not disappoint!  We went every night, that we were in Venice, for a nightcap!  Angelo, the bartender, storyteller & historian extraordinaire was the best!  He made everyone feel like family & friends, I canâ€™t recall  a time or place where I received better service (and drinks)!  Angelo is a gem, I wish he was in New Jersey!!!!    This is a NOT TO MISS while in Venice!  Thanks Angelo!
