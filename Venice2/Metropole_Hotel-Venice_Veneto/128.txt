Stayed for over a week after running the Venice Marathon. The concierge service was excellent. Concierge desk made all the reservations for restaurants and replied to my email promptly. Room Service is implacable with an evening turn down service and a supply of fresh towels and toiletries. Our room has the view of the Grand Canal and it was a treat to wake up in the morning and open the window to see all the boats coming in. The front of the hotel is always busy and packed with day trippers. I will stay at Metropole again in a heart beat for their excellent service. There is a piazza behind the hotel, where there are 2 excellent coffee shops with fresh baked pastry all day. It is an interesting piazza as there is a small church where Antonio Vivaldi was baptized and buried.
