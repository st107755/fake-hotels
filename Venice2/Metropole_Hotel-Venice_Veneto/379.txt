This hotel formed part of our anniversary celebrations. A beautiful hotel, fabulous location and a great breakfast. Initial room, whilst charming, was very small so paid for an upgrade which was no problem to the staff and the room was super. One small disappointment was my surprise that as soon as the bill was paid there seemed to be an immediate level of disinterest from staff even though we were still in the hotel and paying for refreshments. Didn't feel quite so special...
