The hotel is overlooking the canal and a few minutes walk away from San Marco Bascilica.  It’s well maintained with updated rooms and amenities.  The decor is a little dark and heavy for my taste, but nevertheless clean with excellent service and breakfast.  They require you leave your key at the front desk when you’re out of your room.   I’ve stayed at a few other hotels in Venice and this is one I would probably recommend.
