My family an I stayed at this property in March and what a cool little hotel!!! Has a very old school, antique feel to it, but also so very clean and homey!! Staff are all super friendly and very helpful. They gave us great restaurant recomendations every night!!! The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was a little small, but not a big problem. There was no air conditioning in the hotel when we were there, but it was not that big of a deal because there was a nice breeze at night. Breakfast buffet was nice, but limited. (Not like an American breakfast buffet) The bar was very quaint and the drinks were excellent. The location of the hotel was perfect. Short walk to St. Mark's Square and right on the water near the beginning of the Grand Canal. Wouldâ€¦
