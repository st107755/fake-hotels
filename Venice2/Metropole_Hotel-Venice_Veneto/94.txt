We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Metropole. The hotel is in a very convenient location (within walking distance to everything), and the staff is wonderful!   I accidentally left clothing in the closet and they sent it immediately overnight to my hotel in Florence, which we really appreciated.  Venice is not known for the best service, but this hotel will make you very happy you stayed there. They give Venice a wonderful reputation and we would stay again when we return.  Highly recommend!
