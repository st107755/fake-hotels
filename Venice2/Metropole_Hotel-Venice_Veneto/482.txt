The room was beautifully appointed and extremely quiet. We were in the garden annexe and passing through the garden to and from our room to the main hotel building was lovely. The hotel has fascinating museum quality collections on display and is a little world of its own within Venice. The staff were extremely professional and very warm and helpful.
