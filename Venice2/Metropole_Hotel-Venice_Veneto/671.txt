OK, it's Venice.  If you are not ready to splurge, and will get an ulcer over $150 gondola rides or $25 beers, go somewhere else.  But if you want the magic of Venice, and don't mind a splurge, this hotel is a great option.  Great location on Grand Canal and a short walk to Piazza San Marco.  Building dates to the 1300s and is filled with collections of interesting antiques.  Rooms are modernized and comfortable.  You will need a water taxi to arrive or leave for the airport, unless you don't mind hauling your luggage up and down several bridges.  We skipped out on the ridiculously priced meals and always ate elsewhere.  Hotel will give you a free water taxi to Murano or Burano but expect to be taken to an expensive glass factory for a tour.
