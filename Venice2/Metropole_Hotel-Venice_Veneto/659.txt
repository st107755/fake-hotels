A nice place with lush fin de siecle decoration, where you could meet Oscar Wilde sipping his absinthe - if he was still living. The bathrooms are clean and inviting. The only problem of the place is, that it is close to a busy boat pier, where day tourists debark in the morning. You should avoid the rooms with lagoon view if you want to sleep with open window. Go to Gritti Palace if you want lagoon plus silence. The room prices are hefty - be sure you raise your credit card limit when you have a longer stay. Otherwise you will be washing dishes in the kitchen for a couple of years.
