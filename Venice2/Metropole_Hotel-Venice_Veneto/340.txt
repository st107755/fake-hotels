We were very impressed with the location of the hotel close to St Marks Square. The water taxi and water bus stops are right outside the front of the hotel. The hotel itself is a beautiful building with lovely rooms if not a little hot. The air con seems a little weak. We loved the hotel decor and all rooms are decorated tastefully and individually. The staff are very helpful and informative. Thank you to Bruno who pours a mean martini that you won't be able to put down. Venice has to be the most expensive area in Europe but it was worth every cent.
