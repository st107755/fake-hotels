We enjoyed a three night stay in this Baroque style, comfortable hotel just a 5 min walk from St Marks Sq. It has its own dock, ideal for a water taxi direct from the airport (110 euros) The food is good but be prepared to pay 100 euro a head for this Michelin Star restaurant. Service a little slow but very charming and helpful staff- one of the features of this lovely hotel. The decor is stylish and a little opulent, comfortable rooms but lacking complimentary water and tea and coffee making facilities which is disappointing.
