Easy to access, on the grand canal with only one bridge to cross from the vaporetto stop. Venetian style decor with beautiful bar, outdoor area, restaurant.  Nice bathroom. Pretty pricey, particularly for a room on the canal and for breakfast. Fairly far from the main attractions though so keep that in mind.
