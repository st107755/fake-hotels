My wife and I stayed in this hotel on our last visit to Venice, three years ago. We returned because it was, and remains, one of the best hotels we have ever come across. And we have stayed in five star luxury hotels across the world. The rooms are beautiful, the location is central, the service is impeccable. What is more, it's significantly less expensive than the hugely overrated Danieli and Cipriani. This is the best place to stay in Venice. It's not cheap, but then quality never is. And it's extraordinary value for money.
