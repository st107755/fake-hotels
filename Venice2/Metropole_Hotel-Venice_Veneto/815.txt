We stayed here for the night before we cruised from Venice and it was a great start to our holiday. The hotel was chosen and booked by our cruise company, Azamara, so we didn't know what to expect. It was very exciting arriving by water taxi. We were given a lovely room right in the front of the hotel (by the flags!) with a beautiful view of the water. We loved watching the boats and ships of every size and shape passing by.  Then we were just unpacking when a bottle of champagne and an anniversary card were delivered to our room.  It was such a welcoming gesture which we really appreciated!  We had our dinner in the pretty garden at the back of the hotel which was delicious.  Breakfast was also enjoyed in the sunshine in the garden and there was a great choice on the breakfastâ€¦
