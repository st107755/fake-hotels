I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent at this hotel. I could not fault the staff, who were most helpful from the moment I arrived off the water taxi, to the moment I left again for the airport.  Breakfast in the garden settting was a delight. The breakfast room was also beautiful.  The hotel is ideally situated for exploring Venice. Great hospitality, superbly decorated, and another real treat is the displays of antiques and other collected items which are on display throughout the hotel.  Definitely my first choice of stay when I am in Venice.
