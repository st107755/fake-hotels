We stayed at the Metropole for 2 nights over the weekend. The whole experience was fantastic. All of the staff we dealt with were excellent, very friendly and efficient. In fact, all of the people we met were great. Our room was brilliant, very Venice. The hotel was in a great location, 5 minutes from St Marks Square. Venice was lovely, we thoroughly enjoyed it and I would certainly recommend it to others.
