The staff, each and every one of them, made this such a positive experience for us.  They were so friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  The breakfast was amazing as was the location.  As with many European hotels, the rooms are small but very clean.  We stayed for two nights before embarking on a cruise in early October.  We would stay there again mainly because the staff were so wonderful.
