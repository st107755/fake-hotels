Loved it! Fab hotel, quirky, decadent, moody, gothic, Venetian all rolled into one! One of a kind, the hidden garden is just beautiful. We used to have a nightcap out there, so peaceful. Our room was small but perfectly formed, very clean and the bathroom was very modern. I would and have highly recommended. The staff were excellent and couldnâ€™t do enough for you. Wish I was there now....
