In  my many visits to venice , I've been in several hotels , including 5 stars ones , but this time I found a new one , very close to S.Marco Square , and was given a beautiful junior suite with a terrace overlooking the lagoon and the roofs of old Venice .  Excellent service , very fast , and unforgettable restaurant with unique menu .
