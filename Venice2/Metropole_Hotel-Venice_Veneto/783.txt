we just got back from a four day trip which turned into twelve days as my mother in law fell in st marcs sq and broke her arm and pelvis. all the staff were so kind to us it was like having your family with you despite axa the insurance co messing the hotel around they still sorted everything out for us and made our stay as stress free as possible even the hotel owner come to see us and reasured us. the location is great the breakfast lovely and the room was spotless and comfortable I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and would recomend it to anyone.
