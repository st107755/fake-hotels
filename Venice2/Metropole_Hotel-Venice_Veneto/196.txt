Air conditioning is turned on by hotel at their discretion. They base it on outside temperature.  While this may be ok for rooms  on lower levels, it allows for rooms on higher floors to turn into saunas. You can sleep with your window open and let mosquitoes join you for the night or accept a dusty oscillating fan as the upgrade to what is a $700 per night attic room. The hotel Danieli is just steps away from this location. I have no doubt that it would have been the better choice. Luckily I have a chance to do it right next time as I visit Venice often, but if this is to be a special visit for other travelers, I would stay elsewhere.
