I'm writing this review as we're still staying here just so I can try to evoke the FEELING of this incredible hotel...although you really cannot call it a hotel. It's more like going back in time, traveling by gondolas and staying in one's own luxurious private palazzo.   The atmosphere is beyond romantic with literally thousands of antiques, candles and crystal chandeliers. Our room overlooks the Grand Canal and we can hear the piano from the lobby. The Metropole is as seductive and enchanting as Venice itself on a foggy, winter afternoon.
