Our stay at the Metropole was fabulous and perfection.  We mentioned that we were having a vow renewal while we were there on the reservation, and were greeted with a bottle of Prosecco!  We requested a junior suite, and were given room 403.  It is a fabulous room!  It has a rooftop terrace!  The room is decorated like a yacht cabin.  The service is impeccable.  Every time we left the room they would give new towels and empty the trash!  The breakfast is delicious and served in a beautiful room.  The location is perfect and convenient.  It would break my hear if I have to go back to Venice and can't stay at the Metropole again!
