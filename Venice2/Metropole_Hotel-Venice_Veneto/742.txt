We stayed at  the Metropole four nights over Easter, having chosen it for its proximity to all the main sites for which Venice is famous for.  If you are planning to stay there and are flying in to Marco Polo take a vaporeto water taxi and it will drop you off within one bridge of the hotel.  The outside of the hotel looks very modest, but as soon as you step inside it is as if you in another world, another time. This is not for those who like modern, minimalist styles as this hotel is from a bygone age, oozing charm, abounds with wood paneling, chandeliers, rich tapestries and curtains, and sofas everywhere. There are antique collections of hand held fans, furniture, and other bric a brac that belong to the owners and are on permanent display throughout the hotel on every floorâ€¦
