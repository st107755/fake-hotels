Nice hotel. Stayed there for 1 night prior to a cruise. The room was very spacious and a great location.. The hotel is not inexpensive but be aware of their breakfast. Their breakfast is very expensive and not included. The 1 thing that we found annoying is that we had a 1pm check out and we got back to the hotel at 10 minutes after 1 and we were met by the manger who escorted us to our rooms where we found that they had packed our bags and they were in the hall outside our room. I have never had that happen anywhere else. I would not go back there again because of that.
