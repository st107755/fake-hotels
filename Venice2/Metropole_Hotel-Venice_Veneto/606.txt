Convenient to St. Mark's Basillica & The Palace, Metropole was a wonderful place to stay in Venice. Each room is uniquely decorated with beautiful antiques with updated modern bathroms. Lower rooms have noise from lagoon but I found it uniquely Venice. The garden patio dining was very pleasant & our room was very comfortable. Although we stayed only one night I could easily return.
