Old world quirky hotel with old world rooms and bathrooms. Very good quiet breakfast and tasteful dinner.  Front desk staff somewhat pretentious and condescending, perhaps it was because we were with a small tour group which covered all gratuities and staff thought we would most likely not be returning.  If and when we do return to Venice, it will not be to this hotel.  Pro – proximity to St. Mark’s Square.  Con – proximity to St. Mark’s Square. For us proximity to St. Mark's Square and cruise ship crowds was a con.
