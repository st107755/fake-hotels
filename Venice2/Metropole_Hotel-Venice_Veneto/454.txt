Very good location. Very nice hotel. The room that was given to me was nice and Confortable. The service was friendly and efficient. The breakfast is a masterpiece served and the beautiful garden small and ellagant. The very famous and highly rated restaurant servs dinner and lunch but I skip it this visit and focused on casuale places. The bar is nice and very professional.
