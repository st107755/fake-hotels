I booked three nights at the Metropole in Venice to celebrate my husband's birthday. Our stay could not have been better. The staff at the Metropole from the lady who changed our sheets to the front desk staff to the restaurant and bar managers were extremely professional, helpful and friendly. We celebrated my husband's birthday in the Met Restaurant, and enjoyed great service, great food and great wine. We were surprised before dinner with Prosecco and after with a plate of petit fours and candle to celebrate the birthday. We could not recommend this hotel more highly.
