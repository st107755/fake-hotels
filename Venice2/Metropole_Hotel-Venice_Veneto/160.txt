Old historical building with romance decorations. I liked this type of decoration  Most of the loopy and reception area decorated with red velvet even the walls Rooms are nice but very small Location is very nice in the main tourist area , lots of restaurants around you Wifi was really bad. Weak signal  The reception were nice and friendly
