My first trip to Venice was indeed memorable and hotel metropole enhanced this experience.  The location could not be beat...walk through the front doors and you are right in the thick of everything, steps away from the san zacharria vaporetto stop, 5 or less minutes from st mark's square.  The decor was certainly a first for me and maybe a bit too dark for my taste.  The room was extremely spacious as well as the bathroom.  My major complaint is that the bed was too hard...as i traveled throughout italy for two weeks though i realized that this might have been a trait of italian beds....  Breakfast was hearty, tasty and full of variety.  The guys at the front desk were both very helpful and friendly.  i would stay here again.
