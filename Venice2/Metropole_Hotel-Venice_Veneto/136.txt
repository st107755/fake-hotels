The city .of Venice is history on steroids.This hotel is part of that history and charm I have never experienced.Quality of service,location and amenities is amazing.Rooms are well decorated with modern conviences.Located in the middle of the action and A1 staffing.I will return and this hotel was one of the reasons why!
