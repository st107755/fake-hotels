Just returned from 3 nights in Venice. It was my first visit and I was with a group of friends.  The location is great, very close to all the popular sights and right opposite the  vaporetta stop. I really cannot fault this hotel, the room, though not large was extremely comfortable with all the amenities would expect from a hotel of this standard. The staff were terrific, all of them that we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel and if I am lucky enough to return to Venice in the furture, this is where I will stay.
