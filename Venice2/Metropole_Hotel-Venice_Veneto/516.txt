What a lovely hotel. A bit quirky with lots of collections of a whole variety of stuff from locks, fans, bedsteads, corkscrews... You name it, they collected it. However, this adds to it's charm, something to look at in every corner. Service was exceptional and made no problem of switching our room for one that had a shower rather than a bath. Has a Michelin star restaurant which we didn't try because it was pricey and there are lots of restaurants around to tempt. Great location and handy for the vaporetta stop so no lugging of suitcases across the canal bridges!
