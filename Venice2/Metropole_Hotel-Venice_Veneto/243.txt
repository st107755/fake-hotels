Stayed in this hotel for a long weekend. We had a room decorated in fabulous old furniture whilst our friends had a room next door that was more modern, each room seems to be unique and a lot of care has been put into the decor. The hotel is ideally situated on the front by the lagoon and is a few minutes walk to St Marks Square. The staff were all really friendly and when we had to stop an extra night due to our flight being cancelled they couldn't have been more helpful. The breakfast was really good but we didn't use the restaurant so can't comment on that. Would definitely recommend this hotel
