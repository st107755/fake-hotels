A hotel which exudes old world charm with enough modern amenities to satisfy the modern traveller.  The bar makes a great launch pad for planning the days activities or to unwind after a full day of Venice's sights.  The staff was friendly and helpful in everything from arranging tours to booking restaurant reservations.  The location can't be beat and being able to ride a Motoscafi straight from the airport is priceless.
