Tried the tasting menu with another couple at the one star restaurant in the Metropole last weekend. It was all a bit weird, and hard to understand the 1 star status.  Things  went sideways from the start with an introduction to the water menu. OK, so we could choose from different fizz or still varieties , fair enough. Having gone wild for the San Pellegrino, it took forever to show up. Those who ordered a beer  were well onto finishing their drinks and the  amuse bouche before we saw any agua. No big deal, but a sloppy start. As for the amuse bouche, three selections arrived, for a party of four. We asked gently for a fourth, no response. Again, not a big deal, this is a bonus dish and not yet the real event.  Then we had the salt selection - now you are pulling my leg.â€¦
