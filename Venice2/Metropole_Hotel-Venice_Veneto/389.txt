We've been staying at this hotel once or twice a year for 15 years; and every time I fall in love with this hotel more and more. Very convenient place- so close to San Marco with a vaporetto stop just in front, so nice Oriental bar, decorated with antiques and venetian style  charm surrounded by a mystic smell, amazing breakfast, awesome staff, Venetion-style rooms with very modern bathrooms; can not imagine how beautiful and fascinating this hotel is unless you see and feel yourself.
