Not the most expensive luxury hotel in Venice but the best by a long way. After short but exciting trip from the airport via speedboat with arrived at The Metropole's private mooring, once we stepped inside we realised that it was something special. The decor is a mix of oriental and old world Italian. We had a room on the second floor over looking the lagoon. Service was first class, cleanliness was first class  A short walk turning right to St Marks Square turn left to discover real Venice and find some lovely restaurants and bars away from the very pricey St Marks area. Best visit the tourist places early before the cruise liners come in about 10.30 when the whols St Marks area becomes a bun fight!
