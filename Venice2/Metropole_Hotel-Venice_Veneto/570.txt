This lovely hotel is perfectly located on the water and just a short walk to St. Mark's and the Doges Palace.  The staff was eager to please and always willing to help with any question.  Our room was small but beautifully decorated, and the eclectic collections on display in the common areas were fun to look at as we passed by.  The view out our window was the wall across the way, but we did not mind because we were out enjoying Venice all day.  The relatively low cost of our small and view less room made this beautiful hotel affordable for us,  and we loved it and Venice so much we will certainly be back.
