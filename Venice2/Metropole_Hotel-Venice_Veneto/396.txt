My experience with metropole started earlier than i checked in, i've been in contact with hotel staff on room preferences and logistics and it was quite efficient. Check in was easy, reception staff was almost perfect and direct access from side canal was quite appreciated. Rooms are very large for Europe and decorated in a style you would expect in venice.
