We just spent two  glorious days in the enchanting city of Venice after the extremely difficult lockdown in Italy, and what a dream  it was! And what better place to stay than the elegant and oh so Venetion Metropole Hotel!! The location could not be better, just a stone's throw from San Marco and in walking distane to many of the city's conic sights. The hotel  itself is impeccable, clean and just oozes with Venetian charm. The beds are super comfy and you feel pampered from the minute you arrive. The staff was attentive to our every need. We stayed in the luscious Prestige room, overlooking a beautiful and peaceful garden, and breakfast was top notch for its service and for the selection of delicacies on offer, both sweet and savoury. Make your next trip to Venice even more memorable by staying at this stunning hotel... you will not regret it!â€¦
