We stood at the hotel for 4 day in March 2007 prior to the invasion of tourists into Venice. The location, about 500 m away from the Markus square is excellent. Staff was friendly and the room despite it needed minor painting was very clean. Every day new towels and sheets. At all we were very satisfied. However, check the bill for the minibar carefully because not all was clear. Transport from the airport by watertaxi costs 90 € at that time and the transport lasts about 20 min. If you are at least 4 persons it is worth to consider this kind of transit because the airport waterbus costs 13 €/person and transportation time is at least 1 h.
