The Metropole is a first class, luxurious Venice experience. Service is outstanding with great attention to detail. We stayed 2 nights in a junior suite and enjoyed the size of the room and bathroom and the lovely extra touches - the turn down service, lovely bathroom amenities, welcome letter and surprise bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary, complementary transport to Murano and the gorgeous breakfast. The hotel is perfectly located on the grand canal with water taxi access in the small canal on the side of the hotel. We would definitely stay here again.
