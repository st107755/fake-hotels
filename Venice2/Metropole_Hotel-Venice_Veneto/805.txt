We have never before been to Venice and took a chance booking into the Hotel Metropole after reading Internet reviews. We have loved our three days here and are sad to be leaving tomorrow. The restaurant has a Michelin star, we discovered, and is very well situated. The staff are helpful and speak reasonable English. Breakfasts are excellent. St. Mark's square is just around the corner. We have enjoyed watching the madding crowd outside from the cool of the bar/casual restaurant.
