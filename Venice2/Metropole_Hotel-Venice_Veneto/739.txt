Room was small and dated,bathroom was small and taps were not working properly bathroom door would shut properly we had a very bad view it was the side of the building so please request for a view. Rooms were too hot AC was not good at all, you have to pay for water from the minibar and it is very expensive. Breakfast was very expensive and noting special usually hotel breakfast so not worth paying for. Staff do not speak much English so it was very hard to communicate. Inside of the hotel very dark but nice deco. But a very good location close to all the lovely places loved the walk the boat cruise venice is absolutely beautiful. Lots of tourists so very busy loads of food places overall it was lovely hotel did let us down as we wasn't comfortable in the room.
