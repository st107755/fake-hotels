The hotel was very much in line with the reviews and photos I have observed prior to our booking. This is a nice hotel situated in a great location. It is close to St. Mark's Square and the water taxi station. The service was great, the room was charming, turn down service each evening and we had a nice view of the canal. The breakfast buffet was also the best out of the three hotels we stayed at during our week in Italy.
