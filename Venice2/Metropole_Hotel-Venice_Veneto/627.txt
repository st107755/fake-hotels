From the moment our water taxi arrived at the canal entrance we stepped into what must be one of the most opulent hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff were fantastic , smartly dressed and the service they provided was second to none. The living room is decorated in rich red with comfortable soft furnishings and dishes scattered around which held spices adding to the warmth of the surroundings. The antique mirrored ceiling finished the amazing effect. The hotel has its own music manager who compiles music for the time of day and the location. This is an added bonus as his compilations fitted in perfectly for the surroundings. His choice of chill music was brilliant , most of which I had never heard before. I was so impressed I got talking to him and he very kindly made me a CDâ€¦
