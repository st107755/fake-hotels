This is a fantastic hotel located in the heart of Venice steps away from the Piazza San Marco and the Grand Canal. Like many Venetian buildings what lies behind the facade is more beautiful than the outside might indicate. This place has history and ambience to spare. Vivaldi taught lessons here! The concierge staff never failed to recommend excellent restaurants. The rooms were quite large and the heated floors in the bathroom were heaven in late December when we visited. The breakfast room served an excellent meal. I can't say enough about this place. If I go back to Venice I will certainly stay here!
