I was not sure what to expect when we arrived by private taxi at the Met, to be honest I was already delirious with happiness that it might not have mattered... but Venice started as it meant to go on, blowing me away by not only meeting but exceeding my expectations.   The Met is old fashioned but in a good way! The staff are attentive, knowledgeable, helpful and all round just plain wonderful! We usually stay in trendy modern boutique hotels and this time i so glad we did not.   In a five week holiday I can honestly say my best night's sleep was here at The Metropole. Also, do not miss out on eating at their restaurant, the Met - again it was a wonderful magical experience that I want to repeat! In fact I came away with a brand new recipe to try that to my shame I have not yetâ€¦
