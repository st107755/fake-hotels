Location location location, front desk staff was awesome!!!  Gardens in the back are just beautiful - and food is to die for.  Don't look elsewhere   Rooms are standard European rooms, nice details and good bathroom by Venice standards.  Remember, this city is old and modern amenities are harder to come by.
