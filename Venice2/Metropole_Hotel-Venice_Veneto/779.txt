The Metropole Hotel is well situated in Venice. It is close to the main square, St. Marks, as well as shopping and great restaurants,  but far enough away from the crowds so that you don't feel overwhelmed. The desk staff were friendly and very helpful, the room was very comfortable and the bar and restaurant were outstanding. I'd highly recommend this lovely hotel.
