I have just returned from a week's stay at The Metropole Hotel. I took my mum for a week away and what a gem we found. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. There are plenty of antiques scattered around. It's got tons of character & is so elegant. The staff are amazing. I can't praise this hotel enough. Our room which was 153 was so lovely overlooking the garden area. Fabulous drop off by private water taxi right outside the hotel. We went to the opera to see Madame Butterfly & the hotel organised a private water taxi to take us there & bring us back. The restaurant is exquisite, food is amazing & staff were fabulous in what they recommended to us. It's expensive but well worth it. The Oriental Bar is really good too. Food excellent & once again staff fab. The hotel is really closeâ€¦
