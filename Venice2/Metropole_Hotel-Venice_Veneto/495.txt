Arrived at the Metropole by private speed boat which is definitely recommended and first sighting of the hotel left me wandering if we had made the right choice for our wedding anniversary but from the first step of the boat to the last when leaving the staff were beyond expectations in all departments.  We were offered a choice of room and served with a bottle of complimentary prosecco. The room was freshly decorated and the ensuite was all new, I stood under that lovely shower for what seemed like hours. Ours was a side room 127 on the first floor which we picked instead of the one over looking the side canal it was quiet enough, though i could hear music on couple of evenings but not loud enough to be a nuisance or disturb sleep.The room did not have a very good view being onâ€¦
