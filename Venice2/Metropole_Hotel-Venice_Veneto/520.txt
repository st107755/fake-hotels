The hotel is nice. The restaurant (Michelin starred) served the WORST food my wife and I have ever eaten. We have just returned from our first trip to Venice. Fantastic. Wedding Anniversary. Special. Everything about the weekend was great except the meal. It was awful. Very very expensive. Every course was revolting. Didn't need any teeth to eat the meal. Every course was pureed i.e. texture poor and colour bland.. Main course 1 prawn, 1 scallop in "breadcrumbs" - like eating dry sand, and squid (which we love) was spectacularly the most awful thing I have ever started to eat. We had the tasting menu and tasting fine wines as recommended. Big mistake. The head waiter was aware of our discomfort but happy to charge the full price. Michelin have a lot to answer for here.
