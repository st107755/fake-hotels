We decided to treat ourselves to long weekend and after searching for the right hotel we came across the Metropole. We were not disappointed. From meeting us at the dock and showing us to our fantastic room with a great view over the lagoon, we knew we had made the right choice. The concierge was very helpful in organising a lovely canal tour on our first evening there and then again arranging our visit to Murano and Burano. All in all trip we will not forget and this hotel helped make it so.
