This is a great hotel with a lot of history.  The service is impeccable. Everyone is there to help you navigate to what ever it is that you want or need. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because there were no water bottles in the room. In our travels across Europe, every other hotel left us a bottle of water daily, which was much appreciated.
