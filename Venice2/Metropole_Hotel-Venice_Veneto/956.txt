When I first saw the hotel on tripadvisor, I was incredibly happy and very excited. I remember saying how lovely the pictures looked and how much I looked forward to staying at the Metropole.   However, I was very much disappointed once I saw the hotel. Indeed the entrance is grand with the red carpet and great ornaments but the room was very disappointing. It was small and cramped. The bed was a total joke! It was not a double bed but two single beds pushed together with a gap in the middle. I found myself sleeping in the gap every night just so I could be near my husband. The irritation this caused was immense.   On top of all this the air conditioning did not work and the control system for it was far too complicated. I feared to ask the staff as I found them not at allâ€¦
