The Venice Metropole Hotel has plenty to brag about: the rooms are charming, the staff is friendly and helpful, and its location is superb (especially for visitors targeting the Biennale).  This is why I booked three rooms there, for our family vacation, for multiple nights. When my daughter's Apple Airpods were stolen from her room, I notified the reception clerk, who promised to look into it and get back to me.  He didn't. Upon checking out,  I mentioned this incident again, and the reception manager took my email address and promised that I would hear from management promptly.  It's been nearly two months, and I'm guessing that this email is not coming either. I am Never going back to the Metropole.   Not only is it the first time I've ever experienced theft from my hotelâ€¦
