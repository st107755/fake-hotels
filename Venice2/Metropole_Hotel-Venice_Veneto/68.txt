The Metropole is always a site for sore eyes after a long day of travel, and sluffing your bags all over the place.  The easiest way to get to the Metropole is a taxi (water taxi).  The last time we were there we hopped on a water transfer from the cruise ship terminal.  It was a quick transfer but we had 3 bridges to go up and over and like I said sluffing suitcases in Venice is not the easiest.    As for the Hotel itself, it is a remarkable place where the staff knows your name and treats you as special as you feel while visiting a place like Venice.  Conveniently located near St. Marcs Square.  It is of course close to many great little shops and gellato.  Restaurants are nearby.  You are quite a distance from the grand canal which runs through central Venice.  But everywhereâ€¦
