We stayed in a room suitable for our family of 4 during our recent stay in Venice.  The hotel was perfect in every way, from the views, to the decor, the size and cleanliness of the room, and the extremely gracious concierge and staff.  The location on the grand canal, walking distance to St. Marks Square, was fabulous and convenient, and the hotel was easy to reach by either public or private water taxi.  We would highly recommend this hotel and hope we have an opportunity to stay there again in the future!
