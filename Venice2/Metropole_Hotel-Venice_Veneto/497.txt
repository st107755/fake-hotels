We went to Venice for the weekend and stayed at the Metropole for 2 nights - in all honesty we hardly spent any time at all in the hotel so my review is limited.   The hotel is centrally located, literally just a few minutes walk to St.Marks Square.  The concierge were very helpful both whilst we were there and via email before we visited. We booked a standard room which overlooked a side canal, although compact, it was still lovely and considering how much time we spent in the room was the right choice for us. If youâ€™re looking for a modern 5 star then book somewhere else, the Metropole is olde-worlde, with lots of antiques ... we felt that it was an overall good choice.
