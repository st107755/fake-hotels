A beautiful old hotel.  Nothing could have been better from service point of view; reception, concierge, waiting staff, barmen, bell boys. Room was great, everything worked, turn down service. The oriental bar is superb, atmosphere, great service, barmen flirty and knowledgeable. The only drawback was the restaurant; good food but comparing the taster menu of Â£65 at the Savoy London with 125 euro (traditional) or 145 (contemporary) is ridiculous.  No wine cheaper than 40 euro, one spoon of standard panaccota 18 euro! We'd stay at the hotel again but not eat in the restaurant, stick to the Oriental bar.
