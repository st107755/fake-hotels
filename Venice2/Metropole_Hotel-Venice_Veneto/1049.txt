We moved to the Metropole after a night in another hotel. We felt we needed a little pampering, and we wanted to be in the center of all the action.  The Metropole is just a short walk from Saint Mark's Square. We didn't arrive by boat, but if you do they have their own entrance right on the Canal.  The Metropole is a great Hotel, well decorated with hundreds of antiques and tasteful accoutrements. When I go back to Italy we will spend a lot more time in Venice and the Metropole is where I want to be! Highly recommended.
