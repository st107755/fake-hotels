My husband spent the week there to celebrate my birthday. It was our first visit, we usually stay at the Danielli.  This hotel was perfect. The staff kind and helpful, and not grumpy and suffering from tourism burnout, as they do at the Danielli.  Everyone was cheerful, service spot on and the breakfast and bar wonderful.  I was very  surprised to see we got such a large and well appointed room without having upgraded.  This place is a class act among a lot of others that really make a tourist feel exploited. Bravo!!!
