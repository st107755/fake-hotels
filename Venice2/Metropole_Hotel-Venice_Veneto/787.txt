The Hotel Metropole is perfectly located in Venice.  It's just a few minutes from San Marco Square, but far enough away that you're not inundated by all the tourists.   We took the Allilaguna water "bus" from the airport and had only a short walk from the San Marco stop to reach the hotel.  Our room was certainly very nice, if not overly large (it is Europe after all!)  with a very comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom.  Service was excellent.  The front desk staff was very helpful in providing directions to the Rialto Bridge, suggesting restaurants and telling us about their hourly (and complimentary) water taxi to Murano which leaves right from their dock.  A very generous buffet breakfast was included in our room rate and served in a lovely garden.  We'd definitely stayâ€¦
