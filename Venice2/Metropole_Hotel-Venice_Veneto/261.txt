Superb position overlooking  the lagoon and the stops for the water buses are right outside the hotel, and only a few minutes walk to St. Marks Square. Dont let the exterior of the hotel put you off, once inside you will be transported back in time with  Venetian charm, elegance and opulence. Friendly welcome and  room upgrade to a lovely large room with  side canal view . We visited in June when the weather was extremely hot, so between two and four in the afternoon when Venice is crowded, relax with a glass of wine in the hotels beautiful shaded garden. A quiet oasis very rare in the centre of Venice. I want to go back.
