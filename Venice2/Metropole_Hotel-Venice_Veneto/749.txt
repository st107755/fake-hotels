Arriving by water taxi from the airport makes it a truly Venetian experience. This hotel is beatifully located right on the Grand Canal and only five minutes walk from Piazza San Marco. There is a museum-sized collection of oddities and nick-nacks ranging from cork screws to fans all over the hotel. Our suite was big, beautiful and clean. Service is generally good although the reception desk was occasionally a little bit disinterested in helping you.  There's a really cool bar in the garden out at the back, which is lovely for a few cocktails in the evening.
