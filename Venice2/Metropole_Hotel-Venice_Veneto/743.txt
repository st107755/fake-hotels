We just returned from an 8 day tour of Italy....we started out in Venice and so happy we chose this hotel.  While the outside didn't look too beautiful (most need some work!), we were delighted with the interior of this place!  Beautiful decor, wonderful, accommodating people working there....they even knew our names, and called us by name everytime they saw us!  Spacious family room (2 queen beds), great updated bathroom, and they had by FAR the best breakfast spread of anywhere we stayed in Italy!  It was a very short walk to St. Mark's, and only about a 10 minute walk from the Rialto Bridge.  We found the beds to be a bit too firm for our tastes, but others seem to like them, so maybe it's just us.  Would definitely recommend this hotel!
