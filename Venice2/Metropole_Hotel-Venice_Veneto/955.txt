Actually stayed here for our honeymoon a couple of years back but decided to check out the reviews out of nostalgic yearning. I am absolutely astonished by the bad reviews as our stay was perfect and magical inevery way. We had the most outstanding room I have ever stayed in, the staff were fantastic and the food wonderful. Absolute charm personified. I decided to post this review in defence of the hotel and the staff and state categorically that if I was to stay in Venice again this hotel would be my number one choice. Don't be put off.
