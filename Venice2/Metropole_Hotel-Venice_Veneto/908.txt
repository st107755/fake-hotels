We arrived at the hotel after an 8 hour flight from Toronto. You must drag your bags for a good seven to ten minutes to the dock. Your choices are a waterbus (11 euro) or watertaxi (110 euro). Water taxi takes about 20 minutes right to your hotel dock. The waterbus takes 70 minutes . The waterbus stops near St Marco and you must drag your bags to your hotel. Crazy. Thru the main square and hoards of people and down tiny little alley streets packed with tourists. SPLURGE. Take the taxi - we did on the return and loved it-money well spent. Hotel is right beside a small bridge over a secondary canal -gondoliers go right by - so nice!. Very freindly staff and our room was AMAZING. A room for our suitcases, my daughts room was a flip-out couch with a dresser, fridge, flat screenâ€¦
