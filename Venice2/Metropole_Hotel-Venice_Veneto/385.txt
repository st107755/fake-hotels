A stunning hotel. Packed with interesting 'collections' and decorated with such care and taste. It even smelled great! Friendly, helpful staff and a fantastic cosy Oriental bar with amazing cocktails and our favourite, the local Aperol Spritz. The bar food and choices for breakfast were quite delicious. Easy to transfer to and from, and a brilliant location to have as base camp.
