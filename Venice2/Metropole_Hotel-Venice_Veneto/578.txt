we have just returned after spending 2 nights at the Metropole, from the time we were dropped off at their own jetty until the time we left we could not fault anything at all. reception was so friendly, polite and informative. all of the staff could not be faulted and provided an above and beyond 5 star service. Our suite  overlooked the lagune and was beautifully decorated and had one of the best showers ever.
