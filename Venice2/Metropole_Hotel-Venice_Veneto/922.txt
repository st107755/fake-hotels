From walking through the doors the service was excellent, nothing was too much trouble from helping us regarding transport and giving directions.  The staff were attentive, pleasant and always a smile at all times.  Breakfast was more than we expected from a continental breakfast, the range was to everyones choice with a lovely peaceful garden where we could eat at our leisure.  Rooms were spotless with staff attending at least twice a day.  Beds were extremely comfortable.  If we return to Venice, we would definitely choose to stay at this wonderful hotel and have already recommended it to others.
