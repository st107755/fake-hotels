My husband and I spent four nights here for the first leg of our honeymoon. The hotel is truly beautiful, and the rooms are large and elegant. My only complaint is the service, which was often indifferent and aloof. The concierge staff was incredible, but the restaurant and bar staff didn't seem interested in serving. My worst experience was the day I stopped at the bar to order two drinks to take up to my room. I was told that this was a five star hotel and they would never allow a guest to walk across the lobby carrying drinks. You have to love a hotel that informs its guests the quality of the hotel in which they are staying. Classy.
