Stayed 5 nights in May 2016. Our Suite was large and hotel location is excellent (no arguing there) but the rooms are old with heavy drape curtains and carpeting which made our stay a nightmare having to rely continually on allergy (antihistamine) medication with maximum dosage. Also the rooms are not clean and bathroom tub had soap scum all over. Other than that the hotel has a historic charm and the food at the bar is very good. Overall, if you have allergy then avoid by all means and look for a modern hotel in Venice which is hard to find.
