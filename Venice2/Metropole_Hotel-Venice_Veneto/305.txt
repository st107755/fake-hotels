Having stayed at the Metropole several times before we always look forward to our return. Again, we were not disappointed and not only did we book and pay in advance for a good rate but we were also awarded a FOC room upgrade to a junior suite which was really very nice. The staff are always very pleasant and nothing is too much trouble, the rooms, and service is top class and the breakfast is also very very good. There are many hotels in Venice but I don't think there are any like the Metropole, with its sophisticated, eclectic atmosphere and style.   A must!
