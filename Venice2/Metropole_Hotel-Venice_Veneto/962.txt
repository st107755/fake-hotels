Just returned from a month long European vacation. My husband , Daughter and I stayed here on the 18th of Oct. took a cruise to Greece and then came back for 1 more night. We loved it!! the front desk were very nice and helpful.. The rooms were wonderful I am a travel agent and booked myself  and didn't tell them I was an agent. At the Metropole without me asking they upgraded me to a suite and it was beautiful all decorated in red. On the next night that I had booked they also upgraded us to a one bedroom suite this time in green and cream. I like this hotel because they have a water taxi landing right at the door so makes it much easier when you have lots of luggage. Water Taxi was 90 euros from Airport to door of hotel and was about 25 mins total. It is so well located nearâ€¦
