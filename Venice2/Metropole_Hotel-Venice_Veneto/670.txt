We chose the Metropole primarily for its fantastic location near San Marco square.  The room was reasonably large and bed was comfortable.  The staff was invariably pleasant and friendly.  The included breakfast was good.  The hotel itself is unique in that they are almost a mini-museum with baroque d√©cor and display cases full of artifacts in the hallways.  Having a private dock for the water taxis was a nice luxury touch but they're also close to vaporetto stops.  Nice outdoor cafe's just a block away with no cover (unlike the ones in San Marco square).  We stayed one night before a cruise but one night isn't enough to see Venice.  Our only complaint was that the tub had very high sides to climb over but no grab bars to assist.
