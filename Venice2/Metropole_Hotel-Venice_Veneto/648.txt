The positives are substantial -position just along from San Marco, wonderful Venetian ambience aided by stunning antiques and collections, reasonable room size, brilliant breakfast. The service is hit and miss - some genuinely friendly helpful, some off hand and dis interested. The latter comes with the territory in Venice. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel.
