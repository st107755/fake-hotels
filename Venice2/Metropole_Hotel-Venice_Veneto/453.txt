We spent five nights at the Metropole. This was our second visit at this hotel, and out 6th among 7 visits to Venice. We have found that the value of the Metropole is terrific relative to other hotels, both more expensive and less expensive. The service is excellent, the breakfast is delicious, and the location is outstanding. The hotel has a classic Venetian feel. While we stay in the least expensive rooms, without a view, they are nonetheless charming and the service is nonetheless excellent. We will stay here again.
