This hotel. From the moment you enter. Is luxury. Staff are very helpful. We had a room upgrade without asking to a suite and the room was spacious. , bed large and really comfortable , lovely crisp sheets and a large bathroom. They supply all toiletries so don't worry about taking the basics.  They do supply most things. The reception is plush , Venetian , calming and welcoming.  A water taxi will drop you off at the hotel and we would recommend taking a private water taxi and arrive in style. Only negative point is that the bottle of water was £4 and small crisps £4 from mini bar so care when indulging !!!   Really good location for exploring. Just along from the bridge of sighs and opposite the public water taxis  and about 10mins Walk from st marks square. Really nice hotel…
