This is one of the nicest hotels.  From the moment you walk in the door your senses are delighted with aromas and visually rich fabrics.  The lobby and lounge areas are very inviting.  We had a junior suite with a wonderful view out to the canal.  Breakfast whilst expensive is well worth the money, but eating at the bar was disappointing.  Definitely worth a cocktail, just find somewhere else to eat a meal.
