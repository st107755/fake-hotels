Arrived via water taxi from the airport to the canal entrance directly attached to the hotel.  Very quaint hotel with an old Venice feel.  Everything feels authentic but the stay was pleasantly comfortable.  All the rooms seem to have different layouts which is nice and adds to the charm of not being a large standard layout hotel.  Bed was a bit soft for me but the bathroom was fine (good water pressure, no hot water problems, nice selection of amenities, etc.).   Breakfast was amazing.  A nice selection of breads and pastries, cheeses and cold cuts, fruit and even some eggs and bacon.  Fresh juices were also quite nice.  Oriental Bar looked cool but did not get a chance to visit.
