Our two night stay at the Metropole were our last two in Italy before returning to the States.  The location was perfect, with the water-taxi arrival to the hotel lobby a real treat for all of us.  The breakfast, which is included in the room rate, was wonderful, with a nice outside courtyard setting and wide selection that kept all of us, kids and adults, happy.  The front desk was very helpful in directing us to various sites we visited, which ranged from the typical churches and palaces, to an afternoon jaunt to the beach in Lido.  Everything was perfect during our trip to Venice and at the Metropole.
