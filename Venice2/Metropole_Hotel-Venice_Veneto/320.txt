Wonderful stay in Venice in this beautiful hotel with an elegant personality and feel.  Staff are wonderful and Giuliano Brogliato the Head Concierge is excellent with assisting with private guides and transfers.   Location is very convenient to everything.   The outside patio is beautiful and the breakfast buffet is excellent.   I am in the Hotel industry and have to commend them on their presentation of service.     I did not eat at the hotel for dinner as I wanted to experience more local restaurants.   Loved this hotel and would recommend, definitely.
