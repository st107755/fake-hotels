We booked a 3 night stay at The Metropole as part of Special Birthday celebrations. When we arrived we were delighted to find out that the Hotel had kindly upgraded our accommodation, making the Birthday celebrations all the more special. The staff were all very helpful and friendly . The location is perfect ,with St Marks Square and other major attractions close by. If you are looking for a stylish, atmospheric quality hotel this is the spot!!
