We went here for after dinner drinks and missed the shuttle bus! Really helpful staff and the quality of the drinks were just lovely. They know their stuff! They have a selection of Spritz, I had the French which was great and an awesome wine selection. The little smoking garden was very pleasant! We ended up sitting there till 2am! I had planned an early morning! Oops!
