Great stay in this cosy hotel situated between the Piazza San Marco and the Arsenale where the Biennale takes place. A very special applause to the friendly service of all the staff members (something we experience less and less in Italy unfortunately) and in particular the concierges. Very helpful, quick, organized and knowledgeable.
