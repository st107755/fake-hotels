I stayed at this hotel for 3 days.  It is very well located for all activities and restaurants.  A short walk to St. Mark's Square and water buses.  The hotel itself is an older style and very comfortable.   The staff was very accommodating and helpful.  Rooms are smallish but nice with updated bathrooms and the usual amenities.  Very clean.  Complimentary breakfast was outstanding.
