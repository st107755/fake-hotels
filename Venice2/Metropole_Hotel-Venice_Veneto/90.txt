We stayed here after a recommendation by friends and were not disappointed.  Collected by water taxi and lovely  room over looking the canal - staff were attentive and went above and beyond, had complimentary drinks as we were celebrating.  Arranged private water taxi tour of the Grand Canal with Prosecco which was wonderful. Ideal location for all sight seeing and tranquil to come back to after the hustle and bustle of St Marks  Square.  Lovely bar with great cocktails and fab food in restaurant. Would recommend to anyone going to Venice.
