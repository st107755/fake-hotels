My wife and I just spent 5 days at the Metropole. We had booked a classic room (#243) which had one window overlooking the garden. The room was of decent size but the poor lighting, antique style furniture with "antique" wall paper (it really deserves changing !) and little light coming through the window were somewhat depressing. This is not a room where you want to spend time so reserve in the Spring & autumn. The service was mixed: reception and breakfast personnel were very helpful & friendly however the 1 star Michelin restaurant (the Met) was a catastrophy ! We had decided to have dinner there the day of our arrival but our 20:00 request was turned down so we chose 21:00 (perhaps there are 2 services ?). In any case, tired but looking forward to a delicious meal we walkedâ€¦
