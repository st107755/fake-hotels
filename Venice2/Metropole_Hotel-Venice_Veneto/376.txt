We stayed here in March 2016, our third time in Venice. We stayed here on our last trip to Venice on July 2014, when we got engaged in one of the beautiful rooms with a balcony over the canal at the side. This time we were back with our parents as a wedding thank you gift and the hotel staff were kind enough to put us back in the room we got engaged in. We would never stay anywhere else in Venice, this is such a beautiful, authentic and typically Venetian hotel. It was our parents first time in Venice and they absolutely loved the hotel. It's in perfect location, very close to the hustle and bustle of St Mark's Square. Highly recommend taking a water taxi from the airport as it was a great way to arrive on the city and the hotel has a beautiful landing off the canal. Hotel staffâ€¦
