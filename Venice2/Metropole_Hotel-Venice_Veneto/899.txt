Spent 2 nights in Venice at this hotel.  Everything was beautiful.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  Bathrooms were big with stand up shower and a tub.  Great blowdryer.  Breakfast had a good assortment of items.  You could eat outside in the courtyard or in the hotel.  Unless it was raining, I don't see why you wouldn't want to enjoy the beautiful courtyard.   Small restaurant was very upscale.  Location was centrally located near all the activity.  The only downfall was distance from Train station. You could get a water taxi which is private and quick, but also costly (somewere around $70)  You could take the ferry for a much smaller fee but longer ride.  If you ask at the desk there are two boat runs that are much quicker from the hotel to the trainstation which is helpfulâ€¦
