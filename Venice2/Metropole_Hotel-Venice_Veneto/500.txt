This was a beautiful hotel  with many fascinating displays of 'antiques' and curios - everything from corkscrews to evening bags and shells. Delightful arrangements of candles and flowers in many of the 'public' rooms lent a feeling of romance.  We found the staff to be friendly and helpful and the  room, which we thought was nicely decorated and comfortable, was maintained to a very high standard.  We treated ourselves to a meal in the restaurant - a real foodie experience with each dish being carefully explained to us, although not cheap. The restaurant gets very busy so booking ahead (and checking the style of food and prices first!) would be a good idea.
