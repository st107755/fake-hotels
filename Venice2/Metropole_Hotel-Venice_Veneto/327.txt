Having arrived at Hotel Metropole our very welcoming concierge made us aware that we had a room upgrade and bottle of bubbly which made for a lovely surprise on our 20th wedding anniversary. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly, attentive and and full of information about Venice if you needed it. The room was spotless and very well equipped.  The staff made us aware of the different services and events on offer but in no way did we feel that they were being forced upon us.  Perfect location overlooking the lagoon and only 5 minutes walk from St Mark's square.  Perfect!  This will definitely be our hotel of choice when we visit Venice again.
