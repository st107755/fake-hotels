Arriving at the hotel with there private jetty was really special .On arrived we were quickly greeted and bags were whisked away without us even noticing.Very efficient check in and beautiful suite awaited us .Breakfast was very nice .The hotel decor is very tastefully done .There is a beautiful bar and cocktails were amazing.We will definitely return to this hotel on our return to fabulous Venice
