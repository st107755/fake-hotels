An amazing place to stay. From the moment we arrived by water taxi at the private landing stage we knew that this was a special place. Although prices here in the bar and restaurant are expensive by our standards it was worth it to be in Venice! The location is perfect, less than five minutes walk from St. Mark's Square. All of the Staff were friendly and greeted us by name during our stay. A beautifully furnished room, excellent breakfasts and a lovely garden to relax in. It was an experience to just wander around the Hotel with its quirky collections gathered over the years. Can't wait to return. We would not consider staying anywhere else.
