Arrived-front desk rude and placed us on a tour to "refresh us." The boat took us to a glass blowing factory where we got a hard sell. We'd only been in the town an hour and this hotel clerk had the nerve to do that to us. A bold faced lie about where the tour was going! Please! The food in the hotel was god-awful and very expensive. Room was tacky. Next time we're staying at the Londra.
