The hotel contains fascinating collections of antiquities. It is ideally situated close to St Marks Square and the staff are excellent. It's also a Michelin starred restaurant. The vaporetto main station is close by. The hotel runs a free taxi to Murano glass factory but this does entail a hard sell.
