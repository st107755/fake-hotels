They think they are really something but they are not. The rooms are very small but that's typical of Europe. It's just expensive for what you get. Right behind the hotel is a best western. It is a Three star. Save yourself some money and stay at the best western. I went there and personally looked at two if their rooms. They are way less expensive and nicer.
