If not for the fact that our previous rooms in Florence and Rome were so spacious with great views, I'd give this hotel five stars. The staff was very helpful, the hotel in a great location, and the room itself clean and cozy. But..the room was quite small and the bathroom needed a bit more updating. But overall, for a quick two night stay, the hotel met all of our needs.
