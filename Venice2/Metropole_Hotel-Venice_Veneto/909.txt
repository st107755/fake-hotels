As you enter the hotel the atmosphere exudes luxury and timelessness!   It is as if you have stepped back into more gracious times.  Wonderful staff and a beautiful junior suite overlooking the Canal.  The small bar is intimate and cosy - the whole hotel "glistens".  Everywhere you look are antiques and special objects.  Then of course is the location - could not be better.  St Marks Square only minutes away.  Dont miss this one!
