My fiancé and I planned to surprise his parents for their 50th wedding anniversary. We called and emailed the hotel to tell them everything that was happening. We stayed here for 4 nights and the whole time we were here, it was perfect. They surprise was phenomenal. We all got in at the same time and same day, but for the hotel to know that it was all a surprise, they made sure it wasn’t going to get ruined. The first night we got a table at the hotels restaurant, which is a Michelin star, and that’s where we surprised his parents. The staff is amazing here, our bedroom was perfect. Everything was clean and tidy and the breakfast here was good. I highly recommend staying here 🙌🏽
