A SUPERB hotel ,rooms very luxurious clean and LOVELY views of the canal. Staff could not have been anymore helpful and it was the perfect choice of hotel for two sisters. Good location close to the taxis,shops bars and san marc's square (easy to find). I highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to go back again. Also the hotel has its own collection of antiques that are very interesting to look at!
