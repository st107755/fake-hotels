Superb location, right in the center of Venise with view. If you appreciate boutique hotel where the charm and the attention to client is a priority you will love this place. As the minute you enter the hotel, you feel you are in one of the old Venitian palace. Bedroom have kept the antique charm, ask for a view. Breakfast outside and before diner do not miss the bat where VIvaldi composed once the "4seasons". I have tried the restaurant but it has one star Michelin. @mysecretaddressesny
