My husband and I spent 4 nights here at the end of June.  Arriving by private boat from the taxi was a lovely way to arrive, straight to their door!  The reservation staff worked hard to get our room asap as we had come from Australia.  Our room was lovely.  We had glimpses of the water from our balcony which got the sun from the morning.  The room although small was well set out.  There was plenty of room to unpack your case - something that often there isn't - the toilet was separate to the shower, and the shower was really good.  The bed was comfortable and the room nice and dark for our jet lag.  The room was cleaned well every day, always when we were out and without chasing and there was turndown every evening.  We initially questioned the high cost of the buffet breakfastâ€¦
