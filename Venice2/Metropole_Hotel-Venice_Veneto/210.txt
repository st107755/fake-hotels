My wife and I stayed at the Metropole from March 27th to March 31st. It is a wonderful hotel in a great location in Venice and with a lovely private garden. There is very little green in Venice and the central garden at the Metropole was a great feature.  Room was large and comfortable if a little warm but the window opened over the garden which tended to cool the room. The breakfast is great, but they need to work on staffing and coffee service. Often had to wait longer than I liked to get coffee at breakfast.  Staff was very helpful. Recognized us by name shortly after our arrival.  Only other comment (not really a criticism) is that the lobby is small and dark.  On the whole it was a great experience.
