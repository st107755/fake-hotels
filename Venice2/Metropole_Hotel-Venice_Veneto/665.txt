My husband took me here as a 50th birthday surprise. Well what can I say but excellent. Our room was large, comfortable and clean ( no mosquitos). The staff were attentive and polite. The breakfast was good and the restaurant excellent (pricey but worth it). The bar staff were welcoming especially Bruno who made you feel he had known you all his life. If I ever go back to Venice I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it.
