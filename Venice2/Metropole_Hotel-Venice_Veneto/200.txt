Metropole is not far from St Marks Sqaure on the Grand canal. Its very busy outside but quiet inside. There is a great bar with an amazing bar tender. Cocktails are divine and I had the perfect vodka martini - not to strong.   On another night we ate in The Met - restaurant. That was delicious. We had a set menu for the 6 person group and I have food allergies which they catered for in my main meal. Not much imagination for my starter or pudding but it was well presented.   The hotel decoration is very Venetian which I loved. Full of collections - collected by the owners. I shared a twin bed room which was clean and adequate in space for the price. There was a bath and an overhanging shower head which is a bit annoying as you have to hold it to shower.   It was a luxrious spaceâ€¦
