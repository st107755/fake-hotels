A truly unique experience, from arriving to the hotel by boat to exploring the antiques and hidden gems in every corner of the hotel, we loved every minute.  The service was excellent and our room was beautiful. We felt very welcome from the moment we stepped off the boat.  The location couldn't be better. We were just a few minutes from St Mark's Square and there were lots of great bars and restaurants along the way.  We made use of the laundry facilities while we were there and it was spot on. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  I absolutely loved it and can't wait to come back some day.
