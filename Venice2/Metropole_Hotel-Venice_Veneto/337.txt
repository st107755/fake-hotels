We had the hotel make arrangements for "door to door" transport from Marco Polo airport to the hotel, which, while costly, was worth it to avoid the confusion and hassle of doing it using public water taxis.  Very nice hotel on the lagoon within 5 minutes easy walk to St. Marks square.  Peaceful setting for breakfast in the garden.  Room was comfortable.  Service was good.  We were in a room on the first floor with window views of the lagoon; the view was good but the water taxi noise was distracting at times.  We would opt next time for a room with a garden view.
