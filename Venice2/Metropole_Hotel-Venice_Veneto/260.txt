What a grand lady the metropole is!   Nestled on the grand canal just ten mins stroll away from the chaos of st mark's square, step inside this wonderful, tranquil hotel to glimpse a slice of Traditional Venice and take you back to a time gone past. All rooms are decorated in the traditional baroque style so expect lots of luxurious fabrics, furniture coverings and Venetian period furniture - a real feast for the eyes.   The beautifully decorated Moroccan themed garden is a wonderful place to have a nightcap.   Great value for money and a superb location.
