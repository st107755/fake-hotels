We booked this hotel for our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we picked just the perfect place. Before we arrived I was able to book tours and restaurants plus our transfer, once we got there the concierge team had everything ready.  The ease from the airport to the hotel was seamless. We had lunch as soon as we arrived in the hotel, it was superb, we relaxed instantly. Our room looked out over the water, it was spacious, bright and clean. The decor was lovely as it was in the entire hotel, some really great features The hotel is a fab location 5 mins from St Marks Square. We can not speak highly enough of the concierge team, they were just superb, nothing was ever too much trouble Highly recommend a stay here.
