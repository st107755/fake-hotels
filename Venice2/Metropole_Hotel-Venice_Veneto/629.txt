We chose the Metropole because of its fabulous location on the Grand Canal with its short stroll from St Marks Square - in addition we wanted a hotel that truly reflected the historic charm of this unique and fascinating city. We were not disappointed. The hotel lived up to all expectations and the classy Venetian decor transported you into a bygone era which was light years away from the soulless contemporary design found in modern hotel chains. The outside of the hotel has a typically worn look so common to the buildings that front the Grand Canal - don't let this put you off since the interior is very classy. Service was excellent and our sophisticated room overlooked the garden. A magical place to stay and a very special romantic break.
