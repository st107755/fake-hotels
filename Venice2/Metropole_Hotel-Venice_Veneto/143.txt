We loved staying at this historic hotel in the best part of Venice. We enjoyed a 3 night stay in a 1st floor, deluxe room, alongside to a small canal, over the top of the Hotel's canal entrance. The small and cosy room contained genuine antiques, including a Murano Glass chandelier, a glass bathroom basin, antique wooden chest of drawers, a wooden bed head, interesting pictures and decor. The bed was quite good and gave us some comfortable nights sleep. The tariff for our room included a full breakfast and free wifi. The wifi, like most historic European hotels was spasmodic, but it didn't worry us so much. There is no pool or gym on the premises. There is a nice restaurant and a great bar that serves nice food and wine, where we ate most of our meals. We really enjoyed ourâ€¦
