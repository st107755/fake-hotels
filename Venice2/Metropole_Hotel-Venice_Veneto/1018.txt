We just returned from a 2 week Italy trip (Amalfi Coast, Tuscany, Venice and Lake Como).  Most of the hotels that we stayed at were lovely 4-stars, and the trip was great.  I cannot say enough good things about the Hotel Metropole. The location is fantastic (a 1 minute walk from St. Mark's Square), the hotel is gorgeous, the rooms are spotless and have all the amenities, and the service is that of a 5-star hotel.  Aside from all of this, plus a great bar and excellent restaurant, the hotel has its own watertaxi stop (very unusual) and offers free private service to and from Murano. The hotel is also a steal at 200 Euros a night in peak season.
