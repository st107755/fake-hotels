We arrived by motor taxi  and this hotel is unique and a special part of the history of Venice The interiors, room decor and overall ambience is like living in old Venice.The staff are very helpful and attentive.... tickets to the opera, special events...what is really good at the Biennale!!! What would you like to do today......nothing was a problem...the week we spend there was not long enough!
