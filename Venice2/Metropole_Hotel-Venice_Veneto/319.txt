This is a beautiful boutique hotel with excellent service. They even helped us with reservations and advice before we arrived. The location is great with only a 5 - 10 minute walk to St. Mark's Square. Every floor is like a museum with displayed collections of beautiful bags and luggage. Our room was small but just lovely. We even had a balcony with seating and a partial view of the canal. Also loved the beautifully tiled bathroom with the stain glass window. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and in a gorgeous room or, if weather permits, you can eat outside in the garden. Would absolutely stay here again.
