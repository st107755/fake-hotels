Two years ago my boyfriend-to-be seduced me by taking me to Venice to stay at the Metropole.  And I've never looked back.  The staff were fantastic and attended to our every whim, the hotel was beautiful and the rooms made me feel like a queen.  The entire trip was magical from start to finish, and the setting certainly helped.  I will never forget those few days, and want to thank the staff (if they're reading) for all they did to help (especially the bell-boy who gave me his last cigarette!).  I will certainly be back, and this time I might even treat my man!
