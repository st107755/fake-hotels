From the moment you get dropped off by your launch to the moment you leave expect to feel like royalty.This hotel is grace and elegance and you get pampered. YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU ARE TRANSPORTED BACK TO ANOTHER ERA. GREAT LOCATION. GREAT BREAKFAST. Would absolutely stay here again. Mini museum. STAFF EXTREMELY ATTENTIVE. A must stop at oriental bar the mixologist is a genius. sorry I had to leave .
