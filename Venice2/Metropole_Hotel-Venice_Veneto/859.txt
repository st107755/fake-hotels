We stayed at the Metropole for three nights in October 2011. Since our flight arrived in the evening we organised a pickup from the hotel, which was a great experience arriving at the Metropole's own little jetty in a canal off the grand canal. The room was nice, with a great bathroom. We had a balcony with views across the grand canal, which made our stay there unforgetable. The staff at the reception desk are very friendly and helpful. The complemtary water taxi to Murano islan was great. Highly recommended hotel in Venice.
