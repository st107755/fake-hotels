We were really prepared to love the Metropole. We had reserved 2 rooms, had requested them to be connecting as we were traveling with our 17 yr old grand daughter. We got non-connecting rooms and non-adjacent on the first floor with no view. The rooms were shabby. the wall paper in my g-daughter's room was torn in places. The night noise was more than annoying. For some reason from my gdaughter's  room you could hear bathroom noises from other rooms . In our room, the bathroom floor was filthy and when I had used a bath towel, noticed too late that a blood stain had not fully been removed when the towel had been washed. Even a 2 star hotel knows when to discard used old towels.
