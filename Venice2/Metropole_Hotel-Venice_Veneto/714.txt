My family of 4 had a wonderful stay here for two nights.  Quiet room and comfortable with plenty of space.  Clean.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Very nice breakfast in a secluded courtyard.  It is right on the water, just far enough away from St. Mark's not to be super crowded.  While it is on a side canal as well, the noise was never a problem in our 3rd floor room. Water taxi stop right at the side door is very convenient. Vaporetto stop is also close for public transporation. Highly recommend.
