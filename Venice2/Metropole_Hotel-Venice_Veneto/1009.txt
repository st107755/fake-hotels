I arrived by private water taxi at 9 in the morning.  The "double room with side canal or garden view" which I had reserved at the hotel's Web site was not yet ready.  The concierge suggested a single room with a view of the lagoon for 130 Euros per night.  Initially, I was disappointed because this room was quite small, but when the bellhop opened the windows, there was amazing sunlight, fresh air, and a panoramic water view.  There was a pink crystal chandelier on the ceiling and decorative fans on the walls.  The room was perfect for me as I was traveling alone.  I asked the bellhop to show me my original room (for comparison) and it too was small.  It overlooked the side canal and was dark.   The common areas of this hotel are exotic, sumptuous, and breathtaking beyondâ€¦
