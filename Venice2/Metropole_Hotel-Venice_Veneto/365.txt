Hotels don't get much cooler than this one. Very chic with some amazing history. Vivaldi composed many works in the parlor. I think that adds to the legend of this place. Grab a water taxi right beside your hotel. Chill in my favorite bar in all of Venice. The rooms are definitely old and each one is different. Some better than others. The view that we had was amazing. I would watch the boats deliver all of the food to the island in the early am. Really amazing. Super cool place but don't expect spectacular rooms with modern conveniences
