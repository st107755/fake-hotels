We arrived by water taxi to the hotels private landing stage.Staff very pleasant and welcoming but advised room would not be ready until 2pm. No problem went out to explore and soak up the atmosphere St Marks square is a few minutes walk away  Returned at 3pm to be told room not ready for another half an hour. Getting a little cross by now as had a very early start and a lot of travelling. Finally entered room 107 and wow - beautiful art decco style furniture. Interesting collections of antiques everywhere- a hotel with real character. Breakfast was fantastic with fresh fruit, breads, pastries, cakes etc etc. Excellent service. Did not have dinner in the restaurant as very pricey for 1 Michelin star! Received complimentary glass of Prosecco for husbands birthday.
