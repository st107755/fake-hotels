This review is from a trip taken back in 2005; Hotel was lovely, centrally located, had a special dock for a boat to drop you on/off; outside patio bar had a trendy feel as did the rest of hotel, rooms were very large and nice, concierge/front desk had great recommendations for restaurants, one I cannot find online, was just amazing called hostaria da franz on Castillo, fond. S. Giuseppe 754 ( zona giardini biennale); we love Italy and made many trips and would consider staying here when we return to Venice; Another time we stayed at Westin Europa Regina, a little more grand, but non the less both would be excellent choices!
