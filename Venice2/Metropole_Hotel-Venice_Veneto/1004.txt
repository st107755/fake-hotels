Stayed for four nights here last January on a city break with my wife. Hotel was in a great location,three minutes walk from San Marco and next door to the Vivaldi church with great views over the lagoon. Great food and friendly staff also helped make our stay special. The thing we liked most was this hotels originality,the glass cases filled with curios and the opulent slightly OTT decor all added to the feeling that it was a really unique place.   We are frequent travellers,and i travel abroad regularly with my work but this hotel sticks out as being pretty special. I would definately recommend it and hope it never changes.
