The private pier is perfect when you get to Venice from the aiport using taxi boat.The warm welcome by the reception staff speaking english french is to be noticed.This hotel make me think of an old mention in the countryside. The corridors and rooms are full of antiques and to my opinion very tastefully decorated.

Bathtub no seperate shower.Complementary Fruit basket and panetone (xmas special) The lounge and the bar with walls covered in red material,wood, mirrors, red carpets and sofa are pretty cosy and confortable when its cold outside and raining. Nice xmas decoration, candles, home fragrances make…
