We found a special on their website "Fit for A king, but not the Price". It was a petite suite, parking at the International Garage, a drink upon arrival and breakfast for 200E.  Although it wasn't a room with a view, we throughly enjoyed the oversized room, beautiful linens and amentites.  The staff was helpful and we ate in their dining room one night and the food was wonderful.  We truly feel we got our monies worth.
