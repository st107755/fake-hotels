The whole family were there for a break to celebrate a big birthday - and the hotel made an excellent base - close to St Mark's Square. Its decor is based on repro eighteenth-century furniture - the opposite of the currently fashionable minimalism, but the room was of a decent size, and with plenty of storage space (essential when staying for more than a day or two). The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful. All in all, difficult to fault.
