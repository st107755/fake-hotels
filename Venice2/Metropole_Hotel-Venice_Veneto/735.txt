My fiance and I stayed here the night that he proposed to me and absolutely every element of our trip was fantastic. The suite we had was beautiful, the food for breakfast was delicious, the Oriental Bar was amazing, and the staff were the most helpful, friendly, and genuine people I have ever met. I would recommend this to everyone!
