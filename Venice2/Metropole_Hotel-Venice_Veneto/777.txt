Recently came back from a 4 day stay here. What a wonderful place. Didn't eat in the restaurant but breakfast in the garden & drinks in the bar were delightful. Having looked at some of the other hotels in this class whilst there felt that the Metropole was the best. Really can't recommend this place highly enough, would certainly book to go again without hesitation.
