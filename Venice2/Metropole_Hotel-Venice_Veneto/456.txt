We stayed here for one night before our cruise and I booked it thinking it would be totally WOW from the reviews. I can't say it was terrible because it wasn't but I wasn't overally impressed. We arrived on the hottest day of the year and I would of expected a cold refreshment on arrival. This wasn't to be so we ordered one and waited  25 minutes for it to arrive. I just think there should of been special touches aligned with the calibre of this hotel and sadly they were missing.
