This was our fifth visit to venice and our third consecutive stay at the metropole.Once again we can not praise the staff and hotel enough.excellent customer-service,excellent food and overall a pleasure to stay.We always stay in a junior suit with a lagoon view.Each visit we have had a different room but never been disappointed. We aim to visit venice once our twice a year for as small break and will not be looking anywhere else to stay well done hotel metropole it certainly gets the thumbs up from us.
