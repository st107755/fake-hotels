I have been recommending this great boutique hotel for decades  and while having lunch at their magical garden yesterday I realized I never got to write anything about this special place. It's a very friendly, cozy and very Venetian little hotel that deserves to be seen by the well off traveler who doesn't care about the usual touristic well known Venetian traps (I don't want to mention the usual suspects..).
