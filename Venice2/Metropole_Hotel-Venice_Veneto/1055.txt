Venice is incredible. It is unllike any city anywhere. Everything at the Metropole was wonderful with one exception. Our travel package included breakfast, but we found out too late that they billed us for our breakfasts. So be sure to check your bill before you leave. Otherwise, the staff, service, and accomodations, were all top notch. A Super hotel!The walking tour of St. Marks and the Dulce's palace are a must! Also, the free boat ride and tour of the Murano glass factory were great. Some people complain about being pressured to buy, but we already had our hearts set on some gunuine Murano glass, and were very satisfied. As a bonus, Mr. and Mrs. Murano (21st generation to own the factory) rode back to venice with us. What an experience!The canals and small "streets/alleys"â€¦
