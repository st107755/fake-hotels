This was our first trip to Venice so I will not profess to be an expert. However, I cannot imagine a better location to stay than the Metropole. The hotel faces the lagoon with a canal along one side. The canal side entrance has a dock for water taxis. You step out of the taxi directly into the lobby. It is a very short walk to San Marco. I recommend walking down the side alley beside the hotel which leads to several small shops and out of the way restaurants.    The hotel is beautifully decorated with various antique collections on display. Our room was also decorated with many beautiful antique pieces. Our room faced the canal with a view of the lagoon. The room was very large, even by American standards.  We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet, large selection of fruits,â€¦
