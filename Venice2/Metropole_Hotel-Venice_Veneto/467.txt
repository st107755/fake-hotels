A 5 minute walk from Piazzo San Marco square. It's on the water and on the main drag. Many restaurants and shops are nearby all within walking distance. The water taxi delivered us to the door from the train station. The staff here is very friendly and helpful and they all speak English. Rooms are large and air conditioned!!
