We spent Easter in this hotel, which was a memorable expirence. The rooms are to die for with real antics from 19th centuary or older. The standard rooms are mediumsized to small, but since the ceiling is so high it seems bigger. The best views are to the lagoon, but the canal views are also nice. Good bathroom.  The location is near San Marco and don't forget to prebook the Dodge palace's secret itinaries tour, which is a tour in tourture chambers, investigation rooms and Casanova's cells. If you are going by boat to other islands, the ferry terminals are just outside. The location could not be any better, considering that there are no cars in Venice, why a hotel that is not very near the water means carring bags in crowded streets.  Breakfast is the best I have ever got inâ€¦
