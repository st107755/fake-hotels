we booked through am ex platinum and , as somewhat common, we received an upgrade to a great suite. this after we booked a mini-suite...compared to the other five star hotels in venice this is an absolute bargain...very comfortable bed and nice bathroom....tthe staff is very nice the only negative being the at woman who checked us in must have had a bad day...that your she didn't like our italian...
