We stayed at the Hotel Metropole last weekend. While we were excited to stay at one of the few five star hotels in Venice, our experience at Hotel Metropole made us swear off the the city forever. We were attacked by bed bugs on both nights of our stay.   Because it was August and Venice is on the water we thought we were getting bitten by mosquitos. It was not until we were on a plane flying home that we became suspicious the bites were not the norm. After a quick google search our worst nightmare was confirmed. We were covered in bed bug bites.   We immediately called a pest inspector and after they sprayed we found bed bugs that had hitched a ride from the hotel. We attempted to contact the Metropole, if nothing more than to warn them that they have a problem and spare othersâ€¦
