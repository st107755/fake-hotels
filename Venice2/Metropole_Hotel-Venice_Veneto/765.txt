Fantastic hotel in a great location . The food in the restaurant was fantastic although a little pricey if your on a budget but I guess thats just Venice. The bar was very Cozy and over looking the grand canal but had a pub feel with a good menu for day time food. Our room was small but Ok for 2/3 day visit, the hotel was very clean and all of the staff were very helpful, in particular the concierge who organised a trip to Murenno to see a glass factory.
