I am sorry to say that despite all the expectation I was very disappointed with my dinner last night. We were a party of 10 and arrived at 7.45pm and were offered a set menu, albeit a choice of 2 menus, we were then informed that we could not have one table of 10  - only 1 of 6 and 1 of 4. We waited for one hour and a half before we were show to our tables, in an empty dining room! Where we subjected to what I can only describe as one of the most moderate and most expensive meals that I have eaten in a very long time. I do think that Eur 240 (including a tip) for 2 is expensive!
