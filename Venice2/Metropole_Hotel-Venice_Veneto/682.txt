If you could imagine yourself in a first class antique store offering an array of collectibles from furniture to do-dads, you can imagine your stay at the Metropole. It is a delightful hotel, with a friendly staff and with comfortable and well equipped rooms. You are surrounded by collectibles wherever you look, sit down, or sleep. Its fun, its different and its cozy. Located closer to the lagoon than the Grand canal. It nonetheless is convenient. The restaurant is first rate and the service is top notch. Highly recommendable
