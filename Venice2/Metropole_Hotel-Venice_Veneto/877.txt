The place appeared to be of 4 star quality but was very disappointing. The bagggage handling is very poor. You park on the other part of town and while the hotel recommended boat taxi service advertises bag service you are on your own. The staff appeared to have Attention Deficiet Disorder. We couldn't get anyones attention during check in. At check out the front desk was multitasking and the experience was poor. We did enjoy the room and the unique building. Too bad the service was so poor.
