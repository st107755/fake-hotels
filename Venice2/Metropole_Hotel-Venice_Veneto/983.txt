We spent a week at the Metropole in May 2006. Our room was small, but very clean and modern with a small balcony. What a view!  After reading negative comments online about the front desk staff we were surprised to find them both helpful and friendly. Our luggage got lost and they helped with calls to the airline (they offered to do this, we didnt ask). They gave us friendly greetings each morning and evening. The bar was a nice place to relax with affordable drinks. The bartenders were polite and professional, but kinda of quiet.  The hotel's location is perfect, just a short walk from St. Mark's square. About a 15 minute walk to the Riatlo Bridge with plenty to see along the way.    We got caught up in sightseeing and getting out and about each day and did not get to eat atâ€¦
