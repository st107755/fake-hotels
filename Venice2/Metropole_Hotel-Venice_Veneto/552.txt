We stayed at The Metropole for three nights at the end of October having travelled to Venice on The Orient Express.  The train journey was amazing and we didn't think that the hotel would be able to match it particularly in view of some of the comments on Tripadvisor.  We should not have worried. The hotel is fantastic, we loved it from the moment we were greeted as we got off our taxi. The staff were, without exception, friendly, courteous, charming and eager to please.  They all spoke excellent English but were more than ready to listen to our rudimentary Italian and help us to develop a better accent. The bedrooms are superb and the bathroom facilities are excellent, whenever we used a towel it was replaced before we needed it again, I couldn't understand how they could doâ€¦
