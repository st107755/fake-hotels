We stayed at The Metropole for 3 nights, August 18 to the 21st. We were a large group so we stayed in 3 rooms. My room was 211, a family room that was more than spacious. The staff at the hotel is beyond helpful and very friendly. We have stayed in a number of other hotels in Venice but they never seem really special. This hotel and it's delightful collections of unusual objects is a true gem and the staff raises the bar for anyone in the hotel industry.
