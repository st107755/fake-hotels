We stayed here one night prior to taking a cruise. We chose the location to be close to others in our group who were at the Hotel Danielli and, after seeing their room, am glad we stayed at the Metropole.our room was nicely furnished, clean, overlooking the back terrace and quiet. The lobby, restaurant and rooms have great atmosphere and the staff was very accommodating and efficient. Having a water taxi station off the lobby was a great convenience.
