Metropole is in the best location for arrival via taxi, walking to St Mark's square, vaporetto,shopping,Rialto bridge and most all of Venice to Roma. The rooms were comfortable,  bathroom were remodeled, nice size. The service was excellent. I would highly recommend the package with the breakfast included.  Directly outside the hotel is benches that many people sit on for hours eating gelato from the store on the corner and "people watching " . This area was the only public area that one could sit without purchasing food. The down side is the cost for a 5 star hotel that only meets a 4 star rating. The decor is very Venetian eclectic . Overall , I would definitely stay there again ! It is an excellent choice of accommodations .
