I fell in love with this hotel from the minute our water taxi pulled up to the dock to let us off. We took a water taxi from the train which was quite simple to do.  The staff here is amazing, attentive and professional.  The d√©cor is fabulous and we loved its "old world charm." The hotel bar was nice.  We loved it even though the drinks were expensive. Everything in the hotel Metropole was 10 stars. We traveled as a couple in the beginning of August. I would recommend this charming hotel to anyone going to Venice.  It was close to St Marks & the Doges Palace.  Just incredible.
