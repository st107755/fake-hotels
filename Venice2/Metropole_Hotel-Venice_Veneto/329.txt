Arrived here by water taxi at the hotels private water entrance!  We didn't like our first room and were quickly shown to another room which we accepted - no problem. Thus hotel is very quirky and retro with its many collections of memorabilia and antiques filling the corridors and reception areas of the hotel. The small garden is lovely - it was warm enough to sit outside here for breakfast when we visited in late May. The housekeeping was very good with clean fluffy towels provided, sometimes twic daily.  The buffet breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of foods on offer. All staff very professional and friendly. The front of house staff were excellent - very professional and courteous. Do not expect a modern contemporary hotel, but instead perhaps a touch of old Venice.â€¦
