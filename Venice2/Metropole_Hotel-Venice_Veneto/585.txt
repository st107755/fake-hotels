Spent two amazing nights in this hotel, it truly lived up to its five stars, we had a wonderful welcome, even took us into the room and explained the lay out. They were always on hand to help, I would like to commend then in their wonderful English!   The hotel was plush and elegant and filed with beautiful ventitian artifacts, the hotel has its own private launch for the water taxi. Was in an excellent position, overlooking the grand canal and lagoon, so handy for St Marks square, the Bridge of sighs was a two minute walk away. The breakfasts catered for every taste, with such friendly and accommodating staff. Cannot wait to visit again, wonderful!
