Wow, what else can you say about this hotel. My wife and I stayed one night in Venice and could not have picked a more perfect hotel. The hotel is locate right next to S. Marco plaza and is incredibly easy to get to. The charm of this hotel is wonderful and you feel like you are staying in a classical Venetian hotel. Rooms were spacious, clean, and the hotel staff was wonderful. It definitely was a little expensive but worth the extra money for a perfect romantic night in Venice!
