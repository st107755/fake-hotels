Just returned from a wonderful 3 night stay at the Metropole Hotel in Venice.  From check-in to check-out we were looked after well by all members of staff who were also all very polite.  We were fortunate to stay in the Damasco Suite which is on the third floor with a fantastic view over the lagoon.  Every day our room was serviced, shutters and windows opened and closed, towels changed, bed turned down.  Although there is a waterbus stop outside the front of the hotel and a canal on one side, this did not prove to be an issue with sleep etc although I am a very light sleeper.  The Oriental bar was excellent to relax in at night, although we did not try the hotel restaurant the food in the Oriental bar was first class.  The location was probably one of the best to our needs,â€¦
