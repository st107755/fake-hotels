This Hotel was amazing!!! Relaxing, Romantic, Beautiful, Great service!!! Wonderful breakfast in a beautiful setting. Some mornings we ate outside in the intimate internal garden. Venice is such a magic city and coming back to our hotel completed our experience. Listening the boats passing in front of the hotel was so relaxing!! It is only a 5 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. Our Room was amazing! A huge bed and nice bathroom with every modern amenity. The hotel restaurant, Met, is worth a trip by itself! I can't wait to stay here again!!
