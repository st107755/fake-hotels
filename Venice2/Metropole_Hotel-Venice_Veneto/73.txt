I am giving this hotel a three because the bed mattresses and pillows are not in pair with the quality of the hotel. The Metropol is suppose to be a five star hotel, but doesn’t meet the standards in very basic items. The Metropole is outstanding in every other way; service, location, decoration, and room size but the bed mattress are outdated supported with springs, so when the partner moves at night one swings along. The pillows are hard and not soft, goose feather like.  The other item that doesn’t work well is the air conditioner, does not cool as it should. I will probably look for a different hotel when visiting Venice the next time.
