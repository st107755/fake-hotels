Enter and you are in another world...a magical world filled with enchanting collections and decor... a place you haven't been before.  But the real magic is performed by the hotel staff.  The front desk is at once welcoming and eager to help in every way.  The service at breakfast puts sunshine even in a rainy day.  The hotel's MET restaurant is Michelin starred not just for the food but also for the gracious staff.  Located in the main tourist area is a plus as we were able to maximize our time and easily discover the magic of Venice.  We stayed in a junior suite with garden view - it was comfortable, very nice amenities and quiet.  Some rooms require walking up 6 or 7 steps even after the lift ride to the floor...if steps are a problem be sure to mention it when you reserve.
