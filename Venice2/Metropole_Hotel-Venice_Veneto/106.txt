We stayed here for our 30th anniversary and the hotel staff are all very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is quite eclectic and dark but that all adds to the ambience, our room wouldn’t have looked out of place on the palace of Versailles and was very fitting for Venice. We also dined at the Met, their Mitchellin star restaurant which was excellent. One small issued was that they hadn’t asked about allergies and brought out a dish my husband was allergic to but it was replaced with no fuss at all within minutes. A lovely hotel.
