We spent 2 nights here while we explored Venice.  The location was great, a very short walk to St. Mark's Square and right on the water (as is just about everything in Venice).  Our room was large and the bathroom was pretty modern.  While I didn't feel it was quite as deluxe as other reviewers it was certainly clean and well maintained.  Staff was very helpful and breakfast was great.  If you're looking for a nice property very close to the popular tourist destinations this will certainly fit the bill.
