We arrived via water taxi (70 euros, a bit expensive). We just got back from the trip and it was cold and windy in Venice. There were 4 adults and one 3 year old in our group. The hotel was perfect. We had a suite with an adjoining double room (#337 and 339). Beautiful rooms with a great bath in the suite #337. We had a view of the gardens below. No canal view from this room. The staff was polite and informative. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was wonderful. The ambiance is very Venitian and cozy. Breakfast is great and is included in the room rate. We felt welcomed and comfortable during our two night stay. The location couldn't have been better-on the grand canal. I recommend this hotel and would stay there in the future.
