Overall decent Just a lot of visuals going on.   The owner must be a collector of everything! Alittle gawdy for my taste.  Feels kinda spooky.   Our room was one of the low key decorated rooms but not happy with our bed that dipped in the middle.  Think its time for new mattresses.   The wine help deal with that.
