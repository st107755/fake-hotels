Prior to booking with the Metropole Hotel in Venice I had researched several hotels in the area.  We wanted a hotel that was centrally located, easy to get to, historical, and moderately priced.  Ultimately I decided on the Metropole though I did have concerns about some previous consumer feedback.  Though the hotel is located on the very busy lagoon side of Venice, and bordered by one canal, we found the Metropole to be quite and peaceful especially during the evening hours.  The Metropole has a peaceful garden and sitting room that is ideal for drinks relaxation.  All the staff we came into contact with were friendly and very helpful and spoke English well.  Most of our contact was with a staff member named Massimo who was always accommodating, helpful, and spoke English well.â€¦
