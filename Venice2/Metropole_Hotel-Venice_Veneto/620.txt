This hotel is right in the centre of the main attractions of venice. Very opulent but didnt spend a fortune on a room. Service by the multilingual staff was very attentive. Room we had was lovely, view was a side canal but you could look round into the bay - front facing rooms would attract a premium I guess. Nice breakfast- would suggest eating out for dinner though as the hotel restaurant was a bit out of our price range
