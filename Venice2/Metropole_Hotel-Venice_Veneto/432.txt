The hotel was beautiful, in great location, clean, good service and lovely food. We had two deluxe double rooms each room had different decoration with cozy Balconies with partial logon view and Good bathrooms.  The hotel had lots of antiques on display i.e. Fans, Beautiful Evening bags, Card Case, Corkscrews, Nutcracker and Crucifixes which were interesting to watch it was like a museum and they add wow factor to the hotel.  We stayed 3 nights at hotel during the Redentore festival and on 18th July we had dinner at the Mets Restaurant .... Delicious!!   It was an expensive hotel but worth it, If we go to Venice again we will definitely Stay there :-)
