This is a lovely hotel. The decor is amazing, with lots of interesting antique collecations, as is the location which couldn't be much better.  The staff were professional and always very helpful without, as another review suggested, smug insincerety. Our room, next to the canal was lovely, very clean and well decorated and well equipped (apart from of course the coffee/tea making facilities we Brits always miss so much). Breakfast was excellent with a good variety of lovely fresh food. My only less than positive comment was the Met Restuarant. The service was excellent but it was was very expensive and did not live up to expectations (previously had a michelin star).
