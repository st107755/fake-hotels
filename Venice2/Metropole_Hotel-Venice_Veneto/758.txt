My wife and I stayed at the Metropole for 3 nights in early January. This is a five-star hotel but was, unfortunately, really not worth its rating. We asked for a quiet room and were placed in a room on the first floor below a family room. For three mornings and nights we were woken by children running up and down and screaming and the father singing in the bath!! Not their fault (hotel or guests!), but in a five star hotel you expect some sound insulation. Our room was incredibly hot also and we had to have the window open to sleep. The rooms are adequate but no wow factor. We decided not to indulge in the 28 Euro breakfast!! I want to be fair. Location is fantastic on the waterfront near San Marco. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My wife is Venetian so we were sparedâ€¦
