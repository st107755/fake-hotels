Stayed for three nights with my husband.  Situation is great, staff are extremely helpful and attentive.  We ate at the Met restaurant in the hotel which was expensive but absolutely delicious.  I can recommend the tasting menu.  Breakfast was also fantastic.  My only criticism is that the baroque style of decor is dark and I find it a bit oppressive.
