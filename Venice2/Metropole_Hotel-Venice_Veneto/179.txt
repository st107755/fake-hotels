I stayed 5 days in Metropole hotel in Venice. I stayed in a very nice room. The staff in the hotel are very friendly and very efficient.The location of the hotel is great, 2 minutes walk from the vaporetto station. We did not eat in the Michelin star restaurant because it is very expensive restaurant (150 euro for a person). The hotel is expensive but I recommend this hotel and in my point of view when I compare this hotel to others, it is one of the best hotels in venice.
