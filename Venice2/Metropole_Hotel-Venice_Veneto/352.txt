This is a fantastic hotel in a great location. Our room was lovely, much bigger than I was expecting in the centre of Venice. The service throughout the hotel was faultless. Setting for breakfast made a lovely start to the day. Only downside was the cost of drinks - Oriental bar and mini bar in the room were beyond overpriced.
