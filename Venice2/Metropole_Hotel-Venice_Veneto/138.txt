Absolutely love this Hotel and I always make sure to pay it a visit every time I'm in Venice. Such character and ambiance it's a world apart when you enter the front door - check out the collection of antiquities in the hallway on the way to the restaurant. Bar is fab and the Aperol Spritz is not cheap but definitely worth it for the overall experience !
