Spent 3 days here as a surprise holiday for my birthday. The staff here are great and very helpful. Room was kept immaculate and food was fantastic. Would definitely come back again and highly recommend to anyone thinking of coming to Venice. Situated right by all the big sights and scenery ðŸ˜Š. Thank you Metropole x
