We stayed at this lovely hotel 10 March to 13 March.  We were two families with four rooms.  We had two Junior suites and a Deluxe and a Classic Room.  All rooms were great.  Everything was clean and very nice.  We enjoyed the restaurant for dinner and had drinks every evening in the bar.  We also enjoyed the breakfast every morning.  The staff and atmosphere were perfect.  We used the hotel shuttle boat numerous times which was very nice as well.  We highly recommend the Boscolo Venezia!
