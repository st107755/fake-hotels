We stayed at this property for 2 nights to start our trip through Italy.  I am a Marriott Platinum Member and was greeted and treated like one throughout my stay - although, I think they would've treated me the same regardless.  Because of my status, we were upgraded to a sea view room, which was great.  It was on the back side of the hotel through the garden literally on the sea.  There was a nice seating area outside our room and a really nice view.    Rooms are on the smaller side, but normal for Italy and still plenty of room.  Bathroom had a really nice soaking tub and beds are always comfortable.  We had  dinner at the restaurant the first night - it was pricey as to be expected from a hotel restaurant, but the food did not disappoint.  The parmesan risotto was excellentâ€¦
