I can't rave enough about this hotel.  First of all, the lobby is beautiful.  When we checked in, the people at the desk were so nice. There were lavender towels available to freshen up and a refreshing pitcher of water with fresh berries upon check in.  There were also containers of candy on the piano.  We are platinum so we got an upgrade to a room similar to what we saw while touring castles throughout Europe.  I felt like the queen!  Breakfast is served in the most beautiful garden.  Each day, there were 2 adorable rabbits at breakfast and the wait staff would bring out apples for them to nibble.  The food is plentiful and delicious.  The garden has a lovely walking path leading to the dock, where guests can pick up a boat to San Marco or Murano.  I'd only warn againstâ€¦
