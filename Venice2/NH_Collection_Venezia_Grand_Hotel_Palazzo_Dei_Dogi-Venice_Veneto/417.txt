This is truly an amazing property with a fantastic gardens on site and easy access to a water taxi stop and the hotels own private boat to main tourist areas.  The hotel used to be an old embassy and the decor and such is of that age.  It's very unique.  If your seeking ultra modern decor and such, this is not for you, but it does have up to date amenities.  The customer service was excellent throughout and the breakfast was very good.  Take advantage of the free water taxis the hotel provides and use it in conjunction with a day pass to the regular water taxis.  A great way to explore.  Ask for a room in the Garden or a view of the lagoon.  Further, ask for a higher floor if at all possible (the exception being the Garden Rooms).   I will stay here again if returning to Venice!
