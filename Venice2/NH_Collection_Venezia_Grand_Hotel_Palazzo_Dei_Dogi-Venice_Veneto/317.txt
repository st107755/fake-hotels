Pro: - The staff at the hotel were very friendly and accomodating.  - The breakfast was wonderful, well prepared, extensive and tasty. - The rooms and hotel are decorated superbly. One of a kind. - Located in a nice quiet are not to far from Rialto etc. - Excellent free shuttle service. - Great gardens.  Cons: - The shower did not work. Red hot / ice cold. Beware I feel it could be dangerous. The hotel were aware of this, whilst I understand it is an old building with perks, it is simply not five star. - The windows rattled a lot in the night making it quite hard to sleep. - I personally found the pillows quite uncomfortable (very subjective though) - I didn't really like the yoga class in the lobby outside my room which I wasn't told about and felt a bit awkward nearly walkingâ€¦
