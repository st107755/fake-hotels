My brother, his wife and I stayed at Boscolo Venezia and were. completely charmed by the staff and the hotel. We were quite comfortable during our stay. Our concierge Ivan was outgoing, helpful and cheerful in seeing to our request and in answering our questions. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice. Itâ€™s location is quiet and it is easy to move around Venice from the hotel. The staff felt like a family operation and it was obvious by their interactions that they enjoy their jobs.
