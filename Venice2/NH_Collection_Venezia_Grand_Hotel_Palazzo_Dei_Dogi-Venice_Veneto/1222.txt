We booked here at here last minute when our central European vacation was detoured due to flooding.  A short 5-6 hour car ride from Vienna to sunny Italy.  The service was great.  All staff was there to please you and make sure your stay was more than just good.  The breakfast more than good, since flourless chocolate cake as a choice is Ace's in my book.
