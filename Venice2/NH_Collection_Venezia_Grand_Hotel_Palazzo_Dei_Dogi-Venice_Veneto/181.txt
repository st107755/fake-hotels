We booked spontaneously (August) for three nights the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi. The Hotel is good situated in a quiet area of Venice, but still only 15-30 minutes walking distance away from the core of the city! Hotel has a nice garden, which is also the place where breakfast is served. The rooms are outdated and here our not so good experiences started. We checked around 2.00 pm in and were told that our room would be at 3.00 pm available and we would get an upgrade. We were pleased and went for a club sandwich to the garden (good service). At 3.30 pm we went back to the reception and were told that the room was still not ready. Five minutes later we were guided to our room on the top floor. When we entered we got a heat shock, the air con was running and showed 30 degrees Celsius.â€¦
