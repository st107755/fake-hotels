From the moment we entered the hotel until we left (after a late checkout, graciously added), we were treated like royalty. Very much appreciated the upgrades offered and absolutely enjoyed our little piece of paradise: a room outside with a terrace that overlooked the gardens of the hotel. Everything about this hotel was superb, from the breakfast offerings, to the hotel decor, to the aforementioned gardens. But especially wonderful was the service provided. So welcoming, with information on Venice, on the surrounding areas, and on the hotel amenities. Definitely would stay here again, no question. Thank you Boscolo Venezia!
