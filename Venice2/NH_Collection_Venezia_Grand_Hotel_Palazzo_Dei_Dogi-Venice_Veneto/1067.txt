We stayed at this hotel in April, 2014.  The staff was fantastic!  Ivan was the best concierge we have ever used.  He went out of his way to contact other Marriott hotels we would be using in Italy and even helped us book our train tickets.  Our daily breakfast was wonderful and the setting of the hotel is beautiful.  It has an old world feel with modern amenities.  You are on the quiet side of Venice that is away from the train station and cruise ports.  We also ate several meals at the hotel after long days of seeing the sights.  The food was excellent.  We were able to use points for our stay.  I would recommend.
