We stayed for 2 nights at the Boscolo Venezia hotel with our two children. When we arrived in Venice we decided to walk from the train station to the hotel. It is an easy 15 minute walk. There area couple of bridges with stairs to navigate but very easy.  Upon arrival we were impressed with this hotel. Check-in was easy and as a Marriott Platinum member we were given a personal welcome by the General Manger - a nice touch that we also experienced as the Boscolo Exedra hotel in Rome.  We were especially impressed with Martina at the front desk. She always called us by name, gave us great recommendations and booked any needed reservations, like a water taxi to the airport for our departure.  The hotel is an old palace and is adorned with beautiful chandeliers from the Murano glassâ€¦
