I booked online on the hotels website 2 months before arriving and had to cancel providing a full 30 days notice  due to unforseen circumstances and was refused a any refund. They claim it was a "special rate" and I only had 24 hours prior to booking to cancel (Thats insane!).   Poor business practice, I expect this from an online discount website, but not a Marriott Hotel!
