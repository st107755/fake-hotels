We spent two nights here. It is definitely out of the regular tourist area, but very reachable by vaporetto.  This hotel has a lovely garden and spacious rooms. The hotel provides a complementary shuttle from the front of the hotel to San Marco, or the island of Murano.  This hotel is part of the Autograph Collection of hotels which is managed by Marriott. We choose to stay at this hotel at the end of a cruise and are so glad we did.  The area where the hotel is located is the area where the Venetians live.  Nearby there are local, well prices restaurants for dinner.
