We managed to get a really good deal on this hotel/palace, which  has the classic venice style you'd expect. Great location off the noisy tourist track. Our room was very nice, if abit tired and worn, but clean and bathroom on suite was lovely. The staff were not very friendly and rather haughty.  If we had paid for a 5 star hotel we would have been dissapointed its more like a 4 star. The bar is very expensive but there's a shop on the first bridge if you fancy a night cap. Venice is wonderful going back again ASP..would we stay here again......proberly not.
