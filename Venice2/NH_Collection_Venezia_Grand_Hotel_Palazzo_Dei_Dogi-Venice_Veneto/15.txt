One of the most beautiful hotels I’ve ever stayed at. Everybody is so accommodating, especially Elisabetta in the Spa! She is an angel and saved my back with the greatest massage 😍 unfortunately Venice recently was flooded quite badly and I think every establishment is recovering from that with construction and whatnot, but it didn’t effect my stay at all. The location is perfect too because it’s away from all the tourists and more near local spots.
