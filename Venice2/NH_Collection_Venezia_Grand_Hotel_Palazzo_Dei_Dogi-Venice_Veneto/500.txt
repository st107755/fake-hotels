We were welcomed with a warm smile and excellent friendly attitude.  The room very spacious and dust free. We enjoyed the complimentary welcome sweets delivered to the room freshly baked.  The toiletry was perfect beautiful aromatic soap bar for washing the face. Clean towels. Breakfast area small but very warm and homely. Prefect water flow in the toilet. Complementary taxi to the nearby island.
