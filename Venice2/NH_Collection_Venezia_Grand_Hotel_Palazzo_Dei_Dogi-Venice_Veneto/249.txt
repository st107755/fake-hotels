We had a wonderful lunch here.Tranquil garden outlook from an outdoor refectory.The lunch was more than adequate after a long walk across the city of Venice.Sparkling prosseco with meats beautifully  presented.A lovely quiet spot for those wishing to escape the hussle and bussle of the S Mark square.
