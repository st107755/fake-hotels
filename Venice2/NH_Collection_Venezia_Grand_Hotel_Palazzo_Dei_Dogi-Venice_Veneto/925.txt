I loved staying at the Boscolo Venezia because the staff was extremely nice, professional and welcoming.  The buffet breakfast was delicious and had so many choices.  The room size and amenities in the room were terrific.  I had a spa treatment which I enjoyed. Every hotel stay includes an hour in the spa facility. I stayed there plus the treatment  which all felt great because I had been out discovering the city and walking everywhere.  They have a beautiful garden to walk through, and the whole building was built in the 1500s.  It really gave you a feel of how it must have been in the old days.   I found the hotel location to be excellent.  It's quick to get to shops and restaurants, and the hotel offers a free shuttle service to Murano and also the main square. Overall, thisâ€¦
