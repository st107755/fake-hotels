My wife and I spent four nights at this former noble palace from the 1500s and we both loved it.  The staff is attentive, warm and inviting.  Our room was beautiful, with period furniture and wall coverings and a view of the garden.  The breakfast was wonderful and we had an amazing dinner in the restaurant served by the entertaining Luigi, the restaurant manager.  The concierge was most helpful in setting up a tour of the island of Murano and it's nearby island of Burano.  Just a word to the wise - shut the windows at night.  Those mosquitos are killer !
