A peaceful location, just off the beaten track, very convenient for the water bus to/from the airport and only 20/30mins walk to St Mark's Sq if the mood takes you. The garden is delightful, the staff are friendly and helpful but the building struggles to retain it's full charm and character. The room was garden facing, a good size and very comfortable and peaceful with almost everything required, however, working the TV was a mystery with no instructions/channel guides available and (disappointingly) no apparent way to play radio. The bar is probably the biggest disappointment for a 5 star hotel, it is poorly stocked and not very inviting, despite it's proximity to the garden and the general presentation was definitely below the expected 5 star level. All in all a great stayâ€¦
