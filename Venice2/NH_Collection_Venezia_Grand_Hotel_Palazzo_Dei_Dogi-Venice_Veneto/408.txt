We stayed at Boscolo Venezia for 3 nights recently. The decor and the design of the hotel was stunning. Imposing chandeliers made of Murano glass decorated the hotel lobby beautifully. Also, the hotel is located on the banks of the lagoon (at Orto), yet at a walking distance to many restaurants and attractions. The hotel offers free boat shuttles to San Marco which is an added advantage. We dined at their restaurant once and the food was exceptional!   The only drawback I found was that the rooms did not have coffee/tea making facility. While coffee and tea was available at a lounge near reception, it was often cold. Secondly, the convenience of having it in the room is something that most of us are used to while staying at hotels like these.
