We arrived by train to the S.L. train station and having never have been to Venice called the hotel for assistance.  I was told that the 42 and 52 boat lines both stopped very close to the hotel or we could hire a private water taxi.  I was a little disappointed as the hotel's website mentioned a hotel shuttle and was expecting the shuttle to pick us up.  I was more disappointed to find that neither the 42 and 52 boat lines were not available due to a labor strike.  I would have expected the person at the hotel to know this information.  We paid 60 Euro for a water taxi to get to the hotel only to find out that it's actually a 10 minute walk from the train station...again, it would have been nice to have that information.  The food in the restaurant was not very good at all.â€¦
