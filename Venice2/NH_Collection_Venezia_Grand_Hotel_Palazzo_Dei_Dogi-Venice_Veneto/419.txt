This Venetian themed hotel with it's Murano glass chandeliers and lamps, period fresco, and charming Venetian decor has been our favorite hotel in Venice. Ask for a room with the lagoon view.  Located at the back of the property past a nice lush garden are a few room that have the quintessential view of the Venice lagoon right outside your window.  This hotel is located within steps from private water taxi as well as Alilaguna service and a short walking distance from all the attractions of Venice.
