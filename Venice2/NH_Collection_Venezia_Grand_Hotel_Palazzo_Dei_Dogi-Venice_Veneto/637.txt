Venice, our favorite city in Italy, especially AFTER the cruise ships leave in the afternoon/early evenings was better by staying at the Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel: Boscolo Venice, on one of the side streets/canals of the city.  The room, on the second floor overlooking a small garden, was small but adequate. The lobby was beautiful filled with Murano Glass.  This is not an inexpensive hotel so breakfast was NOT included and was a special price of $25 per person (vs $35 normally).  They did provide limited free transportation to St. Markâ€™s Square.  Up to the point where we stayed at La Mongolfiera in Rome, this was our favorite hotel of the Italian vacation.
