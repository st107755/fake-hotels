We had a great time at this quiet hotel which is just far enough away from the masses of tourists.  Phillip at the from desk made the reception experience very pleasant as he took the time to show us around the beautiful hotel grounds and explain how to get around the city.  The bar and restaurant service was first rate with Bane and Sara and the food was just as good as the service. The entire staff was professional and friendly.  The room was large and very comfortable.  Looking forward to our next trip.
