We came after the floods, and unfortunately the spa was still out of commission so cannot review that. However they set up a room with a massage therapist Elisabetta who was great! The hotel is beautiful and happy to be sat from the crowds. Itâ€™s also a very short walk if you take the orange line from VCE, very convenient. Staff at reception are extremely nice & helpful.
