We hoped the location of the hotel would make us to enjoy a short walk from the centre which turned not to be true. The hotel was too far for walking several times per day and later in the night it was difficult to get taxi boat. They provide with their own boat transportation but you need to book the seats early enough. Also to get to and from hotel by a public boat was tiresome and not flexible. The hotel  has beautiful design and fine style but the staff was not as good, somehow slow and not professional. Although it was not a high season when we were there and hotel was  not booked out, I missed a friendly atmosphere or enthusiastic spirit.
