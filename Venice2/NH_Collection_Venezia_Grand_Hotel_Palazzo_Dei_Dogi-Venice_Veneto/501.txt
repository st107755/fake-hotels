Beautiful hotel, if a little smaller than other Boscolo hotels, but the usual brilliant, friendly staff. Only downside is that for a 5 star hotel you expect tea/coffee making facilities in your room. There are facilities near Reception but we prefer to have our own in the room. Otherwise would definitely recommend this hotel.
