We have been to Venice several times but never stayed in this part of town before.  The Boscolo is a beautiful property, very quiet, with its own garden.  We think in the summer this would be a fabulous location, especially since the hotel offers a motorboat shuttle to San Marco Square several times a day (do remember to book it, however!) In the winter, it felt a little bit remote, but it took us away from the hoards of tourists--a major plus that allowed us to enjoy the magic of Venice.  You will probably get lost getting back to it...that is also part of the Venice experience!  There is a wide variety of rooms--some are out in the garden and at least one suite contains stairs.  If this is a problem, be sure to specify that you cannot handle stairs! The rooms vary in size. â€¦
