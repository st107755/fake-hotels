Most travellers I presume would want to stay close to Piazza San Marco or Rialto. We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews, and wow, no disappointment here.  We stayed for 5 nights at this amazing hotel. IT IS from AD 1500. How many hotels can claim that. We had a room overlooking the canal... and if you have a choice, get that. The day to day life of a Venetian unfolds literally under your window. The room is small as expected of an older building, and the washroom was an adequate size. The room is covered with moulding which we felt bad because it covers the lower walls and luggage tends to hit it.  The hotel offers free wifi, a beautiful garden in the back of the hotel, free "water shuttle" to Murano (to a glass shop) and San Marco. Definitely take the San Marco one.â€¦
