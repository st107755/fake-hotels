Easy to get to from the airport.  Just take the public water bus, Orange line, to the stop Madonna Dell O'rto (first stop).  You can see the hotel (look for the hotel flag) before you get off the water bus.  There is a short walk from the water bus stop to the entrance of the hotel but it is easy to walk with luggage!  They offer a ride to St. Mark's square which you should take advantage of and take the walking tour through the canals to get back!  The hotel was comfortable, the service was great.  English speaking staff was a plus! I would go back in a heart beat.
