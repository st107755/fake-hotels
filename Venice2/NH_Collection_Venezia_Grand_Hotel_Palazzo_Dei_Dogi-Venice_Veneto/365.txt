Located in a quiet neighborhood, it's a hike walking to the main touristy parts. They do offer free boat shuttle service from 10:30-18:30 running about every two hours to San Marcos. They also offer a shuttle boat to Murano 5 times a day. You can take the boat back, at the same spot in San Marcos. The hotel has the schedule.  The room had standard, comfortable Marriott beds, good wifi, and great A/C (This summer is hot). The breakfast is decent.  We took the water taxi for €120 to the hotel. Boscolo Venezia is one of the closest stop to the airport. We were there in 25 minutes. The view was nice, but unpaid the same price as would someone staying at a hotel near San Marcos Square that would have better views. I think it's not worth it for a couple, as you can spend €15 a person…
