This was our first time in Venice. We loved this hotel!  The location was perfect - crowds stayed away from this area but it was within easy walking distance of everything in town. The garden was well kept and very quiet - perfect for a relaxed stroll.  The staff was very friendly.  If we ever come back we know where we'll be staying!
