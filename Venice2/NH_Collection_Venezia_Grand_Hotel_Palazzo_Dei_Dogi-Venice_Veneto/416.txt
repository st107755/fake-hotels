Stayed just one night but wish it had been longer. Our hotel was on the ground floor of the annex with the lagoon lapping our wall and our window looking over it towards Murano. So lovely and quiet and the mattress and bedding were excellent quality. The hotel is in a great location for getting to everything easily but away from the crowds- best of both worlds. Would definitely recommend.
