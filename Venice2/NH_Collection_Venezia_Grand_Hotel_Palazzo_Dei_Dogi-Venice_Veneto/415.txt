If you want to stay in a hotel with the old graze still intact, this is the place. The garden is fabolous. You feel as if you enter the 19th century. We have stayed here twice now, and I find the area great. it is a bit of a walk to Plaza St. Marco, but that to me is the point. getting out of the worst crowds, coming to the narrow streets where the locals enjoy themselves is great. some lovely restaurants in the area too. you can also use the compimentary shuttle boat if you dont fancy the walk.  The hotel is old - this also means that the building is old and you can see it. Hallways a quirky, bathroom setup is a shower in the bath, but this to me, is part of the charm.
