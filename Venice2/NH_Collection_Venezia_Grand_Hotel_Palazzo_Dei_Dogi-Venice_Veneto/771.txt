The Boscolo Venezia is tucked away in a great residential neighborhood. Close to the Vaporetto stop at Orto and just a short walk from tremendous restaurants and local shopping. The hotel is very nicely appointed and the staff is extremely friendly and warm. The bartender makes an extremely good "fizz" with Campari, soda water, Prosecco and orange slice. He is very professional yet extremely open and friendly. The breakfast buffet and menu items are extremely tasty although a bit more fresh fruit would be good.
