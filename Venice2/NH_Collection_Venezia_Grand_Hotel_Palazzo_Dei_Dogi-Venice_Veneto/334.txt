I have never been so disappointed at a hotel anywhere in the world. The rooms are tired and badly overdue renovation. Our bathroom ceiling was stained badly as if from a flood, furniture was scruffy, the tv channels mostly did not work, cleanliness is average, the shower fluctuated between freezing and boiling constantly. In my opinion far from a 5 star international hotel. I have stayed in better b&bs. This is especially true when considering the (far from cheap) prices. Surprised the Marriott group owns this given its otherwise generally superb properties. When I raised the issues with management they said they could do no better than offer some loyalty points equating to not much at all. Avoid.
