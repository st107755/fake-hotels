We needed a holiday quickly so booked the night before 6 hours later we were at Manchester airport on our way to Venice for a few days. We loved it. Its a place to be seen, the atmosphere is fantastic no cars, its so calm and just what we needed as we were so stressed we just needed a break! We stayed at the Dei Dogi Boscolo Venezia, Autograph Collection. What can I say we had a room overlooking the front over the canal it was nice well apointed and comfortable bed. The staff were excellent we got delayed on the flight there and were stuck at Munich airport on the runway for 2.5 hours! So you could imagine when we got there we just wanted to get to the hotel, they had stopped serving food as it was late. However they were really accomodating they had the chef make us some roomâ€¦
