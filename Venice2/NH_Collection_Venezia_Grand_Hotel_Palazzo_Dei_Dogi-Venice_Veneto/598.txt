The Boscolo was an amazing place to stay.  The staff was extremely helpful navigating the City of Venice, which can easily get you turned around with the canals and bridges.  The breakfast everyday was top notch and very accomodating with my wife's gluten allergy.  We have long been associated with Marriott and the Boscolo is a very welcomed addition to the Marriott Family
