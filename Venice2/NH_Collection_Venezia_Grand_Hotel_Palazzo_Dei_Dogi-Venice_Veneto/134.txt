We stayed in one of the garden rooms. Nice private terrace (the weather was cold). The hotel is elegant but friendly and relaxed, In a quiet area with some small bars and restaurants (they do exist in Venice). Very close to a scheduled airport transfer stop and easy to get to more central parts of the city, either by free hotel shuttle or public water bus. 40 minutes walk to San Marco.
