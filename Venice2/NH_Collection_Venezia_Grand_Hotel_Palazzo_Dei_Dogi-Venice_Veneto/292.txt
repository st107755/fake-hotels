We arrived to the hotel very late at night and received a very warm welcome. Cookies at the Reception - lovely touch. I would like to underline two members of staff especially . Alessio night shift receptionist was great! Fantastic knowledge of the city and history, talks about city with passion and was happy to answer all our questions. He also Offered a room move when we mentioned that we would prefer to have a room with a view which was really kind and shows that he really wants to make our stay more enjoyable :) Mohamed that helped us with our bags was friendly, each time we were passing he was asking how were we. Claudio on departure was kind and offered to leave our bags. Rooms were spotless! And great size. Lovely breakfast! Waiter -Gentleman with grey hair veryâ€¦
