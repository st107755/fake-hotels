We stayed here for two nights.  It is in the north area of the island, super close to the water bus (and taxi) stop.   Easy to get to/from the airport (16 euros /pp for the waterbus) as it's a ten minute walk to the stop.   We also were able to get to the islands-Murano, Burano, on a vaporetto pass.    I'm a Platinum Elite status so we were upgraded to a really lovely room overlooking the canal.  Marble floors, massive room, decadent bathroom, etc. This hotel is like an art museum -- just before entering our room is a large room that contained artwork.  It also included breakfast which was wonderful -- wonderful buffet with prosecco :), as well as a hot entree.    outdoor gardens were a delight -- loved walking through them every morning.  Highly recommend this location.
