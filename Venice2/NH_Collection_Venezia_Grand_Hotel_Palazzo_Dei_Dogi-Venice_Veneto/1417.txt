We spent two nights at the Danielli prior to this  ( on points ) and much preferred this area of Venice and the hotel itself. Smaller , more personal service . Very nice room in the garden area . Loved the area surrounding for walking and it felt like a real place people lived in , not just a historical site . Great service . If I came back to Venice I would stay here again .
