I was overall unimpressed with this hotel.  It was beautiful dont get me wrong, but the location was very quiet and out of the way (unless you were taking the airport water taxi to leave Venice then it was very convenient).  It was hard to find from the main grand canal entrance.  The staff were very friendly and sweet and sent us up a welcome bottle of wine.  But our room was tiny, the bed was so uncomfortable, and the faucets made high pitched noises when we used them.  If you wanted to go to a restaurant, you had to travel back to the main canal entrance or take a water taxi.   Breakfast was plentiful.
