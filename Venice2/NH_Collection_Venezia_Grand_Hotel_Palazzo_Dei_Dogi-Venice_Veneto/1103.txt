We went though 4 different hotels on our Italy vacation and this was our favorite. The hotel is a converted Palace which continues to impress with every room. We had a canal facing room with a beautiful view of Venice. The hotel is located in a more "local" area that lets you immerse yourself in Venice. They have a private water taxi that will take you to Murano and St. Mark's Square but we didn't use it. You can walk everywhere from the hotel.   The hotel has a beautiful spa with a sauna, steam room, hot tub and meditation room that are all included with your stay. It was a great spot to sit back and relax as we traveled throughout Italy. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel.
