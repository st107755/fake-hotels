Front desk staff were helpful and pleasant. My issue was with billing. I am a platinum elite Marriott rewards member and accumulated enough points to use for 2 free nights. I stayed with my family and reserved 2 rooms for 2 nights. One room I prepaid and the second room I used points.   Upon check out, I was charged 279 Euros for my "free room" because they told me I had been upgraded and need to pay for upgrade.  I was not offered or given the option of upgrade and the hotel seems uninterested in rectifying this situation.   I would also comment on 2 other issues.  The rooms were right above the hotel lobby and you can clearly hear conversations and activity at all hours.   Second, we ate one meal in the hotel restaurant.  It was my families least favorite yet most expensiveâ€¦
