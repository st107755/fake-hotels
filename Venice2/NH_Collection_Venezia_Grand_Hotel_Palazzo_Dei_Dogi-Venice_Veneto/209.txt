We stayed in Italy for 2 weeks and this was, by far, my favorite hotel in the country. An Autograph Collection by Marriott, the service is phenomenal, the food was great, the gardens magnificent! We met some wonderful people at the bar on honeymoons or for very special travel. It's an expensive hotel, but worth the price.  You can walk to San Marco but it would be a long walk, so they provide a shuttle. Wasn't in love with the dinner suggestions from the concierge. We were sent to a couple of places that were tourist traps--so go on trip advisor for restaurant choices.
