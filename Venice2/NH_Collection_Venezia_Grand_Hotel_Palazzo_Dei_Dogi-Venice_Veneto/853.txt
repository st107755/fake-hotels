Lets talk about the "good stuff" first.  There is a LOT to like about this hotel.  Especially its location.  While some folks might like to be in the hustle and bustle of downtown locations, I don't, so if you do, you might disagree with me.  I absolutely adored the location in a quiet non commercial area of the city, but close enough to get anywhere you wanted.  Literally the Orto water bus stop is beside the hotel (around the corner in the back) which couldn't be more convenient to get to and from the airport.  This is a big deal if you've never been and an even bigger deal if you know what I'm talking about from past experiences.  Also to get to the out islands like Murano and Burano - its so easy.  Its also only a 15 min leisurely walk to the train station if that'sâ€¦
