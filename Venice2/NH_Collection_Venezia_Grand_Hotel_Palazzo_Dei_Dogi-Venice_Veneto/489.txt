We stayed at the Boscolo Venezia for 2 nights prior to a cruise in June 2016 and it was fabulous!  The staff was attentive and accommodating, the grounds were stunning, the rooms were spacious (we had a canal view)...all perfecto!  I would absolutely stay here again - close enough to the action and far enough for peace and quiet.
