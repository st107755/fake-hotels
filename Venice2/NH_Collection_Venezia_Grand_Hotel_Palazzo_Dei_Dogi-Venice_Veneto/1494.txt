Our family stayed at the Boscolo dei Dogi from New Year's Eve through January 2nd, 2011. We had selected this hotel from several options available through American Airlines Vacations when we booked our holiday trip to Rome, Florence and Venice. The reviews were mixed, but since most complaints centered on insufficient air conditioning during the hot summer months, we figured this would not be a problem at New Years. Unfortunately, while the hotel was acceptable, we concluded it was overpriced and certainly our least favorite hotel of the trip.  We traveled with our 3 daughters, ages 14, 12 and 9, and had two rooms on the 2nd floor.   Obviously New Year's Eve is a challenging day to arrive. The hotel had a large function downstairs, and we had no reason to be upset by the noiseâ€¦
