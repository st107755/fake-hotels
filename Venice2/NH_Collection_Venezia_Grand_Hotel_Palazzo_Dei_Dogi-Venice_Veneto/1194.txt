Stayed five nights on Marriott reward points.  Hotel situated on quiet part of city but within walking distance to all locations( or you can take their hotel shuttle to Murano or St Marco square)  If you are driving in parking at airport pretty reasonable ( $35 euros for five nights). Then short walk to water bus ($27 euros return). First stop Orta and hotel only a two minute walk  Staff is vey efficient and  vey helpful in recommendations . Great old hotel ( used to be French Embassy about 20 years ago) fantastic grounds. Vey good selection of premium and local wines at bar area. Good place to relax after hectic day around city.  Highly recommend hotel
