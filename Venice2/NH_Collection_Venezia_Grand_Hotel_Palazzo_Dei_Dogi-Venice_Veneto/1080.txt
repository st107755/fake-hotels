Very disappointed in the hotel given the price and that they call themselves 5 stars.  The staff was poor and inattentive.  At a 5 star hotel I should not have to open the lobby door ever.  Desk agents and concierge were indifferent and could not have cared if anyone was there.  While waiting in line a manager just stood in the lobby and looked at people.  Water could not stay at the same temperature and went from hot to cold.  The water taxi they promote only runs a few times and given the location is disappointing.
