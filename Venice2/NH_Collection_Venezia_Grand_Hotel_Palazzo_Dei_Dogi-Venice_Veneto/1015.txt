I had a hard time finding this hotel and thanks to the directions of a  gondolier, waitress, and an old Italian man I was able to find it tucked away from the crowded touristy area. At first I thought the area was deserted. I hardly saw any people around.   The hotel is "fancy" but lot of shady service. First occurrence, I had to get two (2) rooms for my family in which they implied it was a fire hazard to have two adults and three children in one room. We complied and got an extra room with points which was total waste because it was far from the other family members. Secondly they charged me 250 euros instead of 25 euro for a fee. That is a HUGE "mistake" especially when points was used for this hotel. Be sure to keep receipts and check your credit card statement afterâ€¦
