My husband & I stayed at the hotel two nights prior to a cruise August 8-10.  We had great service, everyone was very helpful, our room was updated and had a nice size bath.  My only negative is that it was extremely hot during our stay in Venice and the air conditioner in the room could have been cooler.  Venice was extremely crowded while we were there and we loved that the Boscolo was away from the crowds after a long day of sightseeing. In the evening we would walk to the surrounding neighborhood for a wonderful dinner. It was neat to be in a traditional Venice neighborhood and see how they live...we loved it!  I would definitely recommend the Boscolo to anyone traveling to Venice.
