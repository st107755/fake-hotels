A beautiful small hotel with a large garden area, off the beaten path in Venice. It is a 10-15 walk from the Water Bus stop at the Casino. It is away from the central area and very quiet. The rooms are wonderful with more than enough space. The breakfast is also wonderful; a combination of buffet with an entr√©e. The staff is excellent and will handle your every need. If you are looking for something different, not in the tourist areas, this is for you.
