The Boscolo Autograph Collection was one of the greatest traveling experiences in my life because you can see Venece in films and pictures but when you are there you are in another world. Then the Boscolo with the elegance, the treatment from the hotel personal, the location, the ambiance made this unforgettable once in a lifetime experience. I can write pages and pages about this place, but as I said until you experience it you will not know what dream I am talking about.
