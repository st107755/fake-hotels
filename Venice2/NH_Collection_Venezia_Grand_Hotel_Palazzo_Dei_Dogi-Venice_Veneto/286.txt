Convenient location that allows for ease of neighborhood exploration, quick airport service and a More casual tempo. Food is decent, breakfast is well presented, staff is courteous and knowledgeable.  The common areas are well appointed and have unbelievable Murano Glass chandeliers. The rooms are opulently sized, but it seems as though they ran out of money before they got to the rooms. TV's are too small, there is not a convenient sitting or desk area and the beds were just okay.  Better rooms, better rating. Otherwise, tip top hotel.
