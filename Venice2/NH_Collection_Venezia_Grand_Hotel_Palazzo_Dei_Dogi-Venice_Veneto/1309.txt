WOW this truly was an amazing hotel...The hotel is beautiful and away from all the chaos so this is a great place to come and relax. Breakfast, they need much more variety, other then that its very good! I'd come back anytime(: The staff is welcoming and very nice. The drinks and food could come earlier while warm. The water taxi's should be available until a later time. The garden is beautiful... The beds could be a little softer and more English channels would be nice, because watching CNN or BBC News can be boring for some people.
