This is a nicely appointed hotel in a quite neighborhood.  I'm a Marriott platinum member and stayed using points. We were upgraded to the next level up on room categories.  We had a view of the canal. Loved looking out the window at different times of day. We were up early enough to see how the laundry was delivered to the hotel. Kind of cool.  The rooms were plenty big for 2 people. Beds were comfortable and a mini bar/fridge in the room. The bathroom had a double sink and awesome bathtub.   The breakfast was included with our room and were able to order eggs and pancakes (hot items) from the menu. Also, had other tasty items to eat as a buffet.  My kids found the candy bar on the piano which was a nice touch.  Another nice touch, was coffee and water was available for selfâ€¦
