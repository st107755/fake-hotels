Everyone loves Venice, but not so much the tourist crowds, at times overwhelming.  This hotel is perfect for enjoying a true Venice experience. Quiet side canal, beautiful gardens, old world charm and atmosphere.  This was our splurge for our visit this year. We thoroughly enjoyed the private boat ride to St. Marks, it was like the "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" experience.  This is my fourth time in Venice and truly the first at such a palatial residence. It is off the beaten tourist path but easily accessible by Vaporetta or walking from the main train station. Our room did not have a deluxe view, but overlooked a small courtyard with flower boxes.  We had a full bath with tub, fair size room with robes and plush towels.    This was our trip to experience the quiet canalsâ€¦
