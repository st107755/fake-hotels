We stayed at this hotel a few nights before our Seabourn cruise.  After traveling for 16 plus hours from Miami, we were exhausted.  This hotel is easy to get to from the airport, by the way.  Just take the Aqualina to the first stop - Madonna De Oro.  Anyway, we arrived around noon and the hotel appeared to be very hidden in a quiet part of Venice.  The reception greeted us and took us to our room, which faced the Grand Canal.  Very private, very quiet.  Very elegant.  The grounds were immaculate.  If you are looking for romance, this is the place to go.  The morning brunch was wonderful, complete with champagne.  We were offered their free water taxi shuttle to St. Marks Square, however it was a quick walk, so we chose to see the sites along the way.  We will definitely stayâ€¦
