The hotel is in a great location - away from the tourist crowds and very easy to get to/from the airport.  The staff was very friendly and the rooms were great - gift of water and chocolate cookies on arrival was very nice.  Two things made it not ideal for us:  food was VERY pricey at the bar and restaurant, so it was impossible to just get a quick cup of coffee and breakfast item or afternoon snack cheaply.  We ended up then having to head out to get stuff, and there are options, but not without walking a bit (e.g., not within 1 or 2 minutes of the hotel).  There also is no fitness room - which seems VERY odd for an expensive Marriott property that has a full spa!  Like, there's no treadmill or bicycle, and it was rainy while we were there, so that would have been a niceâ€¦
