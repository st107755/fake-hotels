Location is good, on the main island but away from all the crowd. The hotel has shuttle taking you to and from Marco square, but not so often.  They also have a factory tour to Murano glass factory, but rather say it’s a factory tour, it’s more like shopping tour. Only 5 min seeing the glass blowing, rest will be someone tell you price of all their products, and keep pressing you. Not so pleasant experience, I would say.  Room is small but clean, comfort bed/pillow. wifi however is extremely slow.  All in all, we are satisfied.
