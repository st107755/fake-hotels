We have stayed at the Dei Doge twice now and felt like we were royalty!  We were treated with the utmost respect and service, just love both types of rooms we have stayed in.  We love the gardens with the little grotto's dotted everywhere but nothing could exceed the sea view we had when we stayed in the double floor apartment.  Amazing to look out over the Adriatic and all the little islands dotted right in front of us!  Magical!
