stayed two nights without little one (yes a romantic stay)  The good: - location: one stop to the airport, shuttle taxi to the St Marco or vaporetto close by it is a fair distant to St Marco, but nice walk - Away from the tourist area - nice restaurants near the hotel, with locals - nice to stay in a palace - nice shower,  - comfy bed - view on the canal - friendly staff - shampoo and shower gel made in italy.  The not so good: - a little bit tired.  Would i stay again: yes Would i recommend this hotel: yes
