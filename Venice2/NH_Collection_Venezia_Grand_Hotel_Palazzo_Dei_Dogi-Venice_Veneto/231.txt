A relatively convenient walk or an expensive water taxi will work in getting to this charming hotel, reminiscent of hotels in years gone by. Beautiful large rooms with antique Italian furnishings and draperies provided a great hotel to introduce our young grandchildren to an old European experience. The overall experience with the attentive staff, the expansive breakfast buffet and the relaxing environment made it perfect to relax in frenetic Venice.
