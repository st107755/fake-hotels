We stayed at the Boscolo for three nights at the end of October, the initial impressions were good, we dined their the first night. The meal was both disappointing and expensive, we did not eat their again other than breakfast, bacon and eggs but not as you know it, again rather expensive and not overly impressive, the continental version was good.  Nice large rooms, however, air con non functional, apparently been switched onto winter, therefore we had only two settings, "hot or off", seeing as it was not cold the rooms were uncomfortably hot.  Sorry still moaning, the plumbing is random, the worse kind of shower hot then cold and very difficult to find a mid point.  A lovely old building, interesting decor and fantastic gardens also the Boscolo is well located, St Marks a 15â€¦
