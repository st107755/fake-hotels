We visited in Late May 2019. This is our 2nd visit to this property. The first time it was just my wife and I and the second time we brought our family! AS is with everything in Venice it is so unique but this property is like and Oasis in a desert. What hotel actually has beautiful gardens in Venice?!! This hotel is on the Island but away from the tourist area/attractions like St. Marks Square. In saying this, they provide a boat shuttle to St Marks every hour starting at 10 am.  At check in the staff was so friendly and accommodating to our group of 9. The hotel was booked and they went above and beyond. We had 4 rooms booked, the check in was efficient and staff were friendly. The property is obviously very well managed as EVERY person that you encountered was friendly andâ€¦
