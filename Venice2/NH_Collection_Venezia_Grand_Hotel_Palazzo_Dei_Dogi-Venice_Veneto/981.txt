Our stay at the Boscolo could not have been better! The location was perfect for us. It's a three minute stroll from the Orto vaporetto stop in a very quiet part of north Venice. The building itself is, of course, very old but beautifully decorated and well maintained. The history of the property is very interesting. The concierge will be more than happy to educate you. There are very few gardens on the island, but Boscolo has one of them and it is premier!. The hotel has it's own beautiful wooden boats that provide scheduled service to San Marco and the island of Murano. The breakfast was FABULOUS! The breakfast area is in a courtyard adjacent to the garden. In case of inclement weather you are protected by a tent-like structure supported by a gorgeous wrought iron framework.â€¦
