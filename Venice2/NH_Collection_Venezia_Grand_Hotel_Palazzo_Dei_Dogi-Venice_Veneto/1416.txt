My husband and 2 grown children stayed here for 5 nights. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and I thought they were a good size, we didn't go to Venice to stay in the room all the time. We left in the morning, came back in the afternoon to change then back out for a while. The breakfasts are expensive, but they are good. There are pastry shops not too far from the hotel. They have a shuttle boat to Murano, from there you can get to Burano and from there to Torcello. I loved that the hotel was away from the "touristy" area, yet it was easy enough to walk to San Marco or the train station (if you want to go to Rome for a day). There are some very good restaurants not far from the hotel.
