 This hotel was amazing! Claudio took such great care of us from the moment we stepped into this amazingly beautiful hotel! Our room was gorgeous  and  our bed was so comfortable!   The spa treatments I had with Maria were simply out of this world! Maria was INCREDIBLE!!!  We enjoyed every minute of our stay here and we were definitely spoiled!
