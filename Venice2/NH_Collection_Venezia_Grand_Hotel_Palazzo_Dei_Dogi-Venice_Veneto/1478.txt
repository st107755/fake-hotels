This is a very beautiful hotel and the perfect place to stay in Venice during the summer months.  The public areas are immaculate and a delicious breakfast was served in an open sided marquee overlooking the garden.  There is a choice of ripe fresh fruits as well as cereal, nuts and dried fruit and yogurt.   To follow there is bacon, scrambled egg and sausage as well as cold meats and a variety of cheeses as well as croissants and different breads, jam etc.  Fruit juices and excellent coffee are also available.   The staff  are all charming and helpful.  The marquee also serves as the restaurant in the evening or you can just sit and relax there and have a drink.  Prices are on a par with London – but this is Venice at the height of the season.    The garden is well maintained…
