Venice was my second stop in Italy and the Boscolo was for me, the perfect place to stay.  It's a renovated palace and while still maintaining the elegance of a palace you certainly don't feel like you're staying in a stuffy, pretentious hotel.  The neighborhood is really quiet and filled mostly with locals and the restaurants and cafes are filled mostly with locals than tourists which is always a good sign and the food proved to be wonderful.  The hotel room was light and airy, decent sized with a comfy bed and good water pressure.  My only nit picking note would be that considering the age of the structure the air conditioning was decent but some days it just wasn't up to snuff and considering how hot and muggy Venice was when I was there a more robust AC would have been veryâ€¦
