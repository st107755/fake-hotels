We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel.  We arrived via train, and it was an easy vaporetto ride to the hotel stop.  The staff was gracious, the garden was lovely.  Our room looked over the front canal (small one with small boats).  It was large and very comfortable.  The breakfast was very good, although a bit pricey.  The hotel has a shuttle service to Saint Marks Plaza and also to the island of Murano for a glass-making tour.  The concierge, Evan, was unusually helpful in arranging tours and travel to our next destination.  When we return to Venice, we will stay at this hotel.
