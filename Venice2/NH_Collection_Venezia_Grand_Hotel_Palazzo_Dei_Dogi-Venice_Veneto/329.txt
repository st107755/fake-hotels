This lovely 300 year old building is a lovely hotel situated in the old Jewish neighborhood of Venice.  The neighborhood is residential with restaurants and shops a short walk away.  So happy to be a 25 minute walk from San Marco square and the crowds! The rooms were spacious and lovely.  The staff took great care of us.  The breakfast in the hotel started the day on the right foot.  There are canals at the front and the back of the hotel. There is a lovely garden. I wouldnâ€™t stay anywhere else in Venice.
