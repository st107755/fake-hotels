After staying in the main hub of venice this was a wonderful escape from the traffic of people and noise. On our arrival we were greeted by a pretentious women who had an inappropriate attitude, rather off hand. Once the nonsense was out of the way and we found our way to out hotel room we began to enjoy our settled environs. Our room overlooked a wee canal on the main hotel entry. This is great to watch people pass their day. A nice sun was shinning into our room.  We drank red wine and watched before exploring the garden out the back which is a soft and gentle setting. Our stay here was made more enjoyable by the proximity to all the local amenities and services
