We stayed in the junior suite with a view over the Canal (not the Grande Canal). The room was absolutely majestic. The room captured the overall feel of Venice perfectly. Laden with history in a very silent quarter (read; not boring!) of Venice. The bed was absolute heaven of gigantic proportions. I can heartily recommend this room and Hotel. It is not cheap but absolutely worth it.
