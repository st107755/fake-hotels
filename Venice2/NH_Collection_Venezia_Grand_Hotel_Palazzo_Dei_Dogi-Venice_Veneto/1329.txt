We had a wonderful stay at the Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.  Mr. Claudio and his staff were very gracious, professional and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The room was beautiful and comfortable and overlooked the canal and was close to local restaurants and outdoor markets.   As breakfast people, we found the spread delicious and diverse and having breakfast in garden room enjoyable.  This hotel helped make Venice one of our favorite cities to visit.
