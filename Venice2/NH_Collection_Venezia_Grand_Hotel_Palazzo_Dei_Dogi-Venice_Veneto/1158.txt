Venice for a long weekend and stayed at the boscolo for 5 nights, excellent hotel, quaint and very friendly staff. breakfast was excellent and the selection on the buffet was good and the cooked hot breakfasts were amazing. Room was nice junior suite with an upper sitting area that we never used. The location is perfect just far enough away from the tourist areas to be private. Took sea taxi from airport right to the hotels front door on a canal, the rear of the hotel is right on the open water to the mainland. worth a try.
