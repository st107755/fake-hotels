Great hotel away from all the tourist. Right on the water and the back grounds are wonderful. The staff was helpful especially Ivan the concierge he went above and beyond directing us and making reservations . The only negative was the water temp in the shower, tough to regulate, like some is flushing every 5 minutes hot to cold and back again
