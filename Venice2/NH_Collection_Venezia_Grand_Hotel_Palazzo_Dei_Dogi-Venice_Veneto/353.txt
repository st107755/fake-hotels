This is the third time we stayed at this hotel.We spent 2 night pre cruise. We love it ,great breakfast,very good staff,we love the garden  really,it is a great pleasure to sit there .There are everywhere many places to sit in each floor and it doesn't feel small like others hotels in Venice the hotel is full of charm ,each chandelier is a piece of art!!! The area is very nice,plenty of restaurants bar,wine bar and shop and not crowded like San Marco. One evening we had a small problem at the bar  but thanks to Chiara ,it is all good and we will return definitely to this beautiful hotel.
