Great service, quality rooms and lots of extras like taxi shuttles to downtown San Marcos, murano glass factory and more. Buffet breakfast was ok (nothing to write home about), but the staff service top notch. We used points to stay and this location treated us like a normal paying customer. Would stay again.
