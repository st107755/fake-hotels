Situated away from the crowds at Madonna del Orto, on the northern lagoon, and facing Murano this hotel offers visitors renowned Boscolo customer care and service, as well having its own wooded garden it is within a peaceful locale. The hotel provides its own launch service to St Mark's Square and the tourist delights surrounding it, as well as a complimentary guided tour of the Murano glass works. Within a few canals walking distance is a variety of reasonably priced restaurants which are well patronised by local residents. Shops for visitors' emergencies and needs are also nearby without any souvenir shops which predominate eleswhere.  As expected, hotel service is quietly efficient and discreet.
