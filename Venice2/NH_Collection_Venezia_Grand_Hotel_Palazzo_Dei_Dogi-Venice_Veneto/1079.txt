I stayed here for a long weekend with my daughter (15) and my parents who are in their sixties. The hotel was in a lovely quiet area away from the madness of St Marks but still near enough to get easily into the centre. The rooms were lovely-clean and luxurious. The staff were very helpful and as was our experience generally in Venice, went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Don't forget to visit the exquisite garden during your stay.
