The Boscolo is a few alleys away from the main streets through Venice, which means a little extra walking but also a nice, quiet location.  Its still an easy walk to the major attractions.  Our room had a beautiful view over the canal and the hotel is in a lovely 16th (?) century building.  The staff was fantastic - always very friendly and helpful.  The hotel's water taxi was convenient for catching a ride to Murano Island or San Marco.
