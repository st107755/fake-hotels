Situated on the lagoon, this boutique hotel is a charm. A lovely garden setting with tall trees, winding paths and even a waterfall separates the hotel from its private pier on the lagoon. The attentive staff, though, is the real highlight. Whether it's the accommodating breakfast crew or the informative concierge, everyone is looking to make the Venice experience memorable. On our recent stay, Ivan mapped out a five day plan that covered all aspects of the city. With several dining and shopping opportunities within walking distance, the hotel is perfectly situated on a canal away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist centers.
