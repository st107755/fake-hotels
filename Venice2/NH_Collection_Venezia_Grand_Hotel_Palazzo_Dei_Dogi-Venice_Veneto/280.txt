Boscolo Venice is truly a first class hotel. For those travels that enjoy luxurious accommodation's, this property over delivers.  The service was above and beyond our expectations, and every employee made us feel special.  Boscolo is literally a Venetian Palazzo (previously a private residence and embassy - a long storied history) oozing with charm and decadence.  We also enjoyed the many different levels and comfortable/classy sitting areas to simply relax and enjoy from the hustle and bustle from the center of town.  The buffet breakfast was simply stunning and the lobby bar was inviting.  Again, customer service was top notch and they were very attentive and responsive. Thank you for making our vacation that much more special, Boscolo Venice!
