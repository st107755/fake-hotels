This place is in the middle of NO WHERE.  It's outdated and they are extremely unhelpful.  They scheduled a canal tour for us - told us to meet the guide at a generalized location and they never showed.  Couldn't even get our money back.  The internet is HORRIBLE there as well.  We are young, so we didn't mind the long walk into the hustle and bustle of Venice, but anyone else would have said 'the hell with this!".  Never again.    OH - and the push the MURANO GLASS tour on you like there is no tomorrow.
