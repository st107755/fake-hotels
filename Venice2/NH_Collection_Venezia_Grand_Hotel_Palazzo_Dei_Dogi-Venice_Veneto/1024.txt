Our stay couldn't have been better. As a Boscolo hotel member, we were upgraded to a junior suite accessible only by private elevator. Spacious, clean, and a marvelously large bathroom....especially by European standards. Staff was great,location away from the maddening crowds, and still close to everything by vaparetto. Definitely recommend the Boscolo Venice.
