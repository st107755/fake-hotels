The hotel is absolutely beautiful! We had a room with a view of the water which included a walk through the garden to an open patio leading to our room. Breakfast wasn't included but the price was reasonable. The staff were friendly and accommodating and the room clean with a wonderfully comfortable bed. Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Venezia.
