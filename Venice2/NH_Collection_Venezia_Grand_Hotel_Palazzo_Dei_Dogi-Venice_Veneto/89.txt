Checked into the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi in Venice Italy on July 12, 2019. One word comes to mind.  Eloquent.  The staff and hotel are exactly what I had hoped they would be welcoming and accommodating. The place is beautiful and the staff friendly.   There are views and food and wine and all that screams Italy. . The rooms are large and spacious and the AC is a welcome gift after a day in the sun.  I give all 5 stars to this hotel.  I couldnâ€™t be more pleased.
