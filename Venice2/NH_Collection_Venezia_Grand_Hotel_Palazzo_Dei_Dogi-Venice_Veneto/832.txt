This is a great European hotel, located well away from the bustle of St.Marks Square, but is still only a 20 minute walk. The hotel is comfortable and ornately decorated to represent the city of Venice. The rooms are modern, but still reflect the time and place of old Venice- located right on one of Venice's minor canals. Romantic and elegant!
