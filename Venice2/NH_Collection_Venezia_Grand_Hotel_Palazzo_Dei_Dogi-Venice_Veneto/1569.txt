My husband and I have taken 3 nights at the Hotel Dei Dogi in Venice for 2 years running, and are about to make it 3.  We go in November, when our own hotel is closed.  We love it--the location is perfect, on a quiet canal within interesting walks of great small restaurants, some shopping, some beautiful views and a small church next door with great art.  The staff is helpful and friendly.  We have never eaten in the hotel restaurant, and do not always take breakfast there, though it is a lovely spread.  We feel we are now recognized by some of staff, and it is really "home from home" in Venice for us for 3 glorious nights a year!  Our rooms have always been very nice, and beautifully maintained.
