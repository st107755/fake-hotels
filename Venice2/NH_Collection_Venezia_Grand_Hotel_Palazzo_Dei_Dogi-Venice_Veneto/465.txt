My husband and I visited Venice for our first wedding anniversary. The Boscolo Venezia definitely exceeded our expectations. From the moment we stepped in to appreciate the chandeliers and artwork, we were greeted with friendly faces. The team at the reception desk were ever-willing to offer us advice on the best tourist sights, as well as how to get around the magical walkways. Breakfast was delicious and we thoroughly, the rooms were spacious and extremely clean!! I hope that we have an opportunity to return to this wonderful location.
