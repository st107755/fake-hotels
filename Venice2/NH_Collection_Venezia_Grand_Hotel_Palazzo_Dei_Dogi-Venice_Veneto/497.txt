This hotel is is a perfect spot for travelers touring Venice.    We used our Marriott points, and they upgraded us, and treated us like kings.  We loved the location, just far enough away from the major tourist attractions, but close enough to get there in minutes.

The presentation was wonderful, the food very good, and the service was fantastic.  The hotel offers a boat service to take people into the main city area, it's about a 10 minute ride.  We used this once, but honesty,â€¦
