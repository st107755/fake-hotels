we went to venice 19th jan for 2 nights a gift from my boss .  he had booked us on ba flights,  flight ok but the ba service has gone down hill meal on flight both ways  was a sandwich that wasnt nice.  2 years ago we flew domestic to newcastle and got a hot yummy bref for a 45 min flight here we flew 2 hrs and got a manky roll.  before we went i had bought venice card for transport , with alliguna inclusive .  when we landed in venice we picked up our cards and walked to the alliguna stop.  we knew we needed to get to madona d'orto stop and asked the clerk the best way to go he said take blue line to murano. from there we got the water bus to our stop 3 stops later really easy and this stop is really close to the hotel.  however the alligua was the only place our tickets gotâ€¦
