Beautiful extravagant boutique hotel.  What a shock from our Boscolo Hotel we stayed at in Milan (modern), this hotel was like stepping back in time.  We had a canal view that was so picturesque.  I loved the location, very quiet, with a 3 bridge walk to busier streets in Venice.  Comfy beds and pillows, well appointed baths. The gardens are so beautiful behind the hotel.  Once again, excellent customer service.  The front desk arranged for us to share a water taxi with another couple (so 1/2 price for each of us), since the time we needed was booked up.
