I have just returned from a 6 night stay in Boscolo Venezia, and I can say that the hotel was excellent.  We had a great trip, and the hotel is absolutely beautiful.  We had a king bed that overlooked the neighborhood to the left of the hotel and the Madonna Dell'Orto Tower.   We had great weather last week and slept with the windows open and woke up to the church bells every morning.  The hotel staff was very friendly and greeted us every morning and every evening when we came in.  They answered any questions and offered maps and directions.   The hotel garden is beautiful, and I enjoyed taking a cup of coffee every morning to the end of the garden and standing on the pier in the back of the hotel.  This hotel is away from the crowds, but there is a grocery store, restaurants,â€¦
