Very nice hotel. We had a suite for 3 people and it had plenty of space. The room had a loft with a pair of twin beds and downstairs had a king.   We enjoyed dinner in the restaurant for one night.  Very good  Tips-  visit the garden in the back. It was wonderful. There a couple of rooms off the garden. They would be fun to stay in during our next visit.
