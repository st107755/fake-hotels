Great hotel away from the main streets of Venice.  Friendly staff throughout the hotel who are very willing to help. We stayed in a first floor garden room which means a walk through the gardens to get to it. Nicely decorated and larger than our friends room in the main hotel. Excellent buffet breakfast included in our stay. The complimentary boat to Murano is a bit like a timeshare trip. You are met at the dock by pushy sales staff who want you to buy vastly expensive glass. Get the local water bus and look around on your own terms
