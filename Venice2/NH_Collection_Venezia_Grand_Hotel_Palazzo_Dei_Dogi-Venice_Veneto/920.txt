This was way away from anything, much less restaurants or sites!  It was worn down and worn out.  The shower leaked so bad we used both robes and every spare towel to sop up the flood.  NO face cloths.  Sitting on the thin mattress put you right thru to the hard platform bed.  It was a 2 ¼ mile walk to St Mark's square over many bridges.  We paid €50 for a COLD buffet breakfast.
