Everything at this hotel (except the bar and restaurant prices) was fabulous.   The hotel is immaculate and beautiful, rooms are very well kept.   Towels are nice and fluffy and heated!   The quality of toiletries is superb, slippers, nice shower and beautiful marble.  We had a nice room with comfortable king (2 twins) on the 1st floor overlooking the canal!  I made the mistake of thinking i would get free breakfast from either Bonvoy or Amex Fine Hotels and didn’t book the breakfast package for about $15 more per night and they wanted to charge $60 day for breakfast!  When I checked in, was told $25 each but when I went to order, was told I only got that rate if I chose breakfast for 2 days, I.e. $100 more!   No executive lounge and the owner has decided to get rid of Marriott…
