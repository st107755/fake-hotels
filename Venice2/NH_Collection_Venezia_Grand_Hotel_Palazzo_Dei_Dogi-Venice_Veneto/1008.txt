From the second we walked into the hotel we knew this was going to be a special experience.  The staff is attentive, professional and extremely accommodating. In short they were fantastic during our stay, not once did we feel that we were not their number one priority. I can't thank the staff enough!!!! The room was pleasant, charming, spacious, and comfortable. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of Venice which allows for a quieter stay and better food at a less expensive rate.  I read some reviews about the room being outdated, well we do not feel that way.  The room added to the charm and ambiance of the hotel and Venice.  For goodness sake do not stay in your room, this is Venice get out and explore there is so much to see and do, not to mention relaxing in theâ€¦
