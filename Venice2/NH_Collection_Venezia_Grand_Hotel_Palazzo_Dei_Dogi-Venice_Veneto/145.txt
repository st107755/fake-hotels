This hotel feels very Venetian, close to the Ghetto and public transport but in a quiet and pretty spot. We took one of the few rooms overlooking the charming canal (room 105) and were pleased with our choice. The bedroom is a good size and comfortable, although the decor is too busy and old-fashioned for our taste. With its thick carpet and fabric-lined walls, it was extremely quiet, which we certainly appreciated. The bathroom was supplied with great Aqua di Parma products. The concierge was particularly helpful and pleasant. We would happily return here.
