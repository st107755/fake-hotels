This hotel is very nicely located for easy access on arrival via water taxi from the airport. It is far enough away from the central tourist buzz yet still walkable. And the rooms are small but very comfortable. The grounds offer a very tranquil sanctuary for those needing to connect with the moon and the stars. Venice can be very claustrophobic, and this hotel offers one the opportunity to meditate the buzz away.
