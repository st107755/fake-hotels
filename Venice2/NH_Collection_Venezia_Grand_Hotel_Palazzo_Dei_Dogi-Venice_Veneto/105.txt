Great service, but THEY WERE DRILLING RIGHT OUTSIDE MY ROOM  Pro's - Clean Room - Great Service - Nice Staff  Cons - Individuals were DRILLING right outside my room, woke up my baby SEVERAL times. See pictures - I'm a platinum elite member and no upgrades were available - TINY ROOMS, could hardly fit my 2 suitcases and stroller - Ancient TV, hardly any room to watch  Overall, ruined my trip as the drilling was reprehensible and disappointing.
