This hotel was amazing: beautiful and friendly. The rooms and hotel were decorated very well. The staff were helpful and friendly. We had a communication problem before arriving; maybe due to time difference and language difference, but it all worked out fine. BIG SUGGESTION: Book your transportation through the hotel. It was a little more expensive but so worth it. Our transportation to the hotel from the airport - I felt like royalty. And then we had them arrange the transportation to the cruise terminal; equally as good. Breakfasts were good; coffee was OK not great. Location is in the quiet side of Venice. But everything is walkable from the hotel. I loved this place - I would go back there in a heart beat.
