My wife and I stayed in the Junior Suite as a part of our honeymoon. The room is extraordinary, room service has been great, and the bathroom is awesome. The staff has been wonderful, and the hotel provides complimentary shuttles to Piazza San Marco, as well as a glass factory on the island of Murano. The location is definitely a hike away from most of the tourist spots, should you choose to walk rather than take the shuttle. However, the atmosphere is more lax, and the neighborhood walkways are not shoulder-to-shoulder like the rest of Venice.
