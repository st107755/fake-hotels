The Boscolo is a beautiful building with a gorgeous little garden.  It is out of the main tourist area of Venice, however the hotel provides a free water taxi service to the Piazza San Marco.  The water taxi operators were great and acted like tour guides, always going in a different direction so that we could see different parts of the city.  The staff were fantastic.  The best thing to do is just get out and start walking...So much to see and such a beautiful city.
