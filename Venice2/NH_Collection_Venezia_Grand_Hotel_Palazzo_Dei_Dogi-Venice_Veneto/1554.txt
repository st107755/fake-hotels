Taken to Venice as a surpirse for my 40th Birthday!!  It was somewhere I had always wanted to go and it certainly lived up to my expectations. Hotel was recommended to my partner.  We found the Hotel to be very nice, the room was lovely, overlooking the lagoon.  It was not in the centre, but we knew that, however it was lovely to take the private boat into the town (20 minutes) or to walk only took half an hour (maybe longer if you stopped at all the shops on the way).  Didn't eat in the Hotel, we had been recommended a couple of restaurants to eat in.  Hotel has a garden, which is unusual in Venice.  Staff were very helpful, tea  and coffee was lovely, with free nibbles too!!! Gondola was brilliant and not to be missed!!  Coffee in the square was expensive, but well worth it.â€¦
