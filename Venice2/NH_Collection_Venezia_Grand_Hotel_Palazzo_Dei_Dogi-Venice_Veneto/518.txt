We had a wonderful stay. Our room was right on the water with a view to Murano. The staff was fantastic. Breakfast was a feast but I would have gone elsewhere if I had to pay the going rate of 35 euro. While our room was lovely, the walls were very thin. I felt like I was in bed with the couple above us - from the snoring to the (well, you know what couples do) I had trouble getting a restful night of sleep. I would stay again but maybe in a room that was a single floor.
