And after seeing the crowds on the Grand Canal, we were very glad we chose this quiet, historic and very friendly hotel.  The folks at Marriott scored a home run with this one.  Breakfast buffet was the best we had in Italy and service was equally up to Marriott's standards.  For those making connections to the cruise terminal the staff will arrange a water taxi from the dock in front of the hotel directly to the cruise terminal.  Only reason this hotel did not rate Excellent was the trek required, with luggage, from the Vaporetto stop to the hotel.  No signage.  Arrangements could easily be made to use a golf cart to pick up arriving guests.
