We enjoyed our four-night stay here. We had a two-story suite at the back of the magnificent garden which attracts beautiful birds (the Eurasian Blackbird for instance). The hotel is lovely and the staff is first rate. The breakfast buffet is terrific, with excellent choices and even eggs to be ordered. The bar is elegant and a lovely place to come back to after our evening adventures. Claudio, at the front desk,  recommended two terrific restaurants and we went to one of them twice we liked it so very much.  Every one at the front desk was incredibly helpful and pleasant. The staff rates five stars even if the facility itself does not. That's not a criticism of the facility. I save my five star ratings for the truly exceptional places I have been and this is just once notchâ€¦
