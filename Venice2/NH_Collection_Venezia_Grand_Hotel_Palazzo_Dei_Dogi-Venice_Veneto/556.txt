We arrived in the evening to this beautiful hotel. Located in a quieter part of Venice, but easily accessible to all the sights.Its deceiving from the front, as you would expect a small hotel.  But it is lovely inside, with gorgeous gardens and pathways.    Claudio the manager was invaluable in helping us find the perfect restaurants and giving sightseeing advise.  At the end of day we were warmly greeted by all the staff, a fresh clean room overlooking a beautiful garden.that was just steps away from a gorgeous canal view.   Eddo the barkeep was friendly and welcoming.  The hotel has a free excursion to a Murano glass factory that was quite enjoyable.  The rooms were quite large and comfortable.  We loved our stay and cant wait to come back!
