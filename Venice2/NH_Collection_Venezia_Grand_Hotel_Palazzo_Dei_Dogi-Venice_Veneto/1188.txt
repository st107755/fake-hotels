The Boscolo is a superbly charming hotel in Venezzia, located away from everything, which makes it in an area less crowdy. So if you like to be in the middle of the crowd, Boscolo is not your perfect choice. I honestly loved the location, as i found Venice to be very crowded with tourists and loved being a little away. The food is amazing in the hotel, and it is just such a beautiful hotel. The staff was nice.. Overall i loved Boscolo
