This Boscolo Hotel fronts onto a canal and backs onto the lagoon.    This means that you get the traditional Venice feel when approaching from the front, and the convenience of getting to the 'action' in St. Marcos Square easily from a 'water shuttle' from the back of the property.  Great location for the best of both worlds.
