Spacious, elegant room with wonderful a/c in hot/humid Venice in August.  Free water shuttle from the hotel to the heart of the city allow you to have the best of the Venice experience while keeping your sanity, and your cool! The staff is professional, courteous, and friendly.  Ivan, the concierge, was wonderful!  He arranged a Murano tour and multiple transfers - flawless execution.  The well-equipped spa eased aches & pains of travel, but could have used a receptionist to cover the desk when the staff were busy.  Free wi-fi, but we seemed to have problems staying on the network. The gardens were lovely, providing a quiet place to relax with a book and glass of wine. Belissimo!
