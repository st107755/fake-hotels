Beautiful Hotel and well appointed.  Very clean and well maintained at all levels.  However, be aware that the shuttle that is advertised is only available on a very limited basis... if you dont take the shuttle your only other options are a 75 Euro taxi ride each  way....(not kidding)  or you have to walk to the water taxi stand 3 bridges away.. If you have limited mobility, this is NOT an option.
