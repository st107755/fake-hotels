Very chic and historic Hotel, very different to others Marriott brand. We stay there for one night , location perfect away from heavy tourist area. The room No 218 is dated and well maintained, The manager was very friendly to us , he help us to pay the taxi boat as we did not have enough Euro only Card and Aussie dollars on us. We did not enjoy all the facilities as we check in at 4 pm and check out around 1 pm.
