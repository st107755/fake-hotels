If you want to be away from the mad crowds along the Grand Canal and San Marco,  this is the place to be.  Whisper quiet at night yet quiet a number of restaurant options in easy walking distance.    The folks out front treated me very nicely and upgraded at to a suite that was as wide as it was high.    Concierge Ivan was so helpful and patient  on directions and helpful tips,  a real asset to the hotel.    Breakfast very nice with indoor and outdoor (garden)  options.    Staff everywhere were very nice  Don't bother with water taxi to and from  hotel .  The vaporettos come by within 200m of the hotel constant and costs you 15% of the taxi cost.
