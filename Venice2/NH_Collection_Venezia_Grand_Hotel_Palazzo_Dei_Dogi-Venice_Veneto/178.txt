The hotel didn't win us over with luxury, but instead with the charm of Venice. Grand room, albeit with a sloping floor, that made us feel we were in a special place. The hotel is in a nice neighborhood, away from the tourist throng, and it's easy to get there by either boat (Orto stop) or a walk from the train station. We highly recommend it.
