Away from the crowds of the tourist spots. Was an embassy years ago with glass chandeliers and murals. Great gardens in the back for strolling. Saw a wedding being conducted there. Free shuttle to St Marks Square. Very  good breakfast alternatives and Venetian restaurants nearby. Staff helpful. Would stay again and recommend.
