We stayed at Boscolo Venezia for our anniversary in Italy. The very first impression of the hotel was spectacular. The hotel lobby and entrance is simply beautiful. We had booked this hotel with the free club card points with Marriott, hence didn't have to pay the full price for the room. The room we had was a junior suite, with a private lift to the room. It couldn't have been more perfect :) But when we looked up the prices for the room on the net it came around £350 per night, which we thought was a bit on the expensive side, but Venice is anyways an expensive city and this is a 5 star hotel so probably comes around right. The rooms were huge and very well kept. Had a separate lounge and dinning area. Bathroom had a separate shower area and tub. We were surprised to know that…
