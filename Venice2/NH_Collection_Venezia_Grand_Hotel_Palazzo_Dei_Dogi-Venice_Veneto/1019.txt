We stayed two nights at this beautiful boutique hotel in a quiet corner of Venice.  Our very large junior suite was lovely and accommodated a small family quite well.  When it came to service, however, the hotel came up short.  Emails sent in advance of our stay to inquire about parking and logistics were flat out ignored.  The front desk staff had very little knowledge of the area and referred only to the typical touristy restaurants and sites.  Finally, the internet worked at a snail's pace and required multiple log ins each hour to stay active.  I can imagine how difficult it is to run a business in a city of canals. While I would likely stay here again, I'd love to see the hotels service reflect its prices and location.
