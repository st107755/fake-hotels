I absolutely love this hotel !! It's classic Venice but without being in the hustle and bustle of the city.  I love the garden and being able to over look the lagoon.  They offer a complimentary shuttle to San Marco so you feel like you have your own private boat :- ) Front desk is very helpful.  Also you are literally a 3 minute walk from the boat that goes directly to the airport which can save you some Euro ...
