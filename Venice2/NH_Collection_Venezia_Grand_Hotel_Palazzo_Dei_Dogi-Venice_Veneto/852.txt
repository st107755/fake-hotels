This hotel, thankfully, is a bit away from the maddening crowds of San Marco (St. Mark's Square). We took water taxis from the central part of Venice to this hotel (takes about 10 minutes) and were very glad we did. It let us see more canals than we would have otherwise, the hotel was in a beautiful and quiet place, and the room we had was quite nice. There is a large and beautiful garden as part of the hotel. We also had one dinner at the restaurant, which was very good. The service and staff were great. I would stay at this hotel again, no question.
