First of all, this hotel is so easy to get to from the train station and without having to take an expensive water taxi. Four stops on the vaporetto and a three minute walk to the hotel! You enter into a gorgeous lobby with huge Murano glass chandeliers and you feel like you're in what you always thought a Venetian hotel would look like! The room was spacious and beautiful and the breakfast in the gardens was extremely nice.  We booked the hotel boat the next morning and took a wonderful ride to St. Mark's Square. We had a really nice walk back, over many bridges and canals, and stopped halfway for lunch. It was about a 25 minute walk.  The hotel is in a more residential area called Canareggio. The many restaurants that are walkable are where the locals go. We loved staying inâ€¦
