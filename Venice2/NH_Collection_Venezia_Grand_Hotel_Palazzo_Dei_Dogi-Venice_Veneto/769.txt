We stayed here for 2 nights in October and coming from the Boscolo Exedra in Rome, I had high expectations. The location is nice and the people were very friendly, but our room was horrible. We were in a Superior room and it was so dilapidated and in need of work. The floor was awful...crumbling away in spots (which felt lovely to walk on barefoot) and faded into several different colors. The floor above us was so creaky, I thought our upstairs neighbors were going to come through the ceiling. And when we turned on the water in the bathroom sink, we had an ear piercing whistle every time. We paid a lot of money to stay here and were sorely disappointed.
