We stayed here for 2 days pre-cruise. Had a room on the 2nd floor, canal view. It was very peaceful and away from the big crowds at San Marco and Piazzale Roma. There is a beautiful garden in the back with a path that leads to the dock where the shuttle is to San Marco. The staff were unfailingly polite and cheerful and answered any questions we had. The Murano glass chandeliers in the lobby were beautiful and there was a display of glass as well as one of Burano lace. We did not use the services of the concierge but based on observation, he was extremely helpful in making any arrangements needed. I highly recommend this hotel!
