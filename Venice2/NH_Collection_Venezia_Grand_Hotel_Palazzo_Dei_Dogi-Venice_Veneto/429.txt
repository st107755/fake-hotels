My "inexpensive" $345 (US) room had modest area and no view to speak of. Best included breakfast I've ever experienced. Bathroom was cramped, as is common in older European (inexpensive) rooms. Large quantity of "extras".  Especially the water taxi service is of value. Beautiful garden behind hotel.
