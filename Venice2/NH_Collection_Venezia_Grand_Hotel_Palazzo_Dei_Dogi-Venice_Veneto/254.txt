This is a beautiful hotel with an old world feel. The public areas are full of elaborate Venetian chandeliers and you feel like you are in an old palace. The rooms are nice, although the paint and carpet could use a refresh. The bed was very comfortable and linens were very nice. The bathroom was modern and clean. The room and bathroom were a nice size and there were even double sinks in the bathroom. The hotel is in a quieter part of the island, but the hotel has a private shuttle which makes it easy to get to St. Mark's. The staff are polite, helpful and friendly and gave us several very good restaurant recommendations in the neighboring area. We had the breakfast buffet every morning and it was very nice with hot dishes (eggs, bacon, sausage), breads and rolls, meatsâ€¦
