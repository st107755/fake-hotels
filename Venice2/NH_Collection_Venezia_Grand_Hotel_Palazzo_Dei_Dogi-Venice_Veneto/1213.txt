This is a great hotel for many reasons. It is away from the city center but still close enough for a walk. It is away from all the tourists and on a gorgeous canal street close to a couple of great local restaurants. It has a boat service that can take you to St. Marks square.   We were in for the Fiesta del Redontore and went on the organized hotel boats to this amazing party and fireworks. The experience was even better thanks to Benedetto who was serving prosecco all night and was an amazing host.  I recommend this hotel.
