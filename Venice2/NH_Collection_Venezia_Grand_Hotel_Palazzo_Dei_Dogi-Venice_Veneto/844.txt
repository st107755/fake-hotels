By Venice standards the garden room we had was the biggest hotel room I have ever had in Venice (This is my 4th trip here).  The gardens are beautiful.  The staff can, at times, be a little snooty, but it is a high-end hotel in Italy, so that is to be somewhat expected.    Because the hotel is somewhat off the beaten path (even for Venice standards) you might find it worth the money to take a water taxi (not the public water buses) to this hotel.  It cost 60 euro for my husband and I to take a water taxi, but the taxi took us directly to the front door of the hotel so we avoided the constant pick up and drop that you have to deal with when taking the public water buses. Although 60 euro is not cheap, because it was raining and cold the day we arrived, we thought it was moneyâ€¦
