Was in Venice from 8/10/04 - 8/15/04. The hotel was awesome - beautiful chandeliers in the lobby, not to mention an enjoyable daily buffet breakfast in the garden. The hotel staff was quite friendly and helpful, and although the location was "out-of-the-way", it was great to be around the residential streets - to get a taste of the way of life in that area of Venice - away from the tourists. Highly recommend the Boscolo!
