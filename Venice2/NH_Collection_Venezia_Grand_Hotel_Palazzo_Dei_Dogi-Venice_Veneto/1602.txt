I had the pleasure of spending 3 nights in this hotel, and while I was at first concerned about the location, once there, my fears were allayed. The hotel is really beautiful in a classic way, and the service was always very friendly and helpful. What I loved most about the hotel was that it was so far away from the madness and crowds of San Marco, but you could be there within 20 minutes if you walked, or use the free shuttle offered by the hotel. The garden was also charming, even in the winter month of February. If you have a chance, eat at a nearby restaurant, Ostaria Rioba (corner of Calle Larga and Fondementa de la Miscericordia.) Small, unpretentious, and the best meal we had the entire time we were there. Imaginative cooking and friendly staff. Extremely reasonableâ€¦
