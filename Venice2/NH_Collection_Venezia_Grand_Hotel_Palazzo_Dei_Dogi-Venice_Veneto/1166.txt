Booked this hotel through Marriott using points.  The hotel was the first stop off the water taxi from the airport which was very convenient and easy to get to.  The staff were absolutely wonderful especially Phillip and Giana. We were given a map and directions and recommendations to some excellent restaurants.  The free shuttle to San Marco square and the Murano glass company were a nice benefit.
