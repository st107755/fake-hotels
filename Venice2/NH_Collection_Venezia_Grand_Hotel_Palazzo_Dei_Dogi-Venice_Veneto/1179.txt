Just returned from the Bosolo dei Dogi in the lovely Dell'orto area of Venice. It was a great experience all round. The hotel is an old palazzo and has an amazing garden stretching to the lagoon at the rear. It has two waterside points of entry for their bookable shuttle boat to and from San Marco. The summer restaurant is in a tented area just into the garden area. It's all very nicely done. The staff are professional, attentive and friendly. The reception is very welcoming and helpful. We had an upgraded room which was enormous, if a little elaborately furnished, but that goes with the territory. If you like high ceilings, spectacular chandeliers, marble bathrooms and terrazzo floors you will love this!
