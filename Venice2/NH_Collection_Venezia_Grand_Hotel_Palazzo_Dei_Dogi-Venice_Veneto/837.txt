My husband and I stayed in Venice at the Boscolo for 1 week prior to our cruise using our points. The hotel was wonderful. Quiet and relaxing, off the tourist path. Even though we had a problem with the water pressure (too hot or cold) they did try to fix the problem. The staff was more than accommodating. We stayed on the 4th floor with a wonderful view of the canal and the sunsets. Everything was within walking distance or public transportation.
