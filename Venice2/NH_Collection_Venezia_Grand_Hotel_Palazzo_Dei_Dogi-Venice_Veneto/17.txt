My wife wanted to make me a present and booked a room in this Grand Hotel Dei Dogi for 2 nights. Even if its not a season room costs 160-180 euros per night. Our room number was 118 and it was worst room i ever experienced in 5 star hotels.  Our bed meant to be king size, but they gave us 2 small mattresses together, which made it uncomfortable to sleep! First morning around 8:30-9:00 am we woke up because of some construction works noises. Room was very small and a bit depressive, because there was no light and view was disgusting (check photos I attached). Today morning before checkout i found my towel was dirty - there was a red/orange spot on it.  I will never recommend this place even to my enemies.
