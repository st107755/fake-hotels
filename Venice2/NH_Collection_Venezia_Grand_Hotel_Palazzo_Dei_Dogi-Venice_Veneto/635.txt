We had a great experience at the Boscolo Venezia & booked the room through Marriott points.  The staff was GREAT (expecially Claudio) and they did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  The complimentary boat service to San Marco Square and Burano was super & the hotel is in a great location and very quite too.  We'll stay there again, for sure.   Tom G.  Atlanta, GA
