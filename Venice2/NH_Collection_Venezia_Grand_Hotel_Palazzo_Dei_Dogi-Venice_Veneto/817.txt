The Boscolo Venizia hotel is an excellent place to stay in.. It is located in one of the residential areas and a good distance from the very crowded San Marcos area. We were fortunate to go on the night the Feast of  the Redeemer (July 18). We booked an exquisite gourmet dinner and then took the boat ride to watch the fireworks at San Marcos square. The food was excellent. The  staff were very friendly and courteous.  had a massage with Maria in  the Spa. i highly recommend her.  Definitely worth coming back.
