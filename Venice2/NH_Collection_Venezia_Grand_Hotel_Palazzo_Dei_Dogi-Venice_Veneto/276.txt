First let me start off by saying the location is great, if you don’t mind walking. The hotel is located in a quiet area about a 15 minute walk from San Marco and the water taxi shuttle only runs limited hours, so if you don’t like to walk, this location may not be for you. My husband and I like to walk and enjoyed getting away from the bustle of San Marco. The lobby is lovely, the room was ok, nothing spectacular but clean and had a Venetian feel to it, which we appreciated.  My biggest problem with this hotel was the rudeness of one of the front desk (female) staff. My husband has earned lifetime status in the Marriott rewards program because he chooses Marriott properties for all his business and our personal travel. Never have we been treated in this manner by any Marriott…
