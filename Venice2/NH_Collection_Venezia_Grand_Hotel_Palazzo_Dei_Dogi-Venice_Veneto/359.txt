The Boscolo is located in a residential part of Venice, away from the tourist hordes. Beautiful classic hotel with a large and beautiful garden,  There are some very delicious LOCAL restaurants within a five minute walk.  In less than 30 minutes you can walk to most of Venice, although they have a shuttle boat from the hotel to St. Marks. There is also a water bus stop within a five minute walk.  Breakfast was excellent and the staff is friendly and helpful. Shout out to Claudio and Philip in particular.
