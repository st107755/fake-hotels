This olf palace reconverted in an hotel is away from the piazza San Marco and Grand Canale circus, on the NE directly on the Grand lagoon. Beautiful reception, services was impccable; the suite was large and very comfortable as well as very quiet. This hotel owns the largest private gardens in Venice in which one will have breakfast . There is also a portion of the garden with chaise longues  to relax on the way to a private dock from which an elegant private boat drove us to piazza San Marco.  A great rerteat away from the noise and crowds of Vemice.
