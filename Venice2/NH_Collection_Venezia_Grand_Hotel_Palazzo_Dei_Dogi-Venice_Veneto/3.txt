We stayed with a package "welcome back to Venice" that was very good value for money. It's probably more a 4* than a 5*, but the palace is very impressive, with a garden that is extremely well cared for and lead to the water door at the back with wonderful views. The concierge and personnel are outstanding. If you are running ask for the map of "quiet running routes", it's the best way to explore Venice in the morning. They have a free motorboat service to San Marco square, or you can walk there in about 30 minutes. The area around the hotel is very quiet, but just two blocks away you have the area of the restaurants (osterie and trattorie) popular with the locals.
