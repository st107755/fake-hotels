Great place to stay, almost perfect except at check out, the check out person was very rude.  Our room as well as our kids room were great, clean, comfortable, nicely done.  Great amenities.    The grounds were beautiful, relaxing.  Drinks at the hotel were expensive.  We had complimentary breakfast and that was good.
