I must admit, upon arrival I was not impressed with the interior style of our room at the Boscolo. It seemed so old fashioned with the ornate gold fixtures and the bulky period furniture. However, once we settled in we found it to feel comfortable. It was large like an American style hotel room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. The location in the Cannaregio is a bit out of the way but we found that to be a good thing. We enjoyed being away from the busy and noisy tourist area around Piazza San Marco. We felt this area in Venice provided a more authentic Italian experience. There are small shops nearby where you can buy wine, baked goods and coffee, and of course, very good local restaurants. Our favorite perk at the Boscolo was the free water taxiâ€¦
