Quaint hotel with an excellent breakfast buffet.  The birds where a little aggressive but the hotel is in such a lovely setting.  Easy to get from the airport to hotel, hotel provides shuttle to San Marcos square, and easy access to transportation to the train station.  You even walk back to the hotel if need be.
