I have to admit that I was quite concerned about booking this hotel for our stay in Venice.  The reviews that I read prior my trip had me wondering about the quality of the hotel and most importantly - air conditioning.  By european standards, I think the Hotel Dei Dogi is one of the nicest.  It is not the Ritz but then I didn't want to pay for the Ritz.  Yes, it is away from the tourist area - But we didn't want to stay in a tourist area.  We walked to St. Mark's square or took water taxis.  You will find that the hotel is clean and inviting, and the grounds are beautiful.  Breakfast is served on a covered, outdoor patio.  The food was good and the atmosphere was great.  The rooms were small by american standards but nicely appointed.  The air conditioning was enough to makeâ€¦
