Enjoyed a long weekend, 3 nights, in this Marriott property.  The hotel is magnificent with lobby and fine chandeliers, along with the spacious entry hall on upper floors.  I expected an upgrade as I am a platinum elite, but I don't think I received it since my room was just very average without a good view.  Since the hotel was less than one-third full, I certainly should have received a better room as I spent a small fortune during the three nights.    We ate in their main restaurant every evening as it was easier, although some of our meals were just average and overpriced.   The breakfast was certainly not worth the cost and would never have eaten there if it had not been included with the room charge.  They have many things on their buffet, but not much that we would eat. â€¦
