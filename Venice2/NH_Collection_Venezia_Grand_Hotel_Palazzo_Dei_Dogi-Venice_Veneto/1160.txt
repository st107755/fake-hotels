We stayed stayed 4 nights at this hotel primarily because I have a lot of Marriott points and this was available. Had I not had points, and now having experienced Venice, I would definite choose this hotel. I am ever so thankful for a place away from the maddening crowds that invade Venice daily.   The hotel itself is a Palace with Murano glass chandeliers everywhere. There is a hotel water taxi at the end of the beautiful gardens that will shuttle you to the Murano Glasss Factory and St Marks Square. While it is a 30 minute walk to St Marks square and other tourist landmarks, it is a pleasant stroll through. Dinner was very nice alfreso on the patio with the Gardens in the background. A bit expensive but so is everything in Venice. Room was very nice though being an oldâ€¦
