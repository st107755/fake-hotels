Probably the finest in Venice for five-star service, quiet and historic rooms and, especially, away from the cruise ship 'effluvium' that pervades the rest of the islands...  Breakfast is a large buffet and also a menu of different kitchen-prepared items. Very much worth the price because you might not care for or want lunch. Patience of multi-lingual staff with the jet-lagged and first-time international travellers is a large part of why I give Boscolo Venezia this highest rating.
