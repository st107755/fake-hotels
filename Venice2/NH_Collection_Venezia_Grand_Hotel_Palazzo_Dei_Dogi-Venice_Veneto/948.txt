I picked this property solely based on the fact that I was redeeming Marriott points for my stay. But my wife and I were delighted to stay there. Great view, friendly service and above all, a great location away from the tourist scene. The walk to St. Mark's is great for people watching and shopping, but transportation can be tricky if you don't do your homework. Most of the people asking questions at the front desk were about transportation. I was surprised they didn't provide a one-page summary of the water taxi system, etc. Anyway, within 1/2 mile is a water taxi stop that serves both the water bus system as well as the (separate) Alilaguna shuttle which serves San Marco Airport. You can buy tickets for both on the boats themselves since there's no ticket machine at the stop.â€¦
