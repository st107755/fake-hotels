The location was easy to get to by Vaporetto Water Bus from train station and equally easy getting to airport (VCE)  using Alilaguna Water Bus; both serviced from close by Madonna Dell'Orto boat drop/off pick up location (water taxi service is also available to the front door, but not necessary). The rooms were very comfortable and the gardens where the breakfast was served were beautiful.  There is not much garden space in Venice, and it was very nice having it as part of the hotel.  Also, enjoyed the free visit to the Murano glass factory that the hotel arranged.
