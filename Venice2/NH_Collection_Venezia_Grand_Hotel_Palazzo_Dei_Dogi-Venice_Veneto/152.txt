We arrived to Venice via train from Munich to spend 2 nights before our journey back to AZ.  The staff was welcoming when we arrived, since my husband is Platinum Elite status with Marriott, we inquired about an upgrade.  They informed us that there was no availability the first night, but they would check the next morning. When we went down fro the delicious buffet breakfast in the lobby, Beatrice excitedly came to us and told us they had a surprise for us.  Alessio then escorted us to The Presidential Suite!  I gasped.  This room is simply amazing!  2 floors overlooking the bay.  I've never stayed in a room of this caliber before.  This was by far one of the best nights we've ever spent in a Marriott.  Thank you Beatrice and Alessio for making this anniversary trip so veryâ€¦
