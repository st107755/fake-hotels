This hotel was fantastic. Great location, a bit removed from the hustle around St Marks, but close enough to walk. The staff was amazing and hugely helpful with logistics and planning our stay in venice.  Very comfortable room, 24 hour coffee and water in the lobby. Would definitely recommend, and stay here again! Gorgeous decor
