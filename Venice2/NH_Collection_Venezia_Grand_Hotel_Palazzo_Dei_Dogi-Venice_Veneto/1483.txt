Booked our city break through airmiles and what a gem we chose ! The hotel is a good 20 minute brisk walk to St Marks' but the hotel offers it's own private boat with timetable so make use of it ! you can always walk one way - It's very stylish to aive by boat at St Marks square or use it to return when your feet are weary ! - we had a fabulous room, with a magical view, bathrobes, slippers, nice toiletries. The  gardens were truly lovely with loungers and you can sit at the end of your own little pier with a glass of wine(Buy a bottle locally and bring your own glasses!). Staff were ok, it is Italia and they are never over friendly but if you ask they are always willing. Yes, we did not eat or drink in the hotel, very over priced but you are in VENICE if you stick to theâ€¦
