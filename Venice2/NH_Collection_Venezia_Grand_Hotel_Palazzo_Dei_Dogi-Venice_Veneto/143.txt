This hotel is so beautiful! The pictures of the outside don't look like much, but the inside is gorgeous! We notified the hotel that it was our honeymoon, and they left us a welcome note, a bottle of prosecco, and a gift (wonderful gourmet pasta noodles)! It was so incredibly nice and thoughtful! We had also asked for recommendations for food, and they gave us several recommendations, and were able to make a reservation for us at one of the restaurants. We only stayed here two nights, so we weren't able to take advantage of all of the other things that the hotel offered (such as the free boat shuttle) but I would definitely stay here again. Thank you so much for making this part of our honeymoon so wonderful!
