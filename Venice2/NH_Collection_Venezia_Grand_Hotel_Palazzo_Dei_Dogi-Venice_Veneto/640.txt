The hotel has a beautiful setting and the large private garden is refreshing. The breakfast was very good and the staff were extremely helpful. They answered all our questions and made us reservations for dinner at restaurants they recommended. The rooms were quiet and very comfortable. They really made our stay in Venice so pleasant. It is a five star hotel and we had a five star stay by the kind staff.
