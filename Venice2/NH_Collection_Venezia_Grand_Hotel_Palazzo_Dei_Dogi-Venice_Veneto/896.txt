Possibly the best hotel we've stayed in for feeling so good - and we've stayed in a few around the world! The building is fascinating, the rooms so old but so very comfortable and well equipped. The staff seem like one happy family who wants to make their guests have the time of their lives. Nothing is too much for these guys - we're going back! And the location is perfect - away from the tourists with so many excellent, real Italian restaurants (with very fair prices) but only a short walk or water-bus from St. Marks and all the sights - and tourists.
