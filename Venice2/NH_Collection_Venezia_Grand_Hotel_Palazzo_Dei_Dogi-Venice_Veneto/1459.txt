Wow!  As an American traveling anywhere in Europe - you don't expect a grand room - nice, clean and safe is usually what we get.  This place blew us away.  It's in a quiet residential area of Venice (away from the craziness - but close enough to get anywhere you need to go - they have a complimentary water taxi to Murano and grand canal / central part of town) First thing upon arrival the staff was extraordinary - so kind and accomodating - helpful and informative. We were let into our room and were so impressed.  The beautiful murano glass lighting, the size of the room, beautuiful marble bath and a large king bed - the walls looked as hand painted long ago - and the garden outside....such a tranquil and beautiful place.  The included breakfast was artistically displayed,â€¦
