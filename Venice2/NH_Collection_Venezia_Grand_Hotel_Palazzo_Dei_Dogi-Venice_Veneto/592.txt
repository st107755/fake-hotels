From reservation through departure staff was amazing! At check in Barbara and concierge Ivan the staff was great Breakfast had great staff and food delicious! Room was large and spotless clean with amazing view of canal and surrounded by garden Great restaurants close to walk in very safe neighborhood Try enotecca la Columbina (ask at desk for directions The private water taxi is great and really nice after day of touring to relax with a few people instead of packed valparetto which we also enjoyed! I travel for business in Europe so this was a welcome surprise in such a tourist area to be close to where people actually live and enjoy the wine bars and shops
