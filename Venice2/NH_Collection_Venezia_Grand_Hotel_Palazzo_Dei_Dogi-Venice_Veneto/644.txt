Our first time to Venice.  We took a chance by booking a hotel a little ways away from the "tourist" areas.  We are so glad we did.  The hotel is beautiful with Murano chandelier everywhere.  The gardens are also something to see. We spent many a night in the garden having a night cap.  The staff really went above and beyond.  We stayed 5 nights and really got to see the staff at work. They remembered us and always smiled and willing to answer questions and help with setting up day trips. Don't miss the incredible breakfast with lots of great food and prosecco to start your day off right.  The hotel is a short walk to Marco Square, but they also have a free water taxi. Just make sure and ask for the time schedule.  Can't wait to return!!!
