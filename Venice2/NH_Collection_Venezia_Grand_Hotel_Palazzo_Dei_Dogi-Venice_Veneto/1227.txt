There are many things that I liked about this hotel, beautiful foyer, lovely rear garden where one can eat breakfast, pretty rooms, cleanliness and quiet location.  On the other hand, the bed was not uncomfortable, but it wasn't up to "heavenly" beds at most U.S. hotels, a little hard. While I enjoyed the location of the hotel in the Canareggio  district of Venice, it is a 30-40 minute walk or a long Vaparetto ride to San Marco Square. The district is a residential area offering good affordable restaurants, a small grocery store and even a local bar serving glasses of wine starting a 1.20 euros. This location is great for someone who wants to explore and enjoys wandering on foot, not for those with mobility issues. The bad things were no iron & board in room, awkward placementâ€¦
