We booked this hotel through Voyage Prive and were not disappointed.  The hotel is the first stop after the airport, on the Vaparetto (the public water taxi service) which took approximately  30 minutes and cost 54 euros return for the two of us.  The interiors of the hotel are stunning with chandeliers made from Murano glass and many other fabulous details that make this is a very special building.  We were upgraded to a room overlooking the canal which was wonderful and we enjoyed two nights of uninterrupted sleep, you wouldn't know the hotel was full, the bedrooms were very quiet and well appointed with lovely luxury toiletries.  The best service the hotel offers is its complementary boat which runs between the hotel and St Marks Square on a regular basis.  This is fabulousâ€¦
