We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Boscolo Autograph in Venice . The hotel is about a 30 minute walk from St Marks Square but an enjoyable one . The welcome we received from the staff was warm and friendly, everything was covered, keys, wifi,maps,directions etc . They showed us to our room (408) a superior room that was gorgeous,  tastefully decorated with fantastic smelling toiletries (if you like that sort of thing.... I do)  The hotel offer a free taxi service on their boat to st. marks square and you can book it during the day, a great experience .  We have been to Venice before and stayed more centrally , it's more expensive, busier and quite noisy. The Boscolo is the perfect place to stay , we will go back . The only downside if I was bing really picky isâ€¦
