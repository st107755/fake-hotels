My fiancé and I decided to stay here the first couple of days in Venice just to try it out. To our surprise the hotel had a concierge, Ivan, who went above and beyond for us.  The hotel is amazing! Even if you don’t plan on staying here it’s a must see. The location is perfect and everything about it says Venice.  Again, I can’t thank Ivan enough for his help through out our stay. We’ll definitely be coming back.
