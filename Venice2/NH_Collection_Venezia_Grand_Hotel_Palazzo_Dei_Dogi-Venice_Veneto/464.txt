Honestly, if it wasn't for the size of the room it would've gotten a five but we got an upgrade due to being Marriott gold in the room was the size of a closet. Living in New York City I don't expect a huge room in a major city, but this was very small. The staff at the hotel we're all quite nice and made some good recommendations for bars and other things. The property and grounds are quite spectacular. They also booked us a tour of the Murano glass factory and send us a private boat to get over there. That was very nice. They also run a shuttle service by boat from the hotel to St. Mark's Square. Breakfast that was included with our room was also great. A large bread with many available options. Location was great for us, away from all of the craziness of Venice near the trainâ€¦
