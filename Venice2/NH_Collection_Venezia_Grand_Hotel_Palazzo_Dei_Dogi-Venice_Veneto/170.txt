Having been to Venice twice before, my wife and I saw no need to stay in the middle of the 60,000+ tourists that visit the central islands on an average day. Thus, the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi situated in a very quiet neighborhood in the somewhat off-the-beaten-path sestieri (area) of the Cannaregio seemed perfect. In reality, it was even better. Behind a rather bland entrance (by Venice standards) amidst tired buildings on a nondescript canal is a gorgeous hotel with a top-level staff. A rarity among Venice properties, the hotel has a garden that stretches from the main building to the Canale della Fondamenta Nuove, and our room (No. 135) was in a small sub-building just off the garden lawn - an amazing location! But, despite its quiet surroundings, the Dei Dogi is in no wayâ€¦
