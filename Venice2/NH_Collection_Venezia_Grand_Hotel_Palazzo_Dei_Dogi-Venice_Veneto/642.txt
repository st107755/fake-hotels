Beautiful hotel, lovely room and a wonderful breakfast experience in the largest private garden in Venice. Expensive but very luxurious. Perfect location away from the tourist areas to get an authentic feel for what is a very busy city. Defiantly recommend for a lovely break away in one of the most stunning cities in Europe!
