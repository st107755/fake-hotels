We loved this hotel.  Highly recommend the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi!!  We were in two rooms at the very back of the hotel, one on the second floor, one on the first, 137 and 142.  Both looked out into the lagoon, very quiet, perfect location. We loved the hotel because it was off the beaten path in a residential neighborhood. The walk to restaurants and shops was super easy plus you avoid the crowds.  The other thing that we realized was that the water taxi from the airport pulled right up to the front lobby and luggage was super easy, no lugging across sidewalks and bridges.  We had breakfast both mornings outside under the tent.  Just a perfect setting.  Love it here!!
