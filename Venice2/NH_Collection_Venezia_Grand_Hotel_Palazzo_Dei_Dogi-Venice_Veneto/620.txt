Out of the way, but not too far:  a pleasant walk to the tourist spots.  We enjoyed the neighbourhood and local flavour, cafes, bars and restaurants during the early evening.  Away from the throngs of main Venice.  The Hotel gardens and back dock are a relaxing area to have a late afternoon cocktail.  The Boscolo breakfast buffet is excellent, and the restaurant is worthy of a Michelin star (but I don't work for Michelin).
