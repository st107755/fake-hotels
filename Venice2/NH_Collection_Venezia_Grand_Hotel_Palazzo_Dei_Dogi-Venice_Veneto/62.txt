This hotel has a fantastic location, the area is so quiet (and safe) but is within an easy walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. It does offer a free shuttle to St Marks square that we used once - it was very well organized and a nice ride.   We originally got upgraded to a suite, but unfortunately had to move to a regular room given that the air conditioning was broken in our suite. While disappointing, we appreciated the way the staff quickly took care of things and got us into a new room.   Breakfast was absolutely delicious, and we loved the quaint feel to the outdoor breakfast seating area. The breakfast staff was our favorite, so kind and accommodating!  My only complaint of the hotel would be the inconsistent shower temperature. It was constantly changingâ€¦
