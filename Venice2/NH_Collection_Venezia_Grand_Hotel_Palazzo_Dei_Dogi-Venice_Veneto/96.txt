My Wife and I visited Venice in the summer.  The Hotel Dei Dogi was a palatial refuge from the searing heat. We were lucky enough to have a room overlooking the canal. The room itself, was everything you'd expect, simple and beautiful. The decor was perfect and the room was clean. The staff were professional and always friendly. The hotel offered a free water taxi to the centre of Venice, just a few minutes walk St Mark's square. Our only meal of the day was breakfast, as we visited the many restaurants and cafes. The breakfast options were traditional as well as continental; and always in plentiful supply. Again, the staff were welcoming and lovely - truly professional.  I feel so lucky that we found such an amazing hotel. We loved it.
