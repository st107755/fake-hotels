Well, if you are planning to spend the last day and night of the year somewhere, Venice is certainly the place to be but of course, any other day of the year will do it as well. This hotel is fantastic with a lobby that looks like an art gallery and an amazing private garden, the largest and oldest in the city.  It is situated in the Madonna dell'Orto district, a picturesque area of Venice approx. 15 minutes walking distance from the train station.    The rooms are spacious and come with all the necessary amenities. Please ask for the villa inside the garden and have a great time!
