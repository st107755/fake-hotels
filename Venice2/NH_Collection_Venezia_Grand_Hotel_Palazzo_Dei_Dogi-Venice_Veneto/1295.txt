Superb building.   They have a free water taxi service which in theory is great.  We were harassed into taking a trip to Murano by the staff (think they have some form of commercial deal here, the hotel has the glass everywhere) to arrive at a factory which wasn't in use.  Greeted by quite an intimidating man who says he will show us around 'no obligation'.  He said 'no obligation' so many times it was clear there was an unspoken obligation to buy something.  He followed us around the showroom and seemed to be more and more aggressive up to the point he just asked if we wanted to buy something.  After I said we didn't really like the stuff he started getting personal towards me.  Awful experience.  Don't go unless you are with lots of people.  A very intimidating experienceâ€¦
