I don't understand the negativity!  I was really worried about my booking after reading the reviews on here.  But I needn't have worried - I LOVED IT!  Our room was a good size and very, very clean, air conditioned, dressing gown and slippers, lovely soap and shampoo and bubble baths etc.  And we had the most basic room!    Although we didn't make breakfast (terrible I know) the rest of the experience was, well, magical.  Beautiful gardens with a little jetty facing the lagoon where you can sit on comfy chairs and watch the boats go by.  Lovely location in the quiet part of Venice, and an enjoyable 20 - 30 minute walk into the very centre.  Do not be put off by its off-centre location - it's a bonus.  You get to see the real Venice at the Dei Dogi as you walk to the touristâ€¦
