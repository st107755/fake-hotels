Stayed 2 nights for a romantic gateway in Venice. The hotel is very pretty, a bit difficult to find and not really in the city centre of Santa Lucia. It is positioned in a residential area, which is nice to see and not so crowded. Great service, nice room but without too many frills - i was expecting a slightly bigger room. We experienced some issues with the shower - the water pressure was not right and we struggled to find the right temperature for a shower. I was expecting a room change for this, that did not happen... Great breakfast - high quality buffet and then one dish a la carte. Only suggestion is to add benedectine's eggs! I particularly enjoyed my morning rossini to start the day with an extra gear! We did not have lunch or dinner - too bad as the restaurant lookedâ€¦
