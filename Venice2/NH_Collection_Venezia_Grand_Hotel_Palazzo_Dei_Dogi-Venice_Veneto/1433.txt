As a Marriott Platnum member, I spend a good part of the year in hotels.  My stay at the Boscolo Venezia was by far my best stay at a hotel ever.  Giuseppe, Mariana, and Phillip could not do enough to make our stay more pleasant.  All of the staff at the hotel were extremely courteous and helpful.  As for the hotel, magnificent should say it all.  Can't wait to return.  Thank you all for making my first trip to Venice a 5 star experience. Robert Tassone New York
