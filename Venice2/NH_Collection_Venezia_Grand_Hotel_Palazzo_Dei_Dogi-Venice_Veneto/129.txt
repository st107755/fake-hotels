Lovely hotel away from the bustle of St Marks square. We used our Platinum suite night upgrades and got a junior suite... very nice. As a Platinum member, breakfast was included.The hotel has a free water taxi to St Marco Square (5 times a day and takes about 30min)... good if you want to see Venice from the water and then walk back to the hotel. There are about a dozen local bar/restaurants about 5 min from the hotel. They are great for Cicchetti (tapas like) or full meal with great fresh seafood. A super local feel.  Upon departure we used a water taxi to get to the airport: expensive (euro 135) but worth it... 20min pls 10min walk on moving walkways.  Staff were great: front desk, concierge, bar and wait staff
