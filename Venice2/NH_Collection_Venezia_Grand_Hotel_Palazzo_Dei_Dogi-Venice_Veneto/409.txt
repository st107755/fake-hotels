My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights on 6/1 -6/3 and we love, loved it.  We were fortuante enough to get a lagoon view room on the opposite end of the property (stroll over and take a picture of the sun setting at dusk from the private dock).  The garden here is amazing, there are 2 rabbits that are just adorable to watch mill about the garden.  The staff is very helpful (Evan, Barbara come to mind) and the breakfast is fantastic and managed be a top shelf staff.  The location is great and low key, and a 3minute walk to the main tourist zone.  Our rooms were exactly what we had hoped and we are very much looking forward to returning.
