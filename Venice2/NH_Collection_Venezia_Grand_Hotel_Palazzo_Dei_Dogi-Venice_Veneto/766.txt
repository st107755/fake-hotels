Yes it is away from the main tourist areas but we enjoyed that.  It was a nice hotel, but as someone else said it was quite old.  For the price I would have expected more charming and helpful staff.  After a long day of site seeing we asked the consierge for a restaurant suggestion.....nothing too fancy just simple and easy so we could come back and relax.  The food was not good and very, very pricey....we did better the following night on our own!
