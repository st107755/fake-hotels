If you love all things Italian then this is the hotel for you. In a quiet location but with bars and restaurants a short walk away this hotel was perfect if you like walking and exploring - and if you donâ€™t - then you can use the free water taxi to and from San Marco square. Travelling using Marriott rewards our room was upgraded when we arrived to room 139 which was spacious with the period decor to be expected of a Venetian place. Reached by walking through the beautiful botanical gardens it had a view of the sea as well as access to comfortable outdoor seating looking out to sea. Staff were friendly and service from everyone was excellent. Especially their barman Edo - whose service was excellent along with delicious range of snacks that complimented our drinks.
