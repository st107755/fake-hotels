While the property itself is lovely, the room we were given was simply not 5 star. The decor was no more special or Venetian than grandma's spare bedroom and the bathroom had no tub, only a shower smaller than a cruise ship. We are Marriott lifetime platinum, and booked this hotel to avoid being disappointed. The only saving grace was the weather held out and their boat is lovely.
