We walked from the Venetian Santa Lucia train station straight to this hotel without any problems at all!! We are a family of 4, (55 years old parents with 2 teenagers) and each of us had a roller suitcase. We all enjoyed our first introduction to Venice on this walk. During our stay we did not have to use any transportation. It was a thrill and easy to walk to all the tourist sites. The hotel was wonderful and clean. Free coffee in a cute sitting room in the morning. The staff was excellent.
