From the time we arrived, the front desk staff, the concierge, bar staff, restaurant staff etc etc, service was impeccable  The property is just beautiful with the garden in the middle of Venice and the rooms are very comfortable  It is close enough to all major attractions and a free shuttle boat to main areas, yet is away from the hustle and bustle which provides a quiet local experience
