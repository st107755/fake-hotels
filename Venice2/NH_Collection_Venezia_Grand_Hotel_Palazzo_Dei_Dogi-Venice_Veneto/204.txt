This hotel is absolutely beautiful. It is located near cannaregio district. It is with walking distance to many shops vendors and St Markâ€™s Vasilica. Take the Aliguna water taxi from airport and get off on the Ortho stop and easy walk to hotel even with luggage. The staff is excellent. Breakfast was very good the grounds are beautiful. If I get back to Venice I will surely stay there
