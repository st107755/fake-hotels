This hotel is in a wonderfully quiet suburb alongside a canal. As we were staying for a week our room was upgraded to a canal view. It was absolutely lovely staying there. The staff were so helpful, particularly the two ladies who oversaw breakfast.  The hotel offered a complimentary trip to the Murano glass factory and a shuttle boat to S. Marco square. We mostly walked into the centre but always had the shuttle as back up.
