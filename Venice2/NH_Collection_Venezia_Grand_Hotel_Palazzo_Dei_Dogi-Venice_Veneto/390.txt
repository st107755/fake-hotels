It was great.  I must say that the first night we were checked into a very small room with a view of the dumpster which if we were stuck in there I'd give the hotel a 3 or less.  Upon complaint, they moved us to a much bigger room with a great view of Venetian rooftops which was fabulous.  The common areas are gorgeous. Restaurant is great and garden area is stunning and one of a kind. Also very big!  Shuttle to St. Marks is great and one time we had it just the two of us which was awesome. It is a long walk from the main tourist stuff but that is OK because you get to see more of the real Venice.  Would stay again.
