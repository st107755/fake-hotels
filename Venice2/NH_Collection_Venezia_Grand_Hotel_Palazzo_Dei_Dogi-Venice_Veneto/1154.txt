We stayed at the Boscolo for one night on Marriott Reward points. This was a stopover before our cruise leaving out of Venice on Celebrity in October.  When we arrived at the hotel we were first greeted by the Concierge who immediately opened the doors (two very beautiful and heavy doors) and asked that we "please, come in and not worry about your luggage"   Another staff member immediately retrieved our luggage and set it aside while we registered.  The staff at this hotel is amazing.  I have yet to encounter staff as attentive; professional; and friendly from any hotels with stayed in Europe and some high end in the States.   Daniel took us to our room; and before we got to our room gave us a small "tour" and information on the hotel; the portraits; showed us the balcony inâ€¦
