Wonderful hotel,  we stayed there for 4 days and the service was second to none.  They have a complimentary water taxi that takes you to St. Marco's square which saved us a lot of money.  Hotel was clean, very accommodating staff, and had wonderful food. I highly recommended Boscolo Venezia to anyone who travels to Venice
