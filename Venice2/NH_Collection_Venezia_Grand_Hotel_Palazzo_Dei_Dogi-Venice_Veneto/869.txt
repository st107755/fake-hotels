Luxury hotel owned by Marriott.   Very nice rooms, spectacular hallways and lobby.  Breakfast 35 Euros but you can get them down to 25 a day.  Marriott elite customers get the breakfast free.  I am not one of those.   Breakfast buffet outstanding.  They have a free water taxi that will take you to St Mark's several times a day.  This is very useful otherwise it's either a 40 minute walk (and you will get lost) or a 20 min walk to the Vaporetto on the Grand Canal which is, in my opinion, the best ride of public transport in the world, but it's generally crowded and of course, like everything in Venice, it's slow.
