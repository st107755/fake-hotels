We stayed here in august, it's a beautiful hotel located in the jewish area of Venice. It has a botanical garden where breakfast is served every morning what we did not expect in a city like Venice. It was such a pleasure to stay here and being helped by Gaia who gave us superb recommendations for restaurants and bars. Can't wait to go back to this fabulous property
