The hotel is gorgeous, the staff friendly, the rooms well-appointed, and it has the largest garden in Venice, stretching all the way to the lagoon from the canal. A marvelous retreat after a long day of walking Venice. It's a bit remote being at the opposite side of the city from San Marcos, but it has a water shuttle several times a day.
