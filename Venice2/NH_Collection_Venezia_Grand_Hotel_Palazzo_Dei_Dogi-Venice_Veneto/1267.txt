We spent our first night in the Westin Europa & Regina, but only had a StarFriend rate for one night. Therefore, we booked this hotel for the second night. The gardens are AMAZING! It's the only hotel with private (and huge) gardens.  It's located in the quiet Cannaregio off Madonna dell'Orto. If coming from the bus station in Venice, it's a 1-min walk from the Orto stop (4.2/5.2 lines). You could also walk from the train station and it's a 20-min walk (assuming you don't get lost).  We were coming from San Marco, so we came through the Grand Canal and taking vaparetto line 1 to the San Marcuola stop. From there, it was probably a 10-min walk with 3 bridges I believe. If you've never been the Venice, this means you have to carry your luge up and over the bridge as there are notâ€¦
