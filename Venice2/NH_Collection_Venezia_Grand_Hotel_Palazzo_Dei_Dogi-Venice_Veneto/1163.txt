This was our hotel in Venice during our after cruise stay for several days.  What a grand place to stay.  Our room was large, high ceilings, frescos on the walls, a great bathroom and beautiful grounds to relax and enjoy.  Offered their own water taxi which made it very convenient to travel around Venice and Murano.
