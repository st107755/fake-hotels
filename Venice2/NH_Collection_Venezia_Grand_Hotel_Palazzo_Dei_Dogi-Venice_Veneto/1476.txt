This was my 3rd visit and I felt that the service had improved. We stayed 5 nights and enjoyed reading in the tranquil garden in the late afternoon after a day at the sites. We did not take the expensive breakfast buffet but it is a short walk to a local Cafe. Apart from the air con finding a high of 34C a bit of a struggle everything else was great.
