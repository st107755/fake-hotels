We stayed here on a city break trip to Venice and the hotel was brilliant. The reception staff were super helpful and their mastery of the english language was excellent making it easy to ask for their advice and help.  The bar at this hotel was manned by Bane who was a wonderful host who after finding out we were veggie went out of his way to have the kitchen make us up some vegetarian canap√©s to enjoy with our cocktails a really nice touch.  The hotel is situated just far enough from the hustle a bustle of the main streets but within a 5 minute walk of shops and restaurants and offers a free water taxi service to St Marks Square if you want to use it.  We genuinely loved our stay here and would recommend to anyone considering a trip to Venice.
