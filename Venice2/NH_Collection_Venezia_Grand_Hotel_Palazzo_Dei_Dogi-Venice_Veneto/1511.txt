Really, the fumes coming out of the drains in the bathroom were wretched. When we complained they added an extremely oppressive "room freshner" to the bathroom.   The whole situation began when we were assigned to a tiny room whose airconditioner and TV didn't work. So we asked for a change and got it to a similar one whose AC still didn't work (in May) and the TV had heavy snow. By this time we were tired of changing rooms and it was only the next day that we smelled the fumes in the bathroom. We lived with that and the window open and bugs coming in for 3 more nights. As to room size, don't believe tthose pictures, notice they only show the suite rooms. Ours had nice bunch of pillows on the bed but if you tossed them on the floor there was no room left to walk except overâ€¦
