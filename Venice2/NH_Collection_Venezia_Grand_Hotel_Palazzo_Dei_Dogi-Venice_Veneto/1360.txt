We just checked out from the Boscolo this morning.  The staff, particularly Philip, is wonderful. The hotel is everything they promise and more.  We were unexpectedly upgraded to the Presidential suite. From the view of the lagoon on one side to the overlook of the gardens on the other, this suite is gorgeous. The pictures do not do it justice!  We started our stay with a complimentary glass of prosecco, and it just got better from there. The location is the best of both worlds, very quiet, but only a short walk from the vaporetto to access all of Venice. Thank you again for an amazing weekend!
