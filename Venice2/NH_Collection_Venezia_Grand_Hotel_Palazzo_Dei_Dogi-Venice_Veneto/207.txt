We checked in pretty late at night and in spite of my status (platinum) was still given a regular room all the way out in the garden. An old, musty, cold room out in the garden.   Because I was in good company, it did not matter, but as a hotel guest I was underwhelmed and unimpressed. Not worth the price I payed for the night.  The hotel is also pretty far from the important sights of Venice for example San Marco. Maybe 45 minute walk if you know the way. It was pretty hard to find at night without GPS.   Breakfast was mediocre at best. Three stars is truly generous...
