My reception at this hotel was the best ever! Really!!! Imagine that when I checked in I was showing my ID and immediately the receptionist started to speak in Portuguese to me! Was really a super experience! About the hotel, although it is not in st Marcus piazza is in a very good location, in my opinion. Very quiet, with some very good restaurants near by. Thanks.
