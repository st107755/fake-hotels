In an old embassy building this hotel is one of the only ones with a garden.  Through the hotel I arranged a water taxi from the airport that took 25 minutes.  On arriving you see no crowds.  Relax for breakfast and dinner in the gardens or stroll through venice.  Around a 20 min walk to St Marks or the hotel provides a free shuttle at a set schedule.  Some rooms overlook a small canal.  Lots of bars and restaurants in this district
