My husband and I spent a delightful 2 nights at the Boscolo. The location is very nice and quiet, and the staff (particularly front desk) were fantastic. Very helpful and knowledgeable.The rooms were much larger than I expected. It's not close to the St. Marks square and other major attractions, but this made the area uncrowded and quaint. Overall, the facility ranks as a 5 out of 5. Several good eating spots nearby (within 5 min. walk).
