Absolutely loved this hotel. Absolutely amazed with the gardens and the stunning foyer. Staff were lovely and helpful. My Detox and Revive Spa and massage with Elizabeth was the best i have ever had. Being away from the hustle and bustle of Venice was wonderful but we were within walking distance of some very good restaurants and shopping. The hotel provides a shuttle service to and from San Marco and the island of Murano...another bonus.
