We book this hotel having never been to Venice before and not knowing how to get around or where things are. The hotel it self is amazing with a beautiful garden in a quiet area. The problem is its on the opposite side of St Marc's square where all of the restaurant and shopping is.  So you are left with either public ferries 7 euro services or a taxi ride 70 euro. The hotel did offer a free boat to and from the square a couple times a day but it wasn't convenient. If you want to stay with Marriott I would look at the JW right across for the square. That is where we are staying on our next visit.
