This is an awesome place to stay in Venice. Large room, amazing large beds, well equipped bathroom and lovely view :) I will definitely go back there again. Can't wait. The price is a bit high but Venice is not a cheap place to stay :) Someone can complain about the location because it is away from the crowds but that is exactly what I like - a luxury, quiet place.
