The hotel is about a 30 minute walk from the city center but we didn't mind because we really enjoyed walking around everywhere, getting lost, and discovering new spots. The hotel offers a water taxi to San Marco Square but it needs to be booked in advance and is on a limited schedule so walking was really the best way to get around. Within a 5-15 minute walk there are good restaurants and some shops too.  The bed was comfy and the area is very quiet but we didn't really have great views from our room (down an alley). The only bad thing was that our shower temperature kept changing which was pretty annoying considering the supposed quality of this hotel. The reception was very professional but not quite friendly but, we're American and may have just expected an occasional smile.
