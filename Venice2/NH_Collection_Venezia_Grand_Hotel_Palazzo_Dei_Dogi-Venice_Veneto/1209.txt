This elegant hotel has a marvelous location, away from the hustle and bustle, but very easy to get to all the prime locations that Venice is known for.  Hotel lobby is beautiful and staff was very friendly and welcoming. The garden which includes an outdoor restaurant is breathtaking and unexpected. The breakfast buffet has a wide selection, and if you are a platinum member, it's inclusive with your room rate.  It's picture perfect! We found the room quiet, cool and very comfortable. The concierge was helpful with great suggestions, and quickly made arrangements with the hotel taxi to transport us to Marano or St. Mark' Square.  Overall, a beautiful hotel with staff that was happy to assist in any way possible.  Looking forward to returning in the near future and highlyâ€¦
