This hotel is in a quiet location, but in walking distance of all of Venice.  I was there for four nights and  stayed in one of the rooms in the garden away from the main building.  This location was peaceful and serene with the roses in the garden n full bloom and the room had a terrace with table and chairs.  Room was large as was the bathroom.  Service was excellent and efficient.
