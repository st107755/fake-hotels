Cornareggio is probably the most qiuet and relaxing Sestiere in Venezia and the hotel nicely matches the flavour Friendly and warm service, wonderful garden (very rare in Venice) and... Away from the crowd... But just 15 minutes of relaxing walk from Ri Alto or you can take the taxi boat for free (a nice classic venetian motoscafo) Rooms would need some attention to be a full 5star, anyway more than acceptable and everything was working fine (a/c, plugs, shower, etc) Excellent breakfast
