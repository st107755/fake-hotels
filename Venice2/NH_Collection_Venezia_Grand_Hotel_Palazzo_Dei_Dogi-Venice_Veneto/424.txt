The Boscolo is a 5 star property that is truly 5 stars. The staff are great and the garden and grounds are very unusual for Venice. Very quiet and calming. We will return again I hope. The beds are first rate and everything is excellent shape. Good food and service in the restaurant. They have a complimentary shuttle to Murano and also to San Marco Plazza.
