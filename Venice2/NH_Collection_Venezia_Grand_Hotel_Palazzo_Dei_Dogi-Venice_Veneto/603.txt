We stayed there for one night before leaving on a Mediterranean cruise.   The hotel is beautiful.   We were told it was first a home for noblemen, then a convent and an embassy (maybe in reverse order?), and now a hotel.   The lobby is elegant, with a giant Murano chandelier.   The rooms were lovely, with a large marble bathroom.   The only negative (and it something to consider) is the location.   While it IS on a quiet canal and off the beaten path, it is an issue to get to and from there.   The private water taxi from the airport was going to be 130 Euros, so we took the public water taxi, which was inexpensive, but a hassle and a long walk with our large suitcases.  We did take the private water taxi (which was fabulous!!) to the port the next day, but also expensive - 90â€¦
