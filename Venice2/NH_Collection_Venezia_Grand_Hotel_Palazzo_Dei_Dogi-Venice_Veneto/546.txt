You're in Venice so you have to adjust your expectations.  This hotel is very conveniently situated just around the corner from the train station (however, quite a hike with bags from the drop-off on the boat from the airport, so keep that in mind) so it's quite convenient if you are starting your trip to Italy with a trip to Venice and then working your way through Italy.  Breakfast was typical and the room was spacious with a private bath. No AC to watch it in the hot summer months!
