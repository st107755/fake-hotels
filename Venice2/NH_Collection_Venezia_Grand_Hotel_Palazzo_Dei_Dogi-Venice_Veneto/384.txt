From the reviews I wasn't expecting this hotel to be this nice.  We had Starwood points that we wanted to use so this hotel came up.  Many average reviews but I think it deserves better.  The rooms were very nice with high ceilings.  Appointed well too.  Food was ok.  I can't give it a five mostly because of struggling AC and mosquitoes in the outside dining but it is a nice hotel.
