This was a very pleasant stay with first rate look and feel.  The location on the north side was great as we got to walk through Venice on various routes to St Mark's, the Rialto, Ghetto, etc.  Early mornings and evenings saw the real people of Venice going about their day.  Hotel room was clean and well appointed but not large.  Service was fine.  Breakfast was not included in our rate (high).  Could have added at 25 euros each - discovered on last day it would be 35 euros as we had not prepaid.  Complimentary water taxi a nice touch but walking is the way to see the most.
