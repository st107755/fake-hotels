We stayed at Boscolo in late December 2012.  Hotel is very nice, very well managed, and staff was beyond being nice and professional.  The lobby is beautiful and looks more a museum than a hotel.  Rooms as spacious and clean.  The place is not cheap, and there are some less expensive options in Venice.  However, it is a good value for the money. The location is a bit far from the main attractions in Venice, but a 30 min walk is not a bad thing :-), and get a chance to see the city.  We did not dine at the hotel, so I cannot say much about the restaurant.  There are plenty of dining options within a 5 min walk.
