We stayed at this hotel on the Best of Italy Globus 11 day tour in mid Sep 2011.  Remember when you are out of your normal surroundings things are different.  They will not be the same as you are use to.  Take it with a grain of salt and make the best of it. Hotels and food are not what you are use  to. Know that going into the vacation.  Very nice hotel. Has restaurant and bar and a spa you can book. But beware of prices in bar!  There did not appear to be anything close by this hotel.    The room is extremely nice. Has a full size safe big enough for iPad. One outlet for electric. The power appears to stay on. It has a bidet and hair dryer. They provide lotion, bath gel & salts, shampoo, no conditioner. There is small room off the lobby that has ice water and coffee all day.â€¦
