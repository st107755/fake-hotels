The hotel was very nice. Frankly, we do not have anything that really turned us off except for the cost of the drinks and food. Breakfast was €35 per person per day, and other meals were priced much higher than any other restaurant we went to. The cost of one Beer (Lowenbrau bottle) was €9, and Wine was €12. Again, the Hotel was very nice, and the workers, rooms, and ambience were nice as well. We just did not like how they really tried to stick it to you with the cost of the food and drinks.
