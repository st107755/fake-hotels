We occupied three rooms, with our family group of seven. Each was reasonably well restored in this historic, beautiful property. The staff were friendly, pleasant, and supportive. The location, with its gardens, is perfect in Venice (if you wish a quiet setting, away from the crowds). It is easy to reach the sights, on foot, by water bus, or water taxi. The hotel water taxi to Murano, and St Marcos Square is a bonus. The restaurant is in a wonderful garden setting. There are many high quality restaurants within a short walk.
