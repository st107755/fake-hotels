We stayed in 2 different rooms at this hotel, and they were a well decorated with lots of Murano glass, both as functional and art pieces.  Both rooms had a curious use of space, but were large and comfortable.  While every single guest I encountered was American, the staff struggled to interpret our room service requests, but that's reasonable since we're in another country!  Also, all the television channels were in not-English, which isn't surprising, just frustrating when that's the activity of choice.  I got a LOVELY massage in their small spa and considered coming down for a soak.
