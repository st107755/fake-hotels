We visited as a family of 4 from March 16-18. Our flight was delayed so we arrived instead on the 17th and didnt get as much time. However what little time we got was made splendid by the staff at this lovely hotel. Their reservation staff and dining room staff is the best. The food is good too. The breakfast spread is yummy. The rooms are clean, cozy, and the amenities are excellent.
