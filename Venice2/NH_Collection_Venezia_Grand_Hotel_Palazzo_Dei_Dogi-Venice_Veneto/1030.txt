The hotel was beautiful! Old century feel; wonderful location.. However the Marriott should reconsider it's affiliation!! They clearly stated they were ONLY affiliated and not a Marriott and not under their management. We were kept waiting for a room, told to sit out in the courtyard and wait for a welcome drink, which we are still waiting for!! They forgot to book our shuttle to town which left without us, while we waited in the lobby.. All of this combined wasted previous hours of the short stay we had in Venice! We had a fabulous experience at all the other Marriott hotels we stayed at in Italy - Rome, Florence.. So were quite shocked. Of course issues happen, but remorse or an attitude of good service can easily help you move on. Not here! All of the staff seemed to thinkâ€¦
