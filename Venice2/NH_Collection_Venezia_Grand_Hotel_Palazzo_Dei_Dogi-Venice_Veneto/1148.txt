As per the review of the room with the spiral staircase and a no purpose solarium....I totally agree!  To go to the bathroom at night was a challenge down a steep spiral staircase.....and that's after walking through a dark garden in the rain to get to the room.  When checking in, please be sure you are in the main building!
