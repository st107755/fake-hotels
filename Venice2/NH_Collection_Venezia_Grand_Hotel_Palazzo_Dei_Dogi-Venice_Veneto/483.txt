Stayed here last night and was impressed.  The building is grand and glorious and the service was friendly and warm.  It is not convenient to the touristy areas of Venice and that was a big plus and helped me to decide to book it; however, we had a bit of a problem finding our way back... Our fault not the hotel's fault.  We took part in the breakfast and it was quite extensive by Italian standards.    We would definitely stay here again.
