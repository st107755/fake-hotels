This was the 2nd time we stayed with the Boscolo hotels. Venice was a different experience from our previous stay, we had a great assistance to find the hotel location(knowing Venice), great welcome, spacious room, excellent breakfast. If I was to be picky I will say that the view from the room was not at good, but anyhow in Venice you don't need a view as the city is enchanting when you stroll around. I will recommend the hotel for other friends.
