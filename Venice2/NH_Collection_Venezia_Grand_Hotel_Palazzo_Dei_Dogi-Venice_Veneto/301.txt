Was welcomed warmly at check in and given a room at the end of the hotel near the dock. the room was on the first floor. We immediately dropped the bags off and left without examination. once we had returned to the room I began looking around and noticed the room was extremely worn and dirty. (cobwebs, dead insects everywhere, mold, and broken items) It was not to the quality of what I would have expected from the establishment. I asked for another room but was informed they were full and that they would have to move me in the morning.   The following morning I expressed my displeasure with the room and the fact it was barely habitable and they decided to give me an upgrade to the presidential suite. I said thank you but it did not excuse the fact that we were stuck in the roomâ€¦
