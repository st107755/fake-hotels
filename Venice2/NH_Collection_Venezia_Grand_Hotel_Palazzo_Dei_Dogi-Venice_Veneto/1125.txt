I recently attempted to book a business meeting for 12 people at this hotel and found the staff to be unresponsive and out of touch with the local environment.  Their prices were more than double similarly rated hotels in Venice city.  When given the competitive information, they acknowledged that the hotel was overpriced but were not willing to consider any reduction in price or increased services.  The price gap was over 1,000 per person for a 3 day meeting!  Based on the comments on TA and my experience attempting to deal with the staff of this hotel, I would steer clear of this property.  There are too many choices in Venice!
