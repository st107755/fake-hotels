Lovely hotel - truly beautiful garden, gorgeous rooms and good breakfast. Easy reach to the centre of the tourist parts of Venice but far enough away to be slightly apart and the better for it - Venice does get massively crowded so to be able to retreat to quiter canals and local restaurants and bars is really special.
