This is a beautiful old palazzo that has been converted into a historic and authentique venetian hotel. Our room was large and comfortable. The hotel is elegant, perhaps a little worn around the edges but more than makes up for it with its quiet serene location and a beautiful garden with lagoon view.  The free canal boat service several times a day to the Rialto area is another bonus.
