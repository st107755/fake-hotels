We stayed at the Boscolo the last week in September for five nights.  Wonderful!  We were there as Reward Points guests and as Platinum guests were upgraded to a large room on the 4th floor.  Breakfast was complimentary each morning in the delightful outdoor dining room.  The staff was warm and welcoming, twice the chef sent out complimentary appetizers, and one evening treated us to complimentary lemoncello.  The food was good and we ate there several times.  The location is quiet, the garden the most beautiful we saw in Venice, and the dock on the lagoon made a great place to get acquainted with other guests.  We absolutely loved it there, and would recommend it!
