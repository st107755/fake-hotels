We have spent 3 nigths including New year's eve in a small room, with no views at all and with broken air con unit that banged really noisily continuously.  In spite of the fact that we did our booking (a double non smoking room) 3 months in advance, they gave us a smoking room, we complaint for a change but despite offering assistance with outings etc. they never called back.  Our room need of a refurb - some walls has ripped cloth.  The rooms could be charming and you might be luckier than us in getting a better room - but when you pay more than 150 euros by night we guess you may expect total comfort   In room mini-bar prices are abusive, a bottle of water or a Coke 8 euros!!!!  Definitely not worth the 5 stars or the price that we paid!
