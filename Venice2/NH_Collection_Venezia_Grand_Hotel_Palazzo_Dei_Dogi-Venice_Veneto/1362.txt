If you are looking for a hotel away from the crowd, this is the one. This hotel is directly based on the sea and the Canal in the same time, just minutes away from the routes to main Venice attractions. The rooms are beautiful with sense of old style; also they do have a private garden which i think is the only hotel in Venice with garden. The food is really good; they do have this breakfast menu that gives you choices to select from apart of the buffet. Staff member were very nice and helpful.
