We were treated very well by the knowledgeable staff and were especially happy with the concierge.  The hotel itself was beautiful, with huge sitting rooms on the second floor and a fabulous garden area that has to be unique in Venice.  Our room was plenty large enough and very comfortable. Breakfast was included in our rate and the selection was great.  It even included a made to order hot dish.  The bar was small but adequate.  Probably the best part of the stay for us was the hotel's location in a back neighborhood that was almost entirely inhabited by locals.  After busy, crowded, days hitting the tourist attractions of Venice, we greatly appreciated coming back to our quiet neighborhood and visiting the local places to eat and drink.
