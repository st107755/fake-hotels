We recently stayed at Grand Hotel Dei Dogi. We are a family of 4 with two teenagers. We stayed in the junior suite. The room was incredible with a most spacious bathrooms. The room was incredibly elegant with a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us! The area is quiet and removed from the tourist areas. The grounds are spectacular and beautiful. It is a true oasis. We hope to return in the future. It was also very easy access to walk to the vaporetto stop to Murano/Burano.
