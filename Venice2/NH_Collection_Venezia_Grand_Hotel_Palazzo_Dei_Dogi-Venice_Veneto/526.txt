You'll need a water taxi to get here as it is not near any of the main tourist spots. But this hotel is pure luxury and even has a wonderful restaurant. The room was simply fantastic. We went in the off-season on a travel agent's recommendation, but the visit was extremely well worth it. If you need any help around the city or neighboring islands, just ask the concierge, Ivan. The rest of the staff were fabulous as well.
