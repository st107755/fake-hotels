I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay here. From the moment we stepped into this elegant building the staff made us feel welcomed and at home. They were friendly and tentative and did everything it seemed to ensure our stay was a pleasant one. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the other autograph collection hotels we stayed at during our trip. Apart from the exceptional service our rooms were spacious, well appointed and luxurious. The breakfast was delicious and offered an variety of fresh fruits, breads, and hot items. It was served  by a beautiful garden with covered seating.
