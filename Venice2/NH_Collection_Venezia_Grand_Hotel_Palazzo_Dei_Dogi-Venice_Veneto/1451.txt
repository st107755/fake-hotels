My husband and I stayed at this hotel, earlier this month.  The reason we picked it, was that it has recently become a Marriott property.   We were not disappointed in any way.  Had a fabulous room, overlooking the canal, that oozed old world charm. The hotel is situated on a canal, and a short walk from two vaporetto stops.  Remember that if you don't take a water taxi (which are expensive) you will have to drag your suitcases, over cobblestones and over bridges to get to the hotel.   The hotel has its own water taxi, that takes you to St. Marks Square, which is convenient and very fun, but it does not take you back and forth from the train station or airport. It has the largest private garden in Venice, which is totally enchanting, and unexpected.  Must be great for weddings.â€¦
