This was my second time in Venice and I had a good, but not great experience at Hotel Boscolo.   I really struggled with this review. I wanted to give Boscolo 5 stars, because the front desk manager (I think his name was Claudio) really tried his best to make us happy. I applaud him and the hotel for this effort, but there were too many small issues that made me stick with a 3 star review.  First off, you must know that this hotel is truly “off the beaten path” in Venice. I do not think the hotel rate properly reflects the location disadvantage. You can definitely stay at a nice hotel more centrally located for 350 EUR/night. It takes a solid 20-30min to get to St Mark’s Square after making your way through the streets/crowds. The hotel does offer complimentary boat shuttle…
