With every bridge we crossed, we knew we were getting away from the mass of tourists.  We arrived in probably the most tranquil location in Venice. Our room was suite sized overlooking the canal. Opening the windows at any time was a view into true Venice life.  The garden hiding behind the property was great to stroll through and find a quiet seat to enjoy a couple glasses of wine.  Strolling the local canals, we found great places to eat and local wine bars to enjoy a few drinks.it was a short walk to the main shopping areas. Fantastic choice, you wonâ€™t be disappointed.
