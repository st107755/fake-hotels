The hotel location is fabulous - quiet and very atmospheric on a small canal with some lovely restaurants and a few shops close by.  The hotel free boat to St. Marks is a beautiful comfortable boat that goes about 8 times a day - we took it round trip before dinner one evening just for the ride.  The hotel staff were good and helpful.  The hotel itself physically is OK, not great - it claims to have been 100% renovated in 2011 but our room was very tired and looked like it hadn't had a makeover for 20 years.  The bath shower had no curtain or shield so you had to be very careful to not splash directly into the bathroom. We could not get the hotel internet to work in two attempts.
