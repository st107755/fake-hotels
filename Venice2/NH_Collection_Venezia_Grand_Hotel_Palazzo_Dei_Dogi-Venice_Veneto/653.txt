My partner and I booked this beautiful looking 5 star hotel for 2 nights using points (90,000).  That's a lot of points so expected a very nice place and room.  Upon checking in, the front desk was relatively nice and when we asked for an upgraded room type or at least a view/higher room floor (which is in our profile with Marriott)...they said sorry we don't have anything.  We were still excited to stay in Venice so walked to the first floor room (114, don't accept this room if you stay here) with her.  It was a standard room, small, no view...with a leak in the bathroom sink.  They did offer to have someone come look at the leak, but we were fine with it as we were ready to explore the city.  We were disappointed that the hotel couldn't, or wouldn't, offer any different roomâ€¦
