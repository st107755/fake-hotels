What a beautiful hotel set at the edge of the lagoon with views of Murano. The reception from the staff was friendly and welcoming and our whole stay was made easy by their helpfulness.  The room were full of charm and character and history. The breakfast each day was superb. Big plus was the free shuttle to st marks square through the day.  Would stay here again as the location was great with numerous bars and restaurants a short walk away. Plus we walked through the city to st marks from here in 25 mins.
