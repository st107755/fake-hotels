if you do not want the hoopla of the tourist area this is the perfect hotel.  Free water taxi in the morning to the square, and then walk back enjoying the city.  Staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Great little restaurant a few canals down to the right and a place that sells wine in 2 liter bottles right from the tap.  It was lovely.
