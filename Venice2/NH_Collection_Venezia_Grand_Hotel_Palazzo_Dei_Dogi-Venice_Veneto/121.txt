Went to Venice for a weekend and decided to stay here as it is part of Marriott. I liked the location because it is in a quiet part of Venice away from the busy touristy streets. The hotel offers a shuttle boat to San Marco so you don't have to worry about getting to the most popular attraction if you don't want to walk. They even offered a glass art tour complimentary over at Murano island which was excellent.   On the whole, the hotel could use some major updating. It is in an old, elegant style, but you can see the wear and tear of many things in the room and the overall dirt from years and years of use. I was quite surprised to find this when paying over 300 euros per night. Also, as other travelers mentioned on here, the towels are crap and were falling apart as I wasâ€¦
