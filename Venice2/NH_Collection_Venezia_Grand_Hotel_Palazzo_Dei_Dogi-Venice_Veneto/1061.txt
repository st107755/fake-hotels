My wife and I spent 3 nights in this beautiful hotel. It was a quiet, delightful hotel in a residential area. Venice is a beautiful city to visit...but it can be very hectic. It was nice to enjoy the crowds and then go back to the Boscolo Venezia and relax. We also had a great dinner there one evening. I am a Platinum Marriott person...so breakfast was included. It was fantastic buffet that also included specialty items (eggs cooked to order, etc.) freshly prepared by the chef. We arrived by train and had no trouble catching the correct vaporetto (water bus) to get to the hotel. Also, we took that same mode of transportation to the airport which was extremely inexpensive and easy to do. The dell'Orto vaporetto stop is very close to the hotel (3 minute walk) and is the stop youâ€¦
