Excellent hotel in Cannaregio. There is very convenient access to Alilaguna from the airport (1 stop). The place is very peaceful and the hotel itself has a pretty large private garden. San Marco can be reached on foot in about half an hour.  The hotel is more than 500 years old and is located in a palace. I was accommodated in the Junior Suite - the room was very comfortable and nice, with very high ceilings. The service was excellent and the staff was very kind and helpful. We had breakfast at the hotel, there is a great variety of things. We also visited the restaurant, which is excellent Italian restaurant. The hotel also organizes free tours to the nearby island of Murano with a visit to the glass workshop, which are also interesting.
