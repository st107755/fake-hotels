From the super kindness of the staff, without exception, the the perfect location in a quiet part of Venice, the two days we spent there were really enjoyable. Venice in August can be hell, just hang around the Piazza San Marco to check it out. But this hotel stands in a beautifull location, away from touriste. The few canals around are full of small local restaurant with NO tourist menu. The very convenient shuttle between the hotel and Piazza San Marco is nice to take both ways just for sightseeing.
