The staff and service was worth the visit to this hotel.  The breakfast was very good but most of all we truly enjoyed staying in a historic hotel away from the trourist area.  There were some great restaurants located within walking distance from the hotel in a residential area.  We scheduled a shared taxi from the hotel and the drop off was in front of the hotel.  St Marks is also within walking distance of the hotel so we took the complimentary water shuttle that left every several hours and returned to the hotel by walking.  Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again.
