A historic home converted to the French Embassy, then to a Nunnery, and finally to a Hotel.  Elegant and charming, with beautiful garden (that is worth seeing even if not staying at the hotel).  Pros: Service, incredible garden, elegant and tasty breakfast, wonderful shuttle boat service to St. Marc's square. (Piazza San Marco), away from the main tourist area.  Cons: Pricey - par for Venice and 5-star. Older construction - but par for Venice.  Overall: Absolutely wonderful upscale hotel, with the best service of the hotels we stayed in while visiting Italy.
