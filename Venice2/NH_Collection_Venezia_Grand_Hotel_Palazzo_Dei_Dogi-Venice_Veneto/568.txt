Visiting Venice after a cruise and decided to stay at the Boscolo Venezia a Marriott property. Beautiful hotel situated in an old monastery. It's away from the downtown tourist masses and very quiet with free water taxi to the major attractions. Beds are comfortable, rooms larger than usual and the staff is exceptional. A description of the hotel defies  words, beautiful Murano glass chandleries, gardens to relax in and calm your travel nerves.   Lots of restaurants close by, directions are needed with a map at the front desk.   The bad, can't think of a thing.   Sorry to leave this hotel.   Chow chow
