The hotel was true to its claim. It was beautiful and away from the touristy SAN Marco. Itâ€™s location gave us the opportunity to explore Venice in its spirit and soul. The staff was very helpful. Andrea and his team turned the meals into an experience. The internet in one of the rooms was an issue and the spa was not really good. But everything else was very good! Free ride to the glass factory and San Marco were very helpful.
