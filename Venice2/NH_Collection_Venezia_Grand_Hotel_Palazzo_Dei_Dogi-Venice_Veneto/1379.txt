My wife and I just returned from a 2-week vacation in Italy, which included 5 nights in the gorgeous Boscolo Venezia hotel and 6 nights at the beautiful Hotel La Flora in Rome. It would be hard to decide which property was best...both are excellent choices when traveling in Italy.  My wife fell in love with the entire staff at the Boscolo -  they are very friendly and accommodating - willing to provide whatever assistance you need.  We loved the location away from the crowds and near a number of great neighborhood restaurants.  We walked for hours every day throughout Venice, and were always pleased to return to the serenity of the Boscolo. We had no issues with our room - it was beautifully appointed and remained at a comfortable temperature, both day and night.  Give it a tryâ€¦
