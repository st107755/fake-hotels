We stayed 4 nights before catching a cruise. We caught bus #5 from the airport and then walked to the hotel, don't repeat our mistake, take a water taxi from the bus station! When we arrived hot, tired and sweaty we expected to have to wait for a room since we arrived in the AM. Not only did we not, but they upgraded our room! Pros: Location, quiet it's on the north side easy walk to San Marcos or take their free shuttle, which also goes to the Murano factory. Breakfast, very good but watch out for the pigeons. Staff, outstanding, kudos to Ivan the concierge, who was invaluable in helping first time visitors.  Many places to eat around the hotel where the locals eat including  a nice couple of places which served either beer or wine. Grocey store within 2 or 3 minutes. Cons:â€¦
