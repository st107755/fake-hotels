Location: 2/5 It's 15-20 min walk away from the train station and another 25min walk away to the central attraction of Venice. Quiet little place if that's what you fancy.   Room: 1/5 "Venician size" is what they call it, according to the hotel staff. And that's after I received double upgrades, the room is less than 20sqm I reckon. Barely any space to move around. What makes it worse, they do not provide drinking bottled water in the room. Only one bottle pet stay. We went to the supermarket 15 minutes walk away, and carried 12 litres worth of drinks back.   Service: 3/5 Generally polite, but it lacks a professional concierge team. They tried their best to help though which I appreciate. One tainted experience - My points and nights are not credited to my account despite meâ€¦
