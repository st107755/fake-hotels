We spent one night at the Boscolo Venezia before getting on our cruise ship.  We used our Marriott points to stay and were happy with the accomodations.  The Alilaguna boat from the airport took us straight to the dock the hotel recommended with just a short walk (no bridges) to get to the hotel.  The hotel is lovely and is an old palace so it has a regal feel.  The rooms were spacious and the breakfast delicious.  The concierge was friendly and helpful in planning our 1/2 day in Venice. The hotel is a 25 minute walk to St. Mark's Square so you need to walk to see the sights, but we didn't mind.  I would recommend the hotel, especially if you can stay with your points.
