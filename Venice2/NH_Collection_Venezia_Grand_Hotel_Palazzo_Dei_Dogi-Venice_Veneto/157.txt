We do not visit Venice often and usually stay more central. We were here for a wedding and this hotel was close to ty church. The staff and the ambience could not be better. We chose to use room service the day we arrived and it was efficient and delicious. The garden is under going a restoration but was still enchanting. Lots of good local restaurants as well.
