This Is a very quaint hotel off the beaten path in Venice.  The room was excellent, bathroom was very nice, and the hotel staff spoke very good English and were extremely helpful in assisting us in planning our day in Venice, with maps and shuttles to where we wanted to visit. Make sure you check out the gardens in the back of the hotel.
