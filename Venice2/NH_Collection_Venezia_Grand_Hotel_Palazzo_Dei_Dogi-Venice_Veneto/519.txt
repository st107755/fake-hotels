This hotel is relatively big considering it's in Venice.  It's a bit of a walk to the main part of Venice, which might be a disadvantage for people who want to be near the "action".  If you want to be away from the crowd, this is the place for you.  They service great coffee!  Staff is very attentive to your needs.
