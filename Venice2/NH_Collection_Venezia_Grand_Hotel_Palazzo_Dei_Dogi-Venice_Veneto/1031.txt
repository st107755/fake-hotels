After a wonderful stay at 2 Marriotts in Italy we booked this hotel for the 4th of July for 2 nights, thinking it would have a similar standard. We checked in at 2 pm and were told to wait at the restaurant for a welcome drink by the reception staff. After 15 mins I reminded her we were still waiting and were told it was coming. Finally after 30 mins we decided to go to the room which we were told was ready at 2 pm to find some engineers were "servicing" the aircon systems. We requested that welcome drinks be sent to the room which she agreed to to but never sent them. Then when I asked for change for 500 I was told to go to a bank 2 canals away..... Can you imagine that this hotel did not have 500 Euros in the til.  We booked the water Taxi drop off for the afternoon afterâ€¦
