Our trip started out on the wrong foot when the airline lost our luggage, however the service of the staff to help us with the process and assist with our needs was above and beyond what we would normally expect.  The rooms themselves were well appointed, and would have been 5 star if the beds were a little more comfortable (we found them just a bit too firm, same with the pillows). We loved the location--a quiet neighborhood about a 5-10 minute walk from dining and shops, and about 20 minutes from the most touristy areas. When our travels bring us back to Venice we will definitely stay here again, even though the cost is a bit above what we normally would pay on vacation.
