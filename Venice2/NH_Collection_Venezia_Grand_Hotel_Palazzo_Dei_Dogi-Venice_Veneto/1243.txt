We stayed at this beautiful hotel for three nights in May 2013 with our daughter and niece.  We rented two rooms.  The rooms, while not large, were beautiful, with large comfortable beds and a gorgeous bathroom.    The service was first rate.  It is highly unusual to have the concierge escort you personally to your room.  We have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, and the service here compares favorably.    The garden behind the hotel is one of the best I've seen at a hotel in Italy.  It has beautiful walkways, fountains, a grotto, and then opens on the Adriatic.  Some of the hotel rooms are back in this garden.  I would imagine they are beautiful.  It is a thirty-minute walk to San Marco square, but it is a really nice stroll.  I would highly recommend thisâ€¦
