Beautiful, historic hotel. Overall very happy with the hotel. The rooms are massive, the service is exceptional. They have a beautiful garden. It is a little of the beaten path but that is a good thing since you are away from the massive amounts of tourists. The breakfast is amazing.  If you take the orange ferry line from the airport it is the first stop (15 min ride) and then 2 min walk to the hotel. The hotel offers a free water shuttle service to the main square and you are a 10-15 min walk to the train station.  A few things that knock it from 5 to 4 stars: 1) the lobby is warm and humid (when it’s humid outside).  2) The WiFi reaches the entire hotel but only really works in the lobby. 3) Mosquitoes are prevalent in Venice are are so around the hotel and I’ve been bitten…
