Stayed at the Boscola for 4 nights. The hotel was gorgeous. It had been an old palace and so the architecture was quirky and interesting, and the garden was a great place to relax at the end of the day. The hotel is in a quiet part of the city, but with lots of local restaurants close by and with a free shuttle to the city centre. Walking around Venice is easy to do as well. The holiday was made even better by the helpfulness of all the staff. Giorgia on the front desk could not have been more helpful, and Ivan, the concierge, was knowledgeable and helpful in giving us information on how to get around. The hotel has a free shuttle to Murano which is a great place to spend time. A highlight for me was the wonderful spa and facial from Maria in the Luxury spa at the hotel. Mariaâ€¦
