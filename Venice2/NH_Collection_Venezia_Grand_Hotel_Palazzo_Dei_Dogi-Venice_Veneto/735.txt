The hotel itself was beautiful and in a nice, quiet location that was still close to everything.  Staff was friendly and we enjoyed our time here.  However, we both needed to get work done while in the room and the wifi was so terrible that we ended up having to take our work elsewhere to finish it.  I have no idea how it could have been so terrible for the entire 4 days of our stay, but that was really disappointing and put a damper on our trip.  Further, there was not even a desk in the hotel room at all.  Overall, great for a purely romantic trip... but if you plan to be productive at all, you should choose a different location.
