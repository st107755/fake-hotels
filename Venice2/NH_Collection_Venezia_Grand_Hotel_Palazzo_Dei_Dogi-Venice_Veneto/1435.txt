When I first booked here I was a bit nervous. The reviews were mixed and many reviewers thought the distances from St Marks was an issue. Secondly as a business traveler that does 130 nights a year I love my Marriotts when i am at a conference or having meetings but never convinced Marriott does upscale boutique style hotels very well. I am a huge Marriott fan but everyone has a niche.  In the last year I have started staying at their Autograph collection and really been impressed. From the Carlton and Algonquin in NYC to the one in Minneapolis I have been impressed with the really different approach.  So , in that spirit we booked for a 4 night stay.     Hotel.  It's lovely. Built around an amazing hidden garden that serves as a retreat from the throngs of St Marks we spentâ€¦
