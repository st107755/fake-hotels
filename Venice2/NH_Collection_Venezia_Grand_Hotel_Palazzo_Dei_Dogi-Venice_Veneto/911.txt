The staff at this lovely, quiet hotel were excellent ... beginning with a room selected especially for us on our Sister's Trip.   A beautiful accommodation and roomy enough for all three of us.  We wanted a hotel with local color - not an American experience and this hotel was perfect.    The taxi service is worth staying here alone ... beautiful boats took us back and forth from St. Marks/City Center and Murano Island.  AMAZing breakfast in a beautiful small dining room.
