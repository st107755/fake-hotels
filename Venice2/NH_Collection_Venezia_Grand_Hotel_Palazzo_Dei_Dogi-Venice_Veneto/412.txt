The best part about our experience with this hotel is Ivan, the concierge. Ivan was helpful, professional and gave us great suggestions about places to see and how to get there. Ivan should get 5 amazing stars!  The hotel: We are Platinum Elite Marriott members and I have to say we received a very greeted welcome from the two ladies running the front desk. I cant' say this hotel is charming, although it a polite way, it has a lot of character. We booked 2 rooms for this trip. You get the feeling this hotel was last decorated and upgraded in the early 1900's. The bathrooms are in desperate need of upgrading. Your have to turn the sinks off by literally squeezing them off for the water to stop dripping. The toilet is behind the door so you can't open the bathroom door all the way,â€¦
