This was my first time in Venice and was hoping for a hotel a little closer to the action, but boy was I happy we ended up here. The location was a bit out of the way from the sights, but it came in handy when it was time to walk off our meals! You also got to see parts of the city you normally would not have my staying close to St. Marks square. We also found some great restaurants and little shops nearby. The facility itself was beautiful, with a lawn out back to sun yourself, as well as a private dock with some chairs to sit down with a bottle of whine if you chose to relax on-site. We got upgraded (thank you Marriott status!) to a beautiful and monstrous room. Huge by European standards. Finally, the staff was great! Super friendly, accommodating, informative, and spokeâ€¦
