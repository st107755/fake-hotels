The Boscolo is a great and luxurious hotel.  The room is big and the towels/bathrobes are pure white and soft.  The room has a nice chandelier and the bathrooms have gold colored tiles.  The check in was smooth.  The hotel has a complimentary boat that takes you to the San Marco square so you dont really spend any money going to the center.
