As someone who travels globally for a living I can say the staff are what stands out the most about the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi. The hospitality and genuine care the staff show make you feel as if you are an old friend, even if it is your first time. The location is ideally located away from the chaos and overcrowding of St. Mark's Square. They do have a shuttle boat that will take you to/from the square at designated times. However, their are more than enough delicious restaurants and great shops within walking distance. I loved this hotel so much I am re-working my honeymoon itinerary just to coe back with my fiance. I can't wait!
