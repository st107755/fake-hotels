My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights during a trip for New Years Eve.  The hotel is nice with friendly staff but be prepared to walk quite a lot as the main attractions are a good 20-30 minute walk away.  For the price I expected better rooms, the photos on the hotel website make the rooms look far bigger than they actually are.  We didn’t eat in the restaurant so can’t comment on the food.
