We stayed in this hotel in March and we loved it, they are currently have some works going onsite (no disturbance at all).   The room and the bed were so comfortable and the breakfast selection was excellent!  I would like to specifically thank the staff - Taylan was so attentive and kind and Beatrice was always on duty and so patient! Thank you for everything   PS. The complimentary shuttle from the hotel is a must for already tired guests!   We want to be back soon.   Tamara
