I travel extensively for business and used mostly points while in Italy recently on vacation. My stay at the Boscola Venezia was by far one of the nicest hotels I have been able to stay in many many years.  From the moment we entered the hotel, the reception clerks and concierge made us feel welcome and offered to help and did for the next 3 days.  The breakfast set-up was incredible along with the service provided.  The gentleman responsible for the bar treated us like royalty and made us want to enjoy dinner at the hotel one evening. He was our waiter at dinner and provided us with the same level of service.  Rooms are spacious and incredibly quiet. Hotel is a 25 minute walk to San Marco Square which was perfect during carnival.  would stay here every time in Venice.
