This is an 'Old World' style hotel. Classic Italian rooms, gilded mirrors, heavy brocade fabric, and marbled bathrooms. The garden is a real surprise and worth meandering through. The hotel manager was fantastic and went out of her way to assist us more then once with questions. We found this location to be quiet and a very pleasant walk to the more crowded areas of the city. One point of advice-if you arrive with lots of luggage (or heavy baggage) take a private water taxi-worth the expense especially for the pics.
