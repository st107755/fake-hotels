Four stars for the proximity to the water bus stop and great non-touristy happy hour bars.  Average check-in experience (room wasn't ready at 2pm).  This is a former mansion so all the rooms are different.  Evidently some have bath tubs and some don't.  Nice amenities -- robes, slippers, etc.  Rooms could use some updating -- but if you approach your stay as a chance to stay in a historic palace in Venice rather than a cookie cutter five-star you will enjoy your stay.  Breakfast was above average -- prosecco and fresh juice is included, and a great cheese selection... but eggs were pre-cooked, rubbery and cold (don't expect the hot dishes to look like the photos on the menu).  Tip: put on some mosquito spray, then go for a relaxing stroll through the lush, surprisingly largeâ€¦
