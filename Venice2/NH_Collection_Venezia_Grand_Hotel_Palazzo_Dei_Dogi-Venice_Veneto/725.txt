I stayed five nights at the Boscolo Venezia. The staff was incredibly polite, helpful and professional. Our room, overlooking the garden included a sitting area and a desk. The housekeeping was excellent. The hotel provided daily water taxis to and from San Marco and Murano. We were walking distance from many wonderful and local areas including the Jewish Ghetto the Madonna dell Orto church. Wonderful local restaurants were close by including Al Faro for great salads and Pizza and Al Cantino for fresh fish and a creative menu. Because I was a Marriott platinum elite traveler age nervous breakfast was included. The business center included hot coffee and tea and water available all day. If you are looking for a place a bit off the tourist beaten path, but comfortable and elegantâ€¦
