Staying on the island made it easy to get around. It is in a more residential neighborhood but is easily accessible by water taxi. They have excellent services like the water taxi to San Marcos or the the Murano Glass Factory. The breakfast was great and the staff make me feel very welcome. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Venice.
