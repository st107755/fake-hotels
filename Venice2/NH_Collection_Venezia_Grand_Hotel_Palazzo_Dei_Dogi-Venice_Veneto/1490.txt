Travelled to this hotel for 25th wedding anniversary.  Booked a deluxe room and it was lovely, bathroom stylish but shower leaked water everywhere and bathroom was awash at times...if you do not have breakfast included in the price do not bother with it...at 30 euros per person totally overpriced and inadequate. This applies to rest of hotel amenities, ie bar, minibar and restaurant even allowing for the fact that Venice is expensive.  Took us 40 minutes to walk to St Marks Square but we enjoyed the walk as everywhere you went there was always something to look at.
