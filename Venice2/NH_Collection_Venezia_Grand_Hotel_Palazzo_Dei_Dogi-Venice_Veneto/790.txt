The hotel is exceptionally managed. Staff is very efficient and generally friendly. Attention to detail throughout. Rooms are very clean organized and everything works as expected.  Nice touch with quality toiletries. Quality through out. Breakfast is over the top.  Accessible via water taxi or a short hike from the main canal.  Will stay again.
