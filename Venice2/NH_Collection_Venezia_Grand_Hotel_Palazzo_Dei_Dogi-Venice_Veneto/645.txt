Lovely hotel with a charming and friendly staff! We were upgraded to a beautiful suite and they went out of their way to accommodate any request. The complimentary boat ride to San Marco is a treat. I would rate our dinner three and a half stars, although it's not for lack of effort on their part. The outdoor garden setting is very nice but both the service and the food was a bit clunky and uneven for the price. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. It's away from the "action" so keep that in mind depending on your preferences.
