Travelling so much on business I choose the hotels I stay at for leisure very carefully.  This hotel is exactly what I needed in Venice, it is quiet, small and full of character.  Those expecting the plastic chain-hotel experience please go elsewhere.  This hotel oozes history and character.  Whilst the bar is small, there are always great conversations to be had with other guests especially when the Prosecco is flowing!  The food in the restaurant is really good, I would eat there again any time.  Like all good hotels, it is the staff that add the last bit of magic to make a great experience.  I will definitely be back.
