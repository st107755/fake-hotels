We stayed here for three nights while in Venice.  The hotel is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but is still close enough to walk to St. Mark's Square (approx. 15 minutes) and anywhere else you'd want to go.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Great breakfast.  The room was charming and quiet.  There is also a great dock in the back of the hotel accessible to all guests where you can sip on a glass of wine and enjoy beautiful views of the water.  Highly recommend this hotel!!
