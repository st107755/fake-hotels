We booked the hotel on spec through Expedia and whilst we had read a review or two we had little idea of its qualities. In the event the four of us (our kids are 11 and 13) had a wonderful stay. Our room was clean, stately and had a lovely view over a small canal. The breakfasts were heroically good - as good as I've had and I've had a few!   The hotel is 30 mins or so away from st Marks Square and has some lovely restaurents close by - Bentigodi and Colimbina - and the concierge was excellent at directing us.   So far as location is concerned Venice is all about ambling along, crossing canals and sucking up the scenery, so even with two (relatively young) kids, the walk was fine.   So in summary, the stay was excellent. Genuinely, surprisingly good and very Italian. Staffâ€¦
