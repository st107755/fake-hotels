My wife and I stayed at the Boscolo Venezia from 10/21-10/27 and had a tremendous experience.  To get there from the airport, you simply take the Orange line and it drops you off at the Orto stop.  From there it is about a two-minute walk to the front door.  So right away we were off and running.    We walked in the front door and were blown away by the decor, the cleanliness and the overall feel of the property.  As a Marriott Gold member, I was most pleased to hear upon check in that I had been upgraded to a Garden Suite, which we absolutely loved.  The walk through the garden to the room was a treat every time, and the view of the lagoon to the north was really special.    I can't talk enough about the service we received.  From Ivan the Concierge to the incredible front deskâ€¦
