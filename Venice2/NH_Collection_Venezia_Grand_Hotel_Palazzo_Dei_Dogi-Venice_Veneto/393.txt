The Boscolo Venezia Autograph hotel is a beautiful classic Italian hotel right on the canal. We arrived by private boat taxi directly from airport. Sunset and terrific views of the city as we approached.  We were greeted by staff as we got of the boat and were checked in graciously by Phillip who offered us a complimentary glass of Prosecco.  Our room on the second floor overlooked a canal where we offered views of families preparing their gondola for the days work. Furnishings in the room classic and beautiful including glass light fixtures from Murano.   You will love this hotel!
