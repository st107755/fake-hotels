This hotel was quite a surprise.  Stayed here just one night prior to joining a cruise and wished i had more time to spend there.  Rooms a lovely and clean, albeit a bit small even for European Standards.  Staff were very friendly and helpful especially with navigating the walkways of Venice.  Meals were good with plenty of choices. Hotel is a bit removed from St. Mark's Square but we saw all the sights in one day walking around Venice.  If you have been to Venice you know that is quite a feat since we kept getting lost.  I would certainly choose this hotel again and recommend it to anyone coming to Venice.
