This hotel is beautiful. The history, the decor, the chandeliers. It all feels very venetian. The garden is very impressive (any garden in Venice is impressive but this is big) and once the spring has arrived I imagine it is a beautiful place to sip a cocktail. Even the toiletries are good quality. The complimentary (if booked in advance) boat shuttle to and from St Mark's square is also a wonderful touch that makes you feel very special. So, why only 3 stars?  I have stayed in a few 4 and 5 star hotels over the years and for my special big birthday this year we wanted to 'do' Venice right and looking on the various booking sites the photos and ratings were impressive. So we looked for a good deal, and boy we paid for it, in the wrong way. Why is it every hotel, even the 'best'â€¦
