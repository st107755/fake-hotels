Our room was located on the 2nd floor.   It overall was a nice hotel, but had a few things that really bugged me.   1.)   The AC was not Cold and you were not able to really control it.   I think it must have a safety setting somewhere around 74F which is a bit warm for my taste.   2.)  The Internet was terrible.   I had to call the front desk and ask them to reset the access point a few times.   When I stay at a hotel like this, I expect the Internet to work and work well which was certainly not the case.  3.)  This hotel is in a more remote location which has positives and negatives.  30 min from train station and 35min from St. Marks Square.   LOTS of walking.  On a positive note, this hotel is the first stop on the Orange line from the airport which is nice and it is alsoâ€¦
