Very nice and helpful staff in the front desk. They orient you about the hotel and your experience in Venice. When we arrived to the room, we found a very nice and abundant surprise (I won’t tell, you have tu visit and find out). It’s was a a huge detail from the hotel. Thank you Boscolo for a great trip to Venice.
