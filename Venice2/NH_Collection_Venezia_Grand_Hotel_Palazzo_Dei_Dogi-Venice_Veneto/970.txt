We rented a 2 Bedroom Suite and we had excellent facilities, nice view, and delicious grand buffet. Variety of different appetizers, main courses, and lots of deserts with fresh fruits and vegetables of Italian Gardens. Beautiful Roman interiors and professional staff.  I think we will visit the Hotel again in future.  From Alghayath Family
