If your lookign for peace and quiet then this hotel is spot on, away from the crowds which are only a few bridges away, it took us around 15 minutes to walk to St Marks Square and 10 minute to the grand canal. the staff are friendly espeically the man who works (it seems) in bothe the bar, resturant and room service very professional. fantastic spa staff extermely friendly and happy to help. the bed was massive and very comfortable, rooms are very clean! the only down fall is you dont get drink facilities in your room to which we paid Â£20 for 2 teas from room service. Great private and complimentary private boat ride from the hotel to the glass musium was an added bonus. all in all a very nice stay and hotel
