We had stayed here on a previous occasion and enjoyed both the location and the hotel itself.  The location is away from the busy tourist areas, but is the first stop on the water bus (orange line) from the airport (what could be more convenient?) and is only a 10 minute walk to the Grand Canal and the valporetto stop.  Depending on where you are going, it is often worth walking as you may well be quicker than the valporetto and you will explore parts of Venice that are not necessarily on the tourist trail.  The adjacent church is definitely worth visiting for its Tintoretto paintings and the tomb of the great man himself.   Our room was upstairs in the main building, but we did wander out into the splendid garden, although it was a little cold in November to linger there forâ€¦
