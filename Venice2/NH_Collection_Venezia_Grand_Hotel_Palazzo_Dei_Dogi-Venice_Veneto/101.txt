This very special hotel is a total find. The setting is spectacular, in a historic palazzo, on the north, far from the crazy tourist crowds of San Marco. The staff is very kind and pleasant - really extraordinary service.  The breakfast in the garden is exquisite. They have a free water taxi service every two hours to the San Marco area which was invaluable, as water taxis cost about $100. All in all, a 100% delightful experience.  HIGHLY recommend.
