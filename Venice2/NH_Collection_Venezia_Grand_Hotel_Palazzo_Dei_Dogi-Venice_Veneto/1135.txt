We spent 2 nights here on our Italy trip. This hotel is beautiful, staff is friendly. Room was very nice and comfortable. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. It is included for Marriott Platinum members. Hotel is away from the main attraction in St Mark's Square; however it is not very far. They offer free ride to St Mark's square which was nice. We used that once. Overall it made our trip very comfortable.
