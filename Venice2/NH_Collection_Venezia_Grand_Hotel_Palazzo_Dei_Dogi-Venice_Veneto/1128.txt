Only stayed one night, but the room and amenities were terrific.  could recommend heartily.  made the trip so much easier!  lavish breakfast, access to the hotel's boat was great.  watch out for the field trips - they can be hard-sell.  Cold outside, but the room was warm and cozy.  Very elegant and old-worldly, and in a quiet part of town, but easily navigated.
