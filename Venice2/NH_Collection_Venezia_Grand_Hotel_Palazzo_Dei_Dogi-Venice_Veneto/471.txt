Nice hotel that is in a quiet location in Venice.  Stayed on a low floor overlooking the front of the hotel.  Room was on the small side.  Hotel was quite pricey and breakfast was not included.  The hotel had a complimentary boat service that took you to and from St. Mark's Square.  Quite a distance to walk to the majority of the tourist sites in Venice.
