Boscolo Venezia is a wonderful hotel in a great location.  It's located near the old Jewish quarter, which is now becoming one of the more hip places to be with new restaurants and great little bars opening every few months.  The hotel is stately and charming, and the service fantastic. The concierge, Claudio, was particularly helpful and informative. Breakfast is plentiful and delicious. Our room was large and enjoyable.  My only recommendation is that the cozy bar had a bit too bright of lights which should be lowered to improve the ambiance.  If candles can replace some of the lighting, even better. I will definitely stay here again and explore some of the local color of the area which is thankfully away from the hustle and bustle of the throngs of tourists on the main strip!
