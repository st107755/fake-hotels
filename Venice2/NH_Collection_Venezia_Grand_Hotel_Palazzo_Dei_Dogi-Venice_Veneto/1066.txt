We have traveled quite a bit, staying at many lovely hotels.... this one is exceptional. We made our reservations as Platinum members of Marriott, because it was in Venice and the beautiful photos on the web site. In person, it was even more beautiful. Having once been an embassy the common rooms were stately and beautifully appointed, the look and feel of a bygone era in Venice. The garden behind the hotel was pure magic, with a pavilion for dining. Every member of the staff we encountered were delightful.....they could not do enough to make us feel at home....in their home. Providing an hotel operated water taxi from the front walk to San Marcos square more than made up for being a little of the beaten path. And about being "off the beaten path"...after a day of sight seeingâ€¦
