We recently stayed at the "Boscolo" hotel in Venice.  The hotel was so beautiful with spectacular chandeliers and an elegant yet warm ambiance.  The staff was very friendly and helpful which is not always the case in fancier hotels.  The hotel also provides a shuttle service to St. Mark's cathedral and the island free of charge.    We would definitely recommend staying there and maybe someday we'll return for another visit!
