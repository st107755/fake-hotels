We stayed here this september on 2 dates for 1 night each before and after a cruise. Arriving by water taxi airport is brilliant. Reception is helpful and friendly. On the 1st night we arrived very late and stayed in a standard room which was fine and offered everything we needed. we enjoyed breakfast in the beautiful garden and had a walk in the garden. All was fine for this stay. For the second stay we arrived early from the ship but got a room straight away, even upgraded to a suite in the garden, very nice at this early hour. the room was big, yet quiet and cozy,  no problems with temperatures or airco, everything fine, nice bathroom, excellent bed. The dinner in the restaurant was great. Breakfast was delicious again, if you book breakfast included you can also order fromâ€¦
