Beautiful hotel with lots of character. Very friendly desk staff made helpful recommendations. Hotel is clean and has great history. Some areas preserves to show its history as a fine home and embassy. Three bridges away from the more touristy areas. Good access but provided a quiet retreat when we wanted it. Rooms were not large but that's consistent with Venice where space is premium. Nicely appointed and very clean. Breakfast was nice but not outstanding. Service was just ok. Overall we would recommend this hotel to all.
