Beautiful hotel and an amazing staff! We booked 2 beautiful rooms with gorgeous views of the canals. The grounds are amazing, the staff bends over backwards for your needs. Just a lovely place with lovely people. It is in a quiet part of the city, which we loved. Our only complaint was that one of the rooms air condition wasnâ€™t working properly. The staff did bring in a fan, but it was unfortunately still very warm in that room. We still loved this hotel and all of the amazing people that worked there. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit.
