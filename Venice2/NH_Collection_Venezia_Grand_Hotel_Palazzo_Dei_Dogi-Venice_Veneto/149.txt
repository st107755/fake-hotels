My girlfriend and I were there for a quick two-day stopover in Venice and could not have picked a better hotel. Location was perfect, both for seeing the sites in Venice and also in terms of distance from the water taxi (we were able to walk), and the service was top-shelf. Room decor was spectacular and the cheese and wine plate left for us was a nice touch. Would stay there again for sure
