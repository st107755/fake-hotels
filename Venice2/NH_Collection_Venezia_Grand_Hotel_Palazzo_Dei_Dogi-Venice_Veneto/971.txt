My wife & I stayed 3-nights at this hotel, ideally situated in the quieter, northern section of Venice. It was a relief to wander here, away from the truly demonic crowds around the Rialto & St Marks. The ease of access of the vaporetto right to the mooring point at the front door made travel to & from hotel & airport very easy indeed.   The hotel itself is stunning and the garden is a tranquil idyll. The reception staff were extremely helpful & polite; the restaurant staff could not have been more attentive & kind: breakfast here was a perfect start to a Venetian day. Our room was beautifully appointed and clean: our only very minor quibbles were that the taps made a bit of a noise when running & the shower temperature fluctuated a little but these trivial issues were not inâ€¦
