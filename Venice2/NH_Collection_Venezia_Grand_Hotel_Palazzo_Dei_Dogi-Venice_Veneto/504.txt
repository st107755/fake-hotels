There is a quiet spot in Venice.  It is found on the Fondamenta Madonna Dell'Orto in an old embassy converted into an Autograph Collection, Boscolo Venezia.  I have stayed here with my spouse and kids and always been more than satisfied by everything this grand hotel has to offer.   The rooms are grand and some look out over a small canal, though the irregular, not-so-noisy boat traffic does little but leave you wishing for more.  The grand ballroom, where an amazing buffet breakfast is served daily, exits to the west into the largest garden in all of Venice.  I'm sure weddings and other events are held outside here, but the four or five times I've been here, I have always been able to wander into this unusual-for-Venice natural landscape.  There is even a sunken earth domeâ€¦
