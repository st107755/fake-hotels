This is a first class Marriott autograph hotel retaining the Venice flavor and balancing with historical elegance, comfort, and international service. Quiet location with easy access to airport water taxi and boats to train staton. No dragging your luggage through the streets. In November, it was not bustling with activity, but low-key. Wonderful option for weddings, couples, or family gatherings.
