Great location, nice old style with garden eating area.  However, you can't claim to be top notch if your air conditioning is ineffective. 33 deg heat and nobody's room was cool. Buffet breakfast over priced at €25 and a la carte not much better than buffet or €35.  There are better hotels in Venice for the price.  Come on Marriott.get someone to audit this place..it doesn't meet a gold member expectations.
