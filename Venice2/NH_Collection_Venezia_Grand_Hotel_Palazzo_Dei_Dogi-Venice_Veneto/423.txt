We stayed at the Boscolo Venezia the last week of May, hoping to beat the mad rush of the summer and we were not disappointed! The city is very busy, especially as one gets nearer to St Mark's Square, but this area of Venice was still nice and quiet. The Hotel is on the canal, which can be approached either by a Vaporetto service or by a water taxi--we opted for the latter. A word of caution: I read on this site that the price was E90, but it is actually E120! Probably the vaporetto is just as good, but it was very nice to arrive by water taxi.  The hotel rooms are spacious (we had a junior suite) on the second floor, facing the canal, and it is a tiny bit noisy when the deliveries/ taxis arrive--nothing serious though. The hotel has a restaurant that is OK, but very expensive,â€¦
