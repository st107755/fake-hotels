A Marriott property, somewhat expensive but very classy.  I've always wanted to stay in a palace.  The staff was VERY helpful.  The decor was great and the overall experience was outstanding.  The only issue is the WiFi but I don't think they built palaces in Venice with WiFi in mind. The private boat is helpful to Murano but less so to San Marcos. In Venice everywhere is convenient, don't let the location put you off.  We would stay again any time.
