A beautiful building but the location is remote which puts you at the mercyof the staff, and that is the problem.  On check out we were told not to take their shuttle, which is part of the price of the room.  Four times we were advised to take bus 42 as the quickest possible route to the railway station.  Our maps and info seemed different, but they were so insistant that we followed their advice.    Bus 42 takes the route around Murano and ends 1 1/2 hours later at San Marco - where the shuttle goes in 20 minutes.  The staff are intentionally misleading, very scarey people.  The hotel is in a residential section, far from other hotels and so remote that there is no one else to help.     If this is the only room in Venice, don't go to Venice.
