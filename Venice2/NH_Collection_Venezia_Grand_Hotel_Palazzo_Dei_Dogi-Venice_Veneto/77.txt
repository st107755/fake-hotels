Large rooms with beautiful old Italian style.  Lovely gardens. Super breakfast with great service.  10 mins walk from the Grand Canal  - perfect to escape the crowds but remain in touching distance.  Having parked a Ross the water - we parked and ferried across and this worked really well being on the north side of Venice. Really recommend Parkimeter/Marive transport if driving / parking.
