Tried to cancel a reservation with over 2 months notice and was told that I had booked under a special rate and that my trip was non refundable even though i have given them over 60 days notice. Person I spoke to was completely rude and would not listen to reasoning nor would they let me speak to anyone else. From the attitude I received trying to book and the no refund policy I would recommend staying away!!!
