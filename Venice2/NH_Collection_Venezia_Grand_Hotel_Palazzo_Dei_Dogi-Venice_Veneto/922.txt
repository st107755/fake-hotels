This hotel is on the north side of the island away from the hussle and bussle of St Mark's Square. The rear has a boat pier which looks out to the island of Murano. There is a hotel boat which takes you to the centre of Venice.  The quality of the hotel is excellent, staff friendly and rooms very comfortable. We did not eat in the hotel (except breakfast which was very good) as there were so many fantastic restaurants nearby set on the canals. Location could be a problem for those who want to be close to the main attractions of Venice, but for us it was perfect.
