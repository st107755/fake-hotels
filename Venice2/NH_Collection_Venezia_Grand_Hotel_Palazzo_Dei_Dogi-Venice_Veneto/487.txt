This is my favorite hotel in Venice , where I have been staying one or two times each year. It is located in one of the few part of Venice where there are more locals than tourists, in a grand old palace, skillfully restored with a painful attention to every detail. It was part of a classy Italian hotel chain and it is now part of the Marriott autograph management. The location is on a quiet canal near Santa Maria dell'Orto. It is a fiften min walking to the train station and to Rialto. There is a vaporetto stop a block away with frequent departures to the station or airport. It has a great reception lobby with original furniture, lighting and paintings. The rooms comes in different sizes and locations but are well appointed, comfortable and quiet. The breakfast is outstandingâ€¦
