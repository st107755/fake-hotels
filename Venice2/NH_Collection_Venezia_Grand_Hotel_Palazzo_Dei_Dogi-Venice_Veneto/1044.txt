Recently stayed 5 nights at the Venice location of the Boscolo chain on a vacation that also had us staying 6 nights at the Boscolo Palace Roma and 1 night at Boscolo Milano.  Of the 3 the Boscolo Venezia was far and away the superior experience.  Pros... Great location for easy mobility....Vaporetto stop on N lagoon stop is a 5 minute walk.  Vaporetto stop on Grand Canal is a 10 minute walk.  Train station is actually a short walk but as always in Venice will involve several bridge crossings so best to take the Vaporetto from the train station. Beautiful lobby, breakfast area and garden.... this hotel delivers what you would expect Venice to look like...terrazzo floors, glass chandeliers and a massive quiet private garden. Incredible rooms are possible...maybe you won't get oneâ€¦
