We spent two nights and days at this nice boutique hotel in a nice location in Venice.  It is very easy to get to from the airport and also is an easy walk to many of the primary attractions in Venice - including a 25 minute walk to St. Mark's Square.    One of our rooms was fairly large and the other relatively small but overall with very comfortable bedding and decent furniture.  The hotel is fairly ornate and has an old feel to it.    The service was good but nothing extraordinary.  We only had breakfast at the hotel and thought it was excellent.
