This Marriot Autogragh Hotel is away from the tourist district and huge crowds of San Marco plaza. Just 3 bridges to a great atmosphere of shops, resturants, Cafe, bakeryâ€™s and fruit markets. 12 minute walk to San Geranomo church were Saint Lucia body lies. Marriot hotel has a wonderful Ameriacn and European  style breakfast. Staff is very friendly and rooms were very nice. This is our second time at this hotel and area
