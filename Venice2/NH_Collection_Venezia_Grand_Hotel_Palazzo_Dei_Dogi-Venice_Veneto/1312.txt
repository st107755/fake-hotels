Pro's:  well-located in a quiet but close-in neighborhood, complementary upscale water taxi, English garden that leads to the water, attentive staff, huge towels, giant shampoo etc, spacious and impressive rooms.  Cons: no conditioner provided, weak hair dryer, inconsistent shower temperature (but based on conversations with people at other hotels, this might be a Venice problem).   Based on some reviews, I was nervous going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was fantastic, the rooms were great, and I was happy to stay in a hotel with an interesting history. The water taxi is a nice touch; I felt like a rock star as we approached San Marco.  I'd definitely recommend this fabulous hotel to friends. Kudos to Marriott for getting this property.
