Everything about our stay here was absolutely idyllic. It is away from the main tourist attractions which was a BLESSING. SO NICE to get away from the crowds to a quiet, romantic setting for our honeymoon. We stayed in a beautiful bi-level suite with a terrace overlooking a beautiful garden. There was a lemon tree in bloom that made the whole apartment smell like flowers! Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very good, especially the perfect cappuccinos! We used the free shuttle to San Marco only once; it was great but we enjoyed walking through the streets of Venice. We also took the free tour of the glass making studio in Murano - very interesting - we also stayed behind to explore Murano and Burano which I highly recommend. I must also compliment the cheerful,â€¦
