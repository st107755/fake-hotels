Our first time at this beautifully renovated hotel which captures the essence of Venice. We walked to the hotel from the Santa Lucia Train Station which took about 25 minutes. It is off the beaten path but depending on the weather they do have a complimentary  water taxi that will take you to St. Mark's Square. Or enjoy the sites along the way and walk to the square....25 minutes.  Wonderful helpful staff,  sumptuous breakfast every morning, bar lounge- restaurant on site. Worth every cent. We stated 3 glorious nights! We will return! Would recommend!!
