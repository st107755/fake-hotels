I stayed in this terrible 5 star ???? hotel just for 2 nights , also have a problems with a dental kits, but its nothing with what happend later... After i packed my lugguage and gave it to reception ,it was the last day, went for a walk, because had a few houres before flight...When i came back to the hotel pick up my staff, i realised that forgot jacket and trousers in a room wardrobe. I told it to reception, they checked room and........didnt find ANYTHING! Than  called to person who cleaned my room,and she even said "that saw jacket in my lugguage", probably she was in a room at time i packed or checked my bags after ????? I was so shoked and nearly cry,that this discusting situation happend in a one of the "LUXURY" hotels! One hour later the hotel staff basically admittedâ€¦
