on points with wife and my 2 princesses (2yo and 4yo).  Staff were very attentive which was welcomed travelling with 2 small children.  Bath toys for each in the room were well received.  Room was spacious.  Breakfast buffet fantastic as well as room service and restaurant food.  Girls loved exploring the large and interesting garden space.  Staff helpful in guiding me to the nearest place to buy nappies which is quite difficult on a Sunday in Italy.  Arranged a private water taxi for me at short notice after the water bus planning to get to airport was full (beware of this possibility).  Overall hotel was gorgeous and quiet yet not unreasonable distance from main Venice centre.  Will definitely be my first choice next time in Venice.
