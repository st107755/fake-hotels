We stayed 3 nights on our honeymoon an opted for a junior suite which was stunning with high ceilings and was massive. As the building was originally a palace we felt very privileged. Staff were friendly and attentive. Asked to borrow a uk travel adaptor and iron and both were delivered to the room within 5 mins. We used the spa and both had really good massages. We did not try the restaurant and opted to use the local restaurants instead including a fab meal at the famous Cipriani. Thanks to all the staff.
