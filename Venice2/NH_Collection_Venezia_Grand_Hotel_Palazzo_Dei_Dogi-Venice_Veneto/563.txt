Excellent quiet location away from tourist mobs, superb guest service and a beautiful accommodation. The peace and quiet of the garden is a welcome respite after a day of sightseeing (and difficult to leave when it's time to head to the craziness of VCE to fly home). Close to Orto vapporetto stop with no bridges to cross with luggage - a big plus.
