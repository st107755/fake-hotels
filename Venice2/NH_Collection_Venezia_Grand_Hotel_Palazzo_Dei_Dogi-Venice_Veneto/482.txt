Hotel Bosco- this hotel was a little disappointing after some excellent experiences in Italy. It is in a residential area about a 30 minute walk from St Mark's. They offer a boat shuttle but service is infrequent and the boat can be full unless reserved. It has only 14 seats. Breakfast was good but at least in part served in the lobby of the hotel which was odd. We were ‘upgraded’ to a garden room but we did not view it at all as an upgrade. The room was not ventilated no matter where we set the temperature. We opened the windows but then the mosquitoes arrived in droves. The bathroom was functional but water pressure was an issue. The technology was dated. Service in the hotel was excellent and very attentive but I would probably pass on this one the next time I am in Venice.…
