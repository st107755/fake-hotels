This hotel is based on a building dating from 1501. It has a large garden which is unique in the main islands of Venice, and was most recently updated in 2011. It is part of the Marriott Autograph Collection and can be accessed through the Marriott website. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is comfortable, though ours did show a little wear and tear. The staff is more than helpful with dinner and service recommendations. Breakfast is more than generous. In fact, except for a mid-day gelato, we did not have lunch during the entire time we were in Venice. We chose this hotel in part for the quiet location but will return because of the service and beauty of the garden.
