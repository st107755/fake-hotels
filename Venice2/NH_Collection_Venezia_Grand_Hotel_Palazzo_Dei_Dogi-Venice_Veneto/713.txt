As always, Venice is better in the off-season.  We had a lovely three-day stay here.  The hotel is located off the main tourist areas so there are a lot of locals places nearby for dining choices.  The rooms were quite big for Venice and we happened to overlook a canal, so ask for one when booking.  Staff was really good.  Excellent breakfast.  Rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms were big, too.  Very clean and tidy.  No complaints! Highly recommended.
