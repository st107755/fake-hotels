This hotel is out of the tourist area and the vaporetti are not as frequent as on the Grand Canal or St Marks, but almost all the famous sights are within easy walking distance. Our room was beautifully equipped and very comfortable and we could not understand why there were unfavourable reviews. The garden is beautifully laid out and maintained. On the negative side, the restaurant was deserted and the menu expensive and our bar bill was astronomic - we paid 35 euros for one gin and two tonics - much dearer than St Mark's Square. There were no nibbles - provided in even the simplest bars around town.
