Absolutely beautiful hotel!!  Had 12 friends staying here prior to a cruise and it was amazing!  We were able to arrive by private water taxi, luggage was unloaded easily and we were able to travel to cruise ship the same way.  Quiet neighborhood but we walked all over and took the complimentary water shuttle back from St. Marks.   Rooms weren't ready until 3pm and we arrived on a 9am flight so would have liked to have gotten into at least 1 room to freshen up but they held out luggage securely and we went exploring.  Staff was very friendly but only 1 computer which caused a slight delay at times.  We opened the windows in our room and enjoyed fresh air and listened to the household noises from a local family across the water.  Amazing!
