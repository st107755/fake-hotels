Great resort, perfect spot away from the craziness of San Marco square.  Only a few seconds walk from airport watertaxi which is great with large bags.  Also they have a water shuttle for free to the square and back a few times a day, we were only ones one day it was awesome.  The garden in rear is beautiful.  Overall we had an awesome time here.
