The staff is remarkably nice and helpful. They go out of their way to accommodate hotel guests. The hotel is a hidden gem with a beautiful garden behind the hotel. Breakfast buffet is amazing with fresh fruits, nuts...  You are in a quiet neighborhood on the opposite side of city and 30 minutes walking from San Marco or 15 minutes by boat. Hotel has free shuttle every 90 minutes to and from San Marco. I highly recommend this hotel.
