We stayed here for one night and loved the property. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood at the very opposite side of Venice from San Marco. The grounds and rooms were gorgeous, immaculate, and we wish we could have stayed longer. Don't worry about staying so far from the touristy area of Venice. The hotel offers complimentary water taxi service to San Marco and Murano. We utilized this service. The hotel is also within walking distance of many shops and restaurants, although you would never guess it from the location. Barbara and Phillip were extremely helpful with recommendations and transportation help. We also received wonderful service in the bar with drinks and the restaurant also brought out lovely snacks for the guests to try. We just adored this hotel and would love toâ€¦
