My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights end of August and had the most wonderful stay.  Our room was large and very comfortable.  We loved the daily breakfast and coffee.  It was a beautiful property.   The reason for my review is because I cannot say enough good things about the concierge Ivan.  He went above and beyond to ensure we would have a wonderful time in Venice.  He spent a lot of time assisting us, giving us tips for getting around the city, and was so knowledgeable of all the things we wanted to do.  He gave us fantastic restaurant recommendations.  It was so nice to be able to talk to him and ask his advice as we have never been to Venice before. This was a beautiful hotel, but the incredible staff made all the difference.  We will definitely stay here again.
