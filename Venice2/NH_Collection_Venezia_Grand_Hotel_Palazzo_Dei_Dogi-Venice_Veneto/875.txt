This hotel has a wonderful history and like most Venetian properties, has an unassuming front. The beauty lies inside. This hotel recreates a 15th century palace experience with essential modern amenities.  If you need in room coffee or tea, you can call room service or bring your own like I did.  The location is perfect because you are only 500meters from shopping and excellent restaurants.  The neighborhood is so peaceful you can practically meditate outside.  The garden of the hotel is truly special and very rare for a Venetian property.  It is several nooks and out of the way places where you are likely to be in complete solitude.  For the travel weary expecting all the amenities in their room like a studio "flat" are not likely to be impressed.  This boutique hotel is idealâ€¦
