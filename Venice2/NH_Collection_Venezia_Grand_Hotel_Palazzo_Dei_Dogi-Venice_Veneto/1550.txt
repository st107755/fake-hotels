A beautiful hotel located off the beaten path- but with access to the beaten path.  The hotel has periodic shuttles to San Marco region.  This area has many cozy restaurants where mostly locals (Italians at least) congregate.  Very pleasant staff and beautiful gardens in the back.  I've never written a recommendation before- but wanted to give kudos to Dei Dogi.
