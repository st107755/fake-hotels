Booked the presidential suite for ~535€ for one night. By the time I checked in, both the standard room and presidential suite are available for the second. So I talked to the manager and he agreed to book the standard room and upgrade me to the presidential suite for the second night.  Be aware that there is a 65€ per person per day city tax, so that’s 260€ a night for me with family.  The view was magnificent! Ocean view for more than 180 degrees.  Room is spacious, bathrooms are relatively small. One had tub/shower, the other one has jet tub / shower.   There is no lounge in the hotel, but they did provide free breakfast for four of us. And the breakfast was great!  A few items in the room needs repair. One cracked door trim in the main bath and vent cover. There is no coffee…
