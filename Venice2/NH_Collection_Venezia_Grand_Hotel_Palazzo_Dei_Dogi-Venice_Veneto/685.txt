Elegant Luxury with the Soul of Venice.   What a marvelous MARVELOUS property and staff. Philip at the front desk (FD) whom we met and fell in love with two years ago greeted us with his ear-to-ear smile and warmth.    Very soon we met the general manager Martina Di Luca, who took care of our every need.  She was a very delightful and charming host!  Our room was beyond amazing! Right on the canal and wonderful open windows to open and let the fresh air come in.  Many other associates made our stay very very memorable. Chiara assistant to the GM was delightful. As were Martina at FD, Barbara, Pablo, Giorgia, Veronica, Giai and many others!  The Bellman Sergei was very glad to assist us in pictures with our Marriott Mugs for our story of our 133 day around the world trip at 30+â€¦
