This is an excellent property. First time in Venice, and used the Marriott Bonvoy app to book this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. Take the orange water bus from the airport and its the first stop, Madonna dell'Orto, and it's a quick 2-3 minute walk from there to the hotel lobby.  The hotel has a beautiful garden behind it that runs all the way to the lagoon. There is a great dock back there to sip wine, watch the boat traffic and see the sun set.    What I loved about this hotel is that it sits in a very quiet area of Venice. Just two canals over, plenty of restaurants and bars. But upon returning here at midnight or 1:00AM, just peace and quiet. Avoid the crowds and noise of the grand canal and stay here!  Room was beautiful and A/C worked well. They did have complimentaryâ€¦
