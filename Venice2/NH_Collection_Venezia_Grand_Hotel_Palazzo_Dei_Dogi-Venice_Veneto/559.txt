This really is a great hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great quiet location a bit removed from the bustle of the grand canal, but we easily walked to the things we wanted to see, or to the public water taxis that took us to St Mark's, etc. The complimentary breakfast was really good, much better than expected. This is a good choice for your stay in Venice!
