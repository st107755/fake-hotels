We started our tour of Italy in Venice and used Marriott Bonvoy points to stay at Grand Hotel Dei Dogie. Tay checked us in and could not have been more accommodating.  Walking us to our room. Telling us all the highlights of the hotel, showing us the beautiful garden of the hotel, and giving us several restaurant recommendations near the hotel. Our room was on the fourth floor. It was very clean, and the bed was very comfortable and the shower as well. We explored the beautiful garden which extended the property all the way to the lagoon. Also enjoyed the coffee daily,  and ate delicious buffet in the garden restaurant. This charming boutique hotel, a 30 minute walk from St. Mark's, was everything we could have hoped for. We enjoyed the neighborhood and local feel.
