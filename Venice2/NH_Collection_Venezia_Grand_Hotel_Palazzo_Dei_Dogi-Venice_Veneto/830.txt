The hotel is in a great location, but note that if you enter the hotel address in your GPS you will arrive at a parking garage which you will need to park your, get your bags, walk 10 minutes across the street to the water taxi ride over to the hotel (ride is approx 20 minutes). If you decide to take the general water taxi it will cost you 28 euros round trip (for 2), or you can take a private water taxi for 135 euros (they drop you off right in front of the hotel, common taxi will drop you off around back---5 minute walk to the check in).  Not sure what makes a property "Autograph Collection"? Overall nice property but the rooms need to be updated----the carpet shows its age and the AC did not keep the room cool.   You can walk to many shops and great dinner locations withinâ€¦
