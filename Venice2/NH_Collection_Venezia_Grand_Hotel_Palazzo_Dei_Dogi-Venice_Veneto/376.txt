Located conveniently near both the people mover bus stops, hotel Bellini proved to be a great location to both site see and head to port the next day. The staff was very accommodating and attentive. The room was very clean and a very decent size bathroom. We booked to a through a third party and breakfast and wifi were included. Breakfast was buffet style and did the job. We loved the hotels location since it allowed us to walk towards St Marco's Square and experience a ton of shops and goodies along the way. The area is extremely touristy and there are tons of people walking everywhere. So if yo are looking for a more relax atmosphere this may not be the location for you. Overall it was a good hotel that served its propuse for us and it was very well situated.
