The hotel is a way away from the main parts and is on the north of the island - appears to be more residential - less busy - more local restaurants. It is a bit of a walk to the Rialto - even though this hotel was described as a 'few steps away' - and more to st marks sq - although all in all this wasn't really a problem.   On arrival at the hotel - the reception area is very beautiful - the receptionist was very nice and bags were taken to the room - the room was quite nice - but extremely tiny - when we had pushed the boat out for a superior double - it had the feel that two rooms had been cut in half with a partition - certainly not what we expected or payed for - as we did not decide to do venice on a tight budget.   Unless you are loaded - then dont bother to eat or drinkâ€¦
