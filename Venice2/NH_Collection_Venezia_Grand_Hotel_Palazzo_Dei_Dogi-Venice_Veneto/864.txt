Stayed two nights the beginning of May.  Was impressed with the location, the apparent cleanliness, the breakfast offerings, the amenities but left with bedbugs.  Returned in one week with photos which they claimed were mosquito bites.  Compared them to other bed bug infections which they mirrored exactly -- and unless they have mosquitos trained to bite in linear formations there.....they were bed bugs.  They still claimed they were mosquito bites.  Hummmmmm.  I wouldn't take the chance again.
