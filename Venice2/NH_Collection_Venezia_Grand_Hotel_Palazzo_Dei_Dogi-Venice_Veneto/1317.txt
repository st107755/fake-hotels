It was so nice to begin and end the day walking in the beautiful streets of Cannaregio outside of the busy tourist areas. The hotel decor is very ornate, pink and flowery...would be a drawback in some locations but suits Venice perfectly. Very very close to the closest water bus stop from the airport, and the staff was nice and very helpful. If you dont mind walking, I recommend this hotel and highly recommend staying in this neighborhood.
