We stayed here for three nights. They upgraded our room to the top floor. The hotel is beautiful. It is not is in the most touristy area of Venice, so it feels more like a get away. There are nice bars/restaurants within walking distance. We also received free breakfast for being a Marriott member. The staff was very friends when we arrived and helped throughout our stay. They made recommendations for restaurants and ways to get around the city.
