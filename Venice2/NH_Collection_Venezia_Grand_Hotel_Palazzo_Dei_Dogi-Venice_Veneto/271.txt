Outstanding staff made this five star romantic stay an absolute delight. This hotel is in a quieter part of Venice and very convenient to the water shuttle to the airport. The hotel offers complimentary water taxis in and out of the main area - St Marks square, and the ride is an amazing experience alone.   The hotel has a huge grounds - really enormous for a constrained place like Venice and was once the French embassy many years ago. So the foyer and communal areas are beautiful. Check out the glass chandeliers!   The buffet breakfast was simply brilliant. The bacon was cooked to perfection and the rest of the selection was first class. We also enjoyed some intimate fine dining during our stay that was delicious.   The room was delightful and the bed was very comfortable.â€¦
