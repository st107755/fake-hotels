An amazing place for a stay in Venice. Located three bridges from the main tourist route its in a quiet area with quality ristorantes nearby. For those so inclined there is a free motor boat to San Marco Plaza. We loved the massive garden in the rear and had our breakfast in the garden under a tent. The staff were cheerful and helpful and we took their suggestions to heart and were not disappointed. It was a 10 minute walk back to the main street and the shopping and crowds that are modern Venice. We loved our time here and will return when we can.
