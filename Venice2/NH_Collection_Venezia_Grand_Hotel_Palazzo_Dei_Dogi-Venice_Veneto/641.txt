We loved this hotel and would return in a minute.  My husband is a Gold member with Marriott so we stayed on points, however they upgraded us to a suite since we were traveling with our teenage son and he got his own loft upstairs in our room.

A big thing for me is A/C, some hotels in Europe say they have it and what they really have is an air circulator, this place has GREAT A/C and we were there in 90 degree weather so this was HUGE for us.  Breakfast in their gorgeous courtyard is a treat and the food was fantastic.  The decore is old world, but remodeled for conveniences.  Yes it will be a bit of a walk to the water taxi to get to the sites, but trulyâ€¦
