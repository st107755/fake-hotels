Recently spent 3 nights in Venice at the Boscolo and we very much enjoyed the experience. We were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a suite with it's own lift (which was convenient when dealing with the bags), and the room itself was well furnished and unique in layout as you might expect from a former residence. We had breakfast in the hotel every morning, a very nice buffet stocked with fresh choices. The staff were very helpful and friendly, making numerous dinner reservations for us and even going to so far as to recommend their favorite restaurants in other cities we were planning to visit. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area about a 15-20 minute walk from St. Mark's, but it's very conveniently located just a couple of blocks from the Madonna Dell'Ortoâ€¦
