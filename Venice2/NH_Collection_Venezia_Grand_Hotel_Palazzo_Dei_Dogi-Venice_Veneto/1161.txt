This is a wonderful hotel. It is however, quite far from the main attractions in Venice. The Hotel does run a water shuttle between the St. Marks Square and the hotel but it stops at 6pm or so. We arrived having spent a week in Tuscany. The brekfast is quite good. The rooms are very nice and the staff extremely accomodating. If you are going there, see Ivan and Gaia, they are the Concierges.
