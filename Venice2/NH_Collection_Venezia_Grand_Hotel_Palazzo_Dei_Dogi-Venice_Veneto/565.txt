We loved the location of this hotel, very near good eating and drinking places that are more for locals than tourists. We have stayed in several Boscolo's and this was different being smaller and having a feel of more of a boutique hotel. Staff were very helpful and the smaller 'feel' of the hotel seemed to make everyone interact more. Also very good that they offer a complimentary taxi to San Marco
