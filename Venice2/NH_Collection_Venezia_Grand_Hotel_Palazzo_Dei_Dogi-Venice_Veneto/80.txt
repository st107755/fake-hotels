My family and I just adored this fantastic hotel.  They make you feel like honored guests from the moment you arrive.  Our family suite was gorgeous with a loft space for our children.  We sought several restaurant recommendations and all were truly wonderful, surprising given our previous experience in Venice of mostly tourist trap fare.  This hotel is far away from the crush of summer tourists in Venice and a lovely place to relax.  We hope to come again!
