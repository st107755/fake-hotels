This is a lovely hidden gem, far from the madding crowd.  Since Venice is so zoo-like nearer to St. Mark's square, this is one of the best qualities. The rooms were nice, although a little dark.  the service is nice, and there is a stunning garden in the back. I would definitely stay here again if I had another trip planned.
