We stayed for three nites, our first city in Italy - so we were a bit jet-lagged. And we picked the area and this hotel knowing we would need some comfort zone time. The Boscolo Di what we wanted. The decorations and the service were outstanding. The gardens in the back were a perfect hideaway for relaxing and reading, after the tourist extravaganzas near St. Mark's. We stayed on the top floor and had a great view of the fronting canal. The rm was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom was the best - the towels were thick and perfect. We had breakfast each day, a perfect beginning with good, tasty food and smiling, efficient service. When we return to Venice, we'll be back to the Boscolo.
