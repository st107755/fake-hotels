The hotel is simply bliss - the reception staff are very helpful, the reception is beautiful,breakfast not cheap but serene in peaceful gardens, great sunbeds, very peaceful, fab views of lagoon from the rear and right on the canal at the front. The best aspect is a stunning boat that drops you off and picks you up from St Marks Square. I am a Marriott Platinum card holder and this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. Highly recommended
