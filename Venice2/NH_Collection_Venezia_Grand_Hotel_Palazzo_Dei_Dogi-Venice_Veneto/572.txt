This Marriott property is located In one of Venice's grand old palaces, on the north side of the island, away from congestion and crowds (but a bit challenging to get to sometimes). The staff is courteous and the concierge, Evan, is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  Our room was comfortable, large enough, with a king sized bed and sitting area. The bath was fine, though the shower temperature was tricky to adjust. The hotel provides a shuttle service by boat to St. Marks and back several times per day.
