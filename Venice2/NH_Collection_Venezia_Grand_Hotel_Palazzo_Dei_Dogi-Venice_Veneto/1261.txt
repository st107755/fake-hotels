If you are looking for a place that is not in the heart of San Marco Square or swarming with tourists and pushy gondola's drivers this place is perfect.  The hotel was what I call "Italian Tired"  It was perfectly spotless clean, but the fabric covered walls and comforter could use a change/update.  I was in room 108 which faced the canal with two large windows.  Decent sitting area, desk, flat screen, mini bar and queen/king size bed.The bathroom has Etro products (nice surprise) robes and slippers at check in.  The towels and linens were also very nice.  My room had a European style shower with quarter glass covering the tub.  Not my favorite, but worked very nicely.  Could shower comfortably without flooding the bathroom.  Room 107 had both a shower and European shower.  Turnâ€¦
