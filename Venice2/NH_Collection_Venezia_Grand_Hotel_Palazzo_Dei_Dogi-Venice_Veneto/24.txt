My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights in mid-December on a wedding planning trip.  It was my first time in Venice and the hotel made the experience extra special.  We had a junior suite overlooking the garden.  I loved opening the window each morning and taking in the view.  The staff was exceptional.  The breakfast buffet was delicious with so many choices.  I am still craving their double espresso!  The bar was so cozy and the bartender was very attentive.  We had a nice luncheon one afternoon with soup and meat platter - yummy.  I loved that it was not in the crowded tourist area.  We had so much fun walking and exploring on the way to the shopping areas and Rialto Bridge.  So happy that I get to return to Dei Dogi in August for our daughter's wedding in the garden!  Ifâ€¦
