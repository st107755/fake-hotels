My husband and I stayed at this hotel before going on a cruise. It was more than what we expected. The staff was very friendly and the Concierge staff, Ivan was very helpful in finding us a great restaurant called Al Cantinon.   This hotel is away from St Mark's square which was perfect for us because we got to experience Venice without having to deal with thousands of tourists like in St. Mark's square.   We didn't have dinner at this hotel, but we had the breakfast and it was very good.  I'd stay again at this hotel and I'd recommend it to anyone.
