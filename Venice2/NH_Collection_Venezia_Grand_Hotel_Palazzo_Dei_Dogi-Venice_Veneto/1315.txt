Absolutely phenomenal hotel that we would recommend without a single reservation (pun not intended). Its grounds were jaw-dropping nice -- the shuttle service was the absolutely the best way to see venice. The staff were the most friendly and helpful people we encountered in two weeks in Italy.  The building itself is grand, beautiful and luxurious -- not only can you feel the splendor of ages past, but you feel like a head of state walking into the lobby and up to your room.  Definitely the nicest place we stayed in Italy, and I can't remember anywhere that pulls together all the elements of a hotel stay so excellently.
