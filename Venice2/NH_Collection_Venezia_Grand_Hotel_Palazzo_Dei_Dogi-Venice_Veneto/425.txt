I am looking forward to returning to this beautiful place just one year later - that's how much we loved our stay. Besides sitting on the patio for breakfast and enjoying the company in the bar in the evening, I am also looking forward to relaxing in the garden. Thank you Gaia - looking forward to being spoiled again !!
