This place was beautiful. We stayed in a few rooms beyond the fascinating gardens and it felt like we were in a private getaway. The staff was helpful and friendly despite our misunderstanding of just about everything.  One note: this hotel is in the northeast part of Venice. Many of the tourist locations are a hike from here. It is near a McDonald's, so that's a thing...because I am fat, lazy and American.
