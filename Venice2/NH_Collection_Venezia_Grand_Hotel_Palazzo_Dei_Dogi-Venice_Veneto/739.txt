I stayed at this hotel for a week on October 2015. If you are looking for a Venician experience in a Venician neighborhood away from the tourist traps, stay in an ex-nobility palace, face the water and enjoy a secluded garden, this is the place to be. I rented an upgraded room which had brocaded wall paper, antique furniture and paintings on the walls. The room and bathroom were very clean and immaculate. The front desk staff was extremely attentive and responsive. The concierge service was a true asset and absolutely good at giving directions and recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to try. The hotel has a taxi service to St. Mark Square that is free but needs to be booked in advanced. I am omitting one star from my rating because no staff was at the door to helpâ€¦
