We enjoyed our stay at the Boscolo, which is tucked away in the far northern section of historic Venice. No Venice hotel is going to be convenient to everything in the city, and we were happy with the quiet neighborhood, ease of access from the airport (first stop - Orto - on the orange Alilaguna line from Marco Polo), and the great water shuttle to/from San Marco square. The shuttle runs about every 1.5 hours during the day. It takes about the same time as walking - 30 minutes - but the boats are very comfortable and it's a great way to see the city without wearing yourself out. We missed out on the glass factory tour but would do that next time. As gold members, we received free breakfast, which was quite good. We did not receive an upgrade, however, and there was no mentionâ€¦
