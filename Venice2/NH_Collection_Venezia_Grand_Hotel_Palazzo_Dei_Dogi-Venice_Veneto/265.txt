We were on our honeymoon and it is a great location from all the great points.  They even have a water boat to take you to the main sites like St. Mark's square.  It departs every 30 minutes from the hotel. Plus, I was a platinum member and got complimentary free breakfast that was so great!  The staff was so gracious and very helpful.  Good thing that to head to all the hot spots is only a 15 minutes walk and we even found a great Chinese place to eat on the way back to the hotel which gave a break from Italian food everyday lol!  Thank you!
