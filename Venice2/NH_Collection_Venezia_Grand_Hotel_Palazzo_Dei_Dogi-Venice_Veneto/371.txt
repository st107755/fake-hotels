I will preface my review by noting I am Marriott Platinum, and we chose Boscolo Venezia because I could stay using points.  This hotel is over-the-top beautiful!  From the moment you walk in the front entrance witht he Murano glass chandeliers.  We were upgraded to a larger room.  The hotel is within walking distance of all the Venice tourist attractions, as well as offers free water-taxi shuttle to/from San Marco Square.  The walk is enjoyable, as there are several small restaurants/wine bars, before getting to the crowded areas. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly, and eager to please.  I recommend staying at Boscolo Venezia. Thank you for your hospitality.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
