We chose the Boscolo Venezia based on its location, a ploy to keep us walking during the four night stay.  We are glad we did.  Not only is the neighborhood nearby a proper residential area, the hotel was very close to several excellent fruit stands and bakeries that provided much needed snacks.  Several of the reviewers note that the area was quiet, and they are certainly correct.  As we were dealing with jet lag upon arrival, having a quiet corner of the city to rest was a blessing.  The hotel staff was very helpful and quick to respond to any question or request.  We would like to recognize Gaia, who worked the front desk and went out of her way to help us on several occasions.  She helped us check in early, helped us with water taxi plans, and provided excellent directions. â€¦
