We stayed in this beautiful hotel for 4 nights in a deluxe comfort room. From the moment we arrived and were checked in by Phillip and offered a glass of Prosseco we were made to feel so welcome and nothing was too much trouble for their staff. The hotel runs a boat to St Marks square 6 times a day and 2 back an absolute must an amazing experience. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. We also took a trip to Murano with the hotel boat to a Murano glass factory, so interesting to see the glass being made and no hard sell. They also bring you back to the hotel or drop you near St Marks Square. Special mention has to go to Ivan, who sorted out a problem with my friends bracket she brought from the Marano factory and also managed to get me the earings I wished that  I hadâ€¦
