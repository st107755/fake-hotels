This is the nicest hotel my husband & I have ever stated at. Upon our arrival, we discovered that our travel agent had cancelled our reservation accidentally. The staff were fabulous. They assured us they had room, toured us around the hotel to pick the room we wanted, arranged a trip to the Murano Glass factory...The hotel itself is gorgeous. It's located in a quite area. You will want for nothing. Highly recommend.
