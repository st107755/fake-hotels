The Boscolo may be a five star hotel depending on the room and the color of your Amex card. Our room - probably the worst in the hotel - required leaving the hotel to go outside to get to our room. And because we prepaid with a Travelocity gift card it explained why we were treated with distain. There were stains on the rug and wallpaper and rust stains on the bathroom tile. Total LOL on asking â‚¬35 for breakfast. Seriously? The free Internet service didn't reach our room. The staff seemed to know and didn't seem to care. This is not give stars and my recommendation is to find another place.
