Been in Venice multiple of times always near Piazza San Marco. This time I wanted to be outisde of the mass of tourists and came here at Boscolo. Very nice hotel. 20 minutes away from train station with public boats 42 or 52. They have regular free shuttle from hotel to San Marco or Murano. Staff were very nice and welcoming. Food at restaurant excellent. Quiet area. 30 minutes walking distance from San Marco but worth the trip.
