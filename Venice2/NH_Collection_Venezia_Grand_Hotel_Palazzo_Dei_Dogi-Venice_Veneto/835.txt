My wife and I enjoyed our experience at the Boscolo!   This elegant hotel is located a few bridges away from the main walking corridor.  There is an excellent bakery just a few steps away that serves the best chocolate (and other) fresh croissant's I have ever tasted(get there at 6:30am-poppin hot).   The water shuttle is available by reservation to and from San Marco's square and the water bus station is just around the corner for other destinations.     Breakfast is served in the courtyard daily and includes eggs prepared to order and a typical European buffet.  Check out the private courtyard behind the property that meanders back to the hotel's private dock.
