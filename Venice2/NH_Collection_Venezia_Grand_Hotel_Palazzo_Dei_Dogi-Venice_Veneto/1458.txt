We were in Venice for a few day prior to a cruise - This hotel is in a residential area - quiet & beautiful with an unbelievable garden.  You will not be disappointed if you stay here.  The room was spacious and warm - with beautiful murano glass.  The bathroom was also luxurious.  The staff was so welcoming and accomodating - what a magnificent place - it was a Palace. The included breakfast was perfect too...I can't say enough about how fantastic this hotel is.  There is also a complimentary water taxi into town or you can tour Murano...Only Pros - No cons from me.
