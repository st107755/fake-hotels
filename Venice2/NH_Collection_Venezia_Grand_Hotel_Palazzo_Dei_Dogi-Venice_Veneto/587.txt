Although our previous visits to Venice have been at hotels at Saint Marks square or at the Hilton, we found the Boscolo Marriott to be a great choice. We previously stayed in the Boscolo in Budapest, which is unbelievable! The hotel services were excellent. We had a room with a view of the canal, right where the hotel water taxi is to take guests to Saint Marks Square. It is a free service with a schedule to make a reservation. They also have a water taxi to Murano. The hotel is a 7 minute walk from the Jewish ghetto, where we hadn't been on our previous trips. We also discovered a whole different shopping area very close. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
