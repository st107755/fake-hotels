This is a wonderful property.  It is away from the main tourist area, but in very close walking distance there are wonderful neighborhood areas that are so much less crowded with great local type restaurants and shops.  It's a lot more sane and loads of fun.  You can still get your fill of the main St. Marks area by using the hotel's free shuttle to get back and forth, and you will love returning to the relaxing area of the hotel.  the staff is outstanding.
