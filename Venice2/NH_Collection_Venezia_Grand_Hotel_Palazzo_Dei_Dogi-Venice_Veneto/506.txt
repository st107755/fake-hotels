Stayed here for a long weekend break. Very large and luxurious room, staff all very friendly and eager to help us explore the city. Complimentary water taxis to Piazza  San Marco and Murano were excellent. Dining in the hotel, in either bar or dining room was expensive but the quality was excellent
