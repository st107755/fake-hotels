Venice is a sublime experience, and this lovely former palace fits in perfectly.  It is easily accessible, a half-hour ride by water (Orto stop) via Alilaguna Arancio from Marco Polo airport, then a two block walk south.  It is located in a peaceful neighborhood of Cannaregio, away from the bustling tourist crowds but with easy access by foot and/or water to all of Venice.  The hotel itself, which fronts on Rio della Madonna dell'Orto, is beautiful and has an elegant interior and nicely appointed guest rooms.  It has few enough rooms that it feels intimate, yet stately.  There is a wonderful landscaped private garden between the back of the hotel and the lagoon.  The whole property is very quiet and restful.  The staff members are all extremely pleasant and helpful.  Barbara andâ€¦
