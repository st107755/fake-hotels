I stayed at this property as part of a Globus tour for 2 nights.  The only property in Venice with a HUGE english garden to stroll in or sit in!  It is a bit on the edge of Venice...but isn't the charm of going there to walk around and explore?!  The rooms are large and the bathrooms are spectacular...marble, large, well set up.  The staff was extremely helpful.  We brought wine into the bar that we purchased along the way...no problem, the bartender gave us glasses and chips and was happy to help when we needed.  A bit hungry...we asked for an antipasta plate to eat with our wine...we were brought an amazing selection that was even too much for 4 hungry people.  There is a spa onsite that we did not have time to try out. Front and back of the hotel are on water, you might getâ€¦
