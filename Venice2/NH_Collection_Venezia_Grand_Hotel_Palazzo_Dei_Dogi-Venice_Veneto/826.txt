Stayed in this hotel the nights of June 23 and June 24.  Across the board an excellent choice for my wife, our grandson and me.  Has docks right at the hotel on both the canal and the larger waterway around Venice and a free boat to St. Mark's Square, so not to worry that it isn't right at the Square.  Very quiet, historic building(s), wonderful garden in the back, excellent breakfast, helpful staff.  Had a deluxe room with a second floor loft for our grandson.  Memorable visit.
