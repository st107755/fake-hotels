A wonderful hotel and just far enough away from the hoards of tourists.  A beautiful place!  Even found some very good restaurants within a short walking distance.  Didn't mind the little bit of extra time to the Rialto or St. Mark's if we could come back to this peaceful place at night.  (the garden is awesome!)  We took advantage of the free Murano boat trip and received an excellent tour...and with no 'hard sell.'  Praise for the front desk staff, especially Barnabus (sp?), who never failed to answer every question we threw at him.  We found the whole staff there to be very friendly & helpful.  The rooms were quiet and nicely furnished.  The daily breakfast outside was even enjoyable.  You can take the 4.1/4.2 or the 5.1/5.2 vapparetto from the train station and arriveâ€¦
