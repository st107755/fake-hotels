This is a beautiful hotel with loads of character in an area that is away from the touristy hustle and bustle but still well positioned for great restaurants and being within easy walking distance of the main attractions. We were glad that we chose to stay in this area as we gained a better appreciation of Venice by seeing more than just the main tourist attractions. The service that we received from all staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel had a really good feel.
