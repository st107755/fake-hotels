We were very impressed upon arrival with the Boscolo.  A lovely property we had two rooms at the very quiet back of the hotel right on the laguna.  Our room had a water view and our grown kids had a lovely courtyard view.  We spent late evenings all alone on their dock on the water.  Breakfast was very nice.  First class accommodations!
