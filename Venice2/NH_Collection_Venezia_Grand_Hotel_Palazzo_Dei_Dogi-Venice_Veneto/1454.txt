I´ve stay in this hotel in february 2012. It was an awesome experience back in this hotel; nice rooms you feel like you were in a museum, awesome and friendly staff at front desk, dinner and breakfast restautant, incredible private garden, excellent food, nice and quiet neighbourhood; free ship to Saint Marc´s square; the only thing is our rooms has a little bit hot and noisy during the day at nigth was fine. I definitively will return to this hotel.
