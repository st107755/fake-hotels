We stayed in this hotel in October 2017 for 2 nights and it was  great, located in a quiet area in Venice (Cannaregio)  The staff is great , always very helpful and with a big smile.  We got a lagoon view, i think we were upgraded (I have Marriott Platinum Level, and also we got complimentary Breakfast for the 3 of us) , even though we got our nights  with Marriott points.  Our room was in the back part of the hotel, crossing the beautiful garden  and next to the lagoon pier. It was a good size room with a Venetian style decor. It was very clean  The electrical outlets are only for european electric plugs, so don't forget to bring your converter if your electronics don't have European plugs. WIFI was included and had very good speed  Breakfast buffet has a lot to choose from andâ€¦
