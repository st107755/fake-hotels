This beautiful hotel is truly a step back in time.  Exquisite!  Such history and class.  The rooms are not huge, as is the style in Europe, but very well equipped and classy.  The staff were incredibly helpful and the Breakfast was truly amazing.  Fresh fruits, juice, along with a menu to chose from for hot items.  The Murano glass chandeliers in the lobby along with Murano touch in each room topped off the truly elegant personality this hotel possesses.
