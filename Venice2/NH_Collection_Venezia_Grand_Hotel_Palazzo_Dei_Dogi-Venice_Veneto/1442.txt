This hotel is not near the hustle and bustle of Venice but you can easily walk to all of that.  It was wonderful to walk this area at night!  The hotel is very nice and the botanical gardens make this hotel one-of-a-kind. However, the "free" taxi will take you to a Murano factory/museum which will give you a big sales pitch -- be warned.
