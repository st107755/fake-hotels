Splendid hotel, full service, very nice personnel. The warm bar offers a nice assortment of drinks and snacks. The restaurant is top level. The rooms are gorgious and very clean. Very raffinated Christmas decoration. Quiet environment, a little bit out of crowdy center. We recommend it surely. Top!!!
