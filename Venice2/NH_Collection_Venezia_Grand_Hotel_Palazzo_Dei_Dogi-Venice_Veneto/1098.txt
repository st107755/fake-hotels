Had a lovely stay at the Boscolo.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Our room was spacious and well appointed.  There is a handsome boat that will shuttle you to St. Marks Square which is much more comfortable and convenient than the public transport.  Martina and Claudio at the desk brightened our day with friendly bongiornos and expert advice.  Ivan, the concierge was also very helpful and a pleasure to deal with, recommending concerts and operas that made our visit extra special.  The only reason I give the hotel 4 stars rather than 5 is that the location is out of the way.  The hotel is a good distance from St. Marks Square and that is somewhat inconvenient.  All that being said, I hope to return to the Boscolo some day!
