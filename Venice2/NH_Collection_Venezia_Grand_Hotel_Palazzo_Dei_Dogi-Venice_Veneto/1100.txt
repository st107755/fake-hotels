My husband and I stayed here for one night, ending our two-week tour of Italy. We stayed the night before in the Boscolo Milano and the experience could not have been more different. While this hotel isn't as modern as the Milano, the front desk demeanor was night and day. In Milan they were very cold and unwelcoming. In Venice, they were so kind and pleasant. The staff was super helpful in recommending places to eat, things to do, you name it. And the shuttle to San Marco was perfect as well-- provided by the hotel! The breakfast was amazing. And if you are a Marriott gold member it is included in your stay. The garden in the back was dreamy. We loved every minute spent here, and would definitely stay here again!
