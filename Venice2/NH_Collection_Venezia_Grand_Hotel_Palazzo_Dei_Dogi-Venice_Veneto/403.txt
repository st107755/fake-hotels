We stayed at the Boscolo Venicia (a Marriott resort) and had a great time in Venice. The hotel was grand in an old world setting. Close to all sites that Venice has to offer. The food in the restaurant was above average. Try the octopus salad in the restaurant, .and of course all the pizzas all over Venice. Pizza and pasta was our motto!
