This hotel was a dream! I was hesitant when my husband booked it because it seamed so far from the heart of Venice but it ended up being the perfect location!! We loved how quite the area was. But it was also a beautiful 20-30 min walk to San Marco which I loved every bit of seeing the charm of the city. The hotel is also conveniently located to a docking station which we caught a boat to Burano. Our room was small but very nice. And our view from our room was something of a postcard!
