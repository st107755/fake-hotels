I have mixed feelings about this hotel. As a reviewer I feel it is important to be honest without sounding picky. So I will mention the pros and cons? Pros - the grounds of the property are beautiful and the staff is excellent, great buffet breakfast, they provide a free water taxi service several times during the day to and from St. Marks square. The Cons -  Rooms are very small and although they are furnished to fit with the age of the building they could use updating. We were traveling for a few weeks so we had a lot of luggage with very little room to put our suitcases. The shower had a partial door so when you showered water would get all over the floor. There were no night stands just small tables next to the bed. Also, try NOT to get a room on the first floor in the US itâ€¦
