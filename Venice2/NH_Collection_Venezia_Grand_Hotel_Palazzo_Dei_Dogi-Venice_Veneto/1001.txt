Staying in August 2014 as part of a tour of Italy.  Booked some nights with reward points and paid for others.  As a Marriott Platinum member I don't expect the world, just a small amount of recognition that I'm a loyal customer.  We were given a tiny room with not enough space to put our case down and walk from the room to the bathroom.   There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. A bit of a basic Marriott usual and somewhat unexpected in an autograph hotel.  Mosquitoes were present in room and we were supplied with a plug and mozzie scent.  The hotel also on checkout refuse to credit my reward account with the point earned saying I booked through an agent.  Mmm £186 for 1 night but not regards points.  Another niggle - when do rewards nights not include breakfast.…
