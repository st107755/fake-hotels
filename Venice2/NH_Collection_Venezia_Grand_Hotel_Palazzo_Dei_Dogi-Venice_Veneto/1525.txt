I stayed here for 4 nights in August and liked the hotel and the area it is located in.  It is away from crazy St Mark's area but within 15-20 minutes walk of the station and has restaurants within 5 - 10 minute walk.  Hotels provides water transport to St Mark's Square and there is a water bus stop within 5 minutes walk rom hotel.  From there you can get to Lido, Murano and St Mark's Square.  Hotel is beside a quiet canal and has beautiful garden to the rear that stretches back to the lagoon.  Breakfast can be taken in the garden and there was a good choice provided.   Staff speak good Engliush and are friendly and helpful.
