We stayed there in April and much enjoyed the beauty of the hotel, its,, surprisingly big garden, and their shuttle service with their own elegeant boat. It is located in a neighbourhood is a bit off the trodden path. This in our eyes is a big plus in the somewhat overcrowded city. One thing you have to watch: the romantic rooms under the roof are fine, but on warm days really hot.
