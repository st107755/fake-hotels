The hotel is in a great location - off the beaten path, but easy to get to where you want to go. I had a deluxe room overlooking the inside canal - it was nice, but the air conditioning was week and the room was always warm.  The restaurant in the garden was great for both dinner and breakfast.  Some staff were fantastic and some staff were poor.
