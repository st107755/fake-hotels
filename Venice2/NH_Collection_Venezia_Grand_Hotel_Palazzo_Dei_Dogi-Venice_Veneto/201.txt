We stayed here in July with out two teenage boys. The rooms were beautiful. Two junior suites. It was grand. Claudio, was outstanding. The garden outside was beautiful and fun to walk through at night as we drank wine. It is a 30 minute walk to most to the major sites and the walk itself is a great experience. The beds were comfortable and the room was impeccable. We will definitely be back to this hotel. Loved it!!!!!
