Slightly away from the crowds but in the lovely suburb of Cannaregio sits the 5-Star Luxury Hotel the Boscolo.  18th Century Elegance from the stunning lobby, dining room & bar to the sitting rooms on upper floors and the guest rooms themselves.  Splendid period frescoes, precious marbles and the Murano glass chandeliers are magnificent.  The hotel was once a Palace then the French Embassy and is the only hotel in Venice to hve a garden of over 3000 sq.m. with lovely gardens to stroll or sit in and goes through to the Lagoon at the end.  Complimentary water taxis to St Mark's Square offered several times daily and a trip to Murano with entrance to a glass-making factory.  We had a 2nd floor room (236) overlooking the Canal which was very quiet at night.  Service at thisâ€¦
