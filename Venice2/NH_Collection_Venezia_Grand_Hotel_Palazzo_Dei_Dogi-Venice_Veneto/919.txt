Beds are hard as rocks...The front desk staff is less than friendly, especially Philip who spoke to my husband in a very condescending manner...not professional at ALL. We were also told the last shuttle to St Marco was at 6 by Philip, when indeed the last shuttle was at 5:20 and we therefore incurred expenses to get their on our own.  Philip even wrote in down in the book that were taking the 6pm shuttle that did not exist. Our return transportation that we arranged through the hotel only took us as far as the boat dock at the airport even though we paid for door to door service.  We emailed the hotel regarding this and received NO answer from them...Would NOT recommend this hotel at all.
