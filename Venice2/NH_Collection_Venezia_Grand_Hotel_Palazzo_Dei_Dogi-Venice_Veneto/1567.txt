I booked this hotel because we wanted a quality hotel, in Venice but so many were way too expensive because they are near to the Central locations. For 5 star, this one looked reasonable. It was more than reasonable.  It is a bit off the tourist track, away in the north of the Island.  That means it is quiet, peaceful and avoids the tourists, and MUCH better value than others.  The hotel has a nice boat and will taxi you, for free, so location is not a problem.  Walk out the back and there is a very nice garden, with water and night lights, and then further out at the back you have the water bus stop. The garden is worth a stay on its own.  The hotel has been modernised, is clean, stylish and attractive. Our room was quiet, a good few nights sleep. Good bathroom, lots of hotâ€¦
