Loved our time at the Boscolo Venezia. Our room was beautiful and was ample room for 2 people. We really enjoyed walking in the garden and being able to stop in the hotel bar after a day of touring. It's about a 25 minute walk to St Mark's Square, but I consider that a plus. It was in a quiet residential area a few yards from a gorgeous church. The hotel is very close to a water shuttle stop & the hotel has a free water taxi that runs to St Marks and to Murano. Would definitely stay again
