What a great choice to decompress for a couple of days as part of an Italy trip. The hotel was very easily accessed from the airport. The water bus stop is a few hundred yards away, we opted for $100 euro water taxi to the front door from the airport. The service was incredible, the gardens charming, and the hotel accomodations were exquisite. We met some wonderful travelers in the garden seating for the restaurant as well as the bar, definitely worth stopping into these. Although set back in a more quiet residential area, it was very easy to get to areas with dining and shopping as well as St. Mark's.
