We are long-time Marriott Gold members so chose this hotel for our Venice adventure. It is out of the tourist throngs in a residential area, yet not that far from the train station. The location is important because it is a very quiet retreat from the crowds. There is a free water taxi shuttle to Marco  and back all day and that is important too. Also a free ride to Murano Island for a glass factory tour - worthwhile! It is very classy in the Italian version of luxury - so don't expect a to apply American design standards, for example. The service was excellent. I would give it a slight downgrade for the breakfast quality and service - could have been better, but good enough. Highly recommended!
