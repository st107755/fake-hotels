This beautiful hotel is the first stop on the water bus from the airport.  You will understand why it's not beneficial to stay near the square after you are struggling with your luggage over cobblestones and many stairs.  Walking to the attractions was easy and a great way to see the sights.    This hotel is one of few places in the city that has a lovely green space within its large courtyard.  The service is excellent and the staff is very knowledgable, and genuinely want to help you navigate the city.  Good dining recommendations also.  The beds were supreme and so comfortable.  Unfortunately we closed the drapes all the way to darken the room and slept until noon the second day after arrival.  Oops!  The brunch was elaborate but not a great option for those with foodâ€¦
