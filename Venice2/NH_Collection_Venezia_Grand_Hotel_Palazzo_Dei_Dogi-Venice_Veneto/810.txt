The service at this hotel is impeccable.  The concierge gave us excellent advice for touring around Venice.  The water taxi to St Mark's Square & Murano is so convenient.  The breakfast was very good.  It is about a 30 minute walk to St Mark's square so you are away from the touristy area and the crowds.  There is a lovely piazza area about 10 min walk away for gelata, shopping & restaurants.  It is in a quiet location which we loved.   I would stay here again absolutely.  The rooms are typical smaller size for Europe but very nice.  Air conditioning works great.  Bathrooms are fairly modern.  It is a lovely boutique property, luxurious, modern, convenient & welcoming.
