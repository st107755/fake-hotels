Everything about this hotel is great! When we checked in at noon, they recognized my Marriott elite standing, my mobile check in from the day before and acknowledged our visit to the hotel three years ago and gave us a nice grade and took us directly to our room overlooking the canal. Staff was great and very knowledgeable, breakfast was out standing the rooms beautiful. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood, short 20 minute walk to St Marks. Will definitely return!
