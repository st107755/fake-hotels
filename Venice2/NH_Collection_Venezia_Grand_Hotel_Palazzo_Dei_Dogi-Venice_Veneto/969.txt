We recently spent four nights at the Boscolo in Venice-a gorgious place in a very nice part of the city. It's much more quiet than in the center and the beautiful garden is a real sensation. The only real issue the hotel seems to have is that it hasn't arrived in the Marriott world yet. Being a platinum member I would have expected at least some recognition however there was none. The service attitude is more the Italian style...The restaurant is nice however overpriced-breakfast is excellent compared to Italian average. We had a very spacious room, the building being spectacular and very prestigous. The private boat shuttle is well organized and a real plus
