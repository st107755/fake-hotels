We spent 3 nights in the hotel as a wedding gift from my family.  The hotel is positioned in the north of venice so it is away from the crowds but it is still walkable to all the main galleries, st mark's square and the churches. The foyer of the hotel is fairly grand and the murano glass chandeliers are eye catching.  However our room was fairly disappointing.  There was a tiny window in the room which meant there was hardly any natural light.  We could have been in a cellar!  The bathroom had crumbs from the previous occupant and was slightly on the small side.  There was no bath however we were given bath powders and bubble bath..not sure why! The bed was huge but it did comprise of two twin beds pushed together.  Rather strange but comfortable enough.  There was a mini barâ€¦
