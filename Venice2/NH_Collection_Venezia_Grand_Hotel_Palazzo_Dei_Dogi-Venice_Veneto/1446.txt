Giuseppe Portrandolfo and Mariana Ferreira were superb in every regard.  Courteous, professional, helpful and caring to a fault.  the entire staff were constantly engaged in ensuring that our stay was beyond expectations.   the property itself was immaculate.   Room was large and always refreshed.  all the amenities were perfect and abundant.  the garden area in the back was restful; large and green and the ice house remains are a little known attraction to travelers and right in your back yard..  grocery store, wine shops, bistro's, vaparetto, were all within minutes walking distance.  Maps are a "general help" as the roads are not clearly marked once you get into the interior, but hard to get lost !  San Marco is only an hour's walk and the Rialto bridge about 25 minutes.  â€¦
