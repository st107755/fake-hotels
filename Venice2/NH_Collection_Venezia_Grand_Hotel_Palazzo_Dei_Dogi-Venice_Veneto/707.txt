The Pros: The Boscolo is a beautiful and extremely picturesque hotel. Each room is (I believe) unique as befits a converted palazzo. The bed is comfortable, and the shower is both hot, and has good pressure.   The hotel is situated in Canareggio, and is an easy walk (10-15 min) from the train station, over a few of the shorter bridgest in Venice. It is very convenient to the ghetto, and far (30 min plus walk) from San Marco, but the hotel does offer a complimentary water taxi which you must book in advance.  The staff is friendly, and the hotel is quiet as it is off the main drag, and in a neighborhood that feels very "local."   The cons: The wifi is truly unreliable, and you have to sign in on a regular basis to get internet access. it is NOT suitable for a business traveler,â€¦
