The hotel was outstanding, staff attentive and helpful.  Room was exquisite and service impeccable.  The down side is that it advertises air conditioning, and it does have it, but it is not turned on!!!!  The rooms were VERY warm for the middle of April.  We opened the windows and he mosquitoes ate us up!  The hotel provided us a fan, but it just moved very warm air around.  If you go in he summer months, do ask if the hotel has turned on the air conditioning before you book!
