A very special place indeed.  Each room is different from one another.  The breakfast is bountiful, delicious and beautifully presented.  Check-in staff are very efficient and helpful.   When you come in from walking all over Venice, the hotel has raspberry and lemon iced-water or cappuccino available for your refreshment just beyond the front door.  The lobby area is beautifully appointed with classic Italian detailing.  I didn't want to leave after our two night stay!
