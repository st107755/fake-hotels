We stayed here at the end of a week-long trip in Italy, electing to spend a little more money to stay in a nice, relaxing space. It was some of these things, but we were disappointed about the very small room and the location proved to be more of a detriment than we expected - it was a hike to get anywhere. Overall, it was nice, but it wasn't worth the cost.   Pros: - Beautiful common spaces - Quiet, clean, comfortable rooms - Priority access to tours at Murano glass factory - Private boat shuttle to Murano, St. Mark's square - Helpful, polite staff - Lush outdoor gardens  Cons: - Small room - Long walk from the center of the island and most attractions, food - Expensive breakfast - Week WiFi (I had to go down the hall to connect)
