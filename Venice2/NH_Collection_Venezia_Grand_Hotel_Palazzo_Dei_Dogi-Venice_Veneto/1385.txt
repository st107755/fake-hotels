The hotel is in a very quiet part of Venice, 25 minutes walk from St Marks square. I did enjoy the location. The hotel itself has its flaws. The breakfast is mediocre, it's certainly not worth the 35 euros they charge. The wireless is pretty awful and I ended up paying roaming fees to connect to my mail account. Front desk were below average, but the concierge was very informative. As hotels go stay there for the location and try to avoid using the facilities. Definitely not 5 star but being in Venice is always a pleasure and made up for the hotel shortcomings.
