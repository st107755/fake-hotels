Just returned from Venice. My stay at the Boscolo could not have been better. The hotel is located in a residential area, but it was very easy to get around. I stayed in a 2 story junior suite which had one queen upstairs and one down. Everything from the bedding to the showers were excellent. Breakfast was included each morning because of my Marriott Platinum Premier status. But the other reviews were right, it was the service that makes this hotel shine. From reception to the nice lady at breakfast, everyone was genuine and friendly. I will never stay anywhere else when in Venice. Grazie!
