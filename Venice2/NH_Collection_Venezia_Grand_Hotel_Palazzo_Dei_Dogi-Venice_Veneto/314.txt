This was my first visit to Venice and I talked to a lot of friends who have visited the city, everyone had different hotel recommendations. After reviewing many on TA, I picked Boscolo Venezia based on the reviews and my Marriott Platinum status. I was traveling with my College age daughter. We arrived Marco Airport around 9 pm and was at the hotel at about 10:30, we took the public transportation boat from the airport and easily found the hotel a couple minute walk from the Orto stop. We were warmly greeted upon our arrival. We had an excellent room overlooking the garden (a must walk through!). Breakfast was excellent each morning. The hotel gave 2 great local dinner restaurant recommendations. Thank you Phillip!! We took the hotel free shuttle one day into town, the first dayâ€¦
