I was debating where to stay while in Venice as this was not my first time visiting and I knew it's the peak season so the touristy crowd could be overwhelming so I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed this hotel. It's a bit far from St. Marco but you got to experience more local life and it's quiet and very relaxing yet still walkable to many major places and restaurants. The hotel also got a botanic garden which is hardly seen in Venice and the service is fantastic. The only thing that didn't match a 5 star hotel was inconsistent water temperature while taking shower and spotty public area wi-fi. I'll definitely come back if I visit Venice again!
