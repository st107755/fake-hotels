The location is not ideal for those not familiar with Venice. You will get lost trying to find the hotel and GPS won't be a huge help because some of the streets are very, very narrow. The rooms are a nice size with small bathrooms. The mattress is horrible. I kid you not, it was maybe 4 inches thick and provided a horrible night of sleep. There is a musty smell that lingers through the property as well.  The staff is ok. Nothing memorable. The internet was terrible with less the 1mb down/up. (It's free though) If I had it to do over again, I would have chosen something a little more tourist friendly. The water taxi service advertised is a joke. There are 6 pickup times and you have to book in advance to secure a spot. I think they mislead you to think that it's complimentary atâ€¦
