A great hotel experience in an intimate, boutique setting in one of the most beautiful cities in the world! Beautiful breakfast, finally not another boring hotel buffet! Enchanting back garden on the water, try to book one of the private suites. Out of a fairy-tale! FREE water taxi at the front door of the hotel--saves a lot of money vs. hiring water taxi to city. QUIET! Which is exactly what you want after a day of noisy, busy tourist areas. Walkable to neighborhood restaurants in the evening--you get a true sense of living in Venice. Perfect!
