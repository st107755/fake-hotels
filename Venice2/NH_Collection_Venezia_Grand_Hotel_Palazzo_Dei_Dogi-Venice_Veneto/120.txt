We spent 4 days at this hotel. It is located in a quiet area with few tourists wandering around (at least in early May). It is possible to walk to the touristy areas from there. The best way to get there from/to the airport is by water taxi (120 euros) or shared ride (37 euros/person). The room was comfortable and quiet. The staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was good quality but as expected in a Marriott hotel. We took advantage of the "tour" to the Murano glass and from there to Burano (a most!). Overall a pleasant stay.
