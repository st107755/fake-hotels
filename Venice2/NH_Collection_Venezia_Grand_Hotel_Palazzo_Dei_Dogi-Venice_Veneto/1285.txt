We stayed here for three days in May 2012 and were treated like royalty.  Returned on March 8, 2013 for an 8 day stay, arriving with high expectations.  Once again the Boscolo Venezia far exceeded our expectations.  From the moment Marianna greeted us, we felt like we were staying with family.  Phillip and many of the new staff could not do enough for us. The Hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the location is perfectly situated in a wonderful neighborhood. The restaurant staff especially Bane were outstanding as well as the food. Look forward to returning another time. Bob Tassone New York
