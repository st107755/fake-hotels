We stayed here five nights and had a great experience. The breakfast is the best we had in Italy with varied and unique custom orders in addition to an elaborate buffet.   The hotel has the renovated villa with lots of Venetian art, a lovely garden, rooms off the garden and in the lagoon boat house/welcome building. We were in the boat house with a lovely view to Murano.
