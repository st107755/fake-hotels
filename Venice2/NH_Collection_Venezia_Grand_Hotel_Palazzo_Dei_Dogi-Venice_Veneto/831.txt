My husband, young daughter and I recently spent 5 nights at the Bosclo Venezia. the location was lovely in a true Venetian neighborhood, with actual Italians residing there (rare for Venice). The website does NOT do this place justice. We were so happily surprised by the wonderful large garden with secret paths, fountains and access to the lagoon from the outdoor dining area. The Jr. Suite (fairly priced for its size)  was very large and elegantly furnished, but the Superior Room is rather small and seems overpriced for what it is. A quick vaporetto boat ride ( boat stop is a 5 min walk from hotel) brings you to all the sights, and a 30min. rode will take you to the wonderful Lido beaches to hang out and soak up the Italian beach culture. We loved the quiet, residential feel,â€¦
