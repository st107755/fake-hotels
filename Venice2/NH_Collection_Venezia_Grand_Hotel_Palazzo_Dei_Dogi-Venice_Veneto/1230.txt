Loved my stay at the Boscolo Venice !  It was a beautifully designed property ... specially the restaurant where they serve breakfast opened up to the most breathtaking lawns ... the staff was warm and helpful ... food excellent !  rooms were very large according to european standards .. bathrooms were exceptionally large and well equipped ! quite enjoyed the location .. even though it was a little away from marco square but the shuttles were frequent and an enjoyable ride !
