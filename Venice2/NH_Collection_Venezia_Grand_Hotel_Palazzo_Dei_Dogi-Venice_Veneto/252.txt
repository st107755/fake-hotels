We stayed here for our honeymoon and it was such an amazing hotel! It's a bit away from the main, touristy area, but we preferred that because it was quiet. It's in an old, historic building that's beautiful. Definitely go out back and explore the gorgeous gardens.   Our hotel room was so spacious and had breathtaking views of the canals. Everything was very clean.   The staff was so friendly. When we first arrived and mentioned we were here for our honeymoon, they took us to the bar and gave us each a glass of prosecco. Later we stopped in the bar and the bartender (who was very friendly!) also gave us a glass of prosecco.   The staff was also very kind and let us leave our bags with them on our last day when we had a late ride out of Venice. We would definitely go back to thisâ€¦
