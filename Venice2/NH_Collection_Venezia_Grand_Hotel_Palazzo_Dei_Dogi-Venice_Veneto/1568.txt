The service was wonderful, when they found out it was our honeymoon they sent a bottle of complimentary bubbly to us.  The room was lovely with a HUGE bed.  Very clean room and bathroom., with gorgeous fluffy bathrobes.  Lovely decor and everything worked in the room.  The lobby of this hotel is stunning and there is a communal area on each floor which are all decorated with paintings of the old Doges.  The hotel is in a residential area of Venice but a short walk over a couple of bridges takes you to a lively area full of shops, resteraunts and bars.  The vaporetto stop is a short walk away and very easy even with a suitcase.  Would definatley recommend this hotel and would certainly go again myself.
