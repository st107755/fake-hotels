We stayed here for 3 nights (we booked two rooms, one for adults, one for the kids), and the rooms were beautiful. We were upgraded to an enormous room that looked out onto the canal. The children's room was beautiful, too, but a little small. The hotel was gorgeous and the location was perfect. An easy boat ride from the airport, and in a charming residential neighborhood away from the crazy, crowded tourist area. The spa was wonderful, too. The breakfast was a bit pricey, but still very good. The staff were wonderful and very friendly and helpful. Wonderful property!
