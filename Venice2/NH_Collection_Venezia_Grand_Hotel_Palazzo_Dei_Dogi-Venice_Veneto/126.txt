Treated like a valued guest I enjoyed this hotel immensely. Very nice accommodations couple with comfortable beds and quiet nights, it was just what kind needed after more than 2 weeks of travel. The concierge was helpful, the complimentary cold water, coffee and tea service in the lobby was refreshing after a long day of touring around
