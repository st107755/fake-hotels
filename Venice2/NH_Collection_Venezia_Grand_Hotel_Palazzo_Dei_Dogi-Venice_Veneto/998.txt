December 24-25, Christmas 2013 I booked the hotel 1 month in advance to make sure that they are confirmed.   The room rate from Boscolo is little pretty high, but I'm willing for pay more and expect more of staying during special time of the year.  It was come to surprise upon arrival that I got upgrade to Suite.   What a wonderful time.   The room is about 100 SQM that cover the whole roof area that I think it's good for party.   I wish I had a large companion.   Anyway, Xmas in Venice is quite romantic, and the area is very quiet.   It would be much better if I have purchased many bottle of wines and sip all night through.  For dinning time, it's recommended to go out and ask concerige to reserve table in advance if you really want to have a good taste and nice ambianceâ€¦
