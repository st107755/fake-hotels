We stayed here after spending 3 nights at the JW Marriott located on its own island. We expected the JW to be the highlight of our stay but we were wrong - it was the Dei Dogi and in particular the manager Claudio.  When we booked the Dei Dogi we were only able to book one night which we figured would be acceptable. Upon check-in Claudio asked why we weren't staying longer and when we explained we couldn't book extra nights he asked us to review the room and location while he tried to see if he could arrange more nights. He was able to extend our stay and after our initial impressions we are most pleased that he did. I must say that his concern for our stay was a highlight of this trip.  That's a major claim considering he has to compete with the wonderful views of Venice,â€¦
