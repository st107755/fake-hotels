While the weather was a little damp (we waded through 2' of water in St Mark's) the hotel and it's staff were wonderful. The key staff spoke excellent English and we attentive to our needs. They helped with all transfers to and from the hotel before and during our trip. The room was very simple but well appointed and excellent water pressure (better than any US hotel).   The breakfast was excellent and the choices off the breakfast menu were all delicious.  The wait staff was very attentive and made us feel very welcome.   The concierges (Gaia and Ivan) were very helpful in planning before our arrival and helped with our trips to Murano and Burano.  This was my wife's birthday and the staff of the Boscolo helped make it a truly memorable trip.
