This hotel was so Venetian, our King Size Bedroom was very spacious. Breakfast was very good. The staff was so courteous, especially the person at the desk, I do not have his name. But his user name on my receipt is: zipek732vceak. hopefully that helps, he was so amazing. First Class Customer Service.
