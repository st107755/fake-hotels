This hotel is one of best I have stayed in over my 10 year span of global travel.  From the moment of check in you could tell the staff were pleased to welcome you into their hotel and never once got frustrated with the multiple questions we had throughout our stay.  The location is off the main streets which offers quiet evenings but a very short walk to restaurants and sightseeing locations.  The room was decorated in original fittings which added to the authenticity of this historic building.  The only negative comment was that breakfast seemed a little disorganized but the selection as nice and staff were very helpful too.   We plan to visit Venice next year and will stay at this hotel again.. highly recommended
