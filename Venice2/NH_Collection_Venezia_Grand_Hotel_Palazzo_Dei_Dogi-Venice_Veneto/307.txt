Located on the Northern tip of Venice this lovely hotel is away from the busy, and potentially noisy locations of its competitors. Venice isn't large enough, if you are fit and able, for you to be too far to walk to any destination from any starting point. There are regular water buses, and numerous (expensive) water taxi's, as well as Gondola's (£70 for 30 mins) if walking isn't your thing. The staff at the hotel are knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating, as well as efficient, Allessio, in particular, is one of the best I have met in any hotel in any location and a credit to the brand that he represents. Venice is charming, we spent four days exploring it on foot (32 miles!), and reckon that we covered all the points of interest. Avoid buying, eating, or drinking anything…
