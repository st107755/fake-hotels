The Boscolo Venezia is a fabulous hotel, very luxurious, and well kept.  Our welcome was warm and the staff was most helpful.  We received a room upgrade which was unexpected since we were using Marriott points for our stay.  The room was large, with 2 nightstands next to the king size bed,   a sofa, 2 chairs, coffee table, desk, and 2 large windows with a view of the canal.  The bathroom was well appointed, towels were soft, shower was good, and there was counter space for our toiletries (which we did not find in our other hotels).   Breakfast was pricey, but consisted of a full buffet with meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, juice, coffee and 1 selection from the hot menu (35 euros).    They provide a free shuttle from the hotel to St. Marks Square and to the island of Murano,â€¦
