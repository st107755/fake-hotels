We spent three nights at this hotel in late May.  The hotel is a gem, artistic, quiet, elegant. It sits right on the lagoon separating Venice from the mainland. You can look out the back to the mainland and Morano and Borano. The front is a very quiet canal. The interior is both ornate and grand, And what a lovely garden in the middle of the property.  But the real jewel are the staff.  Pleasant, friendly, helpful, ever present but never in the way. Like you are visiting a long time friend. The staff were wonderful at every turn, whether it was directions, meals or just having a drink.  I will note that the hotel is pretty far from St. Marks square, perhaps a 20-25 minute walk away.  I liked that because it gave us an excuse to really explore the island.  It is not a diffiultâ€¦
