Mixed feelings... The hotel in itself is very nice. The lobby, garden and the room were nice and the breakfast really great. We also appreciated the free shuttle to San Marco's square. On the negative side we were given room 136 and it was a terrible room as we could literally hear every word spoke by the guests occupying the room above us. This was supposed to be a perfect weekend but it unfortunately got affected by the fact we couldn't sleep. We ended up being very happy checking-out... Too bad
