The hotel is in a quiet location, but withing walking distance to the water bus station. There are sufficient restaurants nearby if you do want to walk to the touristy areas. The hotel is very charming and you notice there is a great deal of history in its decor. The rooms vary greatly one from another. We initially had a mezzanine level floor, which was rather hot due to low ceiling. Due to a malfunction in the hot water we were moved the next day to Junior Suite and this quite a welcome change.  Not my favorite Boscolo hotel but it does have quite a bit of character. Take advantage of the complimentary tour to Murano
