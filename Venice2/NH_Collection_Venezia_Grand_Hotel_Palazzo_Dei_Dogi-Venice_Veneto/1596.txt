What a beautiful hotel with a perfect location!  The room exceeded my expectations and the service was outstanding.  I was with my young daughter and felt so safe in Venice and this hotel.  We walked to everything we wanted to see and even felt secure coming back after dark.  Pretty much everything closed at 7:30pm.  Valporetto service just around the corner.  Hotel has complimentary shuttle service to St. Mark's square and the Murano Glass Factory.  Hotel grounds and gardens are beautiful.  We did not eat at the restaurant because we were gone most of the time, but I recommend trying the Trattoria Pizzeria da Gioia during your stay - fish specialties, 30124 S. Marco.  People there are wonderful.  We both decided this hotel is a wonderful place to come back to - and hope toâ€¦
