Our family of eleven stayed over the weekend at this lovely hotel.  Staff, rooms and service were all excellent. Even the breakfast buffet was a good incentive to wake up early the following day.  The distance of the hotel of the hotel from the maddening crowds in the city center was worth the 30-minute walk.
