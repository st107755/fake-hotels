When we first arrived at the Boscolo I was so excited! The hotel lobby is lovely and after our long hot journey, the air conditioned welcome was wonderful.  Our experience quickly soured as we checked in. The reception staff was completely incompetent and rude.  Although we had a reservation (with a confirmation email) the manager said he would not honor our reservation because it was booked through a third party (Continental/United). He charged $90.00 for a cot per night even though our confirmed reservation clearly requested a room for 3.  What made matters worse was that he was so incredibly rude. We asked him to work out this issue with the booking agent and he refused saying it was not his problem.   The worst part of our stay was that there was no (zero) air conditioningâ€¦
