My husband and I stayed her during our first tour of Italy. We were stunned at the elegance and beauty. A little off the beaten path from St. Marks Square but worth it. It really is in a league of its own but as not surprised the service was a little bit on the arrogant side. I would still recommend if don't want to be near where all the action is.
