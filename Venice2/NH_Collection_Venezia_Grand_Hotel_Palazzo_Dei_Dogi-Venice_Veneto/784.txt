Beautiful boutique hotel with period architecture and great food.  Staff was excellent.  Room was a loft style and very comfortable even had AC and it was super hot in August. There are beautiful Murano glass chandeliers everywhere and the local shopping was some of the best and most reasonable in Venice.  Also the local restaurants were excellent and a quick walk from the hotel.
