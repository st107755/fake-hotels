This was my first trip to Venice in 20+ years...why did I wait so long!  If flying into Venice, the hotel is the first stop on the Orange Waterbus (Vaporetto) "Orto".  This stop is one block from the hotel, but no bridges to cross, so you can roll your luggage right along.  On the subject of airplane connections, our departure flight was changed from 12 noon to 7am...too early for the Waterbus back to mainland, so we moved the night before to an airport hotel...really the only safe bet for an early departure.  We loved the hotel, has a room facing the canal and enjoyed seeing boat traffic and the gondola school teaching folks the craft of rowing!  The school is down the road from the hotel if you want to give it a try.  Would recommend getting a rate that includes breakfast. â€¦
