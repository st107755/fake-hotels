This hotel has easy access to all water taxi's it was quiet and clean and very enjoyable to stay in. The hotel staff were very kind and went out of their way to meet your needs. WE only stayed one nite but we enjoyed our stay and the area. WE loved it so much we got back to the hotel around 2:30 AM and sat on the dock it was so peaceful. Well done if you have time book this hotel.
