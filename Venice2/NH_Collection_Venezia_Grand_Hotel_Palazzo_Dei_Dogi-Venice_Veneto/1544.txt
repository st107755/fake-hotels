Travelled with Cox & Kings to this hotel and really enjoyed our stay despite a lack of sunshine! The Hotel reception staff were outstandingly helpfull and very freindly indeed. Given how reasonably priced this hotel is, our room was absloutely fine, nice sideways view of its canal, fantastic gardens and the breakfast was fine. We did not have an evening meal as the prices looked pretty steep compared to other restauarants nearby. We would stay there again. Roger
