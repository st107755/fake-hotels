A most delightful stay in every way at the Boscolo Autograph Collection Hotel by Marriott.  An appreciated upgrade to a Superior room on the 4th floor gave us a nice view with lots of windows to the lovely garden below.  The staff was so helpful and friendly; we began to feel like this was our home away from home!  We had been to Venice before and enjoyed the neighborhood feel and the quiet respite from busy St. Mark's Square.  It was easy to get to the Square using the complimentary water taxi or the vaparetto  within an easy walking distance.  The concierge, Ivan, went above and beyond helpful in his suggestions and bookings for our daily adventures.   Loved Murano, Burano, and Verona.  This is a charming property with a nice restaurant and friendly staff.  Don't forget toâ€¦
