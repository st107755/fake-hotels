Our stay at Boscolo Venezia, Autograph Collection made our trip to Venice incredible.  Our room was gorgeous and the service was exceptional.  It is located in a quiet spot away from the tourist area with complementary water taxis to San Marco Square and Murano. Great restaurants and shops are within easy walking distance, and San Marco Square is a healthy half-hour walk if you don't want to take the water taxi.  We got excellent restaurant recommendations from the front desk staff. We highly recommend it.
