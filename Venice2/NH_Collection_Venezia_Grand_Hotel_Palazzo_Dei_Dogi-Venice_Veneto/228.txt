Really enjoyed staying at this hotel while we were in Venice for one night - the location is in a very peaceful part of town and we loved exploring the neighborhood. There was a loud wedding going on at the hotel and the staff kindly switched us to a quieter room upon our request. The rooms were lovely and the whole hotel had a nice charm.  4/5 stars because breakfast was not included!
