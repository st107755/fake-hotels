On our first trip to Venice, we stayed here for 10 days. We loved the location which was not close to the tourist area. We got a real feel for the place and the people.  Our room was wonderful, spa was so relaxing, thanks Maria who gives the best massages! Breakfast is in a beautiful courtyard with fantastic options to choose from, excellent service as well the only issue was the pigeons seem to think so as well. Closing the curtains helped with that and keeping out the morning sun. What a beautiful way to start the day, although I think they thought we were a little crazy in how much coffee we like in the morning. The front desk staff is unbelievable, very nice and great with suggestions. We had a list of things we wanted to do and they were always giving us additions that madeâ€¦
