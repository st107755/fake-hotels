We stayed here for a few days for a post-work getaway. Pros: Away from the tourist-crazed St. Mark's Square area; near the water bus and some nice shops and restaurants; lovely staff. Cons: No complimentary shuttle from airport, no coffee maker in the room, cheesy bar (small, cramped, lacked atmosphere), expensive (30 Euro) breakfast, spotty Wifi. It wasn't a horrible experience, but if we return to Venice, we will not stay here a second time.
