I liked this hotel alot. It is just 2 min. Walk from Madonna del Orto vapuretto stop. You can easily walk everywhere. The staff is very helpful. Delux rooms are not so spacious but you can not expect much in venice, everywhere it is the same. Good open buffet for breakfast, you can select one dish from the menu that is included in the breakfast. Hotel has its own boat and provides daily shuttles to S. Marco square at planned intervals. If i travel again to Venice, will definetely stay agaib here. Highly recommend
