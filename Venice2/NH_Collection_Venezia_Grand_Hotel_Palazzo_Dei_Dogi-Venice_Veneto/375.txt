For our Venice visit, finding a manicure and pedicure was surprisingly hard. But we are so happy to have found Boscolo's spa. Ask for Maria! She was wonderful and we'd go back just for her. Use of the spa facilities (sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, waterfall shower) before and after was relaxing and enjoyable. Booking ahead is advisable and easy to do by phone.
