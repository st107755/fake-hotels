Everything about the hotel was fabulous. The location is away from the crowds, but a short walk gets you right into the hustle and bustle of the city. There are lots of local restaurants close by, and the hotel provides a shuttle to St. Marks Square if you want to join the crowds. The food was delicious, and if you take a class of wine to the dock on the lagoon side of the hotel, it is the perfect spot to watch the sun go down.. All of the staff were extremely helpful, and I can not speak too highly of this place. I would love to return.
