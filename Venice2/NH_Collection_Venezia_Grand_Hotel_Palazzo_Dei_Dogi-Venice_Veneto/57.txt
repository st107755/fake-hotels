The service at this property is amazing.   The check in was easy and services well explained.  The concierge really was helpful (don't know her name but a blonde lady who works evening). She gave me wonderful advice to get to my next destination and everything worked out perfectly.  The breakfast in the morning was perfect, loved the food and service.  A wonderful bonus I did not expect was a free shuttle by boat to get go San Marco, we definitely used that and it felt like a dream!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.
