We had beet ravelling Italy for the week, visiting Lake Garda, Verona and Vicenza, staying in beautiful 5* hotels on route.  The Boscolo was our supposed highlight, the finale to our week of all weeks, the jewel on our crown and boy were we excited about getting their..., well, that feeling was removed within a very few minutes of walking through the door... This is clear a hotel which does not live up to the Boscolo name anymore and so they have sold it off the Marriott (which is not advertised anywhere!), and called it 'Autograph'.  Don't be fooled by the marketing here! The hotel is aged - you can see the jewel of the past - the custom fitted carpets to the rooms, the gold guilted furniture, etc, but it's all so dated, bashed, rusty, dirty...., old that there is no way onâ€¦
