Our first visit to Venice and I must say that this hotel made the trip for us. Located in a quiet area of Venice to get to St Marks square you can walk which I would recommend but takes around 45 mins. If you don’t fancy the walk the hotel offers a free boat service to and from the square and takes about 30 mins. The hotel itself is excellent, staff were very helpful and couldn’t do enough for us. I would certainly recommend this hotel
