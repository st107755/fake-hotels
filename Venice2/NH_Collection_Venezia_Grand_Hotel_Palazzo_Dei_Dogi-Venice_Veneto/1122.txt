I only stayed here one night, so I didn't take advantage of all the amenities, but I did enjoy myself. The first room we got had a horrid sewer smell, but we were promptly moved to the second floor.  Their excuse was low tide, but it was in the low 40's so I can imagine the smell should have been that bad, but then gain the city is sinking. The hotel is loated in a very quiet area which was nice.  The rooms are large for European standards and the bathroom was quite nice. Friendly staff and elegant d√©cor, but I don't foresee myself paying that much to stay there again.
