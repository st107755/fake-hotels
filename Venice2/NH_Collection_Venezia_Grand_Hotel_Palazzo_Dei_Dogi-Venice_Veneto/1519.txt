To start you hop on the vapareto (water bus)  at the airport and in less than 30 minutes you are at 'Orto' which is a 4 minute walk from the hotel- very convenient. The room we were initially allocated was on the small side but the staff happily switched us to a slightly larger room. The room was modern ventian style, new, clean and well maintained- twin sinks in the bathroom which was also nice and spacious. Breakfast was great and the service was very good. We had a few special requests and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. 30 minute walk from St. Marco but all through the beautiful bustling alliways- the hotel offers a complimentary boat servce to St. Marco but who needs it if you can walk! Hotel is right next to the Getto so if you are looking for a synagougeâ€¦
