The staff at this property is awesome- from bellman to Front Desk and breakfast, we truly enjoyed all of the associates we came in contact with. Phillip was exceptionally helpful and friendly!   The hotel was clean but in comparison to other properties as well as other Boscolo hotels, this one could use some upgrades. Our room was awfully tight and outdated; we also experienced an odd sewage smell frequently throughout our 4 days there.
