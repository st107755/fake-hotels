Such an amazing hotel, we were sad to leave so soon.   My husband took me to Venice for my 30th and as he wanted to make it special he chose this hotel. We had the best room in the 'house' and stayed in the presidential suite, I felt like royalty. The hotel is amazing and takes your breath away. From the grand entrance, the beautiful gardens, to the amazing food.   We loved every second of our stay in Venice. When we return, and we will, we will stay at here again.
