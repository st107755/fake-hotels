We just stayed 4 nights at this hotel and liked the fact that is away from the crowds.  It's a beautiful property and we loved our stay there.  However, I asked the concierge to investigate trains to Florence for me and he assured me that he would print out the information and get it to me but that never happened.  At another hotel in Italy we asked for the same information and got a printout immediately.
