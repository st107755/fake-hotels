Staying at this hotel was a very nice experience. The staff was very friendly. The location is a little bit of a hike from the Piazza San Marco, so it was tiring for my kids to do all the walking around. Beware of the Murano factory tour offered for free from the hotel. The trip is exclusive for the factory and they expect you to purchase something from their expensive gallery and gift shop. I do not recommend wasting the time doing so. Better to get a vaporetto fare to go to Murano.
