We should have heeded the warnings from others. As a platinum member redeeming lots of points here i would have expected better than the very basic room which, while had views over the water, internally looked very dated with damp patches on the wall and faded decor. Not the sort of elegantly glamorous aged decor that might go with such an old building, it just looked like it hadnt been renovated since the 70's.  The positivies  - the main lobby is beautiful and the boat ride takes you right to the heart of the venice (right in front of st marks square).  - Breakfast was also included with the points which was not the case on the Marriott resort island - Its in a great area which otherwise we would not have explored - its is more quite and feels more local. Just a few blocksâ€¦
