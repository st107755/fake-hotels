The hotel is located in a residential area, slightly away from St. Mark's Square (about 20 min walk away). I really liked this because it's nice to explore an area that is a bit more peaceful (Venice is often very crowded), where you can see both locals and tourists and walk through the quaint narrow streets. The staff at the hotel were very professional and eager to help with anything. We came on our honeymoon and they left a bottle of champagne and biscuits in our Rome which was a nice touch. The rooms are great too. They run a free shuttle to St. Mark's throughout the day (although we didn't use it, preferring to walk) and also a free shuttle and tour to Murano island (which we took advantage of). Definitely recommend.
