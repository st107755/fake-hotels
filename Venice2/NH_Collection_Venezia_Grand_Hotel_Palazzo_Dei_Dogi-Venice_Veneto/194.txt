I stayed just one night with a girlfriend on a sort of “Babymoon”.  I couldn’t have been more pleased with our room, the service, the unimaginable garden, the complimentary boat service, or the location.  After being in Venice once before and overwhelmed by crowds.m, this neighborhood changed my view for the better.  Great, local spots and room to breath.  Stop in Vino Vero for a glass of wine!
