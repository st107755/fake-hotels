Boscolo is an excellent location on the laguna side of the island.  It is away from the busy areas but not far from main attractions.  The 15-20 minute walk to St. Mark's is scenic but the hotel does offer a free shuttle service. The staff is friendly and professional and go out of their way to make your stay special.  The hotel has the largest private garden in Venice which is welcoming and relaxing. There is a complimentary shuttle to the glass factory on Maurano and the hotel recommended visiting Burano, which was worth it.
