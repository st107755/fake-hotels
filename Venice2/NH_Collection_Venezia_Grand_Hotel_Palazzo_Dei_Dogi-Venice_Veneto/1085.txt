Overall, we liked this property.  It is in a quiet neighborhood but not far from one of the main thoroughfares that will take you to the train station or to the main tourist areas.  We found everything was pretty much within a 20 minute walk (once we mastered the twists and turns).  They offered us a breakfast special for 25 euro's a person, but you can avoid that expense by simply doing what the Italians do and have a coffee and croissant at any of the many bakeries along the way.  We enjoyed sitting in the garden area at the end of the day.  We took one of the water buses from the main train station to the dock near the hotel and that worked out well.  On leaving, we walked to the main train station and other than crossing four bridges it is a simple 15-20 minute walk.  Skipâ€¦
