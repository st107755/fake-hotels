This hotel is beautiful and the staff extremely nice.  The hotel is prettier than the pictures can depict.  The garden, where breakfast is served, is so tranquil and relaxing.  Will definitely stay here again.   We loved that is was in a quiet neighborhood, but convenient to the Vaporetto service. The hotel boat provides free transportation to and from St. Mark's square
