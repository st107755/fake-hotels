The Boscolo is exceptionally well located and has all the great amenities you would expect.  The staff was friendly and courteous.   It was unexpected to see such attention to security.  I wasn't sure how to take that.  This hotel has a great deal of walk-by traffic and lots of guest that are eating/ drinking on the patio.  After watching them work I felt very comfortable they were very attentive and insured the hotel guests  weren't bothered by peddlers or potential thieves looking to grab a purse of some inattentive guest.
