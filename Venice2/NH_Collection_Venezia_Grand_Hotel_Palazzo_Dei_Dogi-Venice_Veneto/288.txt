We were here in November 2014 (I know the review says 2017...sorry about that)  I loved that this lovely hotel was off the 'beaten path' in Venice.  It is on a much quieter section in Cannaregio across from Murano.  The garden court yard is beautiful, the rooms are so large and elegantly decorated, the food was amazing!!!  It was not a problem to get water taxis either by walking to a central stop or by having the hotel get someone to get us at the hotel stop.
