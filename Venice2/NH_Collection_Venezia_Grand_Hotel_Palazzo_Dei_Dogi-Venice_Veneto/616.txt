I'm so glad we decided to stay here for our Venetian holiday. There was a glitch with the meet and greet water-taxi collection from the airport but he hotel were hugely apologetic and did not charge us for our eventual transfer. How a business deals with an issue is the true test. They passed because they are obviously passionate about their service.  There is a free water taxi to St Marks square and to Murano.  Breakfasts were really good, eaten outside.  Rooms really well appointed and have a good free wifi.   The best is that the hotel is away from the mad tourist areas. But it is in a beautiful neighbourhood and you feel that you are living among the Venetians.   Don't hesitate to stay at this hotel.
