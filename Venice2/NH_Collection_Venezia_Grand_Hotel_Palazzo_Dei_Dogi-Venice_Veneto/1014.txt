we stayed at the Boscolo for just one night....we were put on the first floor on the rear of the hotel over looking the water. Since the dock was directly outside, we had to keep the curtains down, so we could not enjoy the view. The room was large and nice, although a bit dated. The walls were very thin, and we could hear every word from the people amove us. The AC did not work well, which kept us up because of the tempurature. The locatio of the hotel was nice, being outside of the busy city. Getting to the airport the next morning was fast and easy since the boat/bus stops by only a few blocks away. the cost was 13euros per person to the airport.  Would I go back? Probbaly would like to try somewhere else...
