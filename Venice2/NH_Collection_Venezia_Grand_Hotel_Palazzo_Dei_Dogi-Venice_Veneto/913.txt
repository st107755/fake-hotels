We stayed at the boscolo for five nights, it was everything we hoped and more. The hotel is really delightful and we found it to be very comfortable it made a nice change to be away from the crowds but near enough to everything else. If you like walking you will love staying here nowhere is far away. Getting from the airport is very easy if you get the Orange line to the first stop Madona del Orto it's just a short flat walk to the hotel. We would stay here again if we came back to venice In fact we are returning in Mach. We can't wait.
