The front desk staff is very helpful.  Lobby is warm and inviting with so much charm.  We discovered the hotel through a Marriott rewards program, so the expectations were not of Four Seasons quality.  Pricing is very decent for the area, but wouldn't pass anywhere else.  The hotel is rated at 5 stars, but I'm not sure a 5 star rating is carrying the same reference these days.  I think it's great that's it's a bit far from the touristy stuff, for us that's a plus.  It's very easy to get around (unless it's pouring rain).  The room was decently sized, but the bathroom was in terrible need of a fix up. Shower was neither hot or cold, it was a gamble with every turn of the faucet.  At some point we just gave up and hoped for the best.  Bed was not very comfortable but it was clean.â€¦
