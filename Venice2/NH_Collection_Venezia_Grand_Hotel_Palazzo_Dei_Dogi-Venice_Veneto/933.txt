Kudos to Claudio and the team for outstanding service.  Alitalia lost our luggage prior to our cruise.  Claudio was on it continuously, assisting us to track it down.  All members of the team were courteous and accommodating, and always with a smile, be it wait staff, bartenders and cleaning crew.  The room was beautiful and clean with a large bathroom.  This location was easy to get to from the airport, take the Orange Vaporetto  and get off at the first stop (Orto).  Walk inland about a block and half and turn right at the canal.  Thank you all for a great stay, and we will definitely go back!
