We arrived here after an eventful overnight run from Paris on the Orient Express - we had a breakdown and had to wait for a replacement engine and had to make do with yet another meal on the train ! this meant that we arrived very much later than originally planned but the staff were waiting for us and check in was smooth and efficient. Although not prepoposing from the outside, the Reception area (which doubles as the breakfast room) is pure Venetian with chandeliers and Marble everywhere.  Breakfast choices are excellent and although we have not eaten in the hotel (yet), the menu looks interesting. There are also plenty of smaller 'bistro' type places within walking distance.    The Grand Hotel is a pleasant interlude before continuing on our way on Friday.
