We stayed at the Boscolo for 3 nights and it exceeded expectations. The location is fabulous because you get a feel for the "real" Venice- it's in a residential area. Super easy to walk to all the touristy stuff, but walking around the neighborhood and eating at the small local restaurants were the best memories. The hotel has a quaint private garden which is romantic and quite unexpected and rare for Venice. Nice way to unwide after dinner. Taking a stroll to secret alcoves and water features. The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant was above average. The staff made our petite caniche feel like a rockstar so that was a bonus!
