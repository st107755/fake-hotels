This hotel truly was a palace.  The most exquisite hotel I have ever dreamed of staying at.  Views that were breathtaking. This hotel looked more like Versailles palace than a hotel. Delicious restaurant,spa.  Venice is too beautiful for words and the location of BOscolo allows you to explore the city yet remain tranquil in the setting of a believe it or not, an English garden and the Venetian canal.  Private boats owned by BOscolo will take you where you want to go. The staff,all the staff were not to be topped.  Ivan, the con siege was wonderful.  Took the time to make sure we saw everything we set out for and more.  He personally would seek us out everyday to make sure we were happy.  The restaurant manager, bartender and waiter were excellent.  Our suite was delicious, decorâ€¦
