As a first time visitor to Venice, this hotel could not have been more perfect.  This fantastic hotel is in a quiet neighborhood of the city, on the opposite side of San Marco square.  Each day when we left the hotel the streets were wonderfully quiet an uncrowded.  Yet, only a 15 minute walk away there were dozens of wonderful restaurants and shops...and the dock for the water bus was only around the corner.  The service was fantastic from every associate.  Ivan the concierge gave us wonderful suggestions on restaurants and attractions, and the young man that work breakfast each morning was also terrific.  The hotel itself was like a palace with beautiful tapestries and art everywhere. Could not have been a better experience.
