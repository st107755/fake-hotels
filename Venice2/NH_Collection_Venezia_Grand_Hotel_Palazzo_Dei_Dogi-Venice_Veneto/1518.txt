We were there on air miles, so it was great, but when we found out that the room rate including breakfast and taxes was 300 euros per night, had I been paying, I would have been disappointed with the hotel, I certainly think that it was not 5 star. There is no wi-fi. There is a computer for use by the guests and the internet costs 20 euros per half hour and most sites are unobtainable, including the BBC. We initially had room 107, and when we complained about the smell, we were told that it was the canal. We were moved to 105, same side of the building, overlooking same canal, no smell. Avoid room 107!
