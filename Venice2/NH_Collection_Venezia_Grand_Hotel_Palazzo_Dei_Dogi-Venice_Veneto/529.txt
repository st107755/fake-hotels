This hotel is ideally situated for our first visit to Venice and we loved it! the wonderful Murano glass made the entrance spectacular and our room, though not spacious, had everything we could possible wish for and more. We thought the staff were exceptional in their discreet attention, and breakfast was a complete feast with something for every palate or nationality.

Great nibbles, but the drinks were already expensive and just 6 drinks with service charge ended up at £90! On the very big plus side, the free hotel water taxi is fantastic and reliable.
