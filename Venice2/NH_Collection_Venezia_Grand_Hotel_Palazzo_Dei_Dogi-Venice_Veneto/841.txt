Outstanding hotel in Venice! We recently stayed with our family at the Boscolo Autograph in Venice!  From the outstanding concierge service (thank you to Ivan) to the delicious breakfast, I cannot say enough about our wonderful experience here.  This is the area of Venice to stay in, extremely safe, close enough to superb restaurants, yet far enough away from the crowded St. Marks tourist attractions - of course everything accessible by water taxi. The gardens were spectacular - which I understand is a rarity in Venice.  We look forward to staying here again - five stars!
