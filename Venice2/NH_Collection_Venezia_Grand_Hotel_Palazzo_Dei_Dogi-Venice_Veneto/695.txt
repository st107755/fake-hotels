The hotel is located in a quiet part of the city away from all the crowds but also an easy walk to the main attractions. The spacious garden overlooking the lagoon is unique for the city and is worth the stay in itself. The complementary water taxi to St Mark's is fantastic. Breakfast was the best we have had in Europe. We especially enjoyed the smoke salmon every morning! The room is elegant and spacious. The bed was super-comfortable and I would like to buy one of their mattresses. The spa was just what we needed after miles of walking. I hope we can come back soon.
