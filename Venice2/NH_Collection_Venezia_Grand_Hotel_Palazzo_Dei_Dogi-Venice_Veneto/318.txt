There is no two ways about it, this hotel is past it's best. I know that it is an historic building, but that is no excuse for the fixtures and fittings to be 19th Century. Our first room was on the first floor and whilst dated looked OK. It was however very hot (28 degrees) and I couldn't get the air con to blow any cool air. When I contacted reception they advised that the air con had been switched off as it was cold weather now!! A supposed five star hotel switching the air con off to save money???? I'm sorry but when I stay in a five star hotel I expect to be able to choose whether to have a cool room or not, and 28 degrees is just uncomfortably warm for us. They could not change the room that night as they were fully booked, but that they would look at it the day after,â€¦
