This hotel is a gem, away from all of the crowds but near enough to walk to everything - and close to a water taxi and bus stop for easy transportation around Venice and the airport.  The hotel provides a free shuttle to the Murano Glass Factory - which we also visited and loved.  There is also a free shuttle to San Marco square - which can cost over 50 Euros for a private water taxi.  The hotel provided excellent service, food, and the best breakfast we had anywhere in Italy.  The biggest surprise is the gardens - which are not common in Venice - but were a big part of Dei Dogi.  Hoping to go back some day and spend more time here.
