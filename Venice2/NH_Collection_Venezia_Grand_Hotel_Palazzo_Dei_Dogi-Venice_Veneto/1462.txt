On our two week tour of Italy, this was our favorite hotel. We were in the back building and our room was practically in the water - what amazing views. The room was large and beautifully appointed with a chandelier and a rare (for Italy) king-sized bed. It was so quiet - actually, too quiet because both mornings we did not get a wake-up call! The public areas are ornate and worth a few pictures.
