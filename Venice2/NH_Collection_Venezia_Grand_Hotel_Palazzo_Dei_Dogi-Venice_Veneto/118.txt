We had such a wonderful stay here.  After a terrible experience at the Hotel Realto where they insisted we did not have a reservation, when it was later confirmed we did, wr booked this hotel quickly and realized how lucky we were to have the other reservation fall through.   The grounds are gorgeous and the hotel staff was wonderful to us.  From the moment we walked in, Ivan the concierge greeted us and made us feel at home. It is a must stay.   This part of Venice is only a 10 minute walk from the train station and a 20 minute walk from the Rialto and San Marco Square, yet feels worlds away from the crowds and noise.  There are restaurants, caf√©s and shopping yet it feels a little less stressful and touristy.
