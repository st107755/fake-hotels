Lots of great things about this hotel. Lovely staff. Tiny little spa with the best masseur. Lovely garden out the back. It's set in a quiet area of the Cannaregio district which we loved. Great places to eat and drink nearby but also not too far from other districts and the main touristy bits. We had breakfast included and there was a great selection. The fruit was absolutely delicious, the sweetest strawberries I've ever eaten. Our room overlooked the canal. It had a huge, comfortable bed. The bathroom was great and had some good toiletries so no need to take your own shampoo or conditioner (if you're travelling with hand luggage only!). I'd love to go back some day.
