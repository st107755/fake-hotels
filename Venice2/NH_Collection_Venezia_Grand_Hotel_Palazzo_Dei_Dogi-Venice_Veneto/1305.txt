From the moment we rounded the corner to the hotel we were very pleased!!  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Everyone spoke english so they really helped us get around and they even helped us learn their language.  Bane, Roberto and Edo were AMAZING!!!  We felt right at home. I had the delicious breakfast every morning and Bane was so accommodating and friendly.  Every night we stopped by the bar for a yummy glass of wine and the cozy bar.  Perfect to meet other hotel guests from all over the world.  On a rainy day we decided to stay at the hotel and enjoyed the relaxing steam, sauna and jacuzzi at the spa.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, we stopped outside into the magical garden!!! Beautiful walk to the water taxi every day! I cannot explain how trulyâ€¦
