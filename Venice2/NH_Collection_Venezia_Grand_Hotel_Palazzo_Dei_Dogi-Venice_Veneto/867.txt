Stayed in a spacious beautiful room that felt like we were in a castle. The entry doors were of heavy wood and the ceilings  were 15-16 feet high with a beautiful chandelier.  The location was a 30 minute walk or a complimentary boat shuttle ride from the hotel.  From the airport you may reach the hotel by boat shuttle and then a short 5 minute walk to the hotel.  The front of the hotel is located on the canal and the back of the hotel has a beautiful garden leading out to the open Laguna Veneta the main water way to St Marks Square. The surrounding area has great restaurants and a nice walk to the main attractions of Venice.  Service was good and the breakfast area off the lobby is beautiful.  Loved this hotel and would recommend.
