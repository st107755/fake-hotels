This was our first trip to Venice and the Boscolo helped make our experience so memorable. We enjoyed being away from the tourist hotbed, and the complimentary water taxi to St. Marks was great added value. The service was impeccable- truly we felt the folks at the front desk would have done anything for us! Might have been the best service we've ever had!!! The bar staff should also be recognized (see pic of set up for a late evening snack - over the top). The breakfast was the best we had over the course of four hotels in Italy especially the choice of a hot dish. We stayed in one of the two courtyard rooms in the garden and felt like we were at a quaint Inn or B&B. We will recommend this hotel to anyone.
