We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It is in possibly the quietest part of Venice, and yet probably as near to the airport and railway as you could wish for. Opening our room window and we could not hear a thing....nothing ! The garden is quite special as well, lots of little places to hide away in !  The staff were all very knowledgeable and so very helpful. One of them, Phillip, recommended a couple of restaurants, that we would never have found, and they were excellent. Two other staff, I hope I remember their names correctly as Bade and Edo , deserve a mention too as they genuinely seem to enjoy their work. We were only there for 4 nights, but felt so at home.
