We really enjoyed our stay. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Breakfast was wonderful, the staff friendly and helpful...Ivan, the concierge was awesome! Go wherever he tell you to go! You will not be disappointed! But really, I would definitely go back just for Maria, at their spa! She was friendly and amazing! I tried their detox package and wish I was staying another day to go back for a massage! See you next time Maria! ðŸ’žðŸ’žðŸ’ž
