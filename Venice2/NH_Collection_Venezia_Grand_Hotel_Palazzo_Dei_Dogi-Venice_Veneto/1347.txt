This is a beautiful property in a quiet part of town. The staff is helpful and friendly, and all speak English. Most guests seem to be Americans. The room was nice and the food was good. However, if you are counting on having internet access here, you will be severely disappointed. Their WiFi is clearly antiquated and unreliable. If you do get a connection, it will soon drop and leave you to start over, and over, and over. The staff is aware of how poor it is but will not be open about it, perhaps restrained by higher management. I finally went to an internet shop to connect and get email. What a pity that such a beautiful hotel falls so short on a service of this importance.
