We have been to Venice several times but this was our first visit to this hotel.  It was easily accessible by Alilaguna boat from the airport (first stop on orange line) and the neighborhood is residential, so very quiet.  Easy to reach a bit more commercial area for restaurants and shops that were way more polite and welcoming than the ones that are close to St. Marks.  We had a deluxe garden room (there are only 2) which opened onto the rose garden which was in full bloom!  The garden was exquisite and the staff of the hotel were excellent.  My husband thought the bed was too hard but I found it ok.  The heat had been shut off because, hey, its May, and supposed to be hot!  But it was cold so they brought us a portable heater.  It raised the temperature just enough! Inâ€¦
