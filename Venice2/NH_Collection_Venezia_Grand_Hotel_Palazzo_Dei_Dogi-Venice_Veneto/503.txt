I stayed at the Boscolo Venezia for three nights last weekend.  I arrived via waterbus very early in the morning, and the warm welcome by the staff was wonderful.  The manager, Barbara, the front desk agent, Georgia, and the rest of the employees greeted me warmly, and made me feel welcome at their gorgeous 17th century property.  I was put in a junior suite with a view of the lovely rear gardens.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  The showers were warm with good water pressure.  The decor was nice, and I was overall impressed.  I only ate in the hotel for breakfast, and the buffet was full of tasty side items, while the menu items were fine.  The breakfast staff alternated between warm and serviceable, but I never waited for anything.  The truly wonderful part of my stayâ€¦
