A charming hotel in the grandest of styles. Situated in the neighbourhood of Cannaregio, it feels like you are living with real Venetians (as opposed to only tourists). There will of course be tourists...this is Venice...but much less than in San Marco. (The hotel offers a private water shuttle at appointed times to San Marco if you miss the crowds.)  The hotel itself is stunning, with a wonderful back garden that has been written about a hundred times here on TripAdvisor. It's lovely, as is the buffet breakfast (with cooked options) and even the coffee supplied in the rooms is first rate. We had Acqua di Parma bath amenities in our junior suite- which was a room well worth upgrading to if you can. Wifi was fast, and the staff were awesome.  We had an opportunity to interactâ€¦
