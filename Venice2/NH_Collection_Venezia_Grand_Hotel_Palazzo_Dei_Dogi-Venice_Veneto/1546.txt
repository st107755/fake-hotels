We stayed at the hotel on the second weekend of September. The staff was really not friendly especially the people at the reception.   The room we stayed in was very small and we had to ask for a connected bed.   The breakfast was very poor.  The hotel itself is very beautiful however we expected much more for a 300 euro a night hotel.
