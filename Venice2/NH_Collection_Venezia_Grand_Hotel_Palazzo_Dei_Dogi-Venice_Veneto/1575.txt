Over priced and under-delivered.  I could go on for pages, but the quick of it is...  Dei Dogi staff didn't care enough to make the bed, clean the unit.  They charged over $1,000/day for a double room when we were suppose to get a large suite.  The staff was suppose to provide access to a business center with internet connection, but this was not available.  We called the week before the trip and they lied to us about one thing after another.  They are dishonest, over priced and most of all arogent.  Terrible location....terrible service..they ruined our trip to Venice.
