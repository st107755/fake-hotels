WOW!! This hotel is breathtaking.  The grounds are charming, similar to a secret garden.  The rooms have amazing wooden beams, and the windows were gorgeous and ornate. We especially loved the large, deep tub!  The lobby is very eye catching, with chandeliers from Murano ❤️ We took advantage of the free boat shuttle to Murano and to San Marco! Great location, we even walked to San Marco and back from the hotel one day.  I would recommend anyone to stay here as it was the perfect end to our Italy trip 🇮🇹 They took great care of us!
