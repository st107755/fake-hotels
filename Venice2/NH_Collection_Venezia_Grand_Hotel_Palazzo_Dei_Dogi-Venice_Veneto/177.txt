My wife and stayed here for our recent visit to Venice. We loved the fact that you can get her from the airport using the alo Laguna shuttle. It is really only a very short five minute walk to the hotel from the shuttle stop. This makes access to the hotel very convenient. we walked all over the city from the hotel and it was very centrally located and only a short walk to almost anywhere in the main part of Venice. We had a room on the back of the building between the garden in the main Hotel. The room was lovely soundproofing could have been a little bit better though. We thought that the service was excellent and enjoyed the beautiful breakfast in the morning before heading out. I would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful Hotel
