I get it, it's Venice, it's not easy to update, but little things should be fixed line the big crack in our sink and the shower door that didn't shut. Beds were comfortable enough but would've expected more for the price. Service was top notch. Definitely use the complimentary boat trips to Murano and St Marks Square. So beautiful to see the city that way and the boats are meticulously maintained.
