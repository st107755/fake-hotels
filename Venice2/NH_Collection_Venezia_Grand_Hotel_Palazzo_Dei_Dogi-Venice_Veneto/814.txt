An absolutely beautiful property, over 400 years old. Apparently this property was the French Embassy when Venice was its own country - the A/C hasn't been repaired since the French retreated. The rooms are large and the furniture and fixtures are top notch. The hidden garden in the middle is unique. As a Marriott Rewards Gold member I'm told I get free breakfast for 2, quite a value since it would normally cost â‚¬35 each. The military discount is substantial. Overall I'm very happy to be here.
