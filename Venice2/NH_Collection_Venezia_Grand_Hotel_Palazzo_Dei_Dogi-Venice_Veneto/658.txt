The hotel, a former palazzo,  is impressive from the moment you step off the water taxi on the canal that fronts the hotel and into the hotel itself.  The lobby has elegant large Murano glass chandeliers with exquisitely upholstered furniture and beautiful wooden accents. There is a warm intimate bar, indoor restaurant and outdoor tented area for dining as well. A fine and full buffet is available for breakfast. The garden is large, manicured and runs the length of the hotel property to its lagoon dock entrance. The standard king room is tastefully decorated and understated with large bathroom. The staff was extremely helpful and customer focused, provided tickets to avoid lines at the local attractions. It offers complimentary water taxi to and from St Marks Square each day,â€¦
