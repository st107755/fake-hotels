This hotel is located on the northern side of Venice.  It is away from the tourist crowds.  It has one of the largest private gardens in Venice.  The Lobby was beautifully decorated with marble and huge Venetian Glass Chandeliers.  Our room was 4th floor with idyllic terracotta rooftop and church steeple views.   Staff was extremely helpful with anything we needed.  They recommended local dining that was amazing.  Nice lounge areas inside and out.  This hotel has frontage on small canal and on the lagoon.  They offer water taxi service several times a to and from St. Marc square.  5 star service all around.
