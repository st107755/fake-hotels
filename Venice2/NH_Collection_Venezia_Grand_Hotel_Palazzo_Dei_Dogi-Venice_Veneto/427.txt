When you leave the waterbus you walk down two streets to get to the Boscolo, which is an historic and very comfortable hotel. The garden is amazing with features and sculptures not to be missed. We were there for Masquerade which added colour and excitement, the costumes were fantastic and they were happy to let you take photos. The food at the hotel was good and the concierge service first rate.
