Very beautiful property located in the quiet side of Venice. Fortunately it is also not too far away from all the main attractions. Service is very prompt, very classy ambience and the view is spectacular. Due to may status I was also upgraded to the para room which is gorgeous. The breakfast buffet spread is limited, but with high quality. The ala carte main dish selection are very nice and delicious too. They also provide complementary tour to the Murano glass tour. This is definitely worth going. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Highly recommended!!! :)
