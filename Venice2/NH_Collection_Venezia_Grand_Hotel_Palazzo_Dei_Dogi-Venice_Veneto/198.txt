Located in a quite area of Venice (30 minutes or so walking from St. Marks Square) situated by a canal in front and the lagoon behind.  Beautiful gardens are located on the property.  Delicious restaurants nearby.  If you want a place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist area, this is it.  Only disappoint was the lack of availability to charging phones/cameras, etc.....(220/110 ) When we are back in Venice,we would stay here again
