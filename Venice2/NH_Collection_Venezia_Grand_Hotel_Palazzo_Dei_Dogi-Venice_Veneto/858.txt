My husband and I stayed here on our recent trip to Venice.  We were so pleased with the location.  It's easy enough to walk into all the main areas of Venice but you get a nice break from all the tourists every evening.  Our room was through the courtyard and facing the water and was just wonderful.  We loved everything about our stay!
