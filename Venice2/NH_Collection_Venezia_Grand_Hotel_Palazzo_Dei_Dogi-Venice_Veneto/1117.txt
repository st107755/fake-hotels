I stayed at this hotel as part of my tour with Globus.  We were originally staying on the mainland, however we were upgraded and this is the hotel we found ourselves at. I was on my own and my room was on the first floor.  A king size bed and a cute little study with a large bathroom.   The room was gorgeous as was the rest of the hotel.  The breakfast was very nice with high quality food on offer. A very lovely stay and I would definitely recommend staying here.  It would be a perfect place for a romantic escape.  Away from the hustle and bustle of the main areas, but only a short taxi ride and you're there.  You could also easily walk around the area to find somewhere to eat as well.  A great hotel and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
