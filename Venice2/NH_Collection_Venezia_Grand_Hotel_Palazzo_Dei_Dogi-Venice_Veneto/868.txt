We checked out of the Boscolo Venezia this today and wanted to share the wonderful experience we had. Great location a bit off the beaten path so it's quiet and intimate in residential Cannegerio with easy and quick access to anywhere in Venice. Grand setting. Beautiful room. We were in 218 which did not have a view but had all the splendor of the remarkable building. Ivan the concierge is a Venice expert. Our breakfast experience was so great. I can't recall the name of the women who manages the front...beautiful smile and long dark hair...she along with Lindy and Cristina were so thoughtful and helpful. Martina at the front desk was super helpful and so welcoming. We loved our stay at BV and will return. Thank you to the great staff.
