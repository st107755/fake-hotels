A really good hotel off the beaten track and away from the tourist path. However you can get the Alilaguna boat from the airport to a pier no more 3 minutes walk to the hotel. St Marks square is about a 25 minute stroll or there's a free motorboat from the hotel. The rooms are majestical Italian splendour with the hotel being decorated with incredible style. Staff were excellent all round. It's not cheap but what is in Venice?
