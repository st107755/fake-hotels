At the first moment the hotel looks good at the reception. Later when you go to your room you see how bad it really is. Dirty and worn out curtains (pic attached) not washed for years full of dirt and dust. Towels (pic attached) absolutely below any expected level, totally worn out. Very limited breakfast with NO fresh vegetables! The same stuff every day. Dont mention omlet at breakfast you might get it after 30 min 0 r...never. Terrible, lazy staff that does not collect used plates and glasses until you really finish (pic attached). If you plan to eat anything (which I do NOT recommend) order it at least one day earlier. Basically a shame for Marriott to include such miserable hotel in their offer. Better stay away!
