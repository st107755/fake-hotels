The BV is a real gem - and an ideal one for a trip to Venice. It's far enough out of the 'maddening crowds' so that you can retreat to a peaceful haven but when you want some action it's only 15 minutes from the Rialto Bridge. There are many lovely touches - the hotel's launch to/from St Mark's Square four times a day being just one. The staff are very helpful and will sort anything out for you.  It's not the cheapest - but it is worth the cost. We opted not to have the inhouse breakfast (at 70 euros for two per day!) but walked to the Fondamente De Misericordia an dshred breakfast with the locals for 7 euros instead - much nicer by far.  Even though it's 5 star there are still mosquitos - so bring spray and anti-histamine if you react to these things - they have a nasty bite!â€¦
