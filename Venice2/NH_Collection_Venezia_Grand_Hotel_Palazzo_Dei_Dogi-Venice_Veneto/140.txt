Great hotel with amazing customer service. Especially, the manager named TAYLAN, was very kind and helpful! TAYLAN made our days at the hotel even more greater. The breakfast was very nice with variety of options and you also get free water taxi to Piazza SAN Marco at Venice. We will definetly recommend this hotel anyone.
