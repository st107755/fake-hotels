This new addition to the AC/Marriott group is wonderful.  The location "really is" just an easy 3 minute walk from the water taxi stop. It was fairly simple walking to all the tourist areas, and more importantly- not getting lost. The Boscolo is an old Palace, not only charming but a piece of Venice itself. The Ventian glass is spectacular in the common areas as well as in the guest rooms. The entire staff was incredibly kind and helpful with every detail. Roman, the food and beverage Manager, introduced us to a few new wines that made our drinking and dinning experiences unforgettable. Can't wait to go back!
