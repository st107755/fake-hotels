The Hotel claims to be a 5star hotel, however the room I stayed in was tiny! Almost fell over my bed when entered the room. The hallway was so nosy, that I woke up every-time somebody came to the floor and entered his room. But the most disappointing thing was the extremely poor breakfast buffet, in a dark room with little daylight. Even though it was included in the fee, I preferred to go to a cozy Venetian bar and enjoy a nice coffee with cappuccino somewhere near the canals.
