So we just stayed here and for EVERYTHING it was a great hotel.  Great staff, beautiful interior, beautiful exterior, beautiful garden, bar,decor...... I read the reviews about the AC and thought since I was booking for September it would not be bad.  But it was horrible, and you don't want to open your windows because they are big openings...  the air is hot and still.  Can sure make the trip miserable.    The next time, I would stay in one of the hotels closer to St. Marks.  I saw the Aqua Palace on here and then it was booked but I went in and it was really nice.
