The hotel is large and spacious with a beautiful hotel and a terrace/pier overlooking the sea. Amazing and a true hidden gem. However, the best part is the amazing staff with great teamwork and positive attitudes. My whole experience was a delight. The turn down service was fantastic - they will come back later if you are not available when they are around. Outstanding commitment to guests and friendly staff.
