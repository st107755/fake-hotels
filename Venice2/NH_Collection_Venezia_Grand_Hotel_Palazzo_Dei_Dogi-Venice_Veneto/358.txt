The location is very good- it's out away from the tourist areas, but it's an easy walk or boat-bus ride from almost anywhere in Venice. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, but when we came back later in the day, one of the ladies at the front desk even walked us to our room! That's never happened to me in any hotels that I've stayed in, including all of the other Marriott hotels! The hotel has a classic feel to it, with reds, browns, and golds. The bathroom has a marble floor, which could very well be real marble.  We got a price that included the buffet breakfast. It includes pastries, fruit, cereal, and best of all, 1 entree from the regular menu. On the first day, I got an omelette and my wife got the grilled chicken. On the other hand, this means I couldn't have secondsâ€¦
