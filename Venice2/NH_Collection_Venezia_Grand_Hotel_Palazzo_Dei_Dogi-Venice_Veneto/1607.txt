Stayed in this hotel for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon. What can we say, it was excellent. Private and out of the way of the madness that is Venice in August. A Vaperetto stop just beside the hotel and the hotel provided a free private water taxi to and from the Rialto Bridge ever hour. Room was spacious with beamed ceilings and hand painted headboard. Breakfast was outside under a canopy listening to the water feature in their private garden. Impressive lobby with excellent staff, if returning to Venice this hotel would be a definite stop.
