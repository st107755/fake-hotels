The Boscolo is as charming as it is beautiful.  The d√©cor is grand, the chandeliers are stunning and the walls and balconies are so Venetian.  We had 3 bedrooms, all were different, unique and each had their own individual appeal.  In addition, the Boscolo Hotel staff was warm and hospitable.   Everyone made our stay comfortable and memorable as possible.  Georgia, Pablo on reception and Edo in the bar were the 3 main people we dealt with and on every occasion they were helpful, engaging and a joy to meet.  We would recommend this hotel to family and friends and would hope to return one day.  The Hotel is everything Venetian, memorable, beautiful, and stylish and has a touch of class as well as history.
