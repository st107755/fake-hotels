We stayed at this Marriott property in April, 2018 when it was called the Boscola Venezia.  The facility was shabby at best and the staff were consistently unacceptable.  This was the poorest excuse for a five star hotel we experienced in our otherwise successful 19 day, four city visit to Italy.  I doubt they could have totally refurbished the interior and hired a completely new staff in less than three months.  A new name will not change the poor quality of stay you will probably experience.
