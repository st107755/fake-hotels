Although a little away from the main tourist beats of Venice, and about a 35 minute walk to St Mark's Square (although the hotel runs a shuttle water taxi to and from the square throughout the day on a set timetable) but while its position for some might be a concern, you should not think twice given just how wonderful this hotle really is.  It is simply wonderful to sit down in the morning for a sumptuous breakfast (depending on your booking this may be included in the price as ours was)  and look out with surprise at of one of the city's largest private gardens, very much like a lovely English garden, It is simply beautiful with just the minor irritation of a few pigeons who like to feast on the remaining spoils although the staff are on them like a shot-- pity it wasn'tâ€¦
