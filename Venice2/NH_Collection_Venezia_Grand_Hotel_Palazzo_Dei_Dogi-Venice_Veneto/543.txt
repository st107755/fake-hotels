My husband booked this hotel as part of my 50th Birthday celebrations. We stayed 3 nights in this quiet location away from the hustle and bustle. All the staff are warm, friendly and very helpful. Comfortable rooms and beautiful surroundings. Great shuttle service to St. Marks Square. Good choice for breakfast and superb bar service. Wonderful guest engagement. Thank you for a memorable stay.
