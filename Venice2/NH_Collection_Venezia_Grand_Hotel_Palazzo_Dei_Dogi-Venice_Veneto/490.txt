Without realising it we booked a weekend to Venice during the Carnavale but this hotel is just far enough away from the main tourist area to be a haven of peace and quiet. Classic old style rooms and reception. There are local restaurants a couple of canals away that are excellent, also directed by Philip at Reception to a couple of his recommendations...very good. Great holiday in a beautiful place.
