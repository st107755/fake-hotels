Stayed here back in may but only now had time to write a review. Stayed here because we are marriott gold members. Would probably stay here again but definately not if we had to pay rack rates. While the main areas are very nice as others have written it is not a 5 star hotel. Our room was in a separate building past the gardens (think it used to be the barn or stables at some point). The room was quaint but certainly not luxurious. Being gold members we normally get upgraded. I'm assuming this time we did not. Service was not up to marriott standards and certainly not 5 star. we discovered we had ants in our room so called to complain. Had to call a second time before anything done about it. Looked they they sprinkled ant stuff outside our room but by next day we had MORE ants!â€¦
