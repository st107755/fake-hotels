There is a fine Hotel in the Dell'Orto section of Venice called the Boscolo (Boscolohotels.com). We went there for a meal on 18th July. My partner had a Salmon salad with iced vegetables and I had baby squid. There was just a glass of fine white wine each. The service was good,food was excellent and the chef was thanked for such tasty and well presented dishes. The real bonus was the dessert. Tiramisu is very common in Italy and the quality can vary. This one deserved a photograph! It included various berries at the bottom, middle and top. It was the best Tiramisu that I have tasted. I will be raving about this meal for a long time! The hotel looked excellent as well but we did not stay there so there is no review. Maybe next trip to Venice?
