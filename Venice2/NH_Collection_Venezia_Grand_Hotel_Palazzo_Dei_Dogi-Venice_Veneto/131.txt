An amazing property, tucked away in one of Venice's more authentic "sestiere." The house staff is welcoming, our room overlooked a canal, and Ivan (the concierge) recommended delicious restaurants and activities.  Arriving by boat is an experience to remember, and the free shuttle's are a great amenity.  The daily breakfast is also worth it, and will not disappoint.
