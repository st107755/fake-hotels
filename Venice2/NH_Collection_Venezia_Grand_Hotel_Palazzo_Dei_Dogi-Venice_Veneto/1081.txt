Just got back from Boscolo and had a great long weekend. The palazzo and gardens are beautiful and staff is great. The hotel is about as far from San Marco as you can get but we took the free Motoscafi (sign up at the desk early) and enjoyed the walks. Can definitely recommend if you like peace and quiet -
