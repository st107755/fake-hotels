So we got a little lost trying to find it but that is because we decided to find it on our own!!  But we found it and easily could have taken a water taxi:)  We had a jr suite overlooking the canal and it was beautiful!!  It is located in a more residential area which we LOVED.  It is easy to walk everywhere in Venice and I can't imagine staying over by the grand canal with all the tourists.  All of the places we ate near the hotel were amazing.  (And we arrived at noon, they let us check in early which was great!!)
