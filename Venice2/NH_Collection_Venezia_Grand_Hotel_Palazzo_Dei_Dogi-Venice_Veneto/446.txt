The hotel is located at the Rizzo-Patarol Palace, it is a beautiful 16th-century building and it takes you back to Venetian history. The hotel is luxury decorated, full of paintings and beautiful crystal chandeliers. We got an upgrade to a luxury suite and it was very comfortable. The service was very good, and the breakfast was awesome. It was a little far away from Piazza San Marco, but its worth. Very recomendable!
