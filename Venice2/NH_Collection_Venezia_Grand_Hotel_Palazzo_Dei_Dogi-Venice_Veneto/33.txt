My mom and I stayed at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi during a long weekend in November. The hotel was very comfortable and the staff excellent. The hotel is in an old palazzo and that adds to the experience of being in Venice. Don't expect an ultra modern hotel. The hotel also offers transportation to Piazza San Marco which is a great offering. It is a great, free way to see Venice from the water. The hotel is about a 25 minute walk from Piazza San Marco in the Cannaregio neighborhood. I loved being in a more residential and non touristy area of the city.
