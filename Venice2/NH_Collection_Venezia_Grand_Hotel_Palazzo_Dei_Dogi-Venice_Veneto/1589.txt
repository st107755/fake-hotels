We were upgraded to a jr suite facing the canal. This hotel is incredible. It is in a quiet area of town which is what we wanted. It is near the public boat stop however this hotel had it's own boat and a schedule to take it's guests to and from St. Marks Square. Stay away from the water taxi's they are expensive. This boat service was complimentary of the hotel but of course had limited hours. You could walk to the Rialto bridge in 15 minutes and to St. Marks  Square in 25.... The hotel has a great garden restaurant where they had complimentary breakfast.... Great choice if you want peace and quiet away from all the tourists and noise in a 5 star luxury hotel.
