This was our first trip to Venice and we wanted to be close to the main attractions, but not In a hotel on the main street. The Boscolo was perfect! We loved the quaint local feel, yet were a short walk to the main canal, restaurants and attractions.  The gardens were very nice and we liked the boat/water access from both the front and back of the hotel.
