We had had just a lunch in this splendid old hotel in a very quiet part of Venice. The food was beautifully presented and the staff were very helpful and informative about the history of what had been a former Doge residence and French Embassy. Quite expensive but everywhere is in Venice! It is particularly the alcoholic drinks that rack up a bill.
