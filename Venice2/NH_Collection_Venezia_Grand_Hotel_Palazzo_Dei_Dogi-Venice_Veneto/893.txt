If you're looking for the authentic or romantic Venice experience, this hotel is hands down the perfect choice. Venetian glass chandeliers and antique furnishings combined with modern amenities capture all the charm that Venice has to offer. I was a bit skeptical about the location prior to my arrival, however I was really glad with the outcome. Anyone who has visited Venice knows that the area near St. Mark is teeming with (often trashy) tourists and is a bit commercialized. Boscolo however boasts a private garden, boutique restaurants nearby, and an amazing staff that adds a very personal touch.                                                                                       Highly recommended
