Our group of 4 couples stayed here the end of August prior to our cruise.  This hotel is in a perfect quiet area away from all the crowds but still close enough to walk to the sites.  We loved strolling the neighborhood at night, it just comes alive with little places to eat.  The staff were all so helpful and friendly.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and was perfect before the start of our busy days.  There is an outside sitting area to the back of the hotel.  We loved sitting back there and enjoying the beautiful view. The rooms were all clean, beds were comfortable, hotel is beautiful inside, what more could you ask for?! We will definitely stay here during a future visit.
