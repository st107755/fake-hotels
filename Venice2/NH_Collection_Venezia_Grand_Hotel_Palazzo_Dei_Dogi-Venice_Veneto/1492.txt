We recently stayed at Hotel Dei Dogi which is meant to be a five star hotel and were not very satisfied with it. After booking through expedia we thought breakfast was included as it specified the hotel as a bed and breakfast. However, on arrival we were told this was not the case and found out the prices for food in the hotel was extremely overpriced. A couple of the male receptionists were very nice and friendly and made every effort to make our trip enjoyable, and overall I would say without them the hotel would be a very uninviting place to stay. Other staff were not bothered and quite rude at times like when our room door was knocked on four times by the maid and wouldn't take no for the answer. Both the sauna and the jacuzzi were not working and the shower was cold.â€¦
