we stayed a nite after  being on the disney cruise this july 2014, a truly wonderful experience, all staff gracious , helpful.. being from the US it was a great experience in venice... close to all , but truly a secret garden and a wonderful breakfast.. away from hustle bustle.. i would stay here again
