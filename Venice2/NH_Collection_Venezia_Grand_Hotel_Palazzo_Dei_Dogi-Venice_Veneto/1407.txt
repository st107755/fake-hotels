Wonderful location and charming hotel in Venice.  Excellent breakfast served outdoors in beautiful garden.  Hotel was old world with local glass lighting.   We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the canal.  Hotel offered limited transport to St Marks Square.  The first stop on the Aliluguna is for this hotel and the last pickup back to the airport, very convenient.  The area is easy to navigate and with a map you can fo anywhere.   We had dinner at the restaurant one night celebrating 49th anniversary.  Because the dining room was being used by a group, the maitre d served us in the salon; a very special and memorable occasion .  We were in Venice when the earthquake struck close by, this is where the swing and sway comes from.   Too, we have been invited out to dinner moreâ€¦
