This a wonderful high end Marriott hotel in Venice.  It is situated in a location away from the high tourist attractions and traffic but within walking distance to all.  This hotel has such history, high ceilings wonderful art. It was at one point an embassy. Behind the hotel court yard is a spectacular garden which is very private. We did not use the spa but those who did loved it.  Breakfast is served on the covered patio behind the lobby. The service was good but the pigeons a pest!! And somewhat out of control.  The staff is very professional and welcoming. Unfortunately our stay was too short but next trip!
