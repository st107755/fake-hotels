We recently stayed at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi.  The service was wonderful and the hotel was stunning! When they found out we were celebrating our anniversary, they sent a bottle of prosecco to our room.  A delicious breakfast was served every morning on the patio next to their gardens.  It was a great way to start the day.
