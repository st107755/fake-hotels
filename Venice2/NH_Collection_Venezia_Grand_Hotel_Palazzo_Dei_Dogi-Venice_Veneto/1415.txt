Picked this hotel because it is associated with Marriott.  Found the staff, especially the concierge, to be very helpful.  Sold us tickets to see Interpreti Venezini perform "The Four Seasons" by Vivaldi at Chiesa San Vidal.  Amazing!!!!  It was our favorite part of our trip to Venice.  Also set us up for a free shuttle by the glass people to Murano to see glass making.  Very interesting as well.  They will only shuttle you back to St Marks though-FYI.  Beds very comfortable and rooms clean.  Breakfast the best in Italy that we had-finally some fruit!  Especially good on Sunday when you can order other than the buffet.  Loved the free shuttle boat to and from St Marks.  Way better than Gondola ride.   Don't miss the Hard Rock Cafe :) -Smallest in the world, but the  staff is soâ€¦
