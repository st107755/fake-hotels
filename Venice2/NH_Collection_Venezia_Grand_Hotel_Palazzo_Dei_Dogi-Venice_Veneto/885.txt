we booked a four night stay at this hotel and we couldn't have chose a more lovely pace to stay.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, the staff couldn't do enough for us.  Sure we were a little off the beaten track, but the hotel had a free taxi service to San Marco as well as to Burano. To be honest the walk to and from San Marco wasn't too difficult and, bearing in mind how much food and drink we consumed, it probably did us the power of good.  The restaurant at the hotel was truly amazing and Bane deserves a very special mention for his attention to detail and his absolutely lovely personality.  Thanks must also go to the lovely barman who always had a smile for us!  All in all, we had a fantastic stay here and can't wait to go back again!
