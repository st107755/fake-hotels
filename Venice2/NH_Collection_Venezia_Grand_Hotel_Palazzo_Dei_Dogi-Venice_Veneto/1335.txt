My wife & I stayed at the Hotel Boscolo in Venice last April while traveling through Europe. We used Marriott rewards points and were originally going to stay at a hotel by the airport. Fortunately, we decided instead to stay in Venice, closer to many points of interest. The accommodations were fantastic, staff very courteous & helpful, and the morning breakfast a delight. Shortly after checking in, we met the hotel manager who arranged an upgrade to a junior suite. The hotel's location is particularly advantageous, within walking distance to just about anywhere in Venice or a complimentary water taxi ride to San Marcos Square. One cautionary note - dinner at the hotel was good, but pricey. You can eat quite well very inexpensively in Venice. Overall, we both highly recommendâ€¦
