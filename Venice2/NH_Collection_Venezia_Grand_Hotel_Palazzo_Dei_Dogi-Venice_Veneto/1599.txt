What a nice hotel with an even nicer staff! We took the water taxi from the hotel (you can buy a round trip ticket at the airport at a discount) and arrived late in the evening. I would suggest the water taxi, the day we were there, 03/24-25/04, there was a national public transportation strike and only water taxis available. Anything can happen...  The room is gorgeous (upgraded to superior) and the biggest we had while in Europe for the week. The only con about this hotel is that their king size bed is two twins pushed together with their own twin sheets on each one. The food and drink is very expensive, but we spent most of the day out. We did get a complimentary dinner at their restaurant which was one of the worst meals... definitely not worth the money. Venice isâ€¦
