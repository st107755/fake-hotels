Venice had been at the top of my bucket list for some time and I was not disappointed after a five day stay.      My husband and I spent our 45th wedding anniversary at Boscolo Venezia.  We were surprised with a bottle of Prosecco from the management.   The big breakfast was a luxury each morning in the beautiful garden area and prepared us for our daily walking throughout the city.     The entire staff, especially Marianna, were so kind and thoughtful.  We loved staying in a residential area away from the crowds and found several wonderful neighborhood restaurants.   I would highly recommend the Boscolo Venezia and would definitely go back.
