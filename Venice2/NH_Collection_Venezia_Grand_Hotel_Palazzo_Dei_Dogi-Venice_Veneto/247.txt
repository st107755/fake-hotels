My husband and I loved our stay at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi.  The reception area is stunning and breakfast was great.  The location is a bit far from the popular spots, BUT they have a complimentary boat taxi at certain times that takes you to and from St. Mark's square which is so fun. We loved that. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
