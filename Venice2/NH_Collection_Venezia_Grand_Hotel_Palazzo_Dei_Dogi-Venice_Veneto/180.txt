This hotel has everything you could ask for, old world charm of Venice, you can have a canal view or lagoon view, amazing garden (not much greenery in Venice), food is very good, and the staff goes out of there way to make sure you feel like a guest and enjoy your stay.  We had a room on the second floor on the lagoon side of the hotel.  It was so nice to wake up and see the water each morning.  We have dinner their the first night and it was delicious.  We didn't get breakfast included in our stay because we like to try different place, when we did have breakfast at the hotel a couple of time the select was very good as was the quality of the food.  What really made out stay amazing was working with Ivan Romanello, he is the concierge at the hotel, he recommended places to seeâ€¦
