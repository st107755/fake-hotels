If you want a place that is off the beaten path, quiet, with beauty all around it, this is the place.  There is a large green space behind the hotel (that is owned by the hotel) that is amazing - green grass, beautiful vegetation, flowers/roses, etc.  Service was excellent at the hotel including the concierge.
