The hotel photos show a grand sparkling hotel, but in reality itâ€™s an old dirty hotel in need of renovation.  As a platinum elite member I booked two rooms and there was no upgrade, instead we were given too small old rooms when there are much nicer floors at the top.  The bathroom was uncomfortable and the furniture and decor was not worthy of Marriott.  The breakfast is ok but there is a serious pigeon problem that makes it less than enjoyable.  Not the worst but there has to be better options.
