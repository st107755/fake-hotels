The hotel was great but poor food and location let it down. We arrived late so we rushed to the restaurant only 2 there. The food was very poor PLEASE use good ingredients simply it's like a poor artist using to much colour. And very expensive . The hotel is to far out it has a shuttle service but water taxis in Venice are unreliable if your not paying cash! They turn up early , late or not at all and your the one with the problem
