Located in Cannaregio district this lovely boutique hotel has itâ€™s own beautiful garden  and pier so there is no any hassle with the luggage- you may arrive on water taxi from the airport or use the orange line public boats (though will need to walk some 300 m then).  The main attractions are in walkable distance (20 min walk to San Marco) although good navigation skills / app is required.  Staff is very friendly and efficient, good breakfast, clean and spacious rooms thought a bit shabby.
