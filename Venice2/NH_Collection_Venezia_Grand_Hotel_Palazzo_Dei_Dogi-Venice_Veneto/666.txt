We stayed in a quiet room off Venice's largest private garden. Perfect for a destination wedding. This building has approx. 4 rooms and a Presidential Suite. We stayed in one of the 4 rooms (2 on level with the sea level). Amazingly quiet with a beautiful view. One of the breakfast staff (her name was Romina) was very, very passionate and helpful. She deserves recognition. Very helpful with English translations too.
