We thought this hotel was charming and loved the location - away from the crowded tourist areas but not too far.  It gave us a reason to wander all the streets of Venice with our 8 and 13 year old daughters - which was actually our favorite activity.  The garden is lovely and our kids loved it.  We would definitely go back.  We used Marriott points and our kids were so surprised by the charm and character as they had "thought it would look like a Marriott".  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  Very happy that Marriott has paired with Boscolo as we also had a great stay at the Boscolo in Rome.
