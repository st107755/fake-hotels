Beautiful (but old) hotel in a relatively quiet part of Venice. The room was clean, large with a very comfortable bed as can be expected from Marriott owned hotels. The breakfast was excellent but expensive (EUR 30 p.p). Only minor points were that the hotel bar is poorly attended too by staff (we had to wait 15 min to be served) and that hotel doesn't have a fitness room and pool.
