We spent 5 fantastic nights here in April. I didn't do much research because I was using Marriott rewards and this was the best choice for staying in Venice but now that I've been here I would absolutely stay here again even if it wasn't a reward redemption. The staff was extremely polite and attentive throughout beginning with some pre-stay email questions. The rooms are beautifully done with lovely furnishings and real Murano glass fixtures. As others have mentioned, it is a little removed from the main tourist area but that turned out to be a huge plus. The tourist crowds in Venice can be overwhelming so it is nice to have a little distance from the craziness.  Here's a tip - don't shy away from having dinner at the hotel restaurant. This is a very, very good place for dinnerâ€¦
