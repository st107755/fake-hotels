The bar and restaurant staff are great minus the part where you wait a very long time to get a check.   The hotel desk well is very slow. Example we were called after 10 PM to see if they could deliver my platinum level arrival gift.  That was horrible.   The rooms are what you would expect from a centuries old palace. It is very hot 87 Fahrenheit outside the rooms however donâ€™t cool off much more than 76 and the lobby offers no relief being hoter than the rooms.
