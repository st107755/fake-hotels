We stayed for three nights what a mistake.  In the afternoon we checked in, the air conditioning was broken and they didn't bother to mention it. Our room was nothing short of sweltering hot (August) we thought maybe the maid had just turned it on.That first night was miserable we lay awake the entire night.  The management didn't seem to be concerned. Come to find out from another guest who had been there five days, it had been broken for their entire visit. By the second night the antiquated system was running, but unable to keep up with the heat.  Since our room was on the top floor it was especially warm at night. Thankfully we used Marriott hotel points, so that helped with the disappointment some. We will not stay there again and certainly don't advise staying there in theâ€¦
