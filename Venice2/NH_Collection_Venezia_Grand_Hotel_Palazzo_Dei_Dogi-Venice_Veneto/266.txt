We had a 3 night stay in a panorama room situated at the rear of the hotel with a view of the lagoon. Lovely garden to walk through to get to the room.  All the staff were friendly & helpful. Didn't have breakfast as we felt 28 Euros per person was expensive, there are plenty of other options within walking distance at a reasonable price.  Have only given a score of 4 as we had problems with the shower. It kept falling from the bracket into the bath & the temperature was hard to regulate. Also we could clearly hear the conversations of the people in the room above, particularly as they came in late at night & started making phone calls etc  Having said that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay & will consider this hotel if we ever return to Venice
