We stayed for 2 nights and highly recommend this property!  The service, from start to finish was first class.  The property is in perfect shape and the room was outstanding. The location was a bit away from the touristy areas (more residential) and we liked that a lot.  Walking to the San Marco Piazza took about 20 mintues or so, but was fine.The staff always provided great directions and marked up a map each time.  We ate breakfast both days (included since I have a high rank at Marriott) was the best we had all week in Italy. We were able to easily walk 10-15 minutes to the train station when we left.  The only boat we needed the two days was a free tour of Murano & glass factory, provided by the hotel and a ferry from the airport.
