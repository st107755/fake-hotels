My husband booked a room 'with a view'. However, when we arrived, the view ended up being an alley with trash.  The room was much smaller than it appeared on the website, but it was fine for just one night.  I gave this property 5 stars because it is beautiful, the staff were very gracious and accommodating, and we loved the location which allowed us to explore parts of Venice we had not seen before.
