I have to agree with nancy n... We liked the location away from San Marco which is a zoo.  We were in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of anything from a local bakery, pizzeria, cute little restaurants and a grocery store.  Our upgraded room was right on the lagoon but I would say that it was not luxurious for a supposedly 5 star hotel.  The bathroom was small and the door didn't close all the way.  There was 1 chair next to a built-in shelf under an arch and that was where the TV was.  Our accommodations at the Fairfield Inn JFK were smaller but had more amenities. The concierge service was 5 star!  Both Gaia and Philip were excellent with information and services.   Philip recommended the Osteria Al Cantonin for dinner and it was wonderful.
