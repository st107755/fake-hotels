After one night in a mediocre junior suite, changed rooms to a third floor junior suite looking towards the sea for six nights. Wonderful room, view of the gardens and sea. Breakfast more than adequate. Kind staff, especially Barbara at the Reception. The spa is minimal. The location is quiet and amazingly close to everything.
