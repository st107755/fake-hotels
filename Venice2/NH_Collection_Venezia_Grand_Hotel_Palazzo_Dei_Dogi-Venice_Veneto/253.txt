We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on Tripadvisor.. and we were definitively Not disappointed. Through staying here, we discovered a part of Venice which we probably would not have seen otherwise. Much more residential, yet also filled with lovely cafes and restaurants. The hotel itself is great, fantastic staff, excellent breakfast en gorgeous rooms.  I know where we'll be staying a next time in Venice, for sure!
