We arrived at the hotel after being pickpocked in Milan. The staff did all the could to be helpful and were extremely kind. They allowed us to make direct calls to our banks without charge. From the manager trough the entire staff we treated as if we were the owners. They saved our vacation.   God Bless Tom and Mary Low Greenville SC
