We stayed here from Dec 29 through Jan 5th and we were given so many pleasant memories....the hotel and staff were excellent from Fabrizio and Mathew to the young ladies at breakfast...we were made so welcomed and felt right at home although it was the holidays..we felt as thought we were with family...directions were always given to us and it was so convenient to walk over the canals and get to thedifferent sights with their help
