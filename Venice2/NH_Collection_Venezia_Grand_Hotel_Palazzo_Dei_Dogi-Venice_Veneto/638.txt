The water taxi from the airport dropped us off at the first stop and it was a short walk to the hotel. The hotel right on a canal is 3 bridges away from one of the main thoroughfares near the Rialto Bridge. There is a bar in the hotel and they serve breakfast as well. It is located close to several neighborhood restaurants!
