Stayed a couple of days here before a cruise and even though I encountered a problem, the staff was accommodating.  The first night the A/C didn't work in our room and they didn't have any other rooms available.  They brought fans to help and moved us the next day to another room.  They were very considerate of the situation. I would definitely stay here again.
