Venice is such a unique city.  However, people forget that you either boat very expensive or walk over many bridges to get to your seemingly close destination.  Boscalo Venizia is a beautiful property with many experiences that was once a nobles estate.  It sits on the last stop to the airport so to get there you are the first off and on return one stop to the airport!   Female perspective was: she wants to go back and spend more time.  Male perspective was: very cool property, quiet location, off the path, and very efficient.  They recognized Marriott elite status, they were very professional.  No need for a private boat to get here.  There are many quaint areas to lounge around too.  Highly recommend.
