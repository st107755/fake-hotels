I have always wanted to stay in Venice proper and my hubby arranged for us to stay at Boscolo in Venezia. For us a great location as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds but also easy walking into the main sites . The decor contained a lot of Murano Glass but is not over the top. The staff were friendly and informative.We had our anniversary dinner here and the service and food were excellent. Our waiter made sure everything was to our liking but did not hover. He also took pictures for us . Breakfast was buffet but you also where given a hot choice as well. Plenty of food for a good start to the day of exploring. We would recommend this hotel especially if you want a beautiful hotel in a peaceful  location .
