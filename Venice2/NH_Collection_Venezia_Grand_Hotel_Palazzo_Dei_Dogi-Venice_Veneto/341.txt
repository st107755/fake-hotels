First of all, let me tell everyone that  I was expecting a real "Autograph" hotel.... Mr Marriott himself signed on this?  My experience started like this. We left Miami without electricity, tree branches everywhere, (hurricane Irma had just passed  by) and regretted leaving our teenage boys with the grands but we did it anyway. It was our 30th anniversary a few days earlier and we had planned this trip  long enough.  We have been to numerous Marriott Brands around the world, and never had an experience like this. All we wanted was a cozy room with a fair view. What we got was a room that looked like it had been designed by my grandma in 1914. Starting with  the walls (pink /white) , the faded/torn carpets to  the mold in the bathroom tiles nothing inspired what we had seen inâ€¦
