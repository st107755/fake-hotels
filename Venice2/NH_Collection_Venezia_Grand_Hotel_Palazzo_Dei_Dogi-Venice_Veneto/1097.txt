My wife and I stayed here for four nights in late March / early April 2014 in a Superior room -   - The Cannaregio region of Venice is a quiet and peaceful area but only 15 minutes walk from the tourist / shopping area of Rialto Bridge and 20 minutes from St Marks Square; - Our room was excellent: large and very clean, decorated in a traditional style with a beautiful marble floor; - The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Excellent english language spoken by all the staff; - Breakfast was superb!  The main course is cooked to order with a beautiful buffet as well .... but allow an hour to eat it as there is just so much choice :- ) - The complimentary shuttle boat to St Marks Square is a real treat - we used it twice and had a fantastic trip around the island to the square;â€¦
