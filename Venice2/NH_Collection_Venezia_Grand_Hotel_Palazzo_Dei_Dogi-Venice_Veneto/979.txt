We really enjoyed our stay at the Boscolo in Venezia.  It is a Marriott property.  It is small and quiet and housed in an period villa . It is not located in the main tourist area rather in an old residential neighborhood.  No problems with crowds.  Our room was nicely appointed and the staff was very service oriented.  Did I mention they run a free shuttle by boat to St. Mark's Square the center of tourist activity.  It is convenient to Murano and it was walkable to most areas of the city with a little help from the staff in mapping out the path.  We had great meals in the neighborhood and of course great coffee/espresso.  .
