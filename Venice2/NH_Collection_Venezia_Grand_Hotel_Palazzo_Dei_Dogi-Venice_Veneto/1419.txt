We spent two nights at this property and had a wonderful time.  I cashed in marriott points for the stay so wasn't expecting to get a great room.  The opposite was true, they immediately recognized my platinum status, informed me we were entitled to free breakfast ( normally $35 euros per person), free internet, and while we had to wait until 3pm for the room it was worth it.  The property is a former palace so in addition to the main building, they have a courtyard that is over an acre and is amazing.  If you walk to the back they have a boat dock with a seperate building divided into 4 rooms.  Our room was in the ocean/bay buidling with a direct view of the water and the barrier islands including Murano.  The dinning and drinking options on site were very expensive but inlineâ€¦
