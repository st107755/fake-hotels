We flew into Venice and took the Orange Line vaporetto from Marco Polo to the 'Orto' stop (first stop) ... walked about 100 yards until we came to a canal ... turned to our right, and there was the hotel.  When we walked in, it took my breath away - the murals, the paintings, the decor, the welcoming staff --- all of it.  After checking in, we were escorted to our room by the front desk staff member who "introduced" us to our room.  When we looked out the window we were overlooking the canal with the hotel's private boat (one of them) docked just outside the front door.  Understand that this hotel is not located at the popular areas - although they are easily walkable - it's in a quiet, residential area - which made it very nice in it's own right.  Just one issue --- see laterâ€¦
