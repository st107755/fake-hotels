Set in a quiet location with a charming secluded garden away from busy San Marco. Our Superior room gave us a lovely view of the canal and its surroundings. The Hotel staff were charming and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast selection was very good, however, the evening meal was very expensive for what it was. We would recommend eating out at one of the many restaurant's within easy walking distance from the hotel. The hotel offered a complementary water taxi service which we found very convenient. We spent our 25th Wedding Anniversary at this hotel and had a wonderful time and we would thoroughly recommend it.
