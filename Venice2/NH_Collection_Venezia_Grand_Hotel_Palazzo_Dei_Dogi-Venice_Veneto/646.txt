Flawless hotel with great service and an unbeatable location away from the crowds. I was traveling by myself and they made me very welcome.  Spacious room with Etro amenities.  Breakfast in the garden is a special treat.  The garden extends all the way to the lagoon, a lovely walk.  An easy ride via Alilaguna to and from the airport to the Madonna del'Orton stop, with no bridges or canals to cross to get to the hotel's front door.  It's also an easy walk through Cannaregio to the Rialto and St. Mark's.  Can't wait until I can go back.
