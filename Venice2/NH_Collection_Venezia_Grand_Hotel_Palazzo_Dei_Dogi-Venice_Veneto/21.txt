We stayed for three nights to celebrate my birthday and used our Marriott Suite Awards for an upgrade to a Junior Suite of two floors with Canal views. It was a perfect stay! Everyone at the Check in desk was amazing! The breakfast was great. We also loved the location on a quite residential area. We are Titanium members so we enjoyed the benefits received during our stay. We will definitely choose this hotel again when visiting Venice.
