This is a beautiful and spotlessly clean hotel which we enjoyed for two nights while in Venice.  The breakfast was fantastic although they seemed short-staffed at times.  The lobby had the WOW factor and our room was beautiful with two large windows, lots of frest air, tastefully decorated in traditonal European style. The location is in a quiet area, but great restaurants are nearby if desired.  The water shuttle provided was useful to get to and from S. Marco area, but book it early as if fills up and this is not mentioned upon check-in.  I would return to this hotel in a minute, I didn't want to ever leave!
