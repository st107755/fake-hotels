We stayed 2 nights in this hotel. It was booked thru insight vacations and part of a tour package. The hotel is beautiful. Bathrooms are on the small side but very opulent with all the amenities including hairdryers. Very quiet location on a smaller canal with beautiful gardens to relax in. This is the canal at sunset.
