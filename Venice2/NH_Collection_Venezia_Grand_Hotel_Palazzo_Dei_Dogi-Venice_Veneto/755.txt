We are just finishing an outstanding stay at the Hotel Boscolo Venezia.  The Hotel Concierge, Ivan, and his Staff were uniformly exceptional - whether providing restaurant recommendations or helping me use my new Galaxy tablet.  The entire Wait Staff were smoothly efficient while creating and serving our delicious daily breakfast.  Our room accommodations were immaculate. This historic Hotel on a Venice canal is beautifully maintained. We totally enjoyed our hotel free water taxi ride to/from our Hotel and ST Mark's Square.  We equally enjoyed the Boscolo Venezia free shuttle to/from Murano Island. Our extraordinary experience was created for us through the combined efforts of all Hotel Boscolo Venezia personnel.  We so enjoyed ourselves  that we fully expect to stay here again.
