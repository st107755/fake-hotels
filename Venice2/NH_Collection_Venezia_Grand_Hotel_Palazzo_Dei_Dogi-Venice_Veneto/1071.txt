I spent two nights in the hotel, and this was my third visit.  The first night I stayed in a junior suite, on the fourth floor, room 407. The room was not very appealing and I soon discovered that it is quite noisy: the door is not soundproofed and there is a lot of foot traffic / chatter in front of the door.  More importantly the room has three windows whose curtains do not black-out light. So I was woken up at 6 AM!  After I complained I was moved to another junior suite, room 211. This suite was really beautifully appointed, very quiet and dark in the morning. It is too bad that my stay was spoiled by a very bad night.
