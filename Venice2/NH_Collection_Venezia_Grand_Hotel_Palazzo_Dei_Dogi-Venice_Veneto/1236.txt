This is the 2nd time I have stayed here. Wonderful holiday in all ways. First night came back into my room to a lovely bottle of bubbles and sweets!! Very impressed was I. I choose this hotel as it's very close to the water taxi's, water ferryboats and most of all the train station and buses/ taxis to airport.
