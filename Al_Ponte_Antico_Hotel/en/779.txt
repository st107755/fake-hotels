     We have never experienced better service than what you will find at this hotel.   The owner was there to greet us at their private dock on the Grand Canal and give us a tour of his hotel.   With every meeting with a member of the staff we were greeted by our first name, after they had introduced themselves and extended a warm welcome.         The beautiful area where breakfast and cocktails are served has been carefully restored to give you the impression of sitting in a grand Venetian restaurant at the turn of the century.  The seats are tufted in a pale green velvet damask and the tables are finished with lovely crisp white linens.  Directly from the cafe you can access the balcony which provides a wonderful view of the Rialto bridge and the gondolas paying the waters.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
