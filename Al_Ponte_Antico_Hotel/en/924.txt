This hotel reminded me of an American Bed and Breakfast. It is a very small hotel and the staff will greet you by name. The owner introduced himself to us personally and the entire staff is very accommodating. The location is amazing and the hotel, and the rooms, have a very authentic Venetian feel. I prefer a hotel to look and feel authentic to its surroundings, and this hotel is very Venetian, and we really enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
