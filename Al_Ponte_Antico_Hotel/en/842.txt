I stayed at Al Ponte Antico for a few nights in June before leaving on a cruise.  The location is very convenient to vaporetto stops, San Marco Square and the Rialto area.  Matteo, the owner, was so friendly and helpful-as was the rest of his small staff.  Everyone spoke excellent English.  I have been to Venice several times, but for first time visitors, they seemed to do a good job of explaining things travelers find complicated like how to validate your vaporetto ticket, etc.  We took a water taxi from the airport.  It was 110 Euro, but if you have a lot of bags, plan ahead for the expense since Al Ponte Antico has a private dock right off of the lobby and it is far easier than public transport.  At the airport, there is a desk to book your water taxi just outside of customs.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
