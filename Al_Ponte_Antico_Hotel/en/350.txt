It’s tiny--only nine rooms.  The common areas are elegantly appointed:  polished, burled wood; deep, rich velvets; high, beamed ceilings.  Most importantly, the hotel boasts a large balcony, extending over the Grand Canal, only metres from the Rialto Bridge.  The balcony is the place to indulge in a breakfast of pastries, omelets, and crepes prepared by the hotel’s owner, Matteo; or a late afternoon Spritz, the classic Venetian aperitif; or an evening glass of a nice red from Veneto--all while you watch the busy city life of Venice float, row or motor past the hotel and down the canal.  It’s an amazing location.  The rooms are lovely and comfortable.  The staff is exceptional.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
