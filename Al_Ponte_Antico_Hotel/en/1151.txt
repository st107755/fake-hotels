We have just returned from three nights in Al Ponte Antico and the whole stay was marvellous. Our large well furnished room overlooked the Grand Canal and was about 100 yards from the Rialto Bridge, which we could see through our room windows.  The experience of sitting on the hotel terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, at all times of the day (breakfast was particularly pleasant), watching the gondolas and vaporetti go by is one that will live with us.  The service provided by Matteo and hs staff was second to none, friendly and informal yet highly professional. If you are looking to treat yourself to a unique experience in Venice, stay here.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
