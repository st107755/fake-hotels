We stayed for 3 nights in late April -Matteo and his team couldn't, have done any more  to make our first trip to Venice so memorable. The hotel is in a fantastic location with a panoramic view of the Grand Canal from the little terrace on the first floor. The room was extremely comfortable and Matteo ensured each day got off to a great start with his excellent omelettes! When we return to Venice, we will definitely stay here again. Thankyou everyone at Al Ponte Antico HotelRead moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
