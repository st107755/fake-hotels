This is a small family run hotel on the Grand Canal. The rooms are of a very high standard and the service is exellent. The owner meets you personally and is a great help in providing you with helpful suggestions on where to visit. This could be a real help to first time visitors. I would certainly be happy to go back there. Had a wonderful holiday. Thanks to the Peruch family.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
