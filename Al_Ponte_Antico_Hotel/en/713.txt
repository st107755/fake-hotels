If you are looking for charm, impeccable personalized service, and a spectacular view of the Grand Canal & the Rialto bridge look no further! Al Ponte Antico is a small luxury boutique hotel hidden in the back streets of Venice away from the teeming crowds with an unparalleled view out over the Rialto bridge. We were warmly welcomed by Matteo, the extraordinary owner of this lovely hotel, and for the next few days of our stay we felt as if we were special private guests in his historic palazzo! He made us delicious made-to-order breakfasts sitting on the stunning outdoor terrace watching the vaporettos and gondolas pass by. He and his able staff, including Alex and Oliver, were always available to help us with activities, dining reservations, and insider tips to navigate Veniceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
