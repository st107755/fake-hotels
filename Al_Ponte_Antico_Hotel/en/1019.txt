A very special hotel. Superb period features and very comfortable palatial bedroom with view onto the Grand Canal. The most important thing is the quality of service. I do not believe I have ever stayed anywhere where the owners and staff are so attentive to their guests. Nothing is too much trouble. They all remember your names and always have time to talk to you and provide as much information as you need. Breakfast was of a high quality and could be eaten on the terrace overlookig the Rialto bridge if you wanted. The owners recommended us to an excellent restaurant ( Fiaschetteria Toscana) which they booked for us which I think helped to make sure we got a good table I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone wanting a quality friendly hotel in the centre of VeniceRead moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
