This is a very pleasant hotel which is very well situated near the Rialto Bridge, The view from the terrace is fantastic but unless one has a forward facing room the remainder are dark and somewhat depressing though well appointed. The staff could not do more to make ones stay comfortable and we would have given the hotel a higher score had we been able to secure forward facing room. In fairness to Mateao  the owner,  at the time of booking we realised that we were not going to get a front facing room but we lived in hope of cancelation. So, would we go back? Yes but only if we could book a canal view. One last tip, take the water taxi form the airport. The hotel has its own quay  which makes transfers very easy.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
