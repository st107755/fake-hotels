Mateo and his staff are 1st class hosts and hostesses. When our boat arrived we were greeted with first names and excellent service. I have traveled to many states and countries and I can honestly say that the staff at Al Ponte Antico was my finest experience. When I return to Venice I would not think of staying any other place. The breakfast spread was to die for!!! I had the blood orange juice (I cannot find in California :(.. the best Cappuccino, brown eggs to order (omelettes), mini pastries, meat tray etc. And, whether you eat inside or outside the VIEWS ARE BEAUTIFUL!! Outside is a gorgeous view of the Rialto Bridge directly on the water, and inside is a quaint Victorian style parlor with beautiful paintings and decor. On a personal note: I want to 'thank' Mateo; 3 daysâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
