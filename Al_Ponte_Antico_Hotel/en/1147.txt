This was one of the very best travel experiences we have ever had. The entire team was extremely welcoming and passionate about their beautiful hotel and city.  The personal attention made it truly seem like we were visiting good friends.  I look froward to a future visit and there is not a chance we would consider staying anywhere else! Thank you for the hospitality Matteo,Oliver, Armondo and Rosalba!!! Ciao for now!Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
