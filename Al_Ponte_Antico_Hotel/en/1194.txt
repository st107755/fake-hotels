My family is a world traveling family, having visited major cities in America, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Ireland----you get the picture.  The stay with my son at the Hotel Al Ponte Antico was the very best ever.  The staff truly enjoy what they do and they exude hospitality, respect, and love for their guests.  The rooms are opulent but not at all ostentatious.  There is a sense of elegance about the rooms.  The breakfast, included with the price of the room, is fabulous.  We visited in an off season before Carnivale and the owner upgraded us to the best room in the hotel.  Again, this is an example of the kind, loving service that is so rare and also extraordinary.  We plan to be in Venice again and the Hotel Al Ponte Antico will be our destination.  My wife will love this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 20103 SavesHelpfulShare
