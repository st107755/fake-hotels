This hotel and it's fabulous staff make you feel special from the very moment you enter. If you want a magical weekend away staying in the heart of this fabulous city then this is the hotel to choose.  We cannot fault anything at all and can only praise the staff who do everything in their power to make certain you have the most wonderful holiday. The hotel is like a miniature palace.  Sitting on the terrace enjoying a drink along the Grand Canal is something that will remain in our memories for a long time.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
