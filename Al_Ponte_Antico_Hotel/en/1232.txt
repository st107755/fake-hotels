We recently stayed two nights at this absoultely fantastic grand canal property. Our unexpected Jr Suite upgrade was the climax to a wonderful 3 week trip - the accomodations were excellent but Matteo and his outstanding staff made our stay special. The location on the Grand Canal near the Rialto was great - and surprisingly there was litte evening noise. We would stay at no other Venice location. Venice is a magical city and Hotel Al Ponte Antico made for a most memorable visit. Thank you Matteo and staff - we felt like family.
