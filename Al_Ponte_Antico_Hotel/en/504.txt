We stayed here for my wife's birthday and right from the booking confirmation we felt like valued guests. Al Ponte Antico is a small family run hotel; Matteo and the rest of the staff were friendly, charming, informative and tended to our every needs - nothing was too much trouble. Location is perfect, about a 10 min walk from St Marks Square and the view from the terrace was stunning. In short, if you like staying in small family run boutique hotels where you are truly made to feel like a guest then this is the place for you.  Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
