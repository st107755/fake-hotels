Following 2 days on the Orient Express we wanted our hotel to continue the magical holiday that we were already enjoying.  Antico lived up to our expectation and we had the nicest time. The hotel is just what you want in Venice.  Quirky, beautiful, and perfectly located.  The rooms are large and very well maintained.  The balcony and bar / breakfast area is just lovely.  Sitting outside watching the boats go past with a glass of bubbly in the evening, or tea and cake (local cake shops) is very special.  You feel like royalty waving to the boats going passed taking photos.  Matteo and his staff are perfect hosts and are the real deal.  If you want Italian style and to be part of Venice then you wont be disappointed.  We will be back.  Tips.  Don't judge the inside by the outside.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
