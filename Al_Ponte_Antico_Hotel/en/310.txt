I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel for its outstanding location - this is right on the Grand Canal two mins from the Rialto Bridge, it has its own docking place, a wonderful terrace where one can spend time while the room is getting ready. Brilliant views from the terrace. The room we stayed in - Junior Suite - was fantastic. A part of the dock was available and made it into an impromptu open air terrace - it was like our own private view on the Grand Canal. The owners were very helpful and hospitable as was the hotel staff. The rooms were fantastic with one large bedroom and a living room opening into the dock. Very well done interiors. The bathroom was a bit small but had an attached ante room. There is no room service but a great breakfast cooked fresh and served onâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
