My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in November 2013 in a gorgeous room on the first floor of this quite small hotel. The room was very spacious, warm and comfortable. The views out the window to the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge were spectacular. The hotel retains its 14th century look inside which we loved. The best part of our stay was the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff. They were wonderful! They provided great service and were able to answer all our questions and assist us at all times-and always with a smile on their faces. We have never experienced such friendly and helpful staff in 40 years of travelling the world and staying in hundreds of hotels. We look forward to returning soon.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
