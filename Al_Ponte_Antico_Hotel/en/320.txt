This hotel is a 9 room hotel and very initiate. The staff are well trained and know you by name and are very helpful and nice. It has a lovely patio overlooking the Rialto bridge  and the main grand canal. The breakfast is very good with homemade eggs, though the  coffee needed tweaking. I liked the hotel but might not stay here again as I think for the price they need higher quality sheets and pillows and towels,  a more  comfortable less hard mattress. a nicer bathroom, and need to upgrade some if the furniture which is a little tired. But wonderful  location, beautiful view, great breakfast and staff!  It is one of the better options in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
