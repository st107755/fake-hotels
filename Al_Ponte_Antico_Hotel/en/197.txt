We walked out of the train station in Venice right to the Grand Canal; caught a water taxi to the front door of the hotel. The first thing you notice is how much the owner and the entire staff truly love the hotel and working to make the guests happy. Breakfast on the Grand Canal with a direct view of the Rialto Bridge is stunning. Our breakfast was included and they will cook to your request. The hotel has beautiful old world charm and service dates to when people actually cared about your satisfaction; they go above and beyond.  They also setup a free water taxi for us to go to the island of Murano to tour the glass factory; nothing is pushed upon you they are merely there to make sure you having a wonderful trip..................  One last note to the review: "Very Expensive"â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
