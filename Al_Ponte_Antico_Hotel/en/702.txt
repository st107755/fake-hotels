Great place, very intimate and great service. The owner of the hotel welcomed us in and carried our luggage to our room! was so nice and polite plus his english was flawless so it was very easy to communicate with him and the rest of the staff. The breakfast was our favorite part, the owner again made eggs and crepes for us. The room was quiet and the bed- besides being a bit hard- was surprisingly comfortable! Also they welcomed us with a nice bottle of prosecco. We definitely recommend this place, they made us feel like home!
