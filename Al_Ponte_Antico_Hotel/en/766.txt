Great staff, great location, great hotel, great rooms. Just come back from a few days in Venice and had a fabulous time at this small hotel. The staff were amazing with great recommendations for visits, for restaurants, for anything really. Near the Rialto bridge with a great view from the hotel terrace. Generous v&ts from the bar as the sun went down were exceptionally well received. A great place and hope to stay again soon. Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
