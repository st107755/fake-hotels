From the moment we stepped off our water taxi we knew we had chosen the perfect place to stay in Venice. Matteo and his staff were welcoming, professional and so helpful. Sitting on the verandah sipping champagne was a perfect way to begin our evenings - a perfect location. We particularly loved the intimacy of this small hotel and were made to feel very much at home. Can't wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
