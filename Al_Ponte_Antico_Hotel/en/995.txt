As others have discovered this is a special hotel for many reasons, but one thing is for sure, you will have to go very far and stay in a lot of hotels to find anywhere with better, friendlier, more obliging and helpful staff. A high standard is clearly what they aim for and they certainly succeed. We stayed overnight on the way back from the Dolomites and will not hesitate to return. The location is ideal, the furnishings and ambience of the building perfect, the views sensational, breakfast just right.  Also the restaurant recommendation was exactly right so thanks to Matteo, Bruno and all the staff for delivering our first 10/10.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
