Wonderful small hotel, great location near to Rialto bridge and overlooking the Grand Canal. Most of all, Matteo and the other staff Oliviero, Rosalba, Thomas and David, were welcoming, kind, helpful and friendly. The room was fab, with high ceilings and fine decor. Great breakfasts and smooth evening drinks on the terrace. We would love to try some of Matteo's other hotels.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
