Located on the Grand Canal you must arrive at this hotel by boat. Our first time to Venice and we wanted it to be special. You are greeted by first names and made to feel very welcome on arrival. This is not a big Hotel (circa 10 rooms) but the style of the place just makes you feel as if you really have arrived in Venice. It costs extra but if you book the suite at Grand Canal level, you have big opening doors out of your room where you can sit drinking champagne with the canal literally 2 feet below you and all the hustle and bustle of the boats going by - an absolute must! This hotel for us was the "way" to stay in Venice - superb!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
