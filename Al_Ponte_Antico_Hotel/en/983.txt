We did not get disappointed. Bruno surprised us at check in with a " You must be Lino, and you must be Donald "we felt at home right away!! He showed us the beautiful hotel and recommended a very nice restaurant where we ate dinner. Then we met Matteo, Rosalba, Cristiano and Oliver who all rock!  Matteo on the second day had a  delicious sandwich made for me to eat on the train since i did not make it to breakfast. Thank you! :) Our room was humongous and very elegant, <3 it!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
