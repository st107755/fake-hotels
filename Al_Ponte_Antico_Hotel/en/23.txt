Our experience was stellar and the staff accomodated us beyond expectation.  The establishment is boutique and, by definition, it shouldn't be expected to have the level of flexibility that they provided to us, due to scale.  However, I must say that they impressed me with their flexibility and their desire to make every stay at their hotel an exceptional one.  On top of this, they were incredible at helping us get around town, pointing out photographic opportunities (one of the staff shared our passion), helping us find out about one-of-a-kind exhibitions and providing us with solid advice on the local area!  On top of that, the sevices provided by the establishment and their owner were impeccable!Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
