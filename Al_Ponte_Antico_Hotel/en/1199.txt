You might think, the more expensive a hotel is, the better the service is. In this hotel the truth is quite obvious to be recognized: it's not the price, good service is a mixture of good people, much experience and empathy for customers, a passion for being hosts, being extremly professional and disciplined - while staying super-friendly, nearly to friendly.  Before visiting this hotel I thought I've seen all significan kind of hotels (which I can afford). This is a class of it's own. When visiting Venice, it's a must.   The rest is well described by the previous posts which turned out for us to be totally true, which still amazes me. It was a fantastic stay, we were treated like very special guests.Read moreDate of stay: January 2010HelpfulShare
