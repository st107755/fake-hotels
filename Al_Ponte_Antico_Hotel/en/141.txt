My wife and I had the pleasure of a recent three-night stay at Al Ponte Antico Hotel. The location of this property is unparalleled, located on the Grand Canal, just steps from the Rialto Bridge, a short walk to restaurants, shopping and the city's cultural treasures. The interior has been meticulously restored in true Venetian character. What sets the Al Ponte Antico apart, however, is the exceptional customer service extended to each guest. Matteo has established a standard of excellence that is lost in today's hospitality industry. He and his team go out of their way to make sure that each guest has a memorable stay at the hotel as well as in Venice. Without hesitation I give the hotel my highest recommendation.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
