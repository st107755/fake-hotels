Our family of four recently spent two stints on two nights each at the Al Ponte Antico. It is absolutely fabulous. Staying in a palazzo that dates from the 1500s is an experience in itself. But the warmth of the hospitality from Matteo and his team will make your visit truly memorable.  Both times we stayed we had rooms overlooking the Canal Grande.  The outlook provides an excellent view of the canal and its passing traffic, as well as the Rialto bridge. Even if you don't have a canal view, there is a small balcony off the first floor that provides an excellent opportunity to take in the view.  We ate there every day for breakfast, and then also returned there after a day of sight-seeing for a few pre-dinner drinks as the sun went down. This is an experience not to be missed. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
