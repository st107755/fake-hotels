My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights (and mornings and afternoons) at Matteo's beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal.  His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated, and treat each other, like old friends.  The wonderful terrace, for breakfast and evening spritzers and whatever else you'd like, provides the remarkable setting.  Although near the Rialto bridge, serenity reigns.  Al Ponte Antico is a magical place and we will return again and again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
