We stayed in one of the most darkest blue room ever. Only stayed one night checked out the next day at extra cost to ourselves, we were suppose to stay for 4. We Checked in at Llassidi Palace 3nights,(our other choice) and that made our 25th wedding celebration a memorable one for the right reasons.  I am gobsmacked this hotel has this rating as there are so many more far better hotels than this.  Try Metropole Hotel, that hotel should have this rating. We have stayed there twice,since and will be going again. They offer good rates and is so close to St Marks Square. Just remember not everyone writes review, so the ratings are not 100% accurate. If you use this hotel, I do really believe you will be disappointed for the money you'll pay. Try other hotels before this one. Read moreDate of stay: June 2003HelpfulShare
