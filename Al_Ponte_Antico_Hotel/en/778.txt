Small hotel but with a big heart! Just 9 rooms in a little palazzo located right on the Grand Canal less than 100m from the Rialto(with canal and Rialto Bridge views from 4 of the superior bedrooms), and with a terrace, bar and breakfast room organised to make the most of the quite extraordinary situation. Many hotels would let the facilities speak for themselves, but as icing on the cake, owner Matteo and his staff give quite the best of service.  We have not experienced better ..... anywhere, anytime. Can't recommend too highly, and look forward to returning when the weather is warmer to enjoy an early evening drink on the terrace soaking up a view that would be a reason in itself to visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
