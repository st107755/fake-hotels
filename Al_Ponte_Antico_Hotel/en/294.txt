My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel.  It has the perfect location.  It is right next to the Rialto bridge on the Grand Canal.  The hotel itself is small but beautiful with old world charm.  The owner of the hotel, Mateo, greeted us upon our arrival and gave us a tour.  Every morning he made the most delicious breakfast for his guests to enjoy.  I cant say enough positive about how great their customer service was....absolutely exemplary.  Our room was great too!  We had the suite with the patio overlooking the Grand canal. Recommend highly!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
