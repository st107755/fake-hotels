This outstanding hotel experience exceeded all the positive reviews.  The location is one of a kind and the pictures do not do it justice.  The staff were incredible and they all make it a point to know all guests on a first name basis. And the free breakfast was beyond belief with those incredible “made fresh to order” omelets.  And on that terrace over the balcony - and on the Grand Canal.  We will certainly be back and may make a trip to Venice just to relive the experience of this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
