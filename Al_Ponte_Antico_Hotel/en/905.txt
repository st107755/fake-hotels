I would agree with much of what has been written already. Even reading beforehand that guests were referred to by name, when it actually happens, it still seems surprising. The staff could not have been more welcoming, courteous and helpful.  We arrived by water taxi and the hotel's own dock made arrival a breeze.  Great position by the Rialto. Loved it!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
