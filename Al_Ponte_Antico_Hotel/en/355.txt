There is not enough space or time for me to sufficiently rave about this hotel. I generally spend a lot of my travel planning time trying to choose a good hotel, and more often than not I am pleased, but I don't think I have ever had a more delightful or memorable hotel stay. I would not even consider staying anyplace else in Venice!!   First, the staff is truly exceptional. Every member of the staff learns your name when you arrive and greets you warmly and by name whenever they see you. Matteo's love and care for the hotel and the city is clear and infectious. Every member of the staff who we interacted with was warm, friendly, and happy to provide guidance on everything from restaurants, to sites to visit, to transportation. They were always available yet were never intrusiveâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
