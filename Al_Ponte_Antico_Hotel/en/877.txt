We loved our two night stay at this hotel, arrived by private water taxi & dropped off directly at the waterfront entrance, Christiano was very welcoming and helpful- as were all of the staff and the owner, they all made a point of remembering everyone's name which is a rare touch.  They even sang happy birthday to me at breakfast on the terrace & left a chilled bottle of Prosecco in our room later that evening. Breakfast was great, hot & cold options. Large & glamorous standard room with jacuzzi in en suite. Terrace was the perfect place to relax, take in the views of the grand canal & meet the other guests. Bar drinks are good value for Venice.  Unfortunately renovations next door blocked our view of the Rialto bridge but this was out of the hotel's control.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
