A little late in writing this review but better late than never.  I booked a surprise weekend in Venice for my boyfriends 40th birthday in April 2015. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and was immediately given a tour of the exquisitely furnished boutique hotel by the owner Matteo. We then relaxed on the balcony with a glass of wine admiring the view of the famous Rialto Bridge. All the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. They helped us book restaurants and a concert. Matteo was always available to answer any questions we had.  The breakfast is a must, try the cooked eggs.  Thank you all for an amazing weekend as we celebrated in style.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
