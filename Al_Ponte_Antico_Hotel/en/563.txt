We arrive here to attend the Venice Biennale and once again we chose to stay with Matteo and his team at their superb boutique hotel on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge. The hotel only contains 9 rooms and  all have an individual style are spacious and well appointed. The breakfast room is exquisite and the communal deck overlooking the canal is great spot for breakfast and to gather and meet the other guests. Above all else the service is superb, very attentive and extremely helpful. We will definitely be back to stay with Matteo when we return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 20151 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
