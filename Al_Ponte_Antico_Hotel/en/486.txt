We were very struck by the personal nature of the service in this beautiful little hotel. All staff knew our names and the recommendations for restaurants and attractions were spot on and tailored to our personal requirements. The balcony overlooking the Grand Canal is a wonderful place to watch Venice in action, especially with a glass of prosecco in your hand. Breakfast was good and staff were always on hand and attentive. Special thanks to Alex who seemed to have an uncanny knack of getting all his recommendations for us exactly right!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
