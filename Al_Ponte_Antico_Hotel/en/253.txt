Every review about this hotel and the outstanding service is true!  The owner, Matteo, and his team are amazing.  You are greeted by name upon your arrival and in every interaction going forward.  The breakfast included with your stay is wonderful.  Try the omelette, it’s the best I’ve ever had.  Perfectly located, the views from the balcony are splendid.  I would absolutely, hands down, stay here again.  It’s a very special place. Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
