This former palace is fabulously located right on the Grand Canal in the heart of it all. We enjoyed watching the world go by right in front of us while we had our delicious breakfasts or cocktails on the terrace each day. Richly decorated, as every Venetian Palace should be, just adds to the ambience.  Definitely arrive and depart by water taxi, straight to the hotel's canal entrance.  A stay here is more about experiencing Venice in all its glory during the days of Princes and Palaces.  Matteo, the multi-lingual owner, and his staff will make you feel like a visiting Prince or Princess with their genuinely warm hospitality.  Additionally, he makes the best breakfast crepes in Venice. Our experience at this intimate little gem of a hotel greatly enhanced our trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
