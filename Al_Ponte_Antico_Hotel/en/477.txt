We booked this hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary and it turned out to be the best hotel that we had ever stayed in. Apart from the superb location and having breakfast and drinks on the terrace overlooking the Grand canal and Rialto, the friendliness and advice from all the staff is second to none. The hotel is very quiet and provides a great break from the crowds. Our room was wonderful, the breakfast was superb and we can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
