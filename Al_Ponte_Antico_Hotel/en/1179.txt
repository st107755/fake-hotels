Although myself and my partner did not get around to writing a review on the Al Ponte Antico Hotel last year, we felt compelled to leapt to its defence on reading the last review!  It is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at and people who haven't even been there should not really be permitted to leave reviews (how can you actually comment on accommodation, sleep quality, location etc!!)  I can sympathise with people being upset over events of the last few weeks, but that is nothing to do with the hotel, they are still a business and that is why you have travel insurance!  We are booked to return at the beginning of September and we can not wait - our advice is believe the hype and rebook if you can.Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare
