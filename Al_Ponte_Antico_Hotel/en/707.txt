What a delighful stay! Matteo has lovingly restored this beautiful palazzo and he and his friendly staff could not have been more attentive and helpful. The view of the Grand Canal and the Rialto from our room and the terrace/bar was unforgettable. We will definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
