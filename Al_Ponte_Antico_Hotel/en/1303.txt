Its a beautiful, warm and charming Hotel. The service was fantastic, the guys Bruno, Gigi and Alesio were fantastic host, asking you every minute if you were okay, and took the time to call every guest by your first name as you walk into the reception. The room we had was the one overlooking the Canal. You could nearly touch the Rialto Bridge from there. I highly recommend this hotel to whoever is going to venice. Your memories will not be complete without staying here.Read moreDate of stay: January 2009HelpfulShare
