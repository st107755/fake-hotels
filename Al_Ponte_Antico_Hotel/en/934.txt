This is a small boutique hotel located on the Grand Canal, about 150m from the Rialto Bridge. It was renovated in 2007 and is an absolute gem in the perfect location in the magical city of Venice.  The hotel is literally on the canal and yout water taxi will drop you off to the door. Inside, the rooms are luxourous.  You can have breakfast on the terrace overlooking the canal with a lovely view of the Rialto. It takes about a 15 minute stroll to get to Saint Marks. Venice can get very hot and humid so a hotel which you can get to quickly and easily, to take a break and have a shower, is priceless.  The staff are excellent. Their policy must be to do everything to make your stay perfect and to make you feel very special. They use your first names and nothing is too much for themâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
