Matteo and Oliver were so gracious and accommodating.  The views at breakfast and cocktail hour could not be beat!  We stayed 2 nights at the beginning of a 1.5 week tour and what a way to kick it off.  Breakfast was great.  I do recommend arriving by private taxi as it makes the hotel all that more attractive.  Small family owned property that strives to meet all of your expectations. We stayed the end of  October 2013.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
