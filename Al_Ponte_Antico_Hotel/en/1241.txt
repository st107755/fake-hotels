I spend around 150 nights a year in hotels - mainly on business and I can honestly say that I found this hotel to be one of the very nicest I have ever stayed in.  We arrived by water taxi to their private jetty on the Grand Canal - and someone came out and said "you must be Eric and Trish !  Welcome!".  This set the tone for our whole stay.  We were in one of the more modest rooms facing the courtyard - but there was complete silence so we slept really well.  The buffet breakfast, suggestions for dinner (not to mention a willingness to ensure we had a reservation), suggestions about where and where not to go all made this a memorable stay.  A truly lovely hotel in an unbelievable location, with excellent people.  Thanks to all - we will definitely be back.  Eric and Trishâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
