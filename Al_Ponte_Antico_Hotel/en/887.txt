We stayed at ponte antico during carnival 2013 and had the best experiences we've ever had at a hotel. The hotel is so beautifully decorated. The rooms are big and decorated beautifully too. The staff is so friendly and helpful which is a reflection from the amazing owner Matteo that gave us a tour of the hotel the second we arrived. The location is perfect, right in the middle of everything and the views are great of the Rialto bridge and grand canal. In the morning breakfast is amazingly prepared fresh for you with a huge selection of what you can eat. I would recommend this hotel to everyone I know. Thanks again Matteo for making our venice stay unforgettable. Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
