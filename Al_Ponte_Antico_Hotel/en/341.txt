Absolutely beautiful. This is the only place I'd ever stay in Venice. The owner Mateo takes great pride in his hotel and you can absolutely see why. Everything was restored all the frescos, ceilings, drapes... Magnificent charm and elegance. The staff is very friendly and informative. Every morning there is a huge continental breakfast available, delicious! The terrace in the evening is breathtaking overlooking the Grand Canal. You truly are missing out if you do not stay here when in Venice!  Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
