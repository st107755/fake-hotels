Just returned from our trip to Italy. Had the pleasure of spending 2 nights in the Hotel Al Ponte Antico. I can’t say enough about the staff, the hotel and the location. We were welcomed by name and treated as if we were the only guest in the hotel. Location is perfect for an easy walk around Venice. After a day of sight seeing and shopping,  we were welcomed to the terrace where we watched al the activity on the grand canal and enjoyed beautiful sunsets.  Room was beautifully decorated and bathroom was spacious and modern. My only regret is that we didn’t get to stay longer!  Can’t wait to return to the Hotel Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
