Home away from home.  The location is great, the view out onto the canal is great, the rooms are great, the made to order breakfast is great, but what sets Al Ponte Antico apart is the staff.  Led by the owner, Matteo, we have never felt so at home and so pampered.  No stone was left upturned to make sure that our stay was memorable.  To stay in a magical city like Venice and have your Hotel be one of the highlights is saying something.  I apologize ahead of time if my spelling is wrong.  I want to thank Romena for her warm greetings at the front desk and lovely personality. Katrina who made our breakfast so much fun and started our day out on such a high note  Last but not least, Matteo, who was as gracious a person as I have ever met.  Thank You !!  I know where I'm staying ifâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
