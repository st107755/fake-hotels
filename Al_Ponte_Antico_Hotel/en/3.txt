From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed all the staff at Al Ponte Antico could not have tried harder to make my wives birthday treat more enjoyable.  From the moment we arrived at the dock of the hotel on the grand canal by shared water taxi (a must do) and greeted by Alex with a cheery 'Hello Liz, hello Andy', we knew it was going to be special.  At this point, Liz and I would like to say a special thank you to Alex who on a daily basis gave us insights as to the best places to go considering our stay  was fairly short. His recommendations for places to eat were superb especially the reservation he made for us on the last night to ensure we had a canal side table at La Porta d'Acqua.  Our room overlooking the Grand Canal was gorgeous, tastefully decorated, very high ceilings, air conditioned, the most comfortable bed and terrific views of the Rialto Bridge. The shower is a little small but perfectly adequate with both overhead and directional shower heads.  Breakfast here is a treat in itself with everything beautifully presented and the homemade pastries were delicious. Barbara ensured that breakfast ran smoothly cooking the most wonderful eggs (of your choice) and with the help of Roselda ensured that you wanted for nothing. The view from the the terrace is very special and worth the cost of your stay on its own.  We wished we could have stayed longer and were very sad to leave this very special hotel. Our thanks to Egor who sorted out a little issue with our return shared water taxi but this just showed all the staffs attention to detail and their endeavour to ensure our stay was as special as possible.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2020LocationServiceSleep QualityRoom Tip: Choose a canal view room, yes you pay a premium but you will not regret it.See more room tips1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
