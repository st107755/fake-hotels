We had an amazing time at Al Ponte Antico. The owner (Matteo) and staff were fantastic and just couldn't do enough for us.  We stayed in the suite downstairs with our own private terrace overlooking the canal which was beautiful.  Thank you, we had such a fantastic weekend made even more special by our stay here.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
