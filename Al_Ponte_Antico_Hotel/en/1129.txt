My wife and I (honeymooners) stayed here after reviewing comments on Tripadvisor. We found that the descriptions on Tripadvisor only scratched the surface. The location, service (all staff including the owner Matteo), hotel gracefulness all added to a wonderful stay. On our 2 nights we took hotel recommendations for restaurants and found a jem both nights (thanks Oliver for the booking on our last night, we didn't get to thank you). Breakfast is also a highlight of the stay, starting at the custom build coffee machine that produces some of the best cappuccinos I have ever had (had 3 during my last breakfast), and ending with one of the tastiest omlette's to exist....  We intend to return next year and bring my sister and brother in law as they would love it too. 2 nightsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
