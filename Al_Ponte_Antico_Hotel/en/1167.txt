Arrived by river taxi to the Hotel's private mooring and immediately welcomed by our first names. The hotel is an attractive recently-restored 16th Century palace. Our room was fairly compact without much natural light but it was otherwise of a good standard. Mattress firm but comfortable. Walls a bit thin so television easy to hear from next door.  Breakfast is a good buffet with fresh omelettes or pancakes made to order. Delicious hot chocolate as well. The bar leads to a small balcony with excellent views of the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal.  Warm hospitality although perhaps a little over-rehearsed. Location on the canal is superb. Very good boutique-style hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
