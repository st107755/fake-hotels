Matteo and Oliver were wonderful hosts for us and our friends. The rooms were very nice and bathrooms larger then expected. The location is centrally located and easy to access from almost anywhere in Venice. The key to loving this place though is the service. They make you feel at home as if you were long lost friends. The breakfast with eggs was great and the outdoor patio overlooking the Grand Canal was a great place to hang out before dinner.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
