I'd taken my girlfriend for her birthday and she was blown away.  The place is great - location, rooms, breakfast and view. The staff are also wonderful - helpful, friendly and know who you are by first name, making you feel human and not just a room number.   We will be going back (soon) we hope. This is what a hotel should be. FIVE stars all the way.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
