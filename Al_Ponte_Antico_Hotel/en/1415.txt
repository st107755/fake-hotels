We found this hotel on laterooms just before we set off for our honeymoon. Our room was small but otherwise perfect - no canal view but quiet and private, sumptiously furnished, Venetial glass chandelier, chic and modern spa shower room, effective air-con!. The terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge and the Grand Canal has to be this hotel's main selling point though. It was the perfect vantage point for breakfasting while watching this waterborne city come to life, or sipping champagne by evening candle-light, smiling in romantic conspiracy with the gondola passengers below.  Easy access to the Vaporetto (water bus) and the hotel has a landing for the water taxi if you wish to arrive/leave by private boat.  Staff friendly and helpful.
