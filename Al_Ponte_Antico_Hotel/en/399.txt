A wonderfully warm welcome, a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge, staff who couldn't do enough for you - even down to checking you have the correct departure time, route to the airport and flight time, make this a truly delightful hotel. Its setting on the Grand Canal and within minutes of all the main sightseeing spots make this a real gem and I cannot recommend highly enough.  The welcome is so genuine and warm you feel like you are part of the family. Wonderful. I look forward to a return visit.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
