We arrived by water taxi to be greeted personally, by name, by the owner and every moment of the next three days were made to feel that our every convenience was their highest priority.  This boutique hotel has only nine guest rooms so often you have the balcony to yourself to simply enjoy time watching Venice float by and have your picture taken by visitors passing by on the Grand Canal.  We stayed in room 108 with a large window that opened directly on the Grand Canal and our only regret is that we did not book a  longer stay.  The bar has been raised to an impossibly high level for all other hotels that will never be able to measure up to the standard of the Al Ponte Antico.    Thank you to Mateo and staff for a memory that will last a lifetime.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
