We have been back twice now (both special occaions - engagement and birthday) and have loved every moment of it. The staff and particularly Matteo, the owner, are fantastic - so helpful and friendly. The rooms are classic but beautiful, but the balcony is somewhere you could sit all day watching the boats go by. Well worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
