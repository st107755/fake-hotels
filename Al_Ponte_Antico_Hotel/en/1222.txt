Matteo and his staff made our first visit to Venice most enjoyable.  They made excellent choices for us for meals and gave us precise directions.  We would never have found the small wine bar around the corner from the hotel on our own.  I wish we can find more Matteo's in our future travel destinations!Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
