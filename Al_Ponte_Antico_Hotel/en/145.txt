My wife and I stayed here for two or three nights in September 2017, and I still think about it almost every day.  Mateo and his amazing team (shout out to Alex for his excellent Aperol Spritz) knew and greeted us by name every time they saw us.  The room was comfortable and well appointed, but the real showstopper is the balcony overlooking the grand canal.  It is open 24 hours a day, so you can sit as long as you like, and I would live there if possible.  The breakfast was very good (Mateo makes omlettes and coffee), and the staff were very helpful.  Do yourself a favor and stay here.  While there are many great hotels in Venice, you won't regret staying here.  We'll be back. Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
