For me this hotel had everything I every dreamed of for a visit to Venice. Although we walked almost everywhere, it is conveniently located near the Rialto bridge and the water bus stop. The hotel, including the rooms, is beautifully decorated and there is an incredible patio over looking the Grand Canal. The only down side was my husband had difficulty with the tub and shower. The ceiling was very low and standing in the tub to shower was difficult for him. I loved the jacuzzi tub. There was a lovely buffet breakfast with eggs and crapes cooked by Mateo, the owner. We couldn't say enough about the owner and staff. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. They offered not only tourist information but restaurants and places they personally enjoyed going to inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
