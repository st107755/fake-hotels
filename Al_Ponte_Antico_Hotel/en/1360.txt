This hotel really gets you in the Venice mood with its friendliness and location in the heart of the action.  We were two people in an inner room (no view).  It was quite large, and included a king and a comfortable fold out sleeper couch, both comfortable.  The bathroom is huge with the jacuzzi tub that is so relaxing.  Two terrycloth robes were available for use.  The common space is elegant and the adjacent terrace for eatting and drinks is spectacular.  One can spend all morning, evening or all day soaking in the brillant view of the Rialto bridge and watercraft of every sort floating by.  With drink in hand, you definitely feel privledged looking at the world floating by.  The breakfast is outstanding with pasteries, fruit, fresh and hot veggies, and Matteo's fresh omlettesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2008HelpfulShare
