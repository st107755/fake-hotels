We just had four amazing nights at this small, boutique and arty hotel facing the Grand Canal. Matteo, the owner, Bruno, his brother, Romina and other staff could not have been more professional and welcoming, looking after us with a simply sumptuous breakfast, daily recommendations for sights and beautiful restaurants, and just plain simple warmth and friendliness. We had a ball in beautiful Venice - thanks to them! I would not miss staying here on any return trip to Venice! Thank You Al Ponte Antico!Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
