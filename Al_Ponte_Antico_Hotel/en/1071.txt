A truly welcoming hotel with very friendly and attentive staff. Small hotel with a limited number of rooms in a very central location near the Rialto bridge. Sumptuous dining room with terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. Beautiful place to enjoy your breakfast, with eggs cooked to your personal taste by the owner Matteo.  Our room was very comfortable, the only slight critiscism would be that the bathroom was quite small for such a large room. Overall an excellent, if premium priced, place to stay for a special romantic occasion.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
