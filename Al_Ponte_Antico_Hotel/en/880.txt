We have just returned from our 5th stay at Al Ponte Antico and found it as wonderful as ever. The rooms are beautiful, decorated in the ornate Venetian style, the staff is as helpful as everyone says, and the terrace on the Grand Canal, where we had breakfast in the morning and a drink in the evening, is heaven. Friends have told us that they had terrible food in Venice, but following the recommendations of the hotel staff, all our meals have been excellent. The construction partially blocking the Rialto Bridge is unfortunate but only temporary and we just adjusted our chairs so that our view of the Grand Canal was in the opposite direction. I imagine such things are part of everyday life in Venice, which we try to embrace. We look forward to our next visit to Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
