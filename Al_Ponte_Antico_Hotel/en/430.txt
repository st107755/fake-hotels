We loved this hotel and only regret was we had only one night there. Definitely plan to return and stay longer.  We felt so welcome the second we walked thru door and everyone treated us so great and all about how they could help us have best time in venice and provide anything we need. This is very special place and excellent location would definitely recommend staying here. Close to all sights and great place to rest in between sightseeing.  Excellent buddy with breakfast good and lovely patio with view of canal.  Room was unique and extremely comfortableRead moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
