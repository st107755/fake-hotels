The staff was amazing.  The facility superb.  They know your name when you arrive and great you by name the entire stay.  Fantastic location.  Great restaurant and sight seeing as recommended by the staff.  Huge rooms - ours faced the Grand Canal.  The best city hotel I have ever visited.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
