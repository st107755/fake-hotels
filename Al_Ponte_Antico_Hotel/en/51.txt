What an amazing little hotel. It doesn't have all the bells an whistles of a big hotel but it makes up for it in its charm, it's location and the truely wobderful staff who made us feel like one of the family and that nothing was too much bother. I travel a huge amount with my work and hotels can be a drag but not when you feel more at home than when you are in your own home. If I ever go back to Venice I would not look elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
