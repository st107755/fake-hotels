I stayed here in August with family. I do not have a single complaint. They do it all to perfection. The owner Barbara and her staff made us feel like family, greeting us by name from the moment we arrived. Alex made all of our pre trip arrangements which included a private driver and water taxi from airport to hotel, a private tour of Venice and a driver to Florence upon check out.  The location was awesome. After touring all of Venice we all agreed there was no better location. It has a unobstructed view of the Rialto bridge from the lovely terrace where we enjoyed cocktails every night and made to order(by Barbara the owner) breakfast every morning.   The rooms were quaint and very clean.  I canâ€™t wait to return!!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
