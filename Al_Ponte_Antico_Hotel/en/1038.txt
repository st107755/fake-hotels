My husband and I were treated like royalty by the entire staff at this beautiful little boutique hotel overlooking the Grand Canal with a view of the Rialto Bridge in Venice.  We were late getting to our hotel and the staff called us by name when we walked in the door and told us they were worried about us.  It was very romantic at night setting on the terrace watching the gondolas go by while listening to a jazz concert on the the other side of the canal and drinking one of their specialty drinks from the bar. The room was small but comfortable and beautifully decorated in perfect Italian. They also serve a great breakfast buffet. I cannot say enough about our wonderful experience.  My only regret is that we did not stay long enough.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
