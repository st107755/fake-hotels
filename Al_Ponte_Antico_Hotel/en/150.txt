We spent 3 nights prior to embarking on our cruise. The hotel was very central and easy walk to the major attractions.  Our canal view room provided a great vantage point of daily life on the grand canal. Each morning began with a delicious breakfast on the terrace. Eggs/crepes on request by Matteo (owner/egg master) and Rosealba provided superb service. Olivier, Davido and Alex were always helpful with advice and recommendations.  On departure, our water taxi dropped us at the wrong cruise terminal - one frantic phone call to Alex and he had a second taxi there within minutes.  We would stay here again without hesitation and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small boutique establishment.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
