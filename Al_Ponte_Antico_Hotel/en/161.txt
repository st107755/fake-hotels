My husband and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Al Ponte Antico Hotel in Venice.   Everything was top notch! Matteo and Oliver could not have been more welcoming, professional, or helpful...their service was exceptional in all areas.  Our room was beautiful, spacious, and well-appointed. The breakfasts were delectable, and included delicious baked goods made by Matteo's wife, and tasty made-to-order omelettes and crepes by Matteo. Rosa-Alba, who served our breakfast, was wonderfully hospitable and professional. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace in the afternoon and evening with a cappuccino, enjoying the amazing view while relaxing.  We give this hotel our highest recommendation!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
