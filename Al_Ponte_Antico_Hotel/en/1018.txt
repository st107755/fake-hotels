We found this hotel thru trip advisor, and we're very glad we did.  We had to overcome hesitation at the price, but I have to say we were delighted with our "splurge".  The location is perfect, with a terrace for breakfast -- or anytime -- for overlooking the canal.  We are senior citizens & need a balance between wandering & resting.  This gave us the perfect spot for both.  When we needed a break, we could perch on the terrace & watch the fascinating world on the water go by.  The room was palatial and the owners treated us like visiting friends.  They both came to personally see us off on our water taxi to the airport with kisses.
