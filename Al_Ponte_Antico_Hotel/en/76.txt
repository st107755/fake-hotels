We are so very happy that we found this hotel.  Everything about the place is special: the location, the staff, the furnishings, the rooms, the comfort, the neighborhood, and the excitement of sitting on the lovely terrace and watching the world go by on the Grand Canal.  The breakfasts are lovely and we also enjoyed the late-in-the-day aperativi in the bar.  The location is perfect--you can arrive directly there by water taxi and the vaporetti stops are nearby.  At the end of the day, the neighborhood becomes quiet and it is a lovely area to walk around. Thank you so much to all the staff for making our visit perfect.  We hope to return soon.Read moreDate of stay: May 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
