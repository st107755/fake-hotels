Owner Mateo and his team - Oliver, Alex, David and Rosealba - are some of the friendliest people I've ever met. They really can't do enough to make their guests' visits a joy. What a truly gorgeous hotel, set close to the Rialto Bridge with fabulous views over the Grand Canal. My sister and I had the downstairs room, furnished with sumptuous fabrics and antiques and with its own lounge area and private outdoor terrace on the water-front. It was so lovely, that we found it difficult to tear ourselves away in order to explore Venice! The hotel was even able to cater for my vegan diet, with delicious sweet peppers and tomatoes on toast each morning. This really is a very special place.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
