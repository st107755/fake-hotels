This is an intimate boutique hotel, located on the Grand Canal, right near the Rialto Bridge. Wonderful terrace overlooks the canal; it's the perfect spot for breakfast (great buffet and made-to-order egg dishes), cocktails, and relaxing. Great location for walking everywhere in Venice or catching the vaporetto; also has private dock for water taxi. Best feature is the owner, Matteo, and his staff. All are extremely warm, friendly and knowledgeable about Venice. They can recommend a restaurant in any part of town, and willingly spend a great deal of time talking to guests about their stay in Venice and other travels. We would definitely stay here again, and next time be sure to get a room on one of the upper floors for more light, space and a view.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
