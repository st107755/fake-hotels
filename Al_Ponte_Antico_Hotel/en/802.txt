I chose this hotel based on other reviews and we were not disappointed but I can't give it a 5 for a couple of reasons. As everyone says, the location is wonderful (right by the Rialto bridge but also an easy walk to St Mark's). (Because of a water taxi strike, we had to walk in from the Vaporetto stop in the rain and we walked right past the laneway of the hotel the first time because there is no sign off the main street and it is a very discreet lane.) But definitely in the centre of things. The staff are very friendly and attentive and there are nice touches like guide books that you can borrow in the small lobby. We had one of the rooms just off the breakfast room/bar which looks out over the Grand Canal. Small details that could be improved to make the (very large) roomâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
