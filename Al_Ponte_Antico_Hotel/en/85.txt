We were thrilled to spend our 40th anniversary here! We could not have picked a more beautiful and welcoming location. We only spent two nights and it was not enough! The elegance, warmth, and romantic ambience was priceless and we look forward to returning! Matteo, the owner, is a true Venetian Prince who graciously welcomes you to his stunning palace on the Grand Canal. In the morning, after an amazingly restful night listening to the soft splash of water outside your balcony window- you are greeted with a selection of mouth-watering baked goods (crafted by the Princess wife) while Matteo cooks you a delicious breakfast. Every single member of the staff was exceptional in helping us be comfortable and plan our visit! We honestly can't say enough great things about this place.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
