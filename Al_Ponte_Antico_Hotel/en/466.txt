We chose this hotel because of the incredible location in Venice; not only was the location ideal but the rest of our experience exceeded all of our expectations. After a short water taxi ride from the train station we arrived at this incredible hotel. It seems as though no expense was spared... The rooms are spacious, amazingly elegant, and very comfortable (great ac is always a plus). The staff is the most friendly, thoughtful group of people and they offered many tips and advice for exploring the city of Venice. Breakfast was phenomenal.   Overall my stay here was probably the most luxurious, attentive hotel experience that I have had, and I cannot wait to return! Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
