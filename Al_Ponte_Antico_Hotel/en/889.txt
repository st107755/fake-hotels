We only had one night in Venice and so wanted it to be something special - and this place delivered on all counts.  It's in an old building that has been beautifully restored in a style very fitting with this amazing city.  The location is ideal with water taxi access on the Grand Canal and just minutes walk to Rialto Bridge.  With only 9 rooms the staff can truly focus on providing amazing service and we we found the recommendations for things to see and do and places to eat to be perfectly suited.  Thanks Oliver and Mateo !! We'll be back one day ...Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
