Beautiful hotel on the Grand Canal.  All employees welcomed our group of seven by name upon arrival and were very helpful for directions and recommendations!  Breakfast on the balcony with the view of the Rialto Bridge was wonderful.  (Made for great photos for day or night.)  The hotel is in a perfect location for site seeing in any direction in Venice. When we go back, we will definitely stay at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
