Wow, this place is amazing. It was raining when we arrived at the Venice train station so we took the water taxi which dropped us off at the hotel's private dock. The staff was immediately there to great us and help us with our bags. We were met by the front desk person as well as the hotel owner Matteo. They took our bags to our room while Matteo gave us a tour and history of the hotel.   We had a non canal room which was very spacious -- both the actual room and the bathroom. The hotel offers a grand canal view terrace that is open to all guests 24 hours a day. The view is phenomenal -- its right by the Rialto Bridge. If you want a drink or bottle wine, all you do is ask the front desk and it is done. Given the amazing terrace, I think the non view room is a better value. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
