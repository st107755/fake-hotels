The other would be Mateo's other property Locanda Orseola.  This family owns two properties in Venice and we won't stay anywhere else.  The owner is the kindest, most service-focused property owner we have met and all of his staff are hand selected for their service attitudes.  The Al Ponte Antico is perfectly located, just north of the Rialto bridge, and has the perfect patio overlooking the Grande Canal.  The rooms are luxurious and the breakfast is tremendous but the personal service (they staff always greet the guests by name) sets this hotel apart.  Trust the reviews - don't stay anywhere else.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
