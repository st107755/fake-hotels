This small boutique hotel is right on the Grand Canal near the Rialto bridge, perfect location for exploring all of Venice.  Everyone seems to know you as soon as you walk in the door!  The staff is friendly and helpful and make you feel right at home.  And Matteo, the owner, is full of helpful information on seeing Venice and is a great person to chat with.  The breakfast, complete with eggs cooked by Matteo fresh from his grandmothers farm, is delicious and made even more enjoyable when sitting on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  I'm sure I will be back in Venice sometime, and will not stay anywhere else but here!Read moreDate of stay: July 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
