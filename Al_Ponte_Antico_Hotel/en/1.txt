What a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable, all members of staff went out of their way to ensure we had the best possible stay in Venice. The terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge must be the best spot in town for an apperitivo. Breakfast was a delicious home made feast and the room was spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend for your stay in beautiful Venice. Read moreDate of stay: September 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
