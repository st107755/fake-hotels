Hotel has a fantastic location and gorgeous rooms. The view was awesome.  But what really sets this property apart from any other is the friendliness of the staff and the personalized service.  It was a perfect home away from home.  Best hotel stay we've ever had!  We had two rooms (the suite and a double) for a party of 6 people.  Breakfast each morning was perfection!  We loved the ambiance.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
