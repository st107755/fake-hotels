This family run business really makes you feel at home in the heart of Venice! They understand hospitality, and offer a special experience that can't be duplicated anywhere else.  We had a beautiful room with canal view (although the breakfast lounge was outside our window, so privacy was not the best).  Ask them anything, and they will help you get what you want! Definitely recommended!Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
