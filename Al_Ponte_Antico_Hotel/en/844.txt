We stayed in a 5 star villa in florence and a 5 star hotel in Venice on the rest of our trip, but in terms of value for money, customer service, this was by far our favourite. The staff were perfect, breakfast on the terrace was priceless and Thomas the concierge turned our complicated arrival to italy into the beginning of a wonderful romantic holiday!
