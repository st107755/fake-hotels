What a welcome,a gorgeouse hotel with the most attentive staff. We had a fantastic stay thanks to our wonderful host Matteo and his lovely staff. This small hotel is right in the heart of Venice and is a welcomed escape from the hustle and bustle just outside.  This is a must to stay in if you are visiting Venice. Thank you Matteo so much.
