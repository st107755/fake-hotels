I'll just add my accolades to all the others piled up here on TA.  I have to thank previous reviewers for their input, or we never would have found this small gem.   The location right on the grand canal is awesome, and the Rialto bridge location is just the icing on the cake.  If you're a light sleeper, make sure to request a garden view room toward the back, as the grand canal is kind of like Bourbon Street in New Orleans.... it never really quiets down.  The staff could not possibly have been nicer or more helpful.... the one thing we wanted was some great spaghetti alle vongole (clams), and they sent us to Antico Dolo, a small, 12 table restaurant nearby.  We were the only tourists there!!! Gotta love chowing down with the locals on some killer Napoli clams!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
