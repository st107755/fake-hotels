Have been to Venice many times. Have stayed at the Gritti Palace and the Danielli just to name two. My wife and I decided we wanted to stay in a small home-like palace and decided on Al Ponte Antico. Brilliant decision. This is a special place in a great location made just for you and your significant other. Bruno and Matteo as well as their terrific staff make this beautifully restored 14th century palace The place to stay in Venice. Bravo to these two visionaries. Now back to my sumptuous breakfast.
