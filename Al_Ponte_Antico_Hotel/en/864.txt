We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of May for our honeymoon and it was amazing.  Our room was small but everything else was so wonderful we didnt care. The staff are so friendy - everybody knows your name, the location is so central - you can always find your way home, and the terrace is wonderful - the best place in Venice to sit with a glass of wine and watch the world go by ! I have never written a review about anywhere else before, but I just had to share my experience and say a massive 'Thankyou' to all the staff. from Emma and Gary, Brighton, UKRead moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
