This place is like nothing we have ever been to before. The rooms are almost over the top in size and decor, it makes you feel like you are in an old James Bond film. There is also a fantastic view of the Railto bridge which is one of the biggest attractions in Venice. Matteu the owner will personally cook you breakfast which is really first class. Ok it's not the cheapest place we have stayed in, but for a trip to Venice its simply a must! Matteu and his crew are beyond excellent with their personalised service, they are extremely well trained, well mannered, well prepared and helpful. The rooms are fantastic and the views are spectacular. You can't beat this place in Venice it even has it's own jetty for arrival by private taxi (which we did!) Go there!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
