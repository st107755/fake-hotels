Wow! What a beautiful hotel in the perfect location. We came here on our honeymoon and cannot say enough about this place. We arrived by water taxi and the owner greeted us by name and took us on a tour of the property. They made us feel so special that it was almost more like a bed and breakfast. They gave us prosecco and we had it out on their amazing terrace with a view of the rialto bridge. The hotel is also in a perfect location to San Marco square. We highly recommend this place and would love to come back and stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
