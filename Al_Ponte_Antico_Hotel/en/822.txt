This hotel is not just made by its unique location and superb terrace, it is the extraordinary charm of the entire team.  I have never been anywhere, where the staff have greeted me by my first name as soon as we arrived (Thomas is amazing but perhaps we were the last room to check-in) but the same happened with every other member of the team as well. The atmosphere was so friendly and the help to book suitable restaurants, concerts etc amazing. We are determined to re-visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
