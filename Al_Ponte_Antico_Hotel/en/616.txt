We chose this hotel for our first visit to Venice, and it was perfect.  Matteo and his staff couldn't have done more to us feel welcome.  They were so helpful with sightseeing, restaurants, and directions.  The outdoor seating was a perfect place to have breakfast and cocktails.  The service was outstanding, and what a perfect location.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  I can't wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
