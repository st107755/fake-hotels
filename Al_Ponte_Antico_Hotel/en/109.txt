Al Ponte Antico Hotel  Grazie, Grazie, Grazie.  If you are looking for a hotel in Venice, you canâ€™t do any better.  This is one of the best hotels Iâ€™ve ever stayed in.  The rooms are gorgeous and the Grand Canal views incredible, but itâ€™s the personal service that surpasses any other hotel.  Matteo and his wife, Rosa making breakfast every morning, all of the staff greeting you by name and arranging dinner reservations and recommendations. Just incredible people and service. The world needs more small, family run hotels. Grazie and Ciao.  We are even more in love with Venice because of you. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
