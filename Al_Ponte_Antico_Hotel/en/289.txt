We stayed two nights with family in two of the nine rooms.  We were treated like family from our first minute on arrival until we left.  The staff were incredibly friendly and courteous.  The breakfast was wonderful - a huge selection of pastries, cheese and meats with coffees to match.  This hotel is a must stay for anyone wanting top service. The hotel itself is located by the Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal - right in the heart of Venice.  The rooms were spacious and bathrooms modern and comfortable.  The rooms also were like palaces suited for royalty. Our stay was special thanks to the gracious staff of Martell, Alex and "Uncle" Thomas!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
