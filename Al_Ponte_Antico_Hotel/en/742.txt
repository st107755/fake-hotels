Perfect location, great views of the grand canal & ponte rialto, attentive and personalized service.  We were very happy with our 4 day stay here.  According to the owner, Matteo, the hotel is a converted 16th century palazzo and the d√©cor is period appropriate.  Beautiful Murano glass chandeliers, high ceilings, carvings, tiles, the works.  Great buffet breakfast with eggs and crepes cooked to order.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
