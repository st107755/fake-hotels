My husband and I spent one night here on our honeymoon in July.  We were absolutely impressed, the hotel lived up to all of the great reviews on trip advisor!!  We arrived early the day of check-in (8 AMish)- although the room was not yet ready for us, the staff held on to our bags and Matteo, the owner, was gracious enough to offer us breakfast! We loved the terrace and the views of the canal were a great way to start off our stay in Venice.  The staff was incredibly gracious and made us feel completely at home right away!!!!   The room was spotless and beautifully decorated. We were surprised at the size of the room, definitly the largest one we encountered on our 12 day trip to Europe.  My only complaint is we only spent one night at Al Ponte Antico! I cannot say enough goodâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
