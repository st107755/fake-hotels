We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico this week and could not say more great things about our visit! The staff is excellent and extremely attentive while still giving you space. We were greeted by name, which is rare at any hotel, and they were one step ahead of us in terms of what we needed. The terrace overlooks the Rialto bridge and all guests have access 24/7. There are heat lamps too so even in late November we spent a lot of time out there! Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
