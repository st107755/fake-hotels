It's not often that the reality exceeds expectations, but with Al Ponte Antico it certainly did.  From the moment we arrived Matteo and his team made us feel completely at home and welcome.  This is a beautiful hotel, elegantly furnished in traditional Venetian style, right on the Grand Canal.  A highlight was the excellent breakfast eaten on the terrace, watching life pass under the Rialto Bridge.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone. A tip: Take a water taxi from the airport directly to the front door, a perfect start to your holiday.Read moreDate of stay: June 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
