Firstly the owner Matteo was absolutely lovely not to mention inspirational! His passion for the hotel was contagious!! As well as  Matteo, the staff were warm and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble - (not that I had to ask for anything) It was a privilege to be able to stay in such a beautiful hotel. I don't usually return to the same hotel twice, but in this case I will always make an exception. I can't wait to go back. I look forward to returning next year.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
