We have never received customer service to the standard of this hotel. You are made to feel welcome from the moment you arrive. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, we can't recommend this hotel enough if you want the true Venice experience. With views of the Rialto Bridge and superb rooms we didn't want to leave.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
