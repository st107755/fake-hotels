We stayed here for 3 nights in the Junior suite. Expensive - but well worth every penny!  Service was friendly and kind. I really think if I had asked for a bevvy of mermaids to frolick in the canal for my entertainment every morning, they would have tried their best to arrange it! Such nice people.  Breakfast was great, excellent choice - my favourite was the banana and chocolate pancakes! The dining room/bar is beautiful, although I understand in summer guests eat on the terrace looking over the bridge, which must also be lovely.  The junior suite is stunning - opening directly onto the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge. The room was beautifully furnished and very large. The bathroom was quite small (for a suite) but perfectly clean and functional.   Put simply, I cannot rate thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare
