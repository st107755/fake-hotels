This is a very unique and wonderful hotel. It has only nine rooms. The first thing that makes it unique and wonderful is the balcony that overlooks the Grand Canal. Breakfast is served here, and later in the day cocktails are served. The balcony is available all day for just sitting and viewing. It is difficult to describe the pleasure of sitting on the balcony and watching the activity and views of the Grand Canal. The second unique and wonderful factor is the staff. There is nothing that these people will not do to make your stay more pleasurable and worthwhile. It is like having your own personal chef, valet and concierge. I have never experienced anything like this before.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
