We stayed here on our first 2 nights of a 10 day visit to Italy.  What a way to start!  Our flight was delayed by over half a day, so we arrived at night rather than day which was intimidating since we didn't speak Italian and had no idea where we were going.  We contacted the hotel and they had someone waiting for us at the airport and took a private water taxi straight to the hotel.  Service from the beginning was awesome.  We stayed in the 1st floor room overlooking the canal and bridge and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.  It is a splurge but totally worth it for the room, views, ambience, service - all of it!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
