Probably one of the loveliest boutique hotel I've stayed in, simply gorgeous and packed with character. Matteo and his team are genuine, courteous, charming and of course warm and welcoming. The view from our room, the terrace.. made our brief sojourn in venice one to remember. The etro toiletries.. Very cool. If you have class then you'll enjoy this beautiful place. I miss it already.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
