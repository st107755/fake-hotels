Loved Al Ponte Antico so much.  Mateo and his staff are the absolute best.  We felt like guests of old friends.  We have stayed here twice and don't have one negative thing to say.  Service is over the top....The hotel is immaculate....We hate to give this little hidden jewel secret away.   We cannot wait to return to our spectacular find.  :)Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
