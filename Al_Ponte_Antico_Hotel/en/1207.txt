Myself and my husband just returned from a 3 night break at this wonderful hotel. We were treated like royalty from the moment we entered the hotel. Mateo and his staff are wonderfully welcoming and they did everything to make our stay warm and welcoming, We both travel extensively and stay in hundreds of hotels every year. This hotel is the best we have ever stayed in. Thank you for the wonderful memories, Julie anne and StephenRead moreDate of stay: December 2009HelpfulShare
