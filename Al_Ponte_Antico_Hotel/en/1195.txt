My friend and I have stayed in Al Ponte Antico during our trip there. It truly was our favorite hotel we stayed in. Clean hotel!  Location is right on the Grand Canal with the most amazing view of the Rialto. The decorated room is beautifull and large. Breakfast is very good every morning. the staff were fantastic. They made us feel like royalty from the moment we arrived! It was very hard saying goodbye to them 3 days later!  We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Venice! We recommended to other travellers to Venice to stay this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 20103 SavesHelpfulShare
