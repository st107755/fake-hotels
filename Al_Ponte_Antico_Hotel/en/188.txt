This is just a perfect hotel and the staff’s attention to our stay made it fantastic. Matteo’s warmth, cooking and enthusiasm for his hotel and city make Venice ever more special. I can honestly say that Oliver made the best spritz in our travels, and the breakfast and view are second to none. While we have all stayed in glitzier and more expensive hotels, if we measure our experiences by joy and contentment then none can match this hotel. Grazie Al Ponte Antico for allowing us to stay with you!  Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
