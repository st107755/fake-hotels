By any standards this is an exceptionally good hotel. In common with other reviewers the help they gave us before we have even stepped over the threshold was enormous. We have been to Venice many times over the years, but this has to be the best hotel we have ever stayed in there. Their restaurant recommendations could not have been better and the service we received from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was stunning. There are lovely touches such as the embroidered linen on the tables for breakfast, which incidentally is abundant and delicious. Matteo obviously inspires his staff to share his ethos of first class hospitality where nothing is too much trouble. The location is perfect as well, and the view from the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is world class.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
