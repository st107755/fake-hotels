We had stayed at the Orseolo hotel which they also owned and it is no longer in business and we had loved it and the service so we were so happy to see that they had this hotel and right on the Grand Canal with a view of the Rialto.  Barbara, Gigi, Alex and everyone is absolutely at your service and is amazing.  We felt so like family when we were there.  They truly cater to your needs and have the most wonderful breakfast in the morning - with Venice being crowded at night we came back and sat on our patio with the most amazing view and had our cocktails there with just steps back to our room.  It was a perfect location and their recommendations for dinner were always perfect.  We will definitely go back if we go to Venice again.  I miss you all!
