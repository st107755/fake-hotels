One of the best hotels we have stayed in.  Again we were greeted like returning to home after time away.  Breakfasts cooked for you (crÃªpes, eggs, bacon) and full continental breakfast and the best coffee.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms.  Right near Rialto Bridge with terrace overlooking bridge and canal perfect for breakfast and evening relaxing drinks.  Knowledgeable staff willing to assist with your every request and make ideal suggestions for dining and adventures.  Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
