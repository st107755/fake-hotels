This is a small, boutique style hotel near the Rialto Bridge and run by the most amazing people!  Before we even walked in the door Matteo and Romina were waiting to greet us, check us in and take care of our luggage.  Matteo is so calm and his demeanor almost forces you to relax.  Breakfast was amazing...yes you must try Matteo's eggs and his crepes!  So yummy.  The best part of this hotel, other than the charm and location, are the people.  They feel like family.  They all know your name, take time to talk to you and make you feel at home.  I can't wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
