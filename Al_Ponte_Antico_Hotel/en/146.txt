I’ve been fortunate enough to stay at some of the finest hotels in the world but I have never received the level of service and genuine warm welcome that I received from Matteo the owner and the staff of the hotel Al Ponte Antico. This boutique hotel by the Rialto bridge is exceptional but it’s Matteo and the staff that make your stay there a once in a lifetime experience.  You’re made to feel,like you’re a welcomed guest of the house.  I don’t think that I can say enough wonderful things about my stay at the hotel Al Ponte Antico.  It’s the only place that I will ever stay when I visit Venice againRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
