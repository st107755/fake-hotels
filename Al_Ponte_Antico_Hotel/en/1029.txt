Al Ponte Antico delivers the ultimate Venetian experience -- awakening to chocolate/banana/creme crepes and cafe latte overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge, gazing upon gondolas as they glide up the canal.  Does it get any better than this???  This petite, restored castle along the Grand Canal welcomes its guests with warmth and expertise. The walls and flooring are in pristine condition, and artifacts along the ceilings of the main room are being restored to their original castle condition. All on staff are professional and knowledgeable, finding us those special dining gems where the true Italians spent their evenings, giving us a glimpse of the true experience. The guests who share this space are the most discriminating, so many joy-filled hours were spent chattingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
