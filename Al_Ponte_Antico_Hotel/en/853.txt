The staff and service are nothing short of superb!!! You are treated like family and addressed by name every moment they see you.  The rooms are nice and spacious enough for 2 people. The location is in the heart of Venice. The Rialto Bridge is within a stones throw away and provides the scenery when sitting out on the balcony durung breakfast or capping off the night with a limoncello.  Take advantage of breakfast in the morning. Free wifi is provided with a username and password when asked for. I will not stay at another hotel when I return to Venice!!Read moreHelpfulShare
