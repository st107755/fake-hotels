Extraordinary is just one word for this hotel. The classic setting on the Grand Canal (with postcard views of the Rialto Bridge by day & by night) is just one of the many reasons you should stay here. The hotel is intimate & the decor is everything you imagine a Venetian palazzo should be... simply sumptuous. The owner Matteo is utterly charming, he knew all our first names (there were 6 of us) & used them in every conversation with us (as did all his staff). The other staff were perfect too, all of them courteous, friendly, so helpful & fun too. (Thank you Tomasso for your smiling face delivering our 3.00am coffee prior to our 6.00am flight!) The rooms were extremely comfortable, our bathroom was huge with a fabulous contemporary shower big enough for 2 or more people to share.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
