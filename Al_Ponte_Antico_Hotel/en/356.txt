Wow, what an experience Matteo and his team provide. The warm and welcoming personalised email that is received at the point of booking is just the start of the 5 star hospitality provided throughout. Nothing is ever too much from restaurant recommendations and bookings, water taxi bookings to local advice on places to visit and routes to take. The breakfast service is second to none with Rossanna waiting on you hand and foot and Matteo (the owner) cooking exquisite omelettes and crepes to your order. With a view of the Rialto Bridge (which is just 100m away) from the terrace to be taken in over breakfast or for afternoon aperitifs, the location is perfect. I cannot recommend the Al Ponte Antico highly enough!Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
