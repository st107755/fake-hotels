My first time to Venice.  Awesome old propery right on the Grand Canal.  Beautifully restored and elegant.  Staff is over the top polite, helpful and exude class.  We loved this place.  Got to visit with the owner and learn his "story" and the history of the building.  Owner wears a dozen hats and is always absolutely charming.  Rooms so elegant.  Gondolas cruising outside your window while viewing the Rialto Bridge, are you kidding me.  Breakfast buffet was lovely and then found it was only the beginning.  They then come to your table for custom coffee and what ever you want cooked for breakfast.  This was a total experience for us.  Coming back !!!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
