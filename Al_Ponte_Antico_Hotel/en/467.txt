I travel a lot for business and pleasure and there are not many hotels I would go out of my way to recommend to friends and family. But this is one of them.   Matteo and his handpicked team strive for excellence. They greet you by name during your stay, and nothing it seems is too much trouble. During our time there they ensured we secured last minute reservations at some of the best restaurants nearby and also ordered a special wooden water taxi for our departure.   And what about that canal view? Priceless. We could have happily whiled away the day watching the traffic go by with a spritz in hand. But there were sights to see and this hotel is perfectly located to walk to all of them.   Do yourself a favour and book this hotel. You won't regret it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
