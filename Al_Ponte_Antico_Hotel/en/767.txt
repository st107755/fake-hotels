The welcome and service throughout was exceptional, with genius warm and intelligent service, adapted to individual. This charming hotel is tastefully decorated with lots of attention to details, in keeping with its 1500 Palaceâ€™s origin. The restaurant for breakfast is very cosy with partitions for added privacy. The outside terrace was just amazing, with fantastic view, a perfect way to sample the good selection and tasty breakfast. For added comfort our room was supplied with beautiful slippers, bathrobes and Etro toiletries.  The location is perfect for any visit. It would be impossible to fault it. Watching the Grand Canal and the tourists on the Rialto Bridge, tucked away in the calmness of the terrace with a bottle of cold Prosecco, is surely the best way to end an evening.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
