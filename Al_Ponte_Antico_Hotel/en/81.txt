I was skeptical of this whole 'know your name' thing. A PR cynic, I thought of it as a way of branding. If it works, fine. Whatever.  Well, so much for that. I turned out to be a sucker for the style, professionalism and inexhaustible good nature of the Al Ponte Antico owner and staff. Not to mention the prime location of this lovely getaway. Approached from the Grand Canal or from the back street, we walked into an impeccable refuge where the only priority is making guests feel comfortable and welcomed. The terrace is a glorious retreat and the rooms have sound barriers to the Canal traffic. I may never return to Venice, but the charm that pervades Al Ponte Antico has been indelibly imprinted!Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
