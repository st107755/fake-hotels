I know this is the common theme of reviews of this hotel, but after a stay here you can't help but rave about the staff.  The owner, Matteo, is an incredibly charismatic host and he seems to genuinely care if his guests are enjoying their stay.  The location of the hotel is superb.  It was easy to navigate with the proximity to the Rialto Bridge and even though the hotel sits on the Grand Canal there is no foot traffic nearby so the hotel is quiet.    Our group of 5 was split into 2 rooms...3 members were in room 102 which has a view of the Grand Canal and sits right off of the dining room.  Very big room and relatively quiet.  My husband and I were in room 107 which is on the ground floor...no view, but very very quiet.  I loved this!  This is the first hotel I've ever been inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
