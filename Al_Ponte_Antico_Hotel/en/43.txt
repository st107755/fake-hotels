My husband and I spent four nights here for our anniversary. What a welcome, the owner greets you on arrival, shows you around his hotel of which he is clearly very proud. All the staff here are amazing, they truly can’t do enough for you, in fact the service that they provide is second to none! The location of the hotel is perfect, over looking the Rialto bridge. We were lucky enough to have a suite with a private terrace, which we enjoyed tremendously. The breakfast is delicious, with lots of choice. It was lovely eating on the terrace watching the grand canal. Thank you to all of the staff at Al Ponte Antico for making our stay with you so memorable. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else should I visit Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
