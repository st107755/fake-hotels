My wife and I never received a warmer welcome than here at this property.  Matteo is wonderful but how  his customer service attitude is seen in all of the staff is simply amazing.  I felt like they knew us for years.  The location is excellent, the rooms are great and the breakfast is super.  Matteo cooks a hellâ€™va omelet!  My wife left a piece of jewelry in the room and they recovered and put it aside for us to pick up.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare
