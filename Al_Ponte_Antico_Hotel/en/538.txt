The charming manners of the hotel staff really make your stay special. They are so welcoming and friendly. As Venetians they know and love their city and provide excellent advice about where to visit, eat and how to navigate. Our room very very spacious and comfortable. They gave us a bottle of prosecco to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Breakfast is delicious and customised with a choice of omelettes and pancakes made by Matteus. One of the greatest pleasures it sitting on the balcony watching the matchless view of the Grand Canal with an aperol spritzer. Thanks for the stay. Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
