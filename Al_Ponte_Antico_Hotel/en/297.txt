A fantastic hotel in an amazing location in Venice. Matteo and his staff made us extremely welcome during our 3 night stay. The whole ambiance of the hotel is just perfect, out of this world and the service is second to none. Nothing is too much trouble, so homely and helpful. This hotel is just something else and any future visits to Venice have to be planned around availability at Al Ponte Antico. We cannot thank Matteo and his staff enough. The view from the balcony, Rialto Bridge and Grand canal is brilliant, and equally brilliant either to have breakfast or to chill in the evening having a drink, just superbRead moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
