This hotel is very unique, defines its' own category. There is no hotel to compare to. The service is on a level we cannot describe in words, but priceless. The rooms are gorgeous, perfect to the slightest details. The food and drinks are impecable and so the advices of the owner Matteo where to go, what to see, where to eat. I just can recommend to everyone!Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare
