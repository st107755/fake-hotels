A lovely hotel in an amazing location. You can literally spend hours watching the parade on the grand canal go by. Beautiful Venetian interiors, friendly staff and the amazing terrace balcony are what make this hotel so popular. As mentioned by others the beds are very firm and we couldn't imagine spending more than a night or two sleeping on them. If a quick visit to Venice is your thing then this hotel is definitely worth a try.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
