This will be our 3rd or 4th stay at this marvellous establishment.  Everything about this hotel is outstanding - the Venetian decor, the cleanliness, the impeccable service,the friendly staff and Matteo the boss who treats his guests in such a hospitable manner.  When we think back at holidays spent in Venice we think of "Il ponte Antico" and its gracious staff.  We will be staying at Il Ponte Antico at the end of May for several days and are looking forward to seeing Matteo, Rosalba, Oliviero and last but not least, Armando once more.Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
