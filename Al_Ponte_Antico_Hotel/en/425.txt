There are a lot of hotels in the world that have great locations and facilities. And Al Ponte Antico is certainly one of them.  But what makes the hotel EXCEPTIONAL is the staff.  People are always more important than things.  From the moment you arrive, you are addressed by your first name. The personal service is outstanding.  You are treated like old friends.    And so, we give our thanks to:  Matteo, Alex, Rosalba, Oliver, Tomas, Max, David, and Merci.  You were all wonderful to us.  We hope to see you again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
