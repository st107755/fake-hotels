Thank You to everyone at  Al Ponte Antico for making our  short stay special.  The cappacinos and the homemade  breakfast was delicious.  Special thanks for the strawberry smoothy and the view from the terrace while we ate our breakfast was breathtaking!!  Thank you also for the bottle of Proseco left in our gorgeous room and booking a water taxi and making arrangements for another couple who was also booked on the same cruise as us, to split the cost.  Cant thank you enough!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
