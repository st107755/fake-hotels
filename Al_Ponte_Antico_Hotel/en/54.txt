We will be staying at the Al Ponte Antico in October and I have to say that the assistance that Alex at the hotel has given us is beyond description. Since it is our first trip to Venice I asked for advice on restaurants. He not only sent a list with detailed descriptions and recommendations, he was more than happy to book the reservations for us. Little things like this make you appreciate the service and make your trip more enjoyable. I trust his advice and am so glad we booked with the hotel. I can see why this hotel is rated as high as it is, they make the guests feel welcome and comfortable. See you in October! Thank you again!!! KenRead moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
