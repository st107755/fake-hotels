My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary in Italy.  Al Ponte Antico was the first stop of our 2 week trip.  When we arrived, we were greeted by name and welcomed very warmly.  Our flight was early, so our room wasn't ready when we arrived, but Matteo held our bags and gave us suggestions for lunch and how to get to the Rialto fish market (it would be closed on Sunday and Monday)  We got back to the hotel about an hour later and our room was ready early.  The room was very Venetian looking with a lot of character and it was huge.  We stayed here because we didn't want a generic hotel chain and we got what we wanted.   We had a gorgeous view of the grand canal as well.  The recommendations for dinner were fantastic...especially Barababao.  Breakfast was so delicious. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
