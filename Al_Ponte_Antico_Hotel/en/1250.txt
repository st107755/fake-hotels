Just like every review before this has described, the terrace and the view of the Rialto bridge (only a stone's throw away) is fantastic. We had the room adjacent to the terrace and most evenings we were the only couple out there which was very romantic. Matteo's passion about his hotel and Venice itself is very obvious and charming. I probably wouldn't stay here again purely because of the cost, but it was a very memorable boutique hotel which enhanced our Venice experience.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
