This really does live up to the great reviews ... we spent only one night here but it was a perfect start to our honeymoon. It is full of character, warmth and top notch hotel.  Would not stay anywhere else in Venice.  The staff are so friendly and make you feel so special ... we hope to come back soon.  Grazie!Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
