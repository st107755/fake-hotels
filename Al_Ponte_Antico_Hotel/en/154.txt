Many previous reviews covered details of the property and location and all the 5-star reviews are spot-on. The warmth and hospitality at Al Ponte Antico is second to none! Our stay felt more like a visit with great friends!! The pride and passion for Venezia was evident from the moment you step through the door. Matteo is a world class host! And everyone we met on staff, Alex, David, Oliver, Rosalba and Tomas were fantastic. Great recommendations on sightseeing and dining! Matteo does a great job with breakfast and his scrambled eggs, as others have noted, are wonderful. The breakfast breads and pastries are made by his wife. Amazing!! I only wish I could have thanked her in person. Take a moment and spend some time chatting with everyone taking care of you during your stay.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
