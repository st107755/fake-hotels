My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights the day after our wedding as part of a 3 week honeymoon in Italy. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect start to married life.  Matteo is the archetypal Italian gentleman with style and grace which emulates throughout his hotel. All of his staff are wonderful and their attention to detail is meticulous.   We were greeted with a bottle of prosecco in our room which we drank on the terrace which overlooks the Rialto Bridge as the sun was setting, how much more romantic can you get than that?   From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were enchanted by Venice and most of all by the Al Ponte Antico.   Semplicemente  magico !Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
