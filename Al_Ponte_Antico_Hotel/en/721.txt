We spent two amazing nights here, July 2nd & 3rd, and loved every second.  The hotel is located perfectly on the Grand Canal and right next to the Rialto Bridge.  The personal attention from Matteo and his staff was the best we ever experienced.  They truly make you feel like part of the family.  Breakfast every morning on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is a great start to each day.  Pictures do not do the location of this hotel justice.  We can't say enough about the hospitality given by Matteo and staff!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
