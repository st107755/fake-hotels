My husband and I stayed recently for two nights and what a highlight of our trip. Matteo looked as though he was out of italian vogue and had all the charm and grace you could ever hope for. The suggestions from Matteo and other members of the family regarding restaurants etc was like a little bit of our own Venice that no-one else new about. Don't look anywhere else when thinking of going to Venice. Superb in every way.  If it is within your budget ask for room 8 [junior suite] which has open windows onto the grand canal and you could never get more of a romantic setting. We travel the world on holidays and don't like dressing up alot of the time and at Al Ponte Antico we  did not feel uncomfortable being casual which also made our stay alot more enjoyable.Read moreDate of stay: June 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
