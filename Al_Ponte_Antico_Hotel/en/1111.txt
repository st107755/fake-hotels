Yes, this is a lovely hotel, but only average. The service is great, but they sent us to a place that was "local" but everyone was also American there. It's probably what they thought we wanted though. Did enjoy the stay but may stay somewhere else next time. I would describe it more along the lines of average and good. Pros: Location, breakfast, owner still on premises but says he would be leaving in a few months, antiques Cons: bathroom, bed, room decor, kinda dusty, Boutique hotel, yes; but luxury, no. I would recommend this hotel maybe to certain people.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
