My husband and I chose this lovely hotel to begin our two-week stay in Italy to celebrate our anniversary, and I fear everything after this will be a let-down.  The hotel could not be more perfectly situated in Venice and the rooms were beautifully appointed, comfortable, and remarkably quiet.  But the thing that makes this place special is its first-rate staff - Alex and Oliver were superb, the owner Matteo charming and accommodating, and Rosalba warm and attentive.  We will never stay anywhere else in Venice.  We eagerly await the day we can return!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
