Despite having read reviews prior to booking, the experience far exceeded our expectations. We wholeheartedly agree with all that has been written before. This is a really special place and we both feel very lucky to have stayed here. The service provided by Matteo and his team was perfect, nothing was too much trouble. His restaurant recommendations were excellent and, of course, his breakfasts on the balcony - with his grandmothers eggs - looking out over the canal will be an enduring memory. The attention to detail, particularly always being greeted by all of the staff by name, really was wonderful. We were made to feel very special. Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
