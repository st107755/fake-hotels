This small hotel on the Grand Canal was absolutely wonderful. The hotel which is an historic palazzo more than met our expectations. The room was quite large with a full bath. The owner and his staff provided excellent service. On our first day there we asked for a dinner recommendation and we were sent to the owner's favorite restaurant a small place with excellent food. They provided laundry service free of charge. And all of the staff knew and called us by name.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
