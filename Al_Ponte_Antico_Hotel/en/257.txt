With only 9 rooms this may not be for everyone, but if you like individual friendly service, a central location and a terrace with a million dollar view this is definitely the place for you.  By North American standards the standard rooms are small but very clean, have great furnishings and character.  The staff are all amazing and went out of their way to be helpful to us including arranging breakfast 1/2 hour early so we could have breakfast before our water taxi to the airport.  Sipping a Spritz on the terrace over the Grand Canal watching the traffic on the Rialto and on the canal was a particular highlight.  Just remember this is Venice where accommodation can be quite expensive.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
