Our family stayed in two rooms here while staying in Venice.  It was perfect.  The staff went out of there way to be helpful.  Every staff member made sure to introduce themselves to us and to know our names, and greet us every time they saw us.  Wonderful, small hotel with a beautiful view.  They excel in customer service.Read moreDate of stay: June 20102 SavesHelpfulShare
