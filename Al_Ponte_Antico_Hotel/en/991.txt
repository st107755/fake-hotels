My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary in March and were extremely impressed by this boutique hotel. Not only is the location fantastic and the rooms full of character and detail but the service is second to none. The owner Matteo, his brother Bruno and the rest of the staff are extremely attentive an courteous and made our stay truly memorable. The breakfast was of a very high quality -  if the weather allows it is very special to sit outside on the terrace overlooking the grand canal and Rialto bridge. If you are looking for quality and that little extra on your holiday we cannot recommend this hotel warmly enough. Matteo and Bruno are true role models for other aspiring hoteliers out there.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
