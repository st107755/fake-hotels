My husband and I spent a few days at this hotel earlier this month and were beyond thrilled with our experience. From the moment we arrived, the service and attention to detail was unparalleled. Upon arriving at the hotel, Matteo took my husband and I on a personalized tour of his hotel. He told us about the history of the hotel and a bit about Venice and showed us to our room, which was clean, beautifully decorated and had everything we needed.  Each morning, Matteo cooked breakfast for his guests too. The food was phenomenal and we were addressed by name by each of the hotel's staff each time we saw them. The terrace is a beautiful place for breakfast or a glass of wine before dinner. If you're going to Venice, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
