We booked two rooms for our family of 6 for a special occasion trip to Venice.  Room 109 was where the adults slept and had the most amazing view of the Rialto bridge from the patio.  Room 108 was for the four children - one double and one large pull-out couch and was more than big enough to stop them fighting.  From the moment we arrived (you can get a taxi straight from the airport to the hotel's landing on the grand hotel - totally avoiding the need to carry bags through the narrow streets), we were treated like a cross between royalty and beloved family.  Matteo and his team literally couldn't have been more welcoming.  Tomas, the night watchman who let us in, was utterly delightful and a fount of Venetian gossip.  Igor was brilliant at ensuring we had everything we needed. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
