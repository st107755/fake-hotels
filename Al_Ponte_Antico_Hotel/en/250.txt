We have just returned from staying at this wonderful gem of a hotel in Venice.  Matteo is passionate about his property and it shows in all the little details.  His staff is amazingly attentive to all needs. Each day you are personally greeted by your first name (a wonder to me as I can't remember anyones name).  Matteo personally cooks the breakfast every morning and it is a wonderful culinary treat.  He takes so much pride in making his guests feel at home and it shows in every detail.  The view of the Rialto Bridge is spectacular from the outside terrace.  Thank you Matteo for a wonderful stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
