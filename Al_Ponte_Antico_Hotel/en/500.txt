This was our first trip to Italy.  We started in Venice.  I chose Al Ponte Antico Hotel based on the reviews and the location.  The hotel does not disappoint.  Very charming and the staff could not have been friendlier.  Very committed to making sure we had everything we needed.  I would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
