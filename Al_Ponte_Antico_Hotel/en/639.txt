We have stayed here twice with Palio Tours for CARNEVALE. As your water taxi glides under the Rialto bridge up to the former palazzo you know you are in for grand treatment. Matteo and his staff attend to every detail. The breakfast room and bar is furnished as it was in the 1500's. The terrace overlooking the Grand Canal allows you to watch all the activity of the Rialto, the market and the gondolas. Best boutique hotel we have stayed in.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
