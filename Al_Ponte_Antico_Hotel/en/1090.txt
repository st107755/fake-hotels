This boutique hotel is in a great location, has great spacious rooms with views of the grand canal, provides a great balcony overlooking the rialto bridge where you can have breakfast and enjoy a late afternoon drink. However, what really stands it apart is the level of service provided by the staff. Every member of staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Nothing was too much effort for them. I spend a lot of time in hotels, but have never received better service.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
