This hotel is simply wonderful.  From the moment you arrive.... you are greeted by the owner and staff.  You feel so welcome.   The hotel is a restored Villa that is very impressive.   We had a beautiful room with a view of the Canal and the Rialto Bridge.  The staff is just sensational in making sure you enjoy yourself and will do anything to help make your stay perfect.   The breakfasts are unbelievable and are a true treat.  This hotel was a hidden gem for us.   It was perfect for our stay in Venice.... great location,  It far exceeded all our expectations.  We hope to come back to Venice one day and we will definitely stay here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
