The location of this hotel is great.  The staff are very welcoming and friendly.  The terrace overlooking the grand canal was probably my favorite spot in Venice.  Enjoyed being able to watch the action without having to be part of it.    We had a deluxe room with canal view and it was very spacious and well appointed.   The bathroom was a bit small but not unusual for Europe.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
