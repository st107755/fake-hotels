This hotel definitely set the tone for our entire trip to Venice.  Having visited Venice for a day last year in the middle of Carnaval, unknowingly, we did not have a good first trip to Venice.  Upon stepping foot into this hotel, we knew this trip would be different.  You really feel special and like someone important when you stay here.  Everyone knows you by name, they go out of their way to help you in anyway they can, and the made-to-order breakfasts are to die for.  Our room was beautiful and reminded me of a royal room.  The bar/dining room and balcony overlooking the Grand Canal are unbelievable.  A perfect way to unwind at the end of the day or for a little rest in the middle of the day.  All of these things considered, I think this is a great value for your money,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
