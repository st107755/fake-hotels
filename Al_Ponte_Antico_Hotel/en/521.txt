Stayed here for my friend's 40th birthday celebrations..can't fault it! Excellent central location with a view of the Rialto Bridge from the terrace.  All beautifully decorated in traditional Venetian style. Rooms spacious & well equipped. I had the best nights sleep there I've had for some time!  Splendid staff..couldn't do enough to help & we're so friendly at all times. Service was always warm & personal at all times. Breakfast was great..an excellent selection on the buffet table plus lovely eggs cooked to order. Highly recommended and would definitely be my first choice hotel next time I visit!
