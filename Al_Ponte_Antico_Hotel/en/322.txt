How do you decide where to stay? We wanted a great view, quiet, in this famously crowded and exciting city, and, above all, a civilized and highly competent staff. If that interests you, Al Ponte Antico is the best place.   Started by asking the impossible: two tickets for La Traviata at La Fenice. These were arranged flawlessly. Then, within 10 minutes of arriving, a glass of prosecco on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. Just wonderful.   Very personable and helpful without being overly solicitous. Perhaps that's the best thing about a great small hotel. Some say boutique. I say bijou!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
