This boutique hotel has the most amazing terrace overlooking the Grand Canal which literally brought tears to my eyes. The staff are extremely professional and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast is varied,fresh and delicious. I celebrated my birthday while in Venice and was made to feel very special by the lovely staff. Can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
