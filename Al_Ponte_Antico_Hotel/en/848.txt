We have just stayed for one night in this wonderful and beautiful hotel. The service and friendliness is wonderful and made our stay very special. We would fully recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to relax and enjoy Venice. Thank you to Marcelo and Alex for making our stay memorable. We will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
