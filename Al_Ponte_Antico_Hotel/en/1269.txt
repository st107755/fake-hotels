Just returned from a stay of 5 nights in the junior suite at Al Ponte Antico.    We are well travelled and we believe that the friendliness, hospitality, and level of service provided by Matteo and all the staff were of the highest level we have encountered on any of our trips.  Our stay at Al Ponte Antico made our stay in Venice an unforgettable one.    We hope to return in the not too distant future.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
