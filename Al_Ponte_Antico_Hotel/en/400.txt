This hotel is charming.  It is in a wonderful location.  As said before the service here is the best!  Everyone who works here is wonderful and knowledgeable. They all know your name.  We arrived later than expected, yet the welcome mat was out. Nothing is too hard or complicated.  I was a little worried about slipping in the shower and by that afternoon there was a brand new mat in the shower.  The breakfasts were wonderful.  Matteo has a real touch with pancakes (like crepes here in the US).  Eggs, coffee, fresh juice, pastries (baked fresh by Matteo's wife), etc. were wonderful.  This hotel was wonderful in every aspect.  Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
