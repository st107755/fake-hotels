After reading so many reviews about this hotel, we decided to book 2 nights here.   We already had a hotel  in Mestre through Priceline.com that we couldn't cancel.  However, even with the extra expense, we  were very happy with our change of hotels.         Matteo is the hotel!   He made us great breakfasts, coffee drinks, and guided us to restaurants in Venice.    Our room (#1 )was behind the balcony.  It was beautifully decorated with high ceilings, fabric walls and a large chandelier.    We paid 90e for our water taxi to the hotel (that seemed to be the going rate) from the airport.  It cost 80e to our cruise ship at the pier by water taxi.  It was very easy going by water taxi with all our luggage.   It was worth it....  We enjoyed our afternoons out on the balcony meetingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
