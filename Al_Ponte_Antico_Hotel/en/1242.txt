I stayed here for 3 nights based off the reviews on Tripadvisor and I can say they are all true. Its an amazingly nice hotel with unbelievable service. Honestly if you visit Venice and don't stay here you are barking mad. Only downside is that if you don't water taxi direct to it, it is a little bit hard to find as it is hidden at the end of a small alley (we walked past it twice before finding it) though because it is near the Rialto it is very easy to find again from almost anywhere in Venice because the Rialto is so well signed.Read moreDate of stay: August 20092 SavesHelpfulShare
