Always use trip advisor to book but have never been inspired to write a review before! Stayed Fr and Sat in August.  Amazing place, mainly due to fabulous 1)location, 2)rooms 3)staff. Location on Grand Canal nr Rialto Bridge is perfect. In busy time about 10 mins walk to St Mark's Square and easliy accessible by water taxi or by Vaperetto to Rialto and then 2 mins walk. View from upper terrace where you have breakfast/drinks is amazing and totally unique. Our room was perfect, booked Deluxe with Grand Canal view - was to die for and views amazing, even more the lower shared tearrace was right outside our room meaning you could climb out window to access....and even though is a shared terrace we were only guests to use it for entire weekend and sat outside room reading/drinkingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
