The Al Ponte Antico was perfect.  The location of the hotel on the Grand Canal cannot be  beat.  The hotel owner, Matteo has infused the staff ( Alex, Oliver, Tommas and Rosalba) with a high level of commitment to excellence and professionalism that is unparalleled. The hotel is right out of a post card or movie set. I would stay here again and give it my highest recommendation.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
