I don't want to be too complimentary because then this jewel will become too popular but the moment we stepped off the water taxi to the entrance on the Grand Canal we were entranced.  Our welcome was "We have been waiting for you."  Service is outstanding.  Everyone refers to you by name and is so personable, nothing is too much trouble.  We were there from May 4 to May 8 and had the lovely room 103 no view but the canal side patio is only steps away where we spent many hours enjoying our breakfast, or before or after dinner drinks.  The rooms are decorated Venetian style with lovely chandeliers, fabric walls and beautiful touches.  Our bathroom was large with an awesome rain shower.
