Matteo and his fabulous staff made our first visit to Venice as special as could be.  The location of Al Ponte Antico is not only spectacular but very convenient and makes the most of its Venetian heritage. Like other reviewers, we enjoyed breakfast and sunset drinks on the balcony overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge. Apart from the location, it is Matteo and his team's commitment to serving their guests that sets this property apart. Thanks again Matteo, Rosalba, Alex, Oliver, David and Thomas.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
