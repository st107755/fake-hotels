We found this hotel through the reviews on Trip Advisor and it was perfect from start to finish.  It will always hold a special place in our hearts and we would never stay anywhere else when we hopefully visit Venice some day again.  We spent 4 nights in February in this very special hotel with unforgettable friendly staff who go beyond the call of duty to make your stay memorable.   If you go you must book a room with a view of the Rialto.  Thank you again Bruno and Matteo and all of your staff for such a wonderful holiday we will never forget our stay with you.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare
