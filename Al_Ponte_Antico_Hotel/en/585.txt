I have stayed at many incredible hotels in the past few years but - not to take anything away from any of them- but this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. My room was a suite at the level of the canal and the unique view of the the canal and the Rialto bridge can't be beat. Beautiful room. Amazing breakfast. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and somehow everyone knew my name even thought I hadn't met them! Only 9 rooms so availability may be an issue but I can't think of any other reason not to stay here. Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
