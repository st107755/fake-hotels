We just got home from a 10 day trip to Italy. We ended our trip in Venice, and I am so happy that we stayed at this hotel.  The staff is over the top friendly and accommodating. Matteo greeted us so warmly, and Alex and Oliver took such great care of us! Oliver especially was so wonderful in seeing to our every need while we were there - directions, bags, WINE, and always a smile when he addressed us by name.  The balcony view overlooking the Rialto was a highlight of our trip. After a week of strenuous travel, it was so nice to spend our last two days relaxing and just taking in the beauty of Venice.  I hope to be back soon!Read moreDate of stay: October 20131 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
