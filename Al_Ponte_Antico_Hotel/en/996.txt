The hotel was wonderful. The staff went out of their way to be helpful, giving us recommendations for everything from how to best organize our sightseeing to where to find delicious non-touristy restaurants. Their guidance allowed us to have a personal experience in Venice. The room itself was large, clean, comfortable, and well-decorated. The breakfast was lovely, with a great buffet as well as eggs prepared to order in a very charming room. Drinks on the terrace overlooking the Rialto bridge made a perfect respite between sightseeing and dinner.  Arriving from the airport by water taxi was an enchanting introduction to the city. This hotel is truly a jewel set in the middle of Venice's bustle.Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare
