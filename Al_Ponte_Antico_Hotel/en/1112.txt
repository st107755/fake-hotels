From the moment that we began our 5 night stay at the Al Ponte Anitico Hotel the hotel owner Matteo and his wonderful staff (including Oliviero) made it clear that they were there to make our stay the best they could and that we had only to ask and they would do thier best to accomadate us in any way they could.  Matteo himself cooked a wonderful breakfast with fresh farm eggs any style whose yolks were almost orange and the tastyest we have ever had.  We were able to eat our breakfast every morning on a lovely patio overlooking the Grande Canale and the Rialto Bridge.  Our beautiful, well appointed room was  decorated in traditional Venitian style and also over looked the Canal.  The hotel is in a wonderful central location to all things fun in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 20102 SavesHelpfulShare
