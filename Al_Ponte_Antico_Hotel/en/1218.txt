This hotel exceeded my expectations and made my stay in Venice truly magical. Matteo and his staff are incredible and so friendly. From the moment we walked through the door we were treated like royalty. The location is perfect and close to everything. Morning breakfast is excellent, with a huge buffet spread of hot/cold items, and Matteo cooks up eggs to order perfectly. The hotel also has a terrace looking over the grand canal, which is available to hotel patrons 24/7. We'd sit on the terrace at night with some grappa and soak in the beauty. An incredible hotel in an incredible place. When I return to Venice one day, this is where I'm staying.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
