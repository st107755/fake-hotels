Worth every dime!    Could relax with a drink on the terrace all daylong.   Overlooks the Rialto Bridge and quite a lot of the Grand Canal.   Wonderful staff, owner gave us many suggestions for restaurant.   Special thanks to Tomas, the nightperson.   He fixed us late night drinks on the terrace and also brought us snacks.   We wanted for nothing, except to be a permanent resident of the hotel!    Will definitely return!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
