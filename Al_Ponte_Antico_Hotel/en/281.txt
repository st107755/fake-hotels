Carefully renovated furniture, fine decoration and a fantastically located terrace at the Canal Grande with a view to nearby Ponte di Rialto. The owner - Matteo - loves this hotel so much himself that he was in the house every morning; he even prepared breakfast for his guests. All the staff was attentive, friendly and courteous. With these people, this beautiful small hotel is a perfect choice for those who truly love La Serenissima, its heritage, culture - and bacaros.
