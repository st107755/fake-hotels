thanks again to all the team at Al Ponte Antico.  The warm welcome, (water taxi to private dock at the hotel and then welcomed by the team), and the excellent service (thanks for looking after us so well from wonderful breakfast on the balcony, to pre dinner drinks and of course your recommendations and bookings for dinner - all three restaurants were wonderful) This hotel is in an excellent location, with a picturesque balcony over looking the grand canal right - excellent base to explore this beautiful city.   And the staff feel like friends.   thanks again - hopefully we will be back soon (and definately looking forward to visiting your new hotel in Tuscany next year.) xRead moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
