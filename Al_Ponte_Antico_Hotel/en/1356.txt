My bride and I started off the Italian leg of our honeymoon at Matteo's hotel.  Perfect location yards away from the Rialto Bridge.  It's also probably the only hotel with a veranda on the Grand Canal.  Sitting there watching the traffic go by with a glass of white wine was perfect.  The room was fantastic:  Matteo's attention to detail and design were evident in the textiles, chandeliers, glassware, etc.  The staff was A+ as well.  Matteo had excellent recommendations for dining as well as helpful advice on best times to visit Venice's busy tourist sites.  Although our USD took a beating, this hotel was worth every penny.   Our highest recommendation for this hotel.  Thanks Matteo for an incredible start to our honeymoon! J and J BurkeRead moreDate of stay: April 2008HelpfulShare
