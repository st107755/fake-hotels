To stay in this gem of a hotel was wonderful. The very personal concept carried through by all the staff was a new experience to us, but it felt authentic. Our room was cozy, clean and in classic Venetian style - with very modern bathroom and facilities! The view from the terrace is just magical and we felt like in a dream from the first minute. Breakfast was very good with eggs prepared individually for each guest by the boss, himself!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
