We were lucky enough to stay at the al Ponte for three nights last weekend. From the moment you arrive at the hoptel until the moment you leave, everything is perfect. We were luycky enought to have the junior suite with a terrace which gave us a unique view of the canal, but even without this room, the hotel is perfectly placed for anything you may want to do in Venice. The terrace bar gives you a view of the Rialto bridge and the breakfast is everything you could wish for. Would not stay anywhere else in Venice, Andy & BernadetteRead moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
