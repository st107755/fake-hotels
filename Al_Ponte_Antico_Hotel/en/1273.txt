My husband and I stayed here for two nights recently as part of our 25th anniversary trip. The only reason I didn't give a perfect score is that I don't believe one goes to Venice for it's value and our room had no view.  Our room was categorized as a "classic room".  Having said that, I agree with all the good things that have been said about this hotel.  It's a cozy boutique hotel.  The owner and his team treat you as if you are special guests in their home.  We have never been treated so well in a hotel.  We had an absolutely wonderful and relaxing time and would definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
