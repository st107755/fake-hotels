My sister and I have just spent 6 nights in this fabulous place.  Overlooking the Grand Canal the view from the deck is breathtaking.  The owner and staff Matteo, Alex and Oliver are welcoming, friendly and helpful. No request is too much.  Decorated with a unbelievable Italian flair, fabric walls, crystal lightning, ornate but classical.  Although they only serve breakfasts (which are amazing, fresh omelets, crepes etc.) there are plenty of restaurants around.  Only 10 mins walking from St. Marks and a 3 min walk to the vaporetto the.ocation canâ€™t be beat.  This was our second visit and we will return.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
