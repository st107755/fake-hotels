There are many hotels in and around Venice, but I doubt we'd have found one much better. Matteo and his excellent team of staff make you feel welcome as soon as you arrive - they are so friendly and helpful and genuinely cannot do enough for you. The hotel is absolutely stunning and the view from the terrace looking over the Grand Canal and The Rialto Bridge cannot be beaten. Such a great location to get around Venice and you can always find your way back by following the 'Rialto' signs. Get a private boat transfer to and from the airport if you can, blow the budget, it's worth every penny!Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
