We stayed at Venice last year and i hope we will come back. The hotel has a superb location, overlooking the the Rialto Bridge. It's a family hotel with an eccellent service. I found everything I've seen on the site. We were very lucky with the weather and the hotel is simply amazing. My personal advice for travelers.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
