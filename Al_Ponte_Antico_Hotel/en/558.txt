From check in to departure, this hotel is wonderful.  One of the best places we have ever stayed in.  They help you with your bags, provide an exceptional breakfast, provide maps and directions, provide travel tips, and all of the help knew our names.   This place is impressive.  The patio overlooking the Grand Canal was amazing.  We sat and visited with other guests, drank wine, and just watched the world float by.  This was the highlight of our honeymoon - LOVED it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
