Absolutely amazing hotel. Matteo and his staff treated us like royalty. The view from the patio is second to none. Room was very comfortable. Breakfast was sensational. Location was perfect. My wife and I stayed here for 3 days on our honeymoon in mid-June and could not have been more blown away by this hotel experience. Best experience we've ever had. Thank you to Matteo and everyone on his staff!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
