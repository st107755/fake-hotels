My husband and I recently stayed 3 nights at this great bed and breakfast.  We were thrilled with this hidden gem.  The terrace was fabulous, breakfast was amazing, the location is fantastic, however, the BEST thing about this hotel is the wonderful cast of characters that you will meet.  Mateo and Oliver were terrific!  They truly made our stay in Venice MAGICAL ~ Thanks!Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
