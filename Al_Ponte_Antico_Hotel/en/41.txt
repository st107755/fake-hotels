We loved our 3 night stay here. We had a canal view room that was comfortable. It felt like we were staying in a private home as it only has 9 rooms. We enjoying many glasses of wine on the terrace looking at Rialto bridge and watching the constant boat traffic. The staff was fabulous- Matteo, Barbara, Alex, Gigi, Igor, David and all others. Included breakfast was excellent with all food prepared by Barbara and Matteo.They recommended and arranged our dinner reservations, private tours, and our arrival and departure by water taxi. Very special hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
