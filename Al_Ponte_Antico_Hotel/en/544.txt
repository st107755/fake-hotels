My sister and I were greeted by our names the minute we entered the door.  That is just an example of the very personal and detailed service that is given at this beautiful, small hotel on the Grand Canal.  We had a wonderful stay! The room was beautiful and the breakfast was delicious.  Mateo, the owner, made us eggs to order every morning.  His entire staff always addressed us by name and was extremely helpful in every way. We really enjoyed the balcony overlooking the canal.  It was delightful watching the boats go by at sunset each evening.  We were even helped to our taxi at 4:30 in the morning when we had to go to the airport.  I cannot recommend this hotel more!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
