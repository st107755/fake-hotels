My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in April. We were greeted by Matteo and his team who made us feel very welcome. Al Ponte Antico is a small boutique hotel on the grand canal with probably the best view while at the same time having a quiet and relaxing feel. The palazzo dates from the 1500s and is very tastefully decorated with Murano glass chandeliers and Venetian furniture. We loved the terrace so much, it was so relaxing to just sit there and watch the world go by. Breakfast was amazing as well, Matteo would at times personally cook for the guests. It felt like home away from home and missing it already.   We will definitely love to stay here again.  I recommend this hotel for couples without children as it is small to accommodate unhappy babies ;))Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
