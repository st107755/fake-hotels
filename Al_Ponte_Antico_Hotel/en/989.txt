We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. The hotel is easy to find and close to the Rialto Vaporetto stop and the Alilaguna which takes you to the airport.The room was amazing, overlooking the Grande Canal and the Rialto Bridge. Matteo and Bruno make you feel welcome from the moment you first arrive. They were extremely helpful with sightseeing and restaurant tips. Although chilly when we were there, breakfast on the Terrace overlooking the hustle and bustle of the Canal is truly memorable. And the breakfasts were delicious - both the omelette and the crepes are worth mentioning!! A Wonderful Venetian Experience!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
