Just back from a 3 night 4 day stay in Venice for my wife's birthday. Booked the Al Ponte direct and have had plenty of helpful emails prior to our arrival with tips and information. Bruno and Romina were brilliant. They arranged our water taxi from Marco Polo Airport and it couldn't have been smoother. To arrive at the hotel and to step off right next to our bedroom (Room 108) had us smiling. Such a special way to arrive and to be greeted by Gigi. The Hotel is a wonderful warm and welcoming place and the staff made us feel like Royalty from the minute we arrived. The standards are high at the Al Ponte and staff seem genuinely pleased to help in any way. Matteo seems very passionate about his work and it certainly pays off as this was a very high quality stay.It just felt soâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
