The title says it all, I am sure there are plenty of wonderful hotels,but this one just blew us away. My wife has put this hotel down for our weekend trips. From the moment we arrived to our departure,  we were made to feel special. Thank you to Mateo, Olivero, Rosabela and the rest of the staff.  I would recomend this hotel for that special occasion, a honeymoon, anniversary or weekend trips. We stayed for 2 nights before joining the Ruby Princess for a 12 day cruise, I could write forever but less is more, go and see for yourself.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
