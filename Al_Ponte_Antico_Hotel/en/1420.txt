We stayed at the Al Ponte in Room 109 (Junior Suite) 5-7th March 2004 for our 25th Wedding Anniversart.  The view from the 3 windows is specatular just a few Meters from the Rialto Bridge. The room is Huge! amazing for Venice.   Breakfast is very basic a few rolls and crossant, so don't bother going to the breakfast room have it delivered to the room and enjoy watching the world go by, Gondolas, Buses and the daily life on the Grand Canal, also great for sipping champagne ! I would not stay anywhere else checkout great rates from ratestogo we paid 200 euro's per night for the room. Check out the website for the Al Ponte, the details & photo's are 100% acruate.Read moreHelpfulShare
