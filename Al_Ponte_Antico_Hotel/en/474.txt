How can I even begin this review, the biggest relief is that the hotel looked exactly like in photos, we were so excited to visit venice and stay in Al Ponte we were scared our expectations were too hight but its just as beautiful in photos as it is in person. Cant speak much to the food because we ventured out for every meal we wanted to eat as much as possible everywhere, but, that aside, the customer service was 5 stars, we were helped with directions, recommendations, and given lots of suggestions. This is really THE hotel to stay in when you visit Venice and this is the city to visit in Europe!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
