The hospitality by the entire staff is amazing.  Many reviews will say the same thing.  If you are only going to splurge one time on your trip for a hotel this should be it.  Sitting on the balcony eating a full made to order breakfast or having an evening drink is amazing.  Watching the boat and gondola traffic on the canal is awesome.  I especially enjoyed seeing the working boats making deliveries in the mornings.  This is an experience you can only get at Al Ponte Antico Hotel.  UNIQUELY AWESOME!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
