I booked this hotel for my wifes 40th Birthday as a result of the Trip Advisor Reports. I was determined not to book somewhere we could be let down on our first visit to Venice and all our expectations were surpassed. Not a big Hotel but loads of personality and right close to where everything is going on but quiet at the same time. We stayed in the Junior Suite with double doors opening straight out onto the Grand Canal - amazing - if you like the water and want to watch the Venice world go by on the Grand Canal whilst sitting back in totally comfortable surroundings you will love this room and hotel. The staff - Mattheo, Bruno and all others were fantastic and you could not ask for better service. The hotel is very personal and the staff do greet you by your names all the timeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
