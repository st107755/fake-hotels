Wonderful hotel - antique furnishings, beautiful sumptuous large room next to the terrace. Knowledgable, charming, helpful hosts. Gorgeous terrace overlooking the canal and Rialto Bridge for breakfast, coffee in the afternoon, or a glass of wine in the evening.  Heaven!  Breakfast was simply wonderful with a great array of different foods. A wonderful experience which I will treasure always.  A Very Special Place .. 10/10Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
