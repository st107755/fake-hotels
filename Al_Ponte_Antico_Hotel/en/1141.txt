I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We booked it based purely on Trip Advisor reviews, and I am so glad we did.  The hotel is beautiful, the room lovely (the bathroom  could have done with a little update, but was perfectly serviceable) and the location perfect.  Being adjacent to the Grand Canal there is some noise, but it did not bother us in one of the front rooms, in the slightest.  As others have said it is lovely to sit on the terrace and watch all the activity.  It is Matteo and his team who make this place so special.  Nothing seems to be too much trouble.  I hope very much to visit Venice again in the not too distant future, and would certainly stop at Al Ponte Antico again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
