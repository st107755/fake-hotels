We stayed at this wondeful little hotel last week for our first visit to Venice . The help and advice we received from Matteo, Oliviero and all the staff was second to none.  All the restaurant recommendations were excellent ; the advice on where to walk etc was brilliant.   We were very grateful to be right in the centre but in such a calm oasis.  They made us feel so welcome instantly - we can not wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
