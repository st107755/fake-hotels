The location of the hotel is fantastic -- near all of the most interesting attractions in Venice, but the view from the 2nd floor balcony steals the show with a spectacular view of the Rialto Bridge. The lounge is quite beautiful, and our room was spacious. Most memorably, the staff was extraordinary in their efforts to greet every guest by name on every encounter.  My only complaint would be that the tub/shower in our particular room was cramped for my 6'2" frame (but that's hardly an atypical problem for a tall person from the 21st Century spending time in buildings constructed for people living in the 1500s. It's a small price to pay for otherwise excellent accommodations.  Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
