This was our second stay at this hotel.  The location is near the Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal.  The staff is very friendly and helpful from the owner Bruno to all the others we interacted with including Alex, David, Tom, Oliver and Rosalba.  The breakfast is fantastic and includes omelets and crepes made to order by Bruno. There is a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal available to all the guests.  The rooms are clean and very nicely decorated.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
