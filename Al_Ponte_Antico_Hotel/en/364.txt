This was our second time here. It's quite a splurge for us but so worth every cent. The location is all you could ever dream of for your Venice hotel. We stayed in a suite, 2 teenagers and parents, with a window opening onto the canal. It's just so exciting to lean out the window and nearly touch the water and see the passing traffic. The staff are incredibly warm and attentive and obliging.. Matteo makes beautiful omelettes in the morning, and is so helpful re places to eat etc. Wifi is great. Beds are very comfy. Magnificent stay!Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
