MAGNIFICO!! Our stay at Al Ponte Antico Hotel was PERFECT from start to finish. My husband & I stayed here for 3 nights, and loved every single minute. The wonderful staff could not have been more attentive or welcoming: 6-Star service from all the team, especially Matteo and Alex. We chose this small Hotel off the Trip Advisor community reviews and we WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!! There is nothing the staff won't do to make your stay a memorable one - first class service in the true sense of the word. The rooms are large and comfy, and the breakfast served in the dining room each morning is so special, cooked to order by Matteo himself. The location cannot be faulted right by the iconic Rialto Bridge - an easy to walk to within all Venice as to offer, or treat yourself to a waterâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
