This hotel has recently - 2 weeks ago - had a change of ownership and is now run by the superbly hospitable Matteo. We had the most idyllic stay in Venice aided by Matteo's passionate knowledge of the city that he is only too willing for you to tap into.   Nothing was too much trouble.  Fun, friendly and charming service set this hotel apart and surpassed all our expectaions. Sitting on the gem of a terrace with a chilled beer (drinks are very reasonable by Venetian standards) gazing out onto the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal it is easy to lose a few hours observing the hustle and bustle. Location is ideal, a short walk from the main water buses that serve the major attractions. Read moreDate of stay: April 2007HelpfulShare
