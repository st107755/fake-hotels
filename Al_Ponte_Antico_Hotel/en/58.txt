We are happy to return time and time again to Al Ponte Antico. The welcome is as warm as ever and it was delightful to meet Barbara for the first time. The wonderful staff take so much care of the guests and their restaurant recommendations are excellent. They even made sharing a massive storm sweeping through Venice quite fun! Thank you for another superb stay in this perfectly located, beautful little gem of a hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
