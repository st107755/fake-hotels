Arrived into Venice on the orient express ,after that wonderful experience the hotel was going to have a real uphill struggle to impress.We traveled by water taxi and arrived to a fantastic welcome from the owner and a brief history of the hotel.Everything was superb and of a very high quality.The position of the hotel is possibly the best in Venice.Im trying to rack by brains to think of one area that could be improved......but it can't be done..Thankyou  for a wonderful stay and for being fantastic hosts.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
