This is an amazing former palace, I think about 500 years old, now converted into a nine room hotel. The rooms are large and beautiful. Two rooms have large 10 foot high windows looking over the Grand Canal.  The other rooms may not have as good view but they cost less.  All rooms have access to a beautiful patio on the edge of the Grand Canal next to the Rialto Bridge.  Matteo, the owner, makes an amazing breakfast (included) it will be a memorable moment eating outside, it is also nice to have drinks overlooking the hustle and bustle going by.  The entrance is uniquely located in a secret alleyway, but it is more amazing to arrive right to your door by water taxi.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
