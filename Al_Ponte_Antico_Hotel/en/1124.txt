Wow! This B&B is truly amazing!  Matteo and all of his staff know each guest on a first name basis and their hospitality was outstanding!  The view from the outdoor bar/terrace was one of a kind!  The rooms are beautiful! This is the place to stay when in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
