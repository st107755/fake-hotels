In our years of travelling we have rarely encountered hospitality and service which has been so polished and guest centred. Mateo and his team run a beautiful and historic hotel, which they clearly cherish. Every single time we met with a member of staff we were engaged warmly on first name terms. The whole team goes above and beyond. Tremendous location, fabulous views, and a great terrace for an excellent breakfast. We really can't speak highly enough of this truly exceptional boutique hotel. Small, but perfectly formed and  service which is exceptional. We stayed in the junior suite, which was worth every penny. We were so close to the gondolas we were almost aboard - to the extent that the gondoliers posed for photos and cracked smiles and jokes on the way past the window!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
