The Hotel is well situated next to the Rialto with a terrace to chill out in the evening or the place to have breakfast on the Gran Canale. Our suite was spacious and well equipped. The manager is really hepful, friendly and makes the whole experience complete. When I'll return to Venice, I know where to stay. Read moreDate of stay: June 2007HelpfulShare
