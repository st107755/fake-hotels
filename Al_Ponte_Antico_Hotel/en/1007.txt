From the moment you arrive at Al Ponte Antico you're greated by such warmth and gusto! The hotel is right in the heart of Venice, but sheltered from the hustle and bustle down a quaint little street. The hoteliers inform you of the building's history - a 14th Century Palace, no less, and the rooms are sensational. Breakfast is an event in itself you'll look forward to each morning! You can choose from hot and cold dishes and Rosalda will cook you any egg/pancake/crepe or omellette dish you like! The staff are always on hand to make divine coffees and teas and engage in conversations. Teamed with the incredible beauty of 'Al Ponte Antico' is the charm and kindness of its staff and owners. They delight in telling you the history of Venice/the hotel and how to get free Gondalaâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
