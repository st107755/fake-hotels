We stayed in this boutique hotel for three nights on the last leg of a personalised tour of Tuscany and Venice. It is situated close to the Ponte di Rialto and is less than 10 minutes walk from St Mark's Square; so ideal for a sightseeing holiday or a short break. Given the location of the hotel in the heart of Venice, our room (facing a wall) was very quiet with minimal canal traffic noise.  This hotel is very difficult to review because if you use the same criteria as one applies to a typical large 4* hotel then then it would highlight a number of shortcomings. The main attraction of this hotel is that it is unique; with only 9 guest rooms and a management team who are ultra friendly (every one is on 1st name terms from the moment you check-in) so what is there not to like.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
