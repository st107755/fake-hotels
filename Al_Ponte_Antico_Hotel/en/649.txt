This hotel is located within just a few steps of the Rialto bridge and easy walking to St Mark's, the service is superb and everyone goes out of their way to be helpful and friendly.  Our room was lovely and the view from our room (101) was breathtaking.  We arrived late and the night porter was waiting for us, and everyone on the staff went out of their way to make recommendations and see if you needed anything.  The only real negative, is as others have mentioned Room #101 is right off the terrace and right off the breakfast area, so we were kept up late by people on the terrace and woken early by people dining for breakfast.  Minor issue was the bed, it was a bit hard, but overall we were in Venice and the location and service were amazing, and breakfast/coffee was excellentâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
