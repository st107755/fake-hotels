What a beautiful 2 days! With my whole heart I regret that our stay was so short. You know instantly upon arrival how special the experience is going to be, because the owner Matteo and his beloved crew make it so personal. Our family of four (including two young teens) shared the junior suite with the patio that sits directly on the Grand Canal and right next to the Rialto Bridge. It does not get any better than sitting on that private patio (or the lovely shared terrace just off the breakfast room) with a bottle of wine, looking at that view...a serious "pinch me" experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
