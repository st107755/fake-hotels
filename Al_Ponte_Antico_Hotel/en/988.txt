Image a hotel where the owner welcomes you - arriving by Watertaxi straight from the airport - with the first names of your entire party. Where all staff - and I mean all staff - already knows your kids names. Where the staff - and I mean all staff - is constantly eager to make you feel truly welcome, without ever being to much 'in site'. That unique and authentic service was given to us by Matteo, the owner, during last easter holidays in Venice. On top of that, it has the best location, straight on the Grand Canal, overlooking the Rialto bridge. Charming rooms and an astonishing diner, with original frescos, superb coffee, etcetera. A wonderfull experience, and really hard to get these days. Proves the case of small boutique hotels versus global hospitality chains.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
