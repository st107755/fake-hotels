I selected this hotel based on the reviews found here on Tripadvisor, and believe me, all the accolades were spot on.  I've never have experienced such superior service and hospitality than from Matteo and family.  From the moment we arrived, the enitre staff was extremely accommodating, offering us anything from dining recommendations to unlimited cappuccinos.  The entire staff made it a point to know us by name and when my fiance' and I checked into our room, there was a bottle of Prosecco on ice on a platter of rose petals waiting for us.  The attention to all the details, the location of the hotel on the Grand Canal, and the amazing staff has made this my hotel of choice the next time I visit Venice.  Look no further, as you will experience the best service of your lifeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 20102 SavesHelpfulShare
