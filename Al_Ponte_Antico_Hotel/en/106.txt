We have just experienced a simply magical stay in this  beautiful hotel . Everyone associated with the Antico Ponte made us feel so welcome and part of a family . The hotel enjoys a superb lication on the Grand Canal near the Rialto  with the centre of Venice being a simple 5 minute walk . We have rarely felt so genuinely welcome as we have here . We will certainly return .Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
