We arrived from Rome via train for 4 days. Greeted by first name! Words cannot express how wonderful our stay in beautiful Venice was, but this hotel is unlike any other we have experienced. Matteo, the owner and his staff are all so special. They love their life and work. From the pretty, well appointed rooms, great breakfasts & evening cocktail hours to the lively chats on the balcony overlooking the Rialto Bridge! Always at the ready for Venice history, a great dinner recommendation or any other need.  The eggs in the morning cooked personally by Matteo are not to be missed. He throws love in them, you can just taste it!  We thank you Matteo, Oliver, David, Rossalba & Ines. We wish you all well and will be back!Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
