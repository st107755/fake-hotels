We stayed here at the end of June with our just high school graduated grand daughter. What a treat! Its to be expected that some people are not comfortable here.Yes, it is old. Yes, it is difficult to keep such a property in perfect working order.If you want something "cookie cutter", don't stay here. The entrance is slightly problematic to find at first, but so what? Our room was lovely and comfortable. The shower was strange, but usable. Where do you put bathroom facilities in an ancient palazzo? The facilities were spotless and the service exemplary.The staff was most helpful with their suggestions and breakfast and pre dinner cocktails were a delight.The staff,too,all of them, were great! We highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
