With impeccable service, spectacular views and ideal location you'll have to look no further than Al Ponte Antico hotel to make your stay in Venice perfect. My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights at Al Ponte Antico for our anniversary and it was an amazing experience.  Matteo, Alex, Rosa and all the staff at this hotel are the friendliest I've met and the most helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  Views from the terrace are amazing and to watch the Grand Canal come alive in the morning and go to sleep at night is a privilege not everyone gets from a hotel in Venice.  If only I could award a higher rating for this hotel!  Can't wait to visit again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
