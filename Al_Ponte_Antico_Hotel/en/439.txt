This boutique hotel was perfect in every way. My husband and I stayed here for my birthday and the staff (especially the manager) made it super special. It was luxurious in every way. The decor, atmosphere, views, location and food were second to none. It literally was the perfect weekend. Thank you! We've already decided that we will be visiting again very soon!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
