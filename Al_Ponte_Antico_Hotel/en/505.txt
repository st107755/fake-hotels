I don't think we have stayed in a hotel like this before Arrived by water taxi at the hotels waterfront The hotel has only 9 rooms Very central to the Rialto bridge so shopping aplenty. You can pretty much walk anywhere important in Venice (but expect to get lost) or catch the water bus  The hotel is bed and breakfast only but your omelettes, or crepes are cooked for you and are delicious. Eat out for dinner or tea ALL the staff will know your names and will talk to you. . a very personal touch The hotel is recently renovated and is very baroque. Our room was spacious and very comfortable (no wallpaper just fabric!) Thanks to Matteo Alex Gigi Rosealba Oliver and the rest. Can't thank you enough  Wonderful stay. We'll be back!
