Booked a 2 night stay at The Al Ponte Antico based entirely on reading previous reviews and I have to say, the customer service and attention to detail at this hotel are second to none.  As mentioned in other reviews, Matteo (the owner) greets you on arrival at the hotel by your first name, and along with all the other members of staff, he is always available to help with reccomendations for places to visit / restaurants etc.  The terrace which overlooks the Grand Canal & Rialto bridge is wonderful, as are the breaksfasts which are served there every morning. The omlettes in particular are great.  The bedroom was larger than I expected,  and the large bathroom with jacuzzi bath was another bonus.  Venice is a beautiful city and it would be difficult not to have great time there,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2008HelpfulShare
