We have stayed in this amazing hotel 4 times now , nothing changes you still get 100% from all staff . It's such a very personal hotel , from the minute you step off the water taxi you are called by your name . Today is my husband's birthday and the hotel knew with out being told and we returned from a lovely day out to find a bottle of prosecco . Thank you so much to all the staff ,We certainly don't want to go home tomorrow Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
