Al Ponte Antico enjoys a fantastic location overlooking the Grand Canal. The rooms are beautifully decorated with rich fabrics and lush curtains. It is a Venetian palace offering the old Splandor together with modern comfort. Breakfast is a real treat. Matteo and Barbara the owners are perfect hosts and togethet with their staff they make you feel at home. We arrived in November 2019 when Venice was hit by high tide and floods. We could only admire the way Matteo handled the situation. We felt sheltered and pampered in this charming hotel and loved every bit of it. Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare
