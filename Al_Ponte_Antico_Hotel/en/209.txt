We recently stayed 3 nights in the suite looking towards the Rialto bridge. The view was to die for. This hotel is #1 for a reason, the location, the staff, the decor, the ambience and after meeting the owner Matteo you can see why. Such an inspiring man to listen to and hear how his dream was brought to life in recreating a palace. That is exactly what this is, a palace. The staff are an absolute credit too and treat you like royalty from the moment you arrive.  Our first visit to Venice and I am so pleased I chose this hotel to stay in. This will be the first of many return visits to Venice and Al Ponte Antico. Thanks Matteo & StaffRead moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
