We have just returned from Italy and the jewel of the trip was our stay in Venice. Matteo and his staff are truly unique and only add to the beauty of this hotel. I would highly recommend the Jr Suite with windows that open onto to the grand canal. It is mesmerizing to watch Venice go by literally out side your window. Breakfasts on the terrace are amazing. It is hard to believe that Matteo cooks personally for all guests. Venice is loaded with tourists and it was so enjoyable to return to our very private suite on the canal each day. This hotel is going to be difficult to book as word gets out. Matteo has only had the property since April and has plans for renovation. So reserve well in advance!Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
