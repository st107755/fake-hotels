A very special place.  We visited for 3 nights and was the best experience we have ever had.  All of the staff are lovely and make you feel very special.  Superb location - the terrace is a lovely place to sit and have breakfast or a drink.  Matteo is charm personified!  Oliver, so lovely and helpful and made our trip extra special.  We returned 6 months later with our daughters to a cheaper hotel (couldn't afford this for 4 of us) and wanted to show them where we stayed.  We were welcomed back like one of the family and were allowed to sit at the terrace with our daughters and enjoy a drink.  Ask for recommendations of where to eat - we were given good advice each time.  Exceptional people, expectional place!  Thank you Matteo and team!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
