Our stay at Al Ponte Antico Hotel was the most wonderful experience that we could have hoped for. My husband and I stayed there last July during the first few days of our honeymoon. We got so spoiled here that we ended up comparing the other hotels we later stayed at in Italy to Al Ponte Antico.  The other hotels just didn't measure up to the warm hospitality and friendly atmosphere that the staff of Al Ponte Antico offered.  My husband and I felt so welcomed and cared for by the staff. We still talk about the amazing breakfast Barbara prepared for us each morning!  We stayed in the patio suite which was absolutely gorgeous and had a breath taking view of the grand canal. I had read reviews that mentioned noise, but we didn't hear any noise and this was not a problem at all.   â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
