We went to Venice for a wedding anniversary celebration with friends.  Having stayed at the Gritti Palace before(see separate review) we chose this from reviews.  I must admit that I was sceptical.  Reviews were so good I wondered if they were contrived in some way? THEY ARE NOT! This is a very special hotel. From the moment I first emailed them to the moment we left we were treated (by name) like honoured guests in this tiny hotel.  Rooms are Venetian and and well equipped, breakfast is perfect (and I mean perfect - try the pastries), restaurant recommendations great, hotel is manned 24 hours so that you can sit on the terrace late at night and have a glass of wine - shall I go on?  Best of the staff are also wonderful - all of them. For balance I have tried to find a negative.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
