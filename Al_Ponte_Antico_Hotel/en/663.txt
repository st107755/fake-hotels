Everything is perfect about this hotel. Our arrival by speedboat was magical and from our hosts first welcome we were pampered and made to feel very special. Nothing was too much for the hotel staff who advised us about walks, restaurants, shopping and generally relaxing and having a great time. Breakfast is just amazing with savouries and sweet delights and the views from the terrace are breathtaking. Simply the best hotel experience I have ever had. Thank you Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
