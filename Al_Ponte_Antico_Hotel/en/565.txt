We could of stayed anywhere in Venice but I decided to stay in a small or boutique hotel and I could not have made a better choice.

Everything that has been said about Matteo and Alex and the rest of the staff is no exaggeration. When I return to Venice, I will stay at the Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
