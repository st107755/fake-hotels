Incredible place to stay.  From the location with breathtaking views of the Rialto Bridge to Matteo and his amazing staff - Oliver, Tomas, Rosabella and Alex - this was the perfect choice.  Matteo cooks breakfast every morning in addition to the juices, fruits and pastries that are available. The cappucino is the best I've ever had - I had 3 cups at breakfast. Matteo lovingly describes his renovations of the property and his passion shows through in everything.  The terrace over the Grand Canal is a wonderful place day or night for taking in the atmosphere or chatting with fellow guests.  Can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
