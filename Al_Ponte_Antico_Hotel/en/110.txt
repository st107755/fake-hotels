Where do you start. The service, the history, the views and the staff are superb from start to finish. Situated as close to the Rialto as you could want a stunning balcony sets you up at breakfast for the look, feel, sights and sounds of Venice. We stayed over the period when Venice had its worst floods in 10 years. The staff were brilliant and looked after us superbly well despite the reception desk/ground floor area being flooded. A real class hotel, in a superb area so well situated about a 10 min stroll from San Marco and 20 mins from the train and bus stations. The grand canal at the back door and loads of really good local restaurants the hotel are ready to recommend on your door step. We simply would not go else where when we go back.Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
