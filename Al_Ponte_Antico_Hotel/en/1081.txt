We just returned from our trip and had an amazing time.  We DID NOT want to leave.  Thank you to everyone at Al Ponte Antico. Their service was superb.  The rooms were very comfortable.  There was absolutely nothing to complain about.   We had a complimentary breakfast on our balcony every morning.   Our dinner arrangements were also made by the staff at the front desk.  We are planning our next getaway there for 2012 and we want to bring our entire family this time.   Thank you again for a great vacation.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
