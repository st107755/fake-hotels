We booked after reading all the reviews and having just returned from a 3 day break we can honestly say that we weren't disappointed.Even before we arrived the service was first class with a welcoming e mail and help in sorting restaurants for the three night with excellent recommendations.On arrival we were met and shown around and throughout our stay nothing was too much trouble.In our opinion you would have to go a long way to beat this hotel.the location and view are tremendous and just add to the whole experience. We can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
