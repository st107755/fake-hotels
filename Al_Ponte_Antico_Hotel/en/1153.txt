We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico in June and from the minute we stepped through the door we felt like royalty.  The owner Matteo has beauifuly restored the hotel and his has carefully chosen the best staff in Venice as I have never received such amazing customer service especially Oliver! The hotel has one of the best locations with a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge. We spent many hours watching the world go by with one of Olivers famous Spritzers. This is not the cheapest option but if you can afford it this hotel must be your Number 1 choice, you will not be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
