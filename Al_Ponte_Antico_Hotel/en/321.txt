My stay at Al Ponte Antico Hotel in early May was a wonderful experience. Matteo and all is staff were very friendly and attentive. I felt so welcome the minute I entered the hotel! The location is terrific and the terrace is such a highlight! The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed and the breakfasts were delicious. I look forward to my next stay at this jewel of a hotel, and will bring my family to enjoy it with me! Again, thank you Matteo and your incredible staff for all your assistance and to help make my stay in Venice so lovely!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
