Amazing hotel , in a briliant location with the most friendlist staff, What more do you need!! .I spent hours looking through tripadvisor at different hotels but decided as the Al Ponte Antico had been 1st for 6 months it must be good . It was probably a little more than i wanted to pay but was well worth it  and  if i am being honest it  even exceeded my expectations. Matteo  the owner and Oliver afternoon staff were both brilliant in making our stay so enjoyable , they advised excellent itinerary and restaurants. This is a small family run hotel that you feel totally comfortable  from the minute you walk in.  My advice would be to "Just book it" as this is one of best and most friendliest city hotels i have stayed in.a1++++++++Read moreDate of stay: March 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
