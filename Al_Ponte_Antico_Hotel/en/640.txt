Absolutely beautiful 15th century building. The staff were outstanding and accomodated our every need. The breakfast was lovely and eggs made to order were excellently prepared by Mateo. The view from our room was breathtaking...watch the gondolas go by with Rialto bridge in the backdrop. You won't regret staying here!Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
