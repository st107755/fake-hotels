This hotel is by far one of the best hotel experiences I ever had. Our suite opened up onto the grand canal, I could look out my window and see the Rialto bridge. We waived at the gondoliers as the went past our window. Matteo and he staff knew you by your first name, and really wanted to get to know you. The breakfast cooked by Matteo, was amazing! The hotel is in the center of Venice, 5 minutes to the Rialto bridge. 10-15 minute walk to Saint Marks Square. I will never stay anywhere else in Venice! Thank you Matteo for a incredible four days!
