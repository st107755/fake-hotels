This hotel is the only place to stay in Venice. We stayed one night before our cruise and then again after returning to port.  The staff make you feel like you are the only one staying in their hotel. Every place they recommended for lunch and dinner were excellent and they even called the restuarant before we went. The breakfast each morning had everything one could desire. Each evening we had drinks on the terrance, which is right on the main canal!Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
