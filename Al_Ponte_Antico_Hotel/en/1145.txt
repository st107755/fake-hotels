As if Venice hadn't already knocked me sideways with it's sheer loveliness in the summer sun, Al Ponte Antico didn't disappoint. Truly sublime down to the last detail. Tiny but exquisite and added to by the characterful owner Matteu Peruch and his charming team.

Just amazing!! Our room, the most basic, was a little on the tiny side but beautiful and with a great bathroom.Read moreDate of stay: July 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
