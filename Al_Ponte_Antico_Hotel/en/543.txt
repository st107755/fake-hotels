What a find!  I thought that for such a small hotel to be in top 10 it must be good and I have to say it was outstanding!  All the staff are lovely and so welcoming and helpful,  Matteo has an amazing hotel and great team and makes wonderful breakfasts!  All of this in a fabulous location,  we'll be back and we will most certainly will stay here.  Couldn't recommend highly enough. Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
