What more can I say.  From the minute we stepped off the water taxi, we were greeted by Alex, who among the other staff members, made our stay memorable.  Yes this is an expensive hotel, but worth every penny.  From the staff, the grounds, the view, the room, the incredible breakfast and what a great central location.   I will definately stay there again.  All of the rooms do not face the grand canal.  But if you have the time make a early reservation and request if you can.  Mateo was the best host of all.  He cooks a great breakfast and gave us an explaination of the grounds.  What a history it has.  We were always treated very well.  These pictures don't do it justice I'm sure.  Very romantic eating breakfast or a late night drink on the balcony.  Amazing time.  Thanks againâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
