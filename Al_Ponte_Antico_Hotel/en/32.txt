Given that we are not great fans of writing reviews, although we read them willingly to plan our trips (tripadvisor is our bible), we must make an exception for this hotel. What else to add to the nth previous comments? The hotel has an unbeatable location, a small, unique in Venice, terrace where, ideally, it would be to plant the tents to not stop enjoying the incredible view. The owner is proud of his home and owns another hotel near the main piazza (St. Mark). Great staff! A very special thank to Oliver for his generosity and spontaneity and the great restaurants' suggestions; and a special gracie to Gigi. Gigi is the perfect Italian gentleman, a TERRIFIC ambassador for the hotel, for the city, for Italy. Thank you for sharing your love for your country. Thank you Rose tooâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
