We loved this hotel and the entire staff. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. Matteo was an exceptional host, and we enjoyed a lot of time on the terrace watching the world go by on the Grand Canal. The hotel's location is perfect, especially with the boat dock for direct water taxi service. And the daily breakfast was fantastic. We had so much fun wandering the streets of Venice, and know when we return some day, Al Ponte Antico will be our home away from home.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
