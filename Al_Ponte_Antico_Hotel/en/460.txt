This is a  Venician mansion converted into a small boutique hotel.  It has a second floor interior bar (with tables and booths) and an exterior veranda overlooking the Grand Canal very near the Rialto Bridge, from which you can watch all the gondola and other boat traffic. Feel free to bring in your own bottle of wine. The breakfast in the morning is very good and beyond what you experience at other hotels, complete with the owner making chef-quality, made-to-order omelettes.  One to two staff members are always in the lobby waiting to help any way they can, and they greet you by name as you come and go.  The only problem we experienced was finding English television channels.  I won't stay anywhere else when in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
