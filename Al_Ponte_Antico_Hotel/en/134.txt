We've never been treated as well as we were by owner Mateo and his staff: Oliver, Alex, David, and Rosa. They could not have done more to welcome us and make our stay more enjoyable. The breakfast felt like a trip to a bakery, Mateo even made delicious omelets on request. The rooms were exceptionally clean and very nicely decorated in true Venetian style. Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
