We were 4 couples staying at this hotel from 9/23-9/25.  Our water taxi from our ship was greeted the owner Matteo at his dock in front of the hotel.  Matteo introduced himself to our party, and from that point on, all of us were greeted by our first names.  We booked 4 of the smaller rooms, and they were great.  Good size, clean and comfortable.  The service at the hotel was the best we have seen anywhere we have traveled.  Much personal attention.  The terrace was wonderful, where you can have home made breakfasts (cooked by Matteo), while watching the water traffic near the Rialto bridge.  In the evenings, we would have a glass of wine or Matteo's special Spritzer and watch the evening water traffic.  This was truly a magical place, and a beautiful ending to our 3 week tourâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
