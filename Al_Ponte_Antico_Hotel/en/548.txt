This time in Venice my wife and I were with some other friends and couldn't stay with Matteo and his staff as we have in the past.  But we did stop by to say hello and show our friends the beautiful breakfast room and terrace on the Grand Canal.  They were impressed when Oliver greeted us both by name, although he hadn't seen us in 2 1/2 years.  But we weren't surprised; that warm personal welcome is normal at Al Ponte Antico.  A few days later, when we ran into a serious transportation problem, I called Matteo and he helped us out of the jam.  My wife and I feel like we have a second home in Venice.  Stay with Matteo and you will too.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
