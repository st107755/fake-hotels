Just returned from a 4 night stay at Al Ponte Antico.  We could not have chosen a better hotel...location and service.  Matteo, Oliver and the rest of the staff are gratious, warm and accommodating.  You never once felt rushed or bothered by asking questions about the area - restaurants, museums, travel etc.  Everyone is willing to please you and help make your stay not just at Ponte Antico memorable but in Venice as well.  Thanks Matteo, Oliver and everyone else for adding another alluring reason to return to Italy!  Bene grazie!    Nick and Blythe.. Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
