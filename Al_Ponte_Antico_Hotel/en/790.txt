Firstly the people - the owner is amazingly welcoming, helpful and passionate about his hotel and Venice. It is clearly a standard he sets for the rest of his staff who were much the same.  Comfortable and detailed rooms full of charm. It's a small cosy hotel - not anonymous but still professional.  The location could not have been better being nearly adjacent to the Rialto bridge. As you amble through the streets of Venice - signs to the Rialto bridge are everywhere (?50-100). Whilst it's easy to get lost in Venice you could never have trouble finding your way home.  We also found it to be in the middle of all the things we wanted to see in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
