Let me just cut to the chase: Believe me, everything the prior reviews have said is true! 1- Location? Can't be beat 2- Accommodations? Masterfully restored  3- Service? Like being being a family member 4- Intangibles? They're all here!   Matteo, (the owner), and Alex, ( not his real name but he says nobody except his mom    calls him his real name), and the other staff members REALLY care. They treat you like family. There's really nothing new left to say that hasn't already been said. I promise , you won't be disappointed.    NOTE- Yes the price is jaw dropping, but please DO take the water taxi!  It's a magical experience, delivering you literally right to the doorstep of the hotel, and will save you starting out you stay sweaty and out of breath from hauling your luggageâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
