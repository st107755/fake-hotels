My wife and I stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for two nights including our 5th Aniversary based on the reviews from this site.  The reviews painted a perfect picture of what we were to expect.  We booked the Junior Suite and were on the ground floor with a window 2 feet above the Grand Canal.  I can't imagine another hotel in Venice can match the feeling of looking out that window.  I was prepared to spend much more to stay and one of the well know 5 star hotels in Venice, but thankfully found this gem.  As far as value goes this hotel was exceptional. As for the service, I knew what to expect from the reviews, and while i typically would probably chose anonymity over excessive personal attention, I felt incredibly at home with Mateo and his staff.
