We felt like royalty.  Location, location,  location.  Add superb service unobtrusive but always available staff, luxoriously decorated rooms, and delicious breakfast in the terrace overlooking the grand canal and the Rialto bridge. Be sure to arrive by water taxi to their private dock.  Highly highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
