Imagine you have a friend, Matteo who is the gracious owner of a beautiful small palazzo on the Grand Canal overlooking the Rialto Bridge from a lovely terrace. It is run  by a efficient and warm staff who seem to know you the minute you step off the water taxi at their dock. You have arrived at the wonderful Hotel Al Ponte Antico.   With only nine very well appointed rooms and a sensation breakfast each morning personally prepared by Matteo himself. Nothing is left to want. A group,of six of us spent six memorablel days here in early April.  Sitting on the terrace with a glass of wine as the sun sets and the boats go by is magic in this great city of magic. After several times in Venice we are grateful to have found the Al Ponte Antico. We would never stay anywhere else.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
