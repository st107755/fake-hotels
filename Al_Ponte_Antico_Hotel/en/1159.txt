Mattheo and all the staff made us feel like friends more than customers. This wonderful old charm hotel is right next to the Rialto bridge and an easy walk to any attraction. It also has easy access for a water taxi straight to the hotel. The buffet breakfast is superb with a large selection. The rooms are big with high ceilings and comfortable beds, ours had a fantastic view of the grand canal. Enjoying a evening cocktail on the hotel verandah is a pleasure. I cant wait to come back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
