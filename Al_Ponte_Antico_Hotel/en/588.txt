Wow! I am still in awe of Al Ponte Antico. It is a wonderful, beautiful hotel. The view of the grand canal is magical, and the rooms are furnished in a classy Venetian style. The location of the hotel is perfect, you are close enough to everything... Yet when you are inside the building, you can sit on the balcony overlooking the grand canal and watch the world go by in complete relaxation. But what made our stay so wonderful was the staff members. There was nothing we asked that wasn't quickly done. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice... It was an unreal experience that we will remember for years to come. Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
