What a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.  Staff so welcoming and friendly, they greeted and remembered all guests by name.  Breakfast was delicious, cooked by Barbara and even on her day off when Gigi cooked it 👍 we would definitely recommend a stay at this fabulous hotel especially if you like a personal touch.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
