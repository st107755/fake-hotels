We stayed in a canal front room at this wonderful B&B for three nights. The staff were as friendly as it gets; we were treated like family.  The breakfasts we filling and we appreciates having coffee and drinks available throughout the day.  The room was spacious and generally quiet, albeit a little noisy on and off because we were literally right on the main canal. It was worth it for the ambiance â€” with a view of the old bridge from both of the windows in our room. But for a quieter room you may wish to ask for a room more centrally located in the B&B.Read moreDate of stay: December 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
