A delightful first stay in Venice. The Al Ponte is situated in a perfect place for visiting every part of Venice. The hotel is small and intimate. The decor is beautiful, and the service from the staff was truly outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble - booking restaurants, suggesting times to visit busy attractions, down to where to get the best ice cream!Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
