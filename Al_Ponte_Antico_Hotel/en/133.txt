This hotel is fantastic and Matteo can be very very proud of everything about it. I had the pleasure of spending a few days at this lovely hotel and I will definitely be returning at the earliest convenience. Everything about it is wonderful and the staff make it even more so by making a fuss of every one of the guests, making it a very special experience indeed. I can not thank them all enough for making it an unbelievable visit to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
