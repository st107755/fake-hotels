We stayed for three nights in December departing at 4:30am Christmas morning. From start to finish this lovely hotel was on point. Location, staff, cleanliness and value were just perfect. Mateo and his staff were delightful  I love boutique hotels and this one is no exception. They realize the little things that don't cost a penny can make a big difference in making an exceptional impression.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare
