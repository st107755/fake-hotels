We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary.  Everything was beyond wonderful.  From Matteo greeting us at the door by our first names, to the champagne waiting in our room, and breakfast on the terrace, it was sheer perfection.  Our room overlooked the entrance on one side and a small street on the other.  In the morning the smells from the bakery filled our room. *sigh* Wish we were there now.  Venice is absolutely enchanting and staying at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel made it even more so.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
