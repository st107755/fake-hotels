Off a little alley which made it seem like an oasis right in central bustle steps from Rialto Bridge.  Gorgeously appointed, most rooms generously sized (but not all equal - the suites, which are pricier, are significantly larger and afford truly unbelievable views water's edge of the Grand Canal.  Some rooms with no view at all).  Comfortable beds, greatly appreciated AC, good wifi.  Make sure to set aside time to enjoy the bar overlooking the canal's activities, which oftentimes you can have to yourself.  A beautiful setting also for their huge and delicious breakfast, where we found the owner making our omelets and crepes every morning!  But what we truly loved about this place is that every employee learned our names, cared that we had a good time, and helped us enjoy Veniceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
