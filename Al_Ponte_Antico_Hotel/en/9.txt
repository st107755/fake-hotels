The Hotel is perfectly situated. On the Grand Canal next to the Rialto. It doesnâ€™t get better in Venice.   The view from the terrace will captivate for hours and did so repeatedly.   Matteo and his team are fabulous. Service is exceptional, nothing is too much to ask and everything is done with care and attention. You are made to feel special, part of the family and truly home away from home.   This is a special place in a special city with wonderful people.   I look forward to my return.
