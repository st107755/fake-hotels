It has all been said before but it bears repeating.  Matteo and his team have created (to my mind) the finest hotel experience in Venice.  The Al Ponte Antico sets a new standard for service and every aspect of our stay (for our wedding anniversary) was perfect.  We particularly enjoyed pre-dinner drinks on the wonderful terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge.  Stay here.Read moreDate of stay: April 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
