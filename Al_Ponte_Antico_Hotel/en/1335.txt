I stayed with my husband in Al Ponte Antico for two nights and just from the day  we arrived we recieved a warm welcome from the staff and especially Matteo who was just wonderful in every sense.  No matter how hard i tried to explain how friendly he was i will not do him justice.  We just felt at home and he made sure we are being taking care of by all the staff.  For breakfast one can not ask for more...Matteo who made delicious crepes and omelette in addition to the wide variety of food to choose from,which you can all enjoy having in the beautiful terrace. The hotel had an excellect view and the room was really spacious and clean. All of which made our stay in Venice really worthwhile.Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
