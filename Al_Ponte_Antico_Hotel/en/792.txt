I booked this hotel for an wedding anniversary trip for two nights purely from recommendations on tripadvisor and everything that has already been written is so accurate. A gem of a Hotel, in a great location and run by a great team.   All the staff at Al Ponte's (from the moment we arrived to leaving) were not only personal but very professional , which made for a great stay. They also emailed me pre arrival with suggestions of restaurants to research and then took care of all reservations for us.      We stayed in the junior suite overlooking the Grand Canal. A large room with a great view. Breakfast (included) had a great selection. Please if you are undecided, book this hotel like I did and you will not be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
