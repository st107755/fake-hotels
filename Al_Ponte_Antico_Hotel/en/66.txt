Barbara and her staff were fantastic. Cannot say enough positive about this wonderful small hotel. Friends directed us to Al Ponte Antico and there's no mystery why. Great location, wonderful room, amazing staff, breakfast daily was great. I'd go back!Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
