There have been so many superlative reviews about this hotel, this is yet another. Although our already brief stay in Venice was cut short by an emergency at home we could not have asked for a more supportive and caring staff who helped us re-arrange our return. This exquisite hotel is perfectly situated, has been beautifully renovated and above all has the most wonderful atmosphere. Matteo is the perfect host, kind and informative and his staff reflect his high standards. Prosecco on the terrace in the evening light,watching life in Venice ... wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
