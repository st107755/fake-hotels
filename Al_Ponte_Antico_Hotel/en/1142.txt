Just arriving at this hotel's private dock I knew we were in for a special stay in Venice.  The hotel is intimate and charming, with an amazing staff that could not be more welcoming.  Our room was lovely, as are the breakfast room and terrace.  Matteo gave us wonderful recommendations for restaurants and things to do, including a visit to the daily fish market which is just across the Grand Canal.  Really, we can't say enough about how wonderful Matteo and his staff are.  This is a special place.Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
