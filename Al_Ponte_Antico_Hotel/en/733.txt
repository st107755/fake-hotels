Matteo and his team have crafted a truly exceptional hotel experience. Small, intimate, welcoming. Perfectly situated on the Grand Canal. More than anything, what stands out is the remarkable service from the ever visible owner Matteo, and all of his staff. I have stayed in many fine Italian hotels, this one stands heads and shoulders above them all from a service perspective. Would recommend without hesitation.
