What a nice boutique hotel. We stayed in a room beside the breakfast terrace with an extra single bed for our daughter. Love the fact that the owner was around, cooking and waiting and everyone new our names. Great service, nice hotel (you cannot beat being right on the Grand Canal - €50 from the train station and then €110 to airport)  We ran n the mornings and walked other times, with a personal guide one afternoon.  Beautiful city, great food, lovely weatherRead moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
