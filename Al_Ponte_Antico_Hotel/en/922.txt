From the moment we stepped off the water taxi, and were greeted by name by our host, we knew this was going to be great, and it was. A beautifully restored Palazzo, with but 9 rooms for guests, this hotel was like being on a movie set. I kept expecting someone to jump out and say "Cut". But it was real. The only thing better than the amazing building was the even better service by all of the staff. Everyone who worked there greeted us by name and did anything and everything to make us happy. To sit on the terrace viewing the Rialto Bridge, and sip endless cappacinos in the morning, and Alpernos later in the day was my idea of heaven. Who needs  coffee on St Mark's Square. Many thanks to Matteo and all of his wonderful people (especially Rosie).Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
