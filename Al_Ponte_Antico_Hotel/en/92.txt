Me and my wife Tanya recently spent 3 nights in the hotel (actually, 2.5 nights as our flight from Moscow got severely delayed). And it will be fair to say we couldn't expect more from the hotel: - wonderful location, in the very center, close to all key destinations (such as San Marco, Rialto etc.), - nice clean and very well furnished rooms, - very well decorated lobby with terrace overlooking the Rialto bridge (which is pretty rare), - the owner Matteo and his team at the top of politeness, hospitability and readiness to help whichever questions you ask. When we come back to Venice one day, would be happy to stay in the hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: February 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
