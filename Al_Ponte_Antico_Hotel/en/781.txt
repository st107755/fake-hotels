Im gonna keep this review short and simple. There is not a better hotel in Venice, possibly in the world. They are the definition of what customer service should ALWAYS be and unfortunately the world has forgotten the True meaning of it. Thank you for making my short stay so special and you already know that now your hotel is my new home anytime I will come back to Venice. I will also make sure anyone I know that will ever come to Venice I will make sure they will come stay there.  Thank you again. Siete davvero fantastici. Grazie ancora di tutto. ;)Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
