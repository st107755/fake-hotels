Wonderful experience, beginning with directions to the hotel's location from Rialto Vaparreto stop through the cobblestone, winding streets, up and over a bridge or two!  Thank you, Oliver, for warm welcome!  Beautiful, spacious room with large bathroom, comfortable bed.  Only down-side was interior view without adequate sunlight.  However, that was easily remedied by enjoying breakfast and leisure afternoons on the terrace with full view of the Rialto Bridge and all the activity on the Grand Canal.  Delicious breakfast, outstanding service throughout. Location is convenient to pastry shops, gelato, restaurants, and a very old pink church! Walk anywhere from here. Magical!Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
