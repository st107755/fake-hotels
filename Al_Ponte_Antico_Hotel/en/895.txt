Arrived at private mooring via water taxi with a personal welcome from Gigi, who knew all of our names and guided us to room and first views of the city. We had booked the junior suite for family of 4. Perfect. View of Rialto bridge and grand canal. Breakfast was excellent, in lovely environment. Free Internet, and position so close to all major sites. Only down side was the bedding and bathroom had a few "loose" components. 4+ really.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
