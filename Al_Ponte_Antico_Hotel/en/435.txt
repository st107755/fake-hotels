The most outstanding personable hotel I have ever stayed in.  Best service I have ever experienced.  The owner greets you as you come by boat to their hotel and the owner and staff are amazing.  They all address you by name even if it is a staff member who has never seen you before.  The location and view are outstanding!  The owner cooks the most amazing breakfast for you and you eat on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  This hotel is worth every single penny and I would stay there in a second the next time I'm in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
