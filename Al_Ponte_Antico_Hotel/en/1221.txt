Al Ponte Antico was all that was promised in these TripAdvisor reviews.  We booked our itinerary around availability at this lovely hotel and were not disappointed.  Small, personal and friendly, our proprietor, Matteo and his staff, particularly Oliver and Thomas, made our stay in Venice memorable.  What a delight to be greeted by name at the door after wandering Venice for hours.  Be sure to sample the breakfast rolls that Sra. Matteo located on the mainland, and enjoy a Spritz or cup of tea on the terrace.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
