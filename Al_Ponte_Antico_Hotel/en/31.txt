I can not imagine a more amazing and inviting hotel. I know this sounds crazy, but our trip to Venice was truly made special by our stay here. The staff are all superb, learning our names immediately and bending over backwards to be helpful. Multiple recommendations on where to go, what to see, what to stop and look at along the way. Even the night watchman, whom we had never met, knew who we were when we came back from an evening out. It felt like staying with family. And the owner is amazing. Very humble and pleasant, and he even cooks eggs in the morning! Absolutely charming  On top of the staff being a level of service above any we have ever had, the hotel is even more amazing. We were in Venice as part of an anniversary trip, and they were kind enough to get us a suite onâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
