We started our 12 day honeymoon with a 2 night stay in the junior Suite with panoramic view of the Rialto Bridge and the Grand Canal - it was MAGICAL and worth every penny.  the views are incredible and we could have spent our entire stay people watching from our window.   beyond the view itself, the people make this hotel even more fabulous. Matteo and his team are so kind, dedicated, and passionate about their hotel and Venice that you can't go wrong.    The room and entire hotel was gorgeous.  Breakfast was delicious, and our stay could not have been made more special.  We hope we are lucky enough to come back one day!! The staff could not have been more generous to us or have done any more to make us feel special on our honeymoon.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
