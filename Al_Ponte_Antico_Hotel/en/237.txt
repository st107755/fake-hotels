We were so lucky to find this tiny gem! Al Ponte Antico is perfect! With a one of a kind terrace on the Grand Canal, this hotel made our stay in Venice even more special. Every member of the friendly staff, lead by Matteo (the amazing owner/operator), were so helpful and welcoming. I hope there is space for us when we return, I couldnâ€™t imagine staying somewhere else.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
