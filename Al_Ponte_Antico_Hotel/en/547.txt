What an amazing small boutique  hotel right on the Grand canal overlooking the famous  Rialto bridge. We have never experienced such wonderful service from the owner and every member of his staff.  Sitting on the balcony with a drink overlooking all the hustle and bustle of the canal was a joy.  Venice is amazing but this is the only hotel to stay inRead moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
