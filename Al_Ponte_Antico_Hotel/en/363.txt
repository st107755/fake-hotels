After having spent a week in this hotel, I feel lucky with my choice for 3 reasons. The location of the hotel is perfect, especially if you come to Venice for the first time, cause you can be in other parts of the city on foot very quickly. The balcony of the hotel on Gran Canal is the best and the most tranquil place to watch the traffic in the canal any time of the day and night. Last, but not least, Mateo and his lovely team are there to meet all your needs. They are proud of their city, they know it like their palm of their hand and are willing to share with their guest all its secrets.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
