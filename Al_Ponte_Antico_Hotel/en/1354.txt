We were getting married in Venice and this was our honeymoon hotel for the first two nights .. what can I say ... Matteo and his staff were superb, very attentive yet not overly so ... with what must be one of the best views of the Grand Canal in Venice .....  I cannot think of a better way and a more beautiful City to start married life !  Sue and Neil SandersRead moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
