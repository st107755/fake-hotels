Actually, we stayed at this hotel at the recommendation of the concierge at the Hotel Augustus in Fano, Italy.  She was so right.  We stayed here about 4 years ago, actually, and have recommended this to anyone we knew going to Venice.  Hopefully, we will return to this lovely hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2010HelpfulShare
