It's not often that we want to return to a hotel, but after our week at Hotel Al Ponte Antico 2 years ago we decided that we had to come back.  Arriving by water taxi straight to the landing at the hotel is extremely convenient, as is the location of the hotel, only about a 10 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. Breakfast on the terrace, watching life go by on the Grand Canal and under the Rialto Bridge, is just fabulous!  As before, Matteo and his staff were endlessly helpful and informative, and I have no doubt that we will return again one day.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
