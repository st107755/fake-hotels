Located in a former Palace on the Grand Canal, this is a location to die for, with a lovely first floor terrace where you can eat breakfast or sit all day or all evening watching the world go by on the various forms of boats.  They have their own landing stage. It overlooks the Rialto Bridge.  Original ceilings and frescoes inside, and sumptuous bedrooms with lovely antique furnishings and every mod-con. Here you get pampered and spoilt.  A lovely place to stay with first name terms with the staff who treat you like royalty.  Full marks to the proprietor and his staff.  Good foor at breakfast, either buffet or individually cooked to order. Highly recommended. Would we stay here again? You bet we would.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
