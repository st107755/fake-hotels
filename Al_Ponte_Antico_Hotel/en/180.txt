No matter how amazing you think this hotel sounds from other reviews, it's better. The rooms are gorgeous and comfortable, and the view absolutely breathtaking from the breakfast balcony. But the most incredible part is the service! Matteo and all of the staff are some of the most welcoming, friendly, and helpful people I've ever met, to say nothing of had the pleasure of being served by. They knew our names the moment we arrived off the boat. Every question, they had answers and hand-drawn maps before you could even ask.   Another resident at the time told us that when he travels to Venice, if the Hotel Al Ponte Antico is booked, he reschedules when he's traveling to Venice. I 100% back up his advice. Don't stay anywhere else!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
