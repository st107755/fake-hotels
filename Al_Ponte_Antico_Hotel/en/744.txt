We spent four nights at Al Ponte Antico Hotel during May 2014.  We were very pleased with the quality of our room, enjoyed our time on the terrace and thought the breakfast was delicious.  The owner, Mateo, was onsite for our visit and the staff was very polite and professional.  Each staff member called us by name from the time we arrived until the time we left.  The location is very convenient since it is a short walk to the Rialto Bridge and St. Marks.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
