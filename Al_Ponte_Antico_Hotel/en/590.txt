We usually stay in large modern hotels so Venice was a challenge for us.  Well done Matteo and your staff. Your service was spot on, with just the right advice to help us get to know Venice. I'm sorry that we didn't get to have a long talk about Venice and life I know I would have enjoyed it.   Everything about the hotel is perfect. Own pier, location, outside patio, ancient building, great coffee, good breakfast.  I know we'll be backRead moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
