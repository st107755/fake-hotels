We got a shared water taxi from the airport to the hotel dock, great way to arrive and to be greeted by Matteo, the very proud owner, and Oliver.  Luggage taken, and a guided tour of this quintessentially Venetian hotel given by Matteo, such enthusiasm is rarely seen by an owner or their staff, prepare to be stunned by the beauty of this hotel and it's amazing location...............  The decoration, materials and furniture throughout the hotel have to be seen to be believed, along with lovely breakfasts, and delightful service - you guys rock!  We cannot thank Matteo, Oliver, David, Romina, Thomas and Katrina for all the kindness and enthusiasm shown, which only adds to the great memories of a wonderful visit to a beautiful city.  Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
