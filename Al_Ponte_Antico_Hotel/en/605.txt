We visited the  Al Ponte Antico in Venice for my 40th birthday trip.  The customer service was hands down, the best I have ever experienced.  They made you feel so special. We upgraded to stay in a room with a view of the grand canal and it was worth it!  The room was spacious and gorgeous.  This was our first trip to Italy and I think Venice was my favorite location.  The city is so unique from anywhere else in the world that I have ever visited. The breakfast was wonderful and Matteo and his staff were the best.  One of the highlights of the trip was enjoying a bottle of champagne on the grand canal at the table on the dock by our room.  We felt like royalty.  Thank you for making my birthday so special and so memorable.  I can't wait to return someday. Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
