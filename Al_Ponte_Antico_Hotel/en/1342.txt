I've never stayed at a hotel with better service. From the staff greeting you by name when you arrive, to the owner (Matteo) making you whatever you want for breakfast, or making a dinner reservation on your behalf... these people really know how to make your Venetian holiday enjoyable. Antique styled rooms are well appointed, with nice clean reasonably new bathrooms and cheap wireless internet.Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
