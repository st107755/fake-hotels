We've returned to Al Ponte Antico Hotel for the third time after 8 years. It was just perfect! For the first night we have stayed in the Classic room and moved  to Junior Suite for the remaining stay.  Even the Classic room is just beautiful, but the Junior Suite is absolutely breathtaking!!!   The staff makes you feel as the most welcomed person in the world! Not too intrusive, but always ready to help. And believe me, during all our stays their suggestions of places and restaurants were just perfect. Just do not be afraid to ask ;)  We've been to many different places and hotels. But Al Ponte Antico is one of the reasons we keep returning to Venice :)Read moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare
