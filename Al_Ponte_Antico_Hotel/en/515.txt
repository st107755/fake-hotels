We stayed here 3 nights with my parents and myself; a young adult. We came in the off season of January and were able to take advantage of a special winter rate. The rooms were styled to be traditional high class Venetian, with the gold accenta and tapestrys. We didn't want to book a separate room for myself and the hotel manager was very accommodating to that and arranged for a beautiful pull out couch to be brought in that matched the theme of the room. It is a very centrally located space and was relatively easy to find from the water bus station. However,  I would reccomend just getting a water taxi to take you from the train station to the hotel because it was rather hard after a long days travel to get there and the hotel was a water taxi entrance. The staff are amazingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
