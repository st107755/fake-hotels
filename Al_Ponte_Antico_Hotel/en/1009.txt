I have been to Venice 3 times.  This hotel is the "top of the top", by far the best in Venice I've stayed in, but also one of the best hotels I've stayed in the world.  The service of the brothers running their father's hotel was fantastic, in particular their recommendations for dinner were superb.  The breakfast was also great, in an excellently-decorated room with gold-specked plaster and wonderful old master paintings, the service fantastic and the eggs were the best I've ever had.  Our room was a canal view room on the ground floor, with the landing dock as our private verandah, with a view of the Rialto - unbelievable!Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
