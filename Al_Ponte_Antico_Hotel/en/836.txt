This hotel exceeded our expectations. Despite being a very short walk from the Rialto Bridge the hotel is tucked away, quiet and very special. We stayed in two rooms, 105 and 102, and both were spacious en suite rooms with a lot of style and comfort. The second room overlooked the Grand Canal and had a very special character. There is a lovely balcony where breakfast is served in the morning, and come early evening, some fabulous Bellinis. Above all these lovely features it was the very individual and charming way we were looked after by Matteo, Oliver, Alessandro, Rose Alba and Tomasso that made our stay so memorable. We have stayed in many nice hotels but never one quiet like this. Highly recommended for anyone seeking individual class and character and service.
