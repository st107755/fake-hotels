This hotel has service down to a tee. Every single staff member welcomed us by name each time they saw us. They were always happy to help and keen to interact, while still being respectful. The spot is perfect for roaming around Venice. We would definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
