We can't say enough about this hotel. Perfect location in the middle of everything. The hotel staff make this place amazing. They cater to your every need. Call you by your name and never steer you wrong. They recommend amazing restaurants that were not filled with tourists. Even had us go to places to site see that we would never have gone. The breakfast was amazing! Room was upgraded but still had the traditional charm. Very clean and air conditioned. Free wifi and had cable with English channels. If I ever go back to Venice, we are staying here. Book it :). Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
