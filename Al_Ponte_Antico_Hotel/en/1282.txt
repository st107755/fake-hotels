There isn't much I can add to previous reviews except to say that they are all true. The service was the best we have ever experienced, location perfect, restaurant recommendations great and sitting on the Terrace with a Spritz whilst watching the activity on the canal was one of the highlights of the trip!  Thanks Matteo and team.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
