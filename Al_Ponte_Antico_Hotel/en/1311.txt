Having visited Venice several times in the past, I was amazed to find a hotel of this quality and level of guest service at this price. The owner, Matteo, greeted me upon arrival by name. Our room was not only clean, which is an imperative, but also gorgeous. No lodging in Venice proper is inexpensive, but even compared to the Bauer Il Palazzo (where I stayed on my honeymoon) and the Hotel Danieli, the Al Ponte Antico is just beautiful, in a perfect location, and the level of staff attention and graciousness is simply beyond compare (for a third of the price). Matteo and his staff, particularly Oliver, made us feel like royalty. I highly recommend the Al Ponte Antico.Read moreHelpfulShare
