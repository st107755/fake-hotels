I highly recommend this hotel.  The location is perfect for exploring, the balcony setting very special but most importantly the service is second to none.  We took their restaurant recommendation which was also a success - simple, tasty local food (Vecio Bragosso)Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
