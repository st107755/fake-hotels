This was my 4th stay at Al Ponte Antico . It never ceases to amaze me how perfect every stay has been. The primary reason for the perfection, has to do with the people that run this magical place . The people that work at any business are really what make or break it (a hotel, a restaurant a shop) this is no exception. The fact that it is beautiful, the food and drinks are delicious, the location is ...........PERFECT and the beds are comfortable only add to the reasons why I will always return.  Do not hesitate on this one.......only, leave room for me when I want to book next time.  Thanks Matteo and everyone!!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
