We stayed here with our three young children in July on a long trip through Europe.  Our family have stayed in lots of hotels and guest houses all through the world, and this has to be the most friendly and home like ever!  We had the two rooms on the ground floor. The junior suite was fabulous, the views out to the grand canal and the Rialto bridge were unbelievable.  We just sat there with our kids and felt like the luckiest people on earth.  The wonderful staff at this hotel make you feel like you are one of the family.  I could not recommend it highly enough.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
