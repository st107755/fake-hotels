If you come to Venice, this is just the perfect place to stay! Customer service is world class. Breakfast is amazing. Matter and his team just have it sussed. Only 9 rooms so a highly personalised service. Get a water taxi from the airport (115 euros) and arrive in style right to the jetty of the hotel. View of The Rialto is amazing! One of the best hotels we have stayed in.....hope you enjoy. Simon and Kelly xRead moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare
