This little jewel can be seen from the Grand Canal as you head toward the Bridge of Sighs. And sigh you will when you stay here.  The staff, including both owner/manager brothers of the family, are charming and welcoming beyond words.  They ALL know your name by the time you have walked in the door.  I spent more time on the balcony of this hotel watching the canal traffic with a glass of wine than I did exploring Venice during the day.  What a beautiful hotel and worth every penny of the price.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
