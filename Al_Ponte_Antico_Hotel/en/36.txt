Al Ponte Antico continues to set the standard at this boutique hotel. As has been said, the warm and personable staff provide incredible, personal service. Gorgeous rooms, fantastic terrace, delicious home-baked goods along with cooked to order breakfast are wonderful.  Mornings, evenings or any time on the terrace with morning coffee or evening spritz will be remembered forever.   Ci vediamo dopo!  Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
