Venice was the beginning of our 2 week trip to Italy and this hotel was the perfect start. Located at quite a narrow street, once you step inside, the owner (who welcomed us personally) takes you back in time. He is very proud at his hotel and he should be. It’s a gem! Located right beside the Rialto bridge, we couldn’t be at a geater starting point to discover the city. Breakfast in the morning and the cocktail in the evening, at the terrace with this spectacular view is a big bonus.  Service was impeccable, they were all very friendly and helpful! We would definitely recommend it!Read moreDate of stay: July 2020HelpfulShare
