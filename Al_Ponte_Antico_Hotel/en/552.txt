Wow!  What a location.  Great private docking for easy water taxi service.  Great terrace view of the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal.  Gracious host!  Walked all of Venice from here.  Beautiful breakfast.  Much attention to the details.  Room clean and fresh every day.  Worth every penny and highly recommended to all!  Grazie Mille!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
