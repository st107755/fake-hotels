The location of the hotel is second to none. The only hotel with a terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge. Matteo and his team Alex, Igor, Oliver, including his wife Barbara were super welcoming and friendly, starting with a personal welcome and a tour of the hotel. Everyone went an extra mile to help and make our stay memorable. We particularly enjoyed having the delicious breakfast prepared by Matteo and drinks in the evening on the terrace. Will definitely go back when in Venice and recommend the hotel to everyone! Our thanks to the whole team at Al Ponte Antico for an unforgettable stay!Read moreDate of stay: July 2020HelpfulShare
