This is the most amazing hotel!  It is RIGHT on the Grand Canal, with amazing views of the Rialo Bridge and the Canal in the other direction.  It has a gorgeous breakfast terrace - we spent all our afternoons out there just enjoying the sunshine and the activity, it's just wonderful!  And the staff!!! Matteo is just wonderful, and his staff will do anything to ensure that you have the best time in Venice.  We were given great advice for restaurants, activities and places to visit, and all recommendations were well deserved.  Matteo's omlettes are wonderful too - no boring breakfasts here, only a delicious, relaxed and filling start to the day.  The room was lovely and big, with a great bathroom, heaps of room to stretch and relax.    We loved our stay at Al Poonte Antico Hotel,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2007HelpfulShare
