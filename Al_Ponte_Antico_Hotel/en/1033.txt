Truly, I could not afford one night in the canal front "Jr. Suite" so, unknown to my wife, I booked four.  We've stayed previously at their sister Venetian facility, Locanda Orseolo, so we knew that the staff would be exceptional, friendly and the ultimate professionals.  There also would be a wonderful buffet breakfast (chocolate banana crepes by Matteo).  What I didn't realize was how fabulous the "Jr Suite" ( Rm. 108) actually was.  In that room you are transformed into the reigning Dodge of Venice.  I hereby declare this to have been my most WORTHWHILE extravagence ever !  Sincere thanks to Matteo (he's not that handsome.. it's really the clothes), Oliver, Armando, Max, Tommaso, Rosalba & Menelio for our exceptional experience at the Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
