Our family stayed in this terrific hotel for five nights over the New Year period.  The service provided was exceptional, including much help before our arrival in securing a reservation for dinner for New Year.  We had three lovely rooms with varying degrees of amenity, appropriately reflected in the price.  The breakfast room/24 hour bar was cosy with great fresh offerings.  The view from the balcony and front rooms was to die for. Every member of the staff was exceptional and never once forgot the name of any member of the family.  Thoroughly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare
