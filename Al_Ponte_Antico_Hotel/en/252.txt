We have stayed multiple times at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel near the Rialto Bridge in Venice and each stay is better than the last.  Our enjoyable experience is primarily due to the warm and welcoming owners and staff.  Matteo, Oliver, Alex, David and Rosalba treat us like members of their family.  They have not neglected the physical surroundings as we have found improvements to the rooms each time we return.  Breakfast has improved as well in variety and taste.  Don't miss Matteo's pancakes!  The location would be hard to improve upon.  Who could imagine that you could stay five minutes from Rialto but have quiet and serenity?  Our only concern is that the hotel is small and that they might be fully booked for our next stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
