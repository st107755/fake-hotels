At few places that you stay in your lifetime will everyone learn your name immediately and greet you warmly by name each time they see you.  While staying at Al Ponte Antico, you get the impression it is everyone's pleasure to be of service.  This small hotel is centrally located by the Rialto bridge with easy access to the vaporetto.  Beautiful decor and great terrace overlooking the Grand Canal & Rialto bridge, where you can enjoy a great breakfast each morning.  Rooms are definitely European standards, but comfortable and beautiful.  We would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return when in Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
