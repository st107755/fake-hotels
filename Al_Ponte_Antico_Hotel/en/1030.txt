We picked this hotel as we wanted a Venetian experience rather than some corporate chain and we weren't disappointed! A small and somewhat quirky 'palazzo' but it's sumptuous decor, perfect location and very attentive staff made ours a truly wonderful stay in Venice.   Matteo and his team go out of their way to make it special and I would thoroughly recommend guests to take Bruno's daily tips for exploring the city & it's sights. His morning briefings over breakfast meant we got a sense of the real Venice, without missing any of the major attractions - no mean feat in a town jammed full of us tourists!Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
