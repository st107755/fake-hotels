After reading the great reviews of this hotel we booked 4 nights in May.  Location is excellent.  Our room was nice enough but the bathroom smelled SOUR and paint was peeling from the ceiling.  Breakfast was adequate. If hospitality is defined by the staff remembering your name then it was OK.  Hospitality lacking sincerity is how I would define it.  We had an early AM departure and they offered to have coffee ready for us.  As we departed they asked for 10 euros to cover the coffee charge.  We left disillusioned with the offerings of this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
