A heartfelt thank you to Mateo and his wonderful team for making me feel so welcome and for making my trip to Venice so memorable.  This is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location (just far enough from the madness of St Marco but right at beginning of the Cannaregio).  The views are amazing. From the moment you arrive to when you leave, the service is outstanding and nothing was too much trouble.  Venice is a busy city and it can get very hectic. This hotel is an oasis of calm and elegance and was worth every penny.  If you want to experience the best of Italian hospitality and service and enjoy the romance and beauty of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
