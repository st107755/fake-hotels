Matteo, Rosalba, everyone was so very personable and kind. Unparalleled service and warmth. We felt as though we were staying with dear friends and were quite sad to leave. By far our favorite place to stay in Italy and in my top three in the world.    Kathryn & MarkRead moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
