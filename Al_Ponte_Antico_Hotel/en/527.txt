This hotel is lovely, warm, welcoming and exquisite! The room was beautiful and very clean with everything we needed for our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and everyone knew who we were even when staff had a change of shift. The continuation of care was brilliant. Breakfast was fantastic!....The charming owner Matteo makes the best scrambled eggs we have ever had! The location of Al Ponte is perfect....right on the Grand Canal. We will definitely visit again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
