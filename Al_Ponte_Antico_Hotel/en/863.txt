My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Al Ponte Antico. Matteo and his team deserve six stars for service. If only other hotels knew how to treat their guests like this, we would all enjoy travelling a whole lot more.

The hotel is just a few minutes from Rialto Bridge, a very central location for a tourist. Just take vaparetto # 2 (express) heading to S.Marco from either the train or the airport and get off at Rialto. Once you get off, head left and hug the water.
