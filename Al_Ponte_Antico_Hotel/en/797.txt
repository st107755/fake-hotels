No one in all of Italy has staff as friendly, helpful or professional. The Hotel itself is beautifully restored from the 14th century including original floors. The rooms are extremely large, updated, and tasteful. Beautiful full breakfast and amazing coffee every morning. The view from our room and the terrace was spectacular. We would go back to Venice just to visit this hotel again and catch up with the Owner and Staff. You must experience this place for yourself. There simply aren't enough stars to give!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
