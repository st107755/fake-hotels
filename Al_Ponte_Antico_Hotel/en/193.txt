We booked this hotel last July & it lived up to expectations.Very few rooms, 8?? I think. Matthias, the owner, speaks perfect English, & is the ultimate host.ALL the staff know your name, from the moment you arrive, I tried to reciprocate!! Oliver, Alex, Thomas etc. FANTASTIC view of the Rialto bridge & Grand Canal from the terrace.Perfect for a base to explore. If you find fault here, please let me know where you usually go & I will check it out, it will have to be special!!! Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
