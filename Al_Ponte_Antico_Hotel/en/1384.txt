We have just returned from a wonderful experience at the Al Ponte Antico, our first trip to Venice. It was a special trip so we studied numerous hotels and chose this for location and great reviews. Still you never can tell until you arrive but this was everything and more we had hoped for.  We felt very lucky to be stopping in a beautiful suite with french windows opening on to the Grand Canal , watching Venetian life pass by. The staff were unbelievable led by Matteo and his personal touch, nothing was too much trouble. He spent lots of time making all feel welcome and he is rightfully proud of the breakfasts he cooks each day , particularly his family's eggs. There are undoubtedly larger and more famous hotels to stay in but we would definitely have this as our first choiceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
