What a fantastic small hotel in the best location in Venice. The owner Matteo personally greeted us and made a fantastic breakfast. He and all of his staff greeted us personally by name as we entered the hotel. It is located just around the corner from the Rialto bridge - a perfect place to explore this wonderful city. Also, the views from the hotel balcony at breakfast were spectacular.   Thank you to Matteo and all of the wonderful staff for making our stay so special! I will end with what my wife told the couple entering the hotel right as we were leaving - "you are going to love it!"Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
