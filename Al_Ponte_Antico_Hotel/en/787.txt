I chose this hotel because of references on tripadvisor. I must say that I was pleased with the hotel and its interior. Because I booked the hotel in the last minute I got a good price- i hope. We were staying at junior suit which is very beautiful and large room with view on the famous bridge Ponte di Rialto. The staff was very friendly, the use of wifi is free. The only small problem that I saw were small damages on the interior, but you need to have realy good eye. On the end I recomend the hotel specialy for the cuples.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
