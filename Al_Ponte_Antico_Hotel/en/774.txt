This hotel is stunning. Only 9 rooms and superior service. What's really fabulous is their terrace right on the grand canal. Very few hotels can offer this - Most buildings use every bit of space for enclosed rooms. Sitting on the terrace, sipping Bellinis, while watching canal life float by and gazing at Il Ponte Antico is truly a highlight of my life!! I felt so lucky to be a guest in this hotel and they treated my sister and me like VIPs - always calling us by name and preparing breakfast to order and of course, wonderful cocktail service in the late afternoon! I can't wait to go backRead moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
