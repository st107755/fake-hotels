The elegant and charming Matteo Peruch, the owner of this wonderfully special hotel, gives you first hand top service.  His staff has been with him for years and I understand why.  This hotel breathes relaxation, service, style and comfort.  When we return to visit we will most definitely stay at Al Ponte Antico.  You will not be disappointed.  I promise!Read moreDate of stay: October 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
