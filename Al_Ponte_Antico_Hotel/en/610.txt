We spent the week of my birthday in March at Al Ponte Antico and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They are a small but perfectly located hotel right on the Grand Canal. The terrace looking out to the Rialto Bridge is a real find and we spent several afternoons there drinking excellent cocktails (I can wholeheartedly recommend the Negroni) and great value prosecco. The staff and owner are all charming with peerless local knowledge, their recommendations for dinner locations were faultless. The breakfasts deserve a special mention, as does the coffee, as the quality was truly exceptional. Our room was well appointed and despite opening to the bar area we were never troubled by noise. All in all, I can't praise Al Ponte Antico highly enough - they are faultless. Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
