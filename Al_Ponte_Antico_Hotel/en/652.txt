On arrival we were greeted by the owners, we're shown around and was told all about the history of this small and beautiful hotel. The balcony is to die for , we spend a few hours each day sitting relaxing with a glass of  wine, it was cold but it was amazing, so much to watch with a prefect view of the Grand Canel. Central location for everything. Breakfast was cooked to order  again by the owners, their attention to detail was second to none from start to finish. Venice is really an only two to three day visit, so why not stay in a truly friendly family run hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
