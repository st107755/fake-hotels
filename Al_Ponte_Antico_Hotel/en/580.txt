What an amazing hotel! The owner and all the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The location is perfect and actually much more than I could have imagined. A stones throw from the Rialto bridge. We could have sat on the terrace all day and night and watch Venetian life pass us by. The bedroom was beautifully decorated as was the rest of this 14th century palace. We will definitely stay here again.  Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
