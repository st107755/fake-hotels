Our family of 4 (with 2 teenagers) from Sydney just spent 2 nights at Al Ponte Antico. A truly wonderful experience. Matteo the owner personally greets you on arrival and continues throughout your stay to ensure everything is perfect. His team are helpful, polite and accommodating. The hotel itself is charming and perfectly located, small, elegant, quiet, and has it's own dock for direct access to the canal. Breakfast is delicious and has everything  you'd want.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare
