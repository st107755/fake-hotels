This small boutique hotel gets better and better. We arrived by speedboat and it’s a little quirky and very old. We were given room 101 which I knew had some unfavourable reviews so was a little concerned but with only about 8 rooms in total it was what it was. The staff were all amazing, everyone addressed you by name and introduced themselves - room 101 had absolutely no issues with noise and Barbara’s home made doughnuts would make anyone want to return. However for me the highlight was sitting in the small balcony, drinking a bottle of Prosecco that they had kindly left for us as it was our anniversary and lazily watching life on the grand canal and Rialto bridge pass by.  Highly recommend for a romantic breakRead moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
