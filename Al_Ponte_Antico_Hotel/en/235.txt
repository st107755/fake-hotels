With so many great reviews, I arrived at this hotel with high expectations, and the hotel still surpassed them. The service is truly one of a kind and the staff really does care about your experience, not only at the hotel but in the city overall. The location is absolutely wonderful and the entire hotel is beyond compare. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
