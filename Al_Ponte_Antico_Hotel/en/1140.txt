We have visted Venice on three previous occasions and loved it, but this hotel, Matteo and his staff made it this visit truly amazing.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it felt like we were personal guests invited to Matteo's home.The rooms were beautiful, the breakfasts amazing especialy Matteo's grandmothers golden fresh eggs. At any time of the day the balcony gave you a stunning view of Venice, for breakfast or drinks in the evening.Matteo advised us on hidden parts of Venice to visit and lovely authentic resturants have supper.This hotel was wonderful and we learnt a great deal about how attention to detail makes all the difference for your guests. Many many thanksRead moreDate of stay: August 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
