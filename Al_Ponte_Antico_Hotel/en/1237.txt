Al Ponte Antico offersr the greatest hotel experience.  From the moment we arrived, we were treated like the most important guests ever received.  The hotel is in a perfect location and is beautiful.  Mateo and his staff know each guest by name and make every endeavor to make one feel truely welcome.  The view of the canal from the balcony is most splendid.  The Rossinis are pretty grand, too.  Cannot wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
