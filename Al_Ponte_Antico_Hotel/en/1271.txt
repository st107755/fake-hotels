I read dozens of reviews before I booked this hotel and, like other reviewers, I had very high expectations.  Our train from Florence was 3 hrs late.  We took a water taxi to the hotel (highly recommended - costs 50 euro but worth it based on talking to others who did not take it) - the hotel has a dock right on the grand canal and views the Rialto bridge.  Cannot beat that.  You feel like a king arriving on that water way in your own boat. The owner Matteo met us at the dock. He already knew our names and personally carried our luggage in.  Like others, he gave us a tour of the hotel, told us to get settled in, and then gave us excellent dinner recommendations. We had a ground floor room.  Very nice with a large bathroom (room at the back of the hotel, not on the grand canal). â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20091 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
