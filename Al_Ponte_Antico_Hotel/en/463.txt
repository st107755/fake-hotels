This place is true quaint venician hotel. So close to the Rialto and easy walking distance to San Marco square. A lovely terrace overlooks the grand canal and is open 24/7 so you can sit out there and enjoy it anytime. The staff made us feel like we were the only guests. What we really loved too was that the owner, Matteo, was there to personally great us, carried our bags, and cooked our breakfast. Alex was so helpful with directions and recommendations. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was really large, especially for Europe. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place to anyone.
