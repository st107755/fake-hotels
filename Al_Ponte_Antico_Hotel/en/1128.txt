An excellent location, the terrace and suites overlooking the canal are sublime and the location near perfection. The staff are incredible, NOTHING is too much trouble. Waking to breakfast on the terrace overlooking the grand canal is like being in a canaletto painting. The furnishings are first rate and the location very central. Matteo is the perfect host and it was wonderful to be treated as friends as well as customers. They go the extra mile to make your stay a good one.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
