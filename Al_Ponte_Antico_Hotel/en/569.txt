Matteo, the proprietor of this hotel is incredibly hospitable from welcoming us at the jetty to waving goodbye when the water taxi collected us.   He cooked us breakfast, made us cocktails, recommended excellent restaurants and did everything possible to ensure we 6 women had the time of our lives.   His staff were well trained and frankly, just lovely.  The rooms were huge, clean and comfortable.  The position is about 50m to the Rialto Bridge, right on the Grand Canal.   This hotel has just 9 rooms.   We loved every single thing about it.    We were so well looked after.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
