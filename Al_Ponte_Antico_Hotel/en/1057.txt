First we stayed in another family hotel in Venice the Locanda Orseola and it did not disappoint in any way. How can this hotel be any less spectacular with Mateo Peruch now running it?! His wife Barbara still runs the other one. I would like to know of other hotels they own and run in Europe. Stay with the Peruch Family!
