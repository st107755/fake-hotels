Staying at Al Pont Antico Hotel makes a visit to Venice very special. The staff are warm and friendly, the breakfast delicious and our room was very comfortable.   The location is wonderful on the Grand Canal near the Rialto bridge which makes it easy to reach any part of Venice. The best feature is the terrace where you can have breakfast overlooking the canal or come back for a drink in the afternoon to relax.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
