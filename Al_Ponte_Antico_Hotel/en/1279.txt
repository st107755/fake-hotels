Hotel AlPonte Antico is just perfect! From Matteo and his team to the food and furnishings of this fabulous hotel, everything is as it should be, but rarely is.   Breakfast will delight and satisfy the most fussy of gourmet and evening spritzers on the romantic terrace are a must.   Matteo's recommendations are spot on and he makes the most charming host, nothing is too much bother here for any staff member. Tradition is all but gone everywhere, but not at the Alponte Antico, where everyone is treated as royalty!Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare
