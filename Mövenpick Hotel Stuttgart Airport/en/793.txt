From the outside the hotel doesn't look very spectacular, but inside you will be surprised. The style is unique: modern with boudoir elements. The rooms have the same decoration style. The bathroom has a peculiarity: from the bed you can look into the shower. The service was very friendly and the restaurant offered a very good buffet. The antipasti were delicious as well as the deserts. A very recomendable hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 5, 2011Dear isaGermany,  We have read your commentary with a great pleasure.
