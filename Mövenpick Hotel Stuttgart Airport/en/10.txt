We booked this hotel as we had an early flight from Stuttgart airport. The hotel is very near to the airport (5mins by car). Hotel staff were very friendly, welcome drinks at the arrival, small but very clean room and all this for a very decent rate. We also had few drinks at the bar and played table football which made our stay even more relaxing and fun. I would definitely stay again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 29, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback and for your stay with us.
