A new stylish hotel that offers good service as well.  I was driving into Stuttgart and flying out early the next morning so chose this hotel for location. It is modern stylish and has great rooms.

It is also very quiet which is a major factor for airport hotels.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Mike R,  Thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your feedback on Tripadvisor.com.
