Movenpick Hotel is within walking distance from the airport. A good place to stay if you visit an event in the area, walking distance from the conference centre. I attended a conference and we had a buffet of local specialities in meat, fish etc. Maybe not the best buffet I ever had, but overall quality was good. I recommend the very good breakfast, nice clean rooms: I stayed on the side not facing the airport and could open my windows without the noise of the motorway of the airplanes.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 10, 2017Dear Guest,   thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
