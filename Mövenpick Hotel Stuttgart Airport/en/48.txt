I have been trying to get intouch with someone concerning a reservation since days, the calls were never answered, Twice answered but was forwarded to the reservation on 20th minutes no one attends the call. After i tried to call office hour, the same lady Saïd sorry the call has to be forwarded to the reservation coz either she doesnt know or in the head its not my job. Then one time she said to send an email. I did so,but lord jesus i had to call Again and begged again to have an answered,which did nothing but waste of time. The email was answered After 3 days of hard time. I know it seems hard to believe it with all the outstanding comments and class. But believe it,never again, If the GM reads this, please do some background checks.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 23, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback.
