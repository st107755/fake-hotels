Stayed here for long layover.  Hotel rooms were great, dining and bar excellent, and very close to airport.  We were able to walk over to the train station in the airport and travel to the city for dinner and brunch.  Very reasonable room rate too.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 7, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your great comment and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
