Last night to stay in Stuttgart.  Had a very early flight in the morning.  Would have liked to stay another night here.  Very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent.  Will schedule more than one night there the next time I visit Stuttgart.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 18, 2016Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your stay with us and your lovely feedback on TripAdvisor.
