As a business traveler, the lack of a working and usable wifi means that I'll never return. But I loved the convenience of being directly across from the terminal in an extremely quiet room. The room temperature was difficult to adjust, and along with the heavy bedding meant that we didn't get a good night's sleep. Having a full-length window between the shower and the rest of the room was a little disconcerting. Please realize that we were too tired to bring the problems up to management, and I'm sure our concerns would have been addressed.
