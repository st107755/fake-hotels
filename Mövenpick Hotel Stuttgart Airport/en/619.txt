Short 1-night stay while travelling in Stuttgart area. Liked the modern design, the facilities, rooms and the overall cleaning. Excellent restaurant with good and attentive service, not really usual for an airport hotel. I would have liked a slightly friendlier welcome from the reception upon arrival but it is a minoir fault. Would definitely recommend, although it's definitely not cheap.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 24, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe for your stopover and for having taken the time to give us a feedback about your stay on tripadvisor.com.
