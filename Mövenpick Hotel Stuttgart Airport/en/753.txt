Very convenient for an overnight stay. Rooms clean and comfortable. Nice gym and spa area.  Only complaint was the glass wall between shower and bedroom. No way to shade the room if bathroom light on. Dinner in hotel was worth the price. All staff friendly and accommodating.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 22, 2012Dear amalaPrinceton_Nj,  Thank you for having shared your impression about your stay.
