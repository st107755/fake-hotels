My husband and I stayed here on the first night of our recent trip to Germany, as we had left booking a hotel to the last minute and all the other (suitable) hotels in the centre of Stuttgart were booked out.  Movenpick was particularly convenient as we were pretty tired when we flew in and simply had to walk across the road from the airport to the hotel.  There are plenty of shops in the airport to pick up the basics, and the train from the airport is only a short 20 minute trip to get into the centre of the city.  The decor is modern and clean and the rooms are a good size for 2 people.  The spa and fitness centre area also very nice for a hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 12, 2013Dear guests,  Thank you for having taken the time to give us your feedback.
