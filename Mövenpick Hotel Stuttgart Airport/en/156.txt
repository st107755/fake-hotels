Stayed 1 night at hotel, prior to flying home after 2 week holiday with family, arrived tired after long road trip to be met with a fabulous welcome from check in right through to check out. We had 2 interconnecting rooms of the highest standard for our stay. In the twin room for our kids were a welcome pack for them that was excellent. Rooms were amazing. We had a great rest that night and a lovely breakfast next morning before strolling across the road to fly home. I would highly recommend this for an airport stayRead moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 11, 2017Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport.
