I attended a conference at the nearby centre, both the hotel and conference venue were within an easy 5 minute walk of the terminal! The hotel was superb, the room was large and furnished very nicely. Room service was great (the menu was a little limited) and breakfast superb. Overall great value and highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 23, 2014Dear Guest, thank you for your comment for the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
