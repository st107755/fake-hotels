Very good hotel near the Stuttgart Airport, it´s clean and with spacious rooms and with the best beds where I have ever slept. Breakfast is not included in for the room price and it´s quite expensive ( 17,50 eur per person), but really good, also the parking for car is too expensive, we kept our car for 12 hours there and it cost 28 euros !
