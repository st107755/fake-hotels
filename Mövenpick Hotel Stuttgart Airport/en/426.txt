Could not stay at a more convenient location. Out the door, around the corner and not 30 yards away and you are in the International terminal. Superior staff speaking several languages, engaging and fun to talk to about your travel options into Stuttgart. Room warm and quite. We stayed on the backside nearest to the airport and had no problems with noise. Comfortable nights sleep prior to our travel back to the West Coast.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 27, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your lovely feedback and your stay with us.
