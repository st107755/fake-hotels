I was impressed with this hotel.  It makes a big change from the usual chain hotels with their uninspiring decor and atmosphere.  The rooms are quite cool, with glass, wood and a nice bathroom and powerful shower.  Towels are nice and the bed is very comfy and a decent size.  The hotel's food is quite local and not as international as a bigger chain - not a problem and I enjoyed two meals there, but worth noting if you are expecting international fayre.    WiFi works well - it's good enough for Facetime/Skype - but there is a very poor selection of English language TV channels - just BBC World was working when I stayed, and some of the minor news channels such as Euronews. Plenty of Spanish, French and German channels with drama/shows though.Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 23, 2012Dear stevo_srh,  Thank you very much for having shared your experience.
