The hotel is in a great location and the staff friendly and warm.  Everyone was eager to please but not imposing or a pain.  A super surprise was the check in gent wishing me a happy birthday, and then a little birthday card and treat in my room. Lovely touch. I'll reward it with more nights in Moevenpick when I can. Thank you to all.
