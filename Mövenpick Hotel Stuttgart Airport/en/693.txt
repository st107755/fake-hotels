I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times the night before an early morning flight.  As far as airport hotels go, this is one of the best.  Rooms are well appointed and very quiet.  The hotel restaurant is very good.  Service is good.  Should you want to go into Stuttgart, the airport has an attached train station.  Although the hotel isn't connected to the airport, it is an easy 2 minute walk to the terminal.  The hotel has a nice exercise room.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 15, 2013Dear „Sandyboyles“  Thank you so much for  your positive feedback.
