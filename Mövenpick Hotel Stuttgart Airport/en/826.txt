I have stayed this hotel few times already and always have pleasant stay. If i can summarize my experience:  1. Nice stylish clean rooms 2. great breakfast  3. nice new spa! 4. location is just brilliant if you arrive late at the airport or depart early (walking distance!) 5. easy access to the train station. (u-bahn) however, there is little negative side too: 1.  cleaners knock on your door from 8 if you dont put "not to disturb"  2. steam bath of the spa seems not very clean. 3. parking is too expensive  but overall, the hotel is great and hope they maintain this!Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
