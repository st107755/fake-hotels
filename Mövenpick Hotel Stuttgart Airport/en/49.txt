Each time we have an early morning flight, we stay at the Movenpick. It is perfect location to sleep in and still make the flight on time. The rooms are very nice and modern. We really enjoyed the restaurant and bar. The food was really delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to visiting the Hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 11, 2018Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your recent stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
