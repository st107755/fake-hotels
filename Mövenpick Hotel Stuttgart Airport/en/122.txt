I often stay at this hotel the night before leaving Stuttgart because there is nothing more convenient than being able to wake up and walk across the parking lot to the airport.   Moreover, the hotel is comfortable and the food is good.   I had a much larger room than normal, the entry way was curved and they put a roll out bed in there for my son, it was very close to having a suite.  I highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Geschäftsführer at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 12, 2017THANK YOU!
