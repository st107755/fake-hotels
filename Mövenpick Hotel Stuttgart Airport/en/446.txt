I got stuck overnight at STR and the airline bought me a room here.  So I was not in a great mood when I walked into this hotel, but it was hard to stay mad. The staff was great, and the room is very nice. Clean, modern, and spacious. The wifi is excellent, too, which in my experience is unusual. Had lunch in the restaurant and it was very good, and the bar was nice, too. If you want to head into the city, the S-Bahn is right across the street.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 29, 2015Dear Guest,   Many thanks for your great feedback and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
