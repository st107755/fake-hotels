I stayed one night whilst waiting for my early morning Flight.  Everything you'd expect from an airport hotel and breakfast in the morning was good.  Only niggle was house keeping deciding to wake you up at about 7.30am whether you were in your bed or not.  I did call out to them but they still opened the door.  Remember to put the lock on so they cannot enter.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 28, 2017Dear Guest,  thank you so much for your comment and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
