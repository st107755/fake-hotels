Very nice modern hotel with well soundproof rooms. Air conditioning is not very effective and my room had a cigarette smoke odor even though it was a non-smoking room.  (Windows do open but then you get airport noise.). Very nice workout area.   Restaurant is outstanding. very good staff and Service.   Extremely convenient to stuttgart convention center, 10 minute walk away.   Overall highly recommended as a Stuttgart business hotel especially if you need to be near the convention center or airport.

It is a pleasure to hear that you enjoyed our hotel with our restaurant, the wellness area and the convenient location nearby the airport and the congress center as well.  Thank you for your comment regarding the smell of the air condition. We regret that you had the feeling that your room had a smell of cigarettes. Actually we have 7 smoking rooms, which are all located on the first floor and all our guests who want to smoke in the room are accommodated in a smoking room as well. If your non-smoking room was on a lower floor and your window was open, it could be possible, that you smelled the smoke from the adjoining floor with smoking rooms. For your next reservation we would like to recommend our premium category on a higher floor. Please ask our team from the reservation for further assistance during your next stay.   We are looking forward to receiving your next booking and wish you all the best in the meantime.  Best regards, Victoria Zimmermann - Guest Relations - Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe  Read more
