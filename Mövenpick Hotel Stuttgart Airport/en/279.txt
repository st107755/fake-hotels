Beyond the sheer beauty of this hotel and its convenient location to the airport,  their staff is incredible.  There were a bit of a confusion with my initial reservation, that had nothing to do with the hotel, and their staff handled it not only efficiently and quickly, but in an incredibly warm and friendly manner.   100% I would return, even spend an extra day just enjoying the hotel and its facilities.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Guest,  Wow, we feel highly honored and I will share your feedback directly with our team!
