We had a wonderful staying in this nice Hotel! The service was just great (not as you expect it in Germany) and the hotel was very clean. Prcies were average and they had a nice breakfast with a lot of health food! We will come again if we travel to Stuttgart!     Read moreDate of stay: June 2003HelpfulShare
