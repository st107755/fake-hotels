I visited this hotel while on a business trip. It is located across the road from the airport which also have a train system underground. The hotel is beautiful with friendly staff and a very nice restaurant and bar which only opens after 6. My room was very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The town center is 15 minutes away by train but all you have to do is cross the road to get on a train. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Stuttgart.

It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed our beautiful hotel as well as our friendly and professional staff. We are happy that you like our restaurant “Trollinger”, the “Message” bar and the well-designed rooms as well. It is right that the S-Bahn is inside the airport and takes 20 minutes to the city centre.  We will look forward to welcoming you back again soon and wish you a wonderful pre-Christmas time.  Kind regards  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
