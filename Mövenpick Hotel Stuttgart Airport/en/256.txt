...but many opportunities to make it better. Check-in/out is slow. Access from the airport side is confusing and poorly signposted if you are heading from the east end of the airport. Food was good, but expensive. Room was good. Softer bed than I would like. Pillows were far too soft. Strange window into shower form bedroom. Feels unnecessary and likely unwanted by most. Sound proofing from aiport (I was facing airport) is excellent. Access to most room lights from bedside. Power ports below bedside tables are strangely difficult to reach. Pretty good overall, but not very good value at all. Lack of flexibility on a reduced rate for a later checkout was poor by comparison to other chains.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 27, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
