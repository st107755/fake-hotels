Across from the airport clean,welcoming.  Food a little expensive but you can eat at the airport.  Coffee and crossonts were available with our early checkout.  Three minute walk to the airport.  Great little collection of local clocks in the lobby.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 17, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positiv review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
