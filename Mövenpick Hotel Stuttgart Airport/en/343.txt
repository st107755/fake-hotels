A great hotel. Clean and modern with friendly, helpful staff. Rooms were comfortable. Would definitely recommend with it being within walking distance of the airport and the S-bahn. Good choice at breakfast. Would recommend booking direct with the hotel as you receive a discount from the hotel making it cheaper than booking with any online companies.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 23, 2016Dear Guest, Many thanks for your positive feedback regarding your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
