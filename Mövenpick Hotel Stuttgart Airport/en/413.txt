Had a last minute change in my plans and called the Moevenpick at the recommendation of a friend.  My call was quickly and professionally handled with no drama.  Got an email confirming my room within the hour.  Arrival was unremarkable.  Again, quick and professional.  Appearance of the hotel is nice.  Room was quite adequate, modern and clean.  TV selection had pretty much every language covered.  Didn't eat at the restaurant or drink at the bar, so no info on that.  The airport is literally a one minute walk out of the hotel, so obviously very convenient.  The only, and I do mean only, "complaint" I had was that there was no sugar for the coffee.  If this is the only complaint I have, then the layover was just fine.
