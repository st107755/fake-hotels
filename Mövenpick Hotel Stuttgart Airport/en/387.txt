It was the 1st time I have stayed at this hotel and it was a pleasant surprise.  I have seen luxury that I have not paid for. The restaurant is a must to visit. They know how to cook beef fillet. I would prefer though more robust pillows. They were too soft for me and I needed 4 pillows to feel comfortable.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 31, 2016Dear Guest, Many thanks for your feedback on tripadvisor.com  and your stay in the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
