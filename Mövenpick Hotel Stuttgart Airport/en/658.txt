Loved that this hotel is right across from the airport, no car or taxi needed. It is a distance from the city center, but was perfect for me as i could get right off the plane from my international flight and sleep for a few hours before heading to my meetings.   Hotel is modern and lovely, comfortable room with firm beds and well appointed bathroom. The sweet yellow duck in the shower made me smile and stood out against the dark modern tile. The rooms are well insulated from the airport noise. Food was excellent, breakfast was a buffet with enough choice. Dinner was fancier with a nice selection and big portions. Lots of informal areas for business meetings. Enjoyed my visit at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Administrator at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 12, 2013Dear Guest,   thank you for having chosen the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and for having taken the time to share your feedback on Tripadvisor.com.
