Stayed overnight due to work.  Hotel is super modern, super clean and considering it’s only metres away from the main airport terminal, it’s super quiet.  Room was a good size, exceptionally clean with an amazing bathroom. The shower is the largest I’ve ever encountered in a hotel.  The bed was comfortable and as I mentioned earlier, it was very quiet, so I slept very well.  Breakfast was out this world. Selection was awesome, with regular coffee top ups from the many staff. Restaurant ran as smoothly as you’d expect from a hotel of this standard.  All round excellence, well worth a stay.
