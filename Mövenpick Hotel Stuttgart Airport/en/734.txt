We are very happy that you enjoyed your stay at the Mövenpick in Stuttgart.   Some of our bathrooms do have a glass window looking into the room as you described. The idea of the architect, Matteo Thun, was to provide daylight coming from the room, which is very rare in hotel bathrooms.  I will definitely share it with my colleagues that you have enjoyed the food as well as the service in our restaurant Trollinger.

We are looking forward to your next visit in Germany and wish you all the best in beautiful Montreal in the meantime.  Kind Regards  Tiaré de Vries Online reputation managerRead more
