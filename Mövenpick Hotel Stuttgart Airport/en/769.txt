Stayed here one night, literally walked to terminal.  Hotel was modern and clean, not the cheapest option, but you get what you pay for.  Did not try restaurant, but if breakfast is anything like sibling hotel in Nuremberg, it should be fine.    If I want to stay near the airport again, this will be my choice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 5, 2012Dear guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share your experience with us.
