I stayed there for a month while looking for a flat in Stuttgart. I didn't want to move out in the end. The breakfast menu was awesome! I could have spent hours there every morning. They make your eggs whichever way you want. Room was great. Despite the location (just outside of the terminal with Sbahn just at the doorstep) it was very quiet. I never heared a plane. If you wanna stay close to the airport, this is your best address. Make sure you choose the new hotel. They have an "old" hotel too.
