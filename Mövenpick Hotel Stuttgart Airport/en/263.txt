I have stayed here a couple times and find it to be a very comfortable and clean hotel with pleasant staff.  Just a few convenient steps from the airport (yet the airplane noise isn't obnoxious) and from the conference center. I am not aware of restaurant options nearby, but the restaurant in the hotel is very good, so I haven't needed to look for restaurants.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 29, 2016Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor and your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
