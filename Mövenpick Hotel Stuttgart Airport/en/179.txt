One of the best hotels im my life - due to personal touch of Simona, your colleague at the hotel, so delicious food and impressive ambience of gents hotel - Movenpick Stuttgart! I would like to have such a nice bathroom at home, like I had in the hotel! Now I have a desire to promote all Movenpick hotels for my clients, friends! I was extremely satisfied with my stay and it will be long-lasting memories! Simona - is a gem! She is so careful, attentive, polite, close to my soul! You should keep her, treat her in the highest level! She is one-of-a-kind! Please copy Simona and paste to each Movenpick hotel - to have a great staff for sure! :0) Thank you so much for being so unbelievably good, tasty Movenpick Stuttgart ! You exceed my expectations greatly! BEST!
