This is just such a great hotel. It actually doesn't feel like an airport hotel because of the quality of the rooms, the ability and attitudes of the staff and the excellent restaurant. The rooms are very comfortable, fully equipped with everything you need. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and unfailingly helpful and the restauarnat and bar facilities are great. It's a 2 minute walk from arrivals and the S-Bahn station so it's extremely convenient.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 7, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you for having shared your feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick of Stuttgart.
