Thank you very much for your comment regarding the iron and iron board. It is always helpful for us to get feedback on how our guests such as yourself are feeling within the hotel. I regret that you missed an iron and ironing board in your room during your last stay. Since we do not offer it in every room we have it organized in such a way that our housekeeping team brings it up to your room on request. We have made note to bring the ironing essentials up to your room before your arrival on your next stay. I attached this information to your guest profile.  I hope that you will give us the chance to welcoming you back again in the not too distant future to prove our service quality.   Best wishes  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
