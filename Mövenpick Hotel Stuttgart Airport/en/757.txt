This hotel (which I understand is part of a Swiss-owned chain), although a bit expensive, had European-style, modern elegance.  The rooms were comfortable and quiet; breakfast was first-rate, although pricey.  The hotels in central Stuttgart probably offer more old world charm, but this hotel has easy access to highways and to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 11, 2012Dear Saint Louis Traveller,  Yes Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts is an international chain with Swiss roots and high quality standards.
