Used the old hotel (currently wyndham) many times over the years and was always impressed with the quality and service. The new hotel is bigger with spacious rooms, great breakfast and very good service. The hotel is great for business. Free WiFi for the first 24 hours. The hotel is equipped for the handicapped. great experience.  A point to improve - the elevators on ground floor are not so easy to reach since it is paved with chairs and tablesRead moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 8, 2015Dear guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.
