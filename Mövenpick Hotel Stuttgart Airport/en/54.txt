Great hotel, spacious room with a luxurious bathroom. I ate in the hotel restaurant, although the menu was small they offered a self serve anti pasti which is was very enjoyable.  There is a very calming Welness center also which was very clean and well maintained. I was a little disappointed it wasn't open before 3pm, as it would have been nice to use the sauna etc. in the early AM.  Would stay again if I was in Stuttgart and required close to airport!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 29, 2018Dear Guest,   Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport. It is great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us.  Due to the low demand of our wellness area in the mornings, we do not open it until the afternoon. We regret that you did not have the opportunity to enjoy our spa and we hope that it works out the next time.  We hope you had a pleasant trip back home and we will look forward to welcoming you back again soon.  Kind regards,  Jürgen Köhler, General Manager – Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportRead more
