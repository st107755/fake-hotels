Very attentive staff, beautiful spacious and modern design beyond standard hotel atmosphere. Felt a very personal living space in rooms. Extremely comfortable beds and stunning breakfast buffet with hot choices, cold buffet, fresh fruit and breads. All highest standard with local touch. Food in restaurant is freshly prepared and fantastic quality and taste. Big portions so don't be deceived by a small portion option. It's still a full course size. Location is unbeatable for business trip or trade fair at ICS with 100m walking distance and Stuttgart airport 30m in other direction. Will definitely be back.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 18, 2016Dear guest,  thank you very much for your positive feedback for our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.
