The hotel opened its doors only some months ago and offers a very stylish interior. The rooms are nicely decorated, designed in dark colours, with very good beds. The fitness-club is quite big, with about 15 training machines, and a large wellnes area with a large (!) finnish sauna, a bio sauna and a steambath, also different possibilities to relax afterwards. I had breakfast in my room without additional fee, what had to be warm was delivered warm, everything was tasteful - quite a good hotel. BUT be aware that the gateway to the car park is very close the the most expensive car park of the Stuttgart airport. I chose the wrong drive - which cost me 7 Euros on topRead moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
