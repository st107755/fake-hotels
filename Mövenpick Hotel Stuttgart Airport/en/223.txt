stayed here for 2 nights. as a smoker was perfect, they have a separate part of each floor that has smoking rooms. door opens automatically for you to enter smoking section of the floor.   the breakfast was fantastic. they had a wide range of selection. also live egg station to make your own eggs.   only disadvantage is the showers in the room has one kind of shower gel and shampoo that is 2 in 1.  suggest you bring your own.
