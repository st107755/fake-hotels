This hotel is a few hundred feet from the Stuttgart airport. In the airport you can catch the train directly into Stuttgart which is about 25 minutes away. The hotel is very close to the convention center so if you are staying there you can walk to that.   It is very nicely appointed and the food is top notch. I highly recommend this hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 11, 2017Dear guest,   Thank you very much for your lovely comment and your stay with us.
