Booked as the final night of a week long trip and being so close to the airport it was ideal.  Great staff, great room, lovely breakfast (too much choice :) Downstairs bar was good, as was Herr Peters.  Would definitely use again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for you lovely comment on TripAdvisor.
