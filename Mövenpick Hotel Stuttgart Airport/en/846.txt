This is the perfect hotel to stay at before or after a flight.  We stayed for 1 night and it met our needs in every way.  Check in was efficient as was check out.  Our room was fantastic.  I am not sure if they are all the same but our room was huge and all new modern facilities.  The cot for our baby was also brand new.  Everything was extreemly clean.    I would definately stay it this hotel again if I arrived late or have another early morning flight from Stuttgart.   Just a short walk across to check in - so convenient!  This hotel is fantastic!  I wish more hotels were this efficient,  comfortable and modern.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare Response from AssistantStuttgart, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 27, 2009Dear luvofholidays,   Thank you very much for taking time and for your outstanding rating.
