For the business traveller perfect location and service. Breakfast one of the best to be found.

Hope it stays this way.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 21, 2013Dear dullyjan  Thank you so much for your great feedback.
