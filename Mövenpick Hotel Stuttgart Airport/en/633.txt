Second time I stay here. By far the best airport hotel I have stayed at, and definitely one of the top hotels in Stuttgart! I will not stay at any other hotel but this one in my frequent visits to the city. Excellent food, staff, room and facility conditions. And the best is that it is not the most expensive in Stuttgart and is worth every penny. Thank you Mövenpick for the best hospitality in Stuttgart!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 17, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you for your fantastic comment for our hotel on Tripadvisor.com.
