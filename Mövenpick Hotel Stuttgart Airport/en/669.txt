This is what Mövenpick does best if they have the opportunity. It´s modern, stylish, airy and extremely professional. The reception is friendly and fast and happy to help with any information you need. The rooms are first class, though this is a four star, and in the morning - if you´ve booked an early flight - you´re in the airport in a minute, as you simply have to cross the road. And no noise ...  Excellent quality in the restaurant - you won´t want to go somewhere else for dinner, and a large and varied breakfast for those who have time.  If you need to be at this end of town, and you need access to the airport, then this is my choice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Online reputation manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 21, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you so much for your very positive feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
