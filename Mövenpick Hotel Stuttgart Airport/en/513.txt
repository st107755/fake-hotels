Staying at Moevenpick Hotel, you will be next to the Messe (CMT) and the Airport. No transport needed to both.  If you want to go anywhere in Stuttgart or nearby, the Train is next door.  The staff and the management are very friendly and accommodating.  Especially those attending the fair at the CMT, this is the right place.

We are happy that you like our hotel in all sectors and that you experienced our friendly staff. It is great to read that you enjoyed our location nearby the airport and fair and it is right that the S–Bahn station is inside the airport and takes 20 minutes to the city centre.  It would be great to welcoming you back in the not too distant future and for the meantime we wish you all the best.  Sincerely,  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
