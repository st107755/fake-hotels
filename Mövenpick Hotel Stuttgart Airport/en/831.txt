Nicely designed, clean and cozy rooms; great location: just a 2 minutes walk from the airport. Quick check in and check out; english speaking, friendly and welcoming staff at Reception as well as the bar. 5 stars service. I really recomend it for business trips at Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
