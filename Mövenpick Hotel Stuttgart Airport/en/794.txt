I was very please with my recent visit to the Movenpick. After arriving at 8am off a very long flight, I was greeted with warmth but the front desk. Upon checkin, I had asked for an iron. This had been an issue in the past at other area hotels. Within 10 mins, it was delivered to my room and I was told to keep it for my entire stay. After a  long flight, the wardrobe needed a little love! The rest of the stay was as pleasant and the staff was all very nice, bar and restaraunt were also good. i do not speak german and it was not an issue.  This was my 10th vist to this area and by far the best with the best service.
