When you check at the front, it is tricky how to get to the main lobby- car access is not very intuitive from the airport(Flughaffen road). Walking from Terminal 3 is a minute direct walk. Food is good in the restaurant- service may not be that prompt though. Breakfast buffet is slightly overpriced,even when traveling on business (28 Euros is a bit too much to spend for a typical breakfast in Germany).Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 14, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you for having given us your feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick of Stuttgart.  We are pleased that you found the location of the hotel as convenient and that you enjoyed your hotel room.  Regarding the access to our hotel garage, the easiest way is to follow the P6 sign and take the first hotel entrance on your left. Concerning the access from the airport terminals, it is true that the hotel entrance is at a lower level than the reception situated on the first floor.  Regarding your experience in our restaurant, I have transmitted your comment regarding the service. However, as far as the breakfast is concerned, there must have been a mistake as the breakfast buffet costs 22,50€. Please do not hesitate to contact our team directly so that we can refund you the difference.  Should you stay with us again, I would also like to inform you that you can have a breakfast à la carte instead of our breakfast buffet.  We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again and wish you all the best in the meantime!  Kind Regards Tiaré de Vries Online reputation managerRead more
