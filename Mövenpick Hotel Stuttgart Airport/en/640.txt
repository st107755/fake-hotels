Top hotel in front of the airport exit. Very good service, with very professional staff. The rooms are good, big enough for a business stay. Missing an iron, a good shampoo and soap.  Unbelievably for a business hotel, they only offer Wi-Fi for three hours. The breakfast is not dazzling, although enough, it's just according to the hotel price. Nevertheless, definitely the right choice in terms of business hotels in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 6, 2014Dear Guest, thank you for your comment for the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.

Regarding the breakfast, I would like to inform you that you have the choice between the buffet where all hot drinks, egg specialties, and fresh juices are also included and our breakfast à la carte. The last option may be more adequate if you are on the go or willing to have something small in the morning. Dear guest, we do hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again.
