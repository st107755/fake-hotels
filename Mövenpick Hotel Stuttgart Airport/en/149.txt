Ideally suited for Stuttgart Airport, this hotel makes early morning departures a breeze, as you can return any rental transport the night before and walk to the terminal in under 5 minutes.  The facilities look good, the service is excellent and I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling out of Stuttgart Airport.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 24, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
