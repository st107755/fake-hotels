We decided to treat ourselves to a good start to our Christmas holiday by staying overnight at the airport. It was a great idea and allowed us to get up at a reasonable hour. The room was great, (we took a standard room) the bed very comfortable and the breakfast was wonderful with options for all tastes, I think.  A theory of mine was confirmed however: the more stars a hotel has, the longer you have to wait to check in. I couldn’t understand this, as there was lots of staff at reception. Anyway, nevertheless, the staff were great and the overall experience really good.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 23, 2018Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your positive feedback on TripAdvisor and your stay with us.
