Checked in here for one night while visiting a show at the Messe, this is about 2 minutes walk away so very practical. The hotel itself is something of a let-down when you think that your reservation has been made at the sister hotel, a very plush looking 5 star over the road. That said, although a little dated, and the single room on the small side, the staff were excellent, most helpful, dinner was very good and above all the proximity to the show gave me a lie in the next morning.
