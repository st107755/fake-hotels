I've wanted to stay here a while but it's never normally on my work budget. Managed to get a deal on booking.com this time.  Warm welcome, which at 2245 is must pleasing. Bedroom very well equipped and very comfortable bed.  Clean, quiet, great shower all the normal requirements.  Breakfast very good too.  Parking is outrageous! Park in p4 or p2!  Rooms, as all German hotels, stupidly warm!Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 1, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for having shared your feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com. It is always helpful for us to get feedback on how our guests such as yourself are feeling within the hotel.  It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed our hotel especially the warm welcome at the reception as well as our well-equipped rooms. We are also happy that we met your expectations referring our breakfast buffet.  Regarding your comment concerning the parking situation, we can tell you that our parking garage is managed by an external company. Therefore we can’t offer parking for free but with a reduction of more than 50%. Our parking lot is located next to the terminal and our location is an ideal situation. At the cash register we have tried to largely point out about the reduction a hotel guest receives and are sorry if it didn’t catch your eye.    We regret that we did not come true with your expectations concerning the temperature in your room. You have the possibility to settle the temperature by yourself in the room until the pre-defined level of 18 degrees is achieved.   We will look forward to welcoming you back again in the not too distant future and wish you all the best in the meantime.  Kind regards, Tanja Rollny – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
