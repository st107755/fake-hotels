We come to Stuttgart often and always try stay here. It is disappointing if we can't. When that happens, we usually change our plans around so we can stay at the Movenpick. It's convenient, clean and well priced. Its probably the best airport hotel that we have stayed in. Staff is friendly and very helpful. As long as we have been coming here, I note that the rooms do not seem to tire. Everything continues to looks great.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 19, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback and for staying again in our property.
