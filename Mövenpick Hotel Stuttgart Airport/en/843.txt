We were delayed in Stuttgart as Birmingham Airport was closed and our flight was cancelled.  The airline, Flybe, booked us in overnight at the hotel and we were delighted to be there.  It was a short walk across from the airport to the hotel.  The staff were so polite and helpful, at check-in, in the restaurant and in the bar.  We had a very relaxing time and felt very priviledged to have been booked into the Movenpick Airport.  The hotel, as the name suggests, is at the airport, but we were not aware of this when we were inside, or even when we were in our room.  The whole experience was a pleasure.  The hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff were helpful and pleasant.Read moreDate of stay: January 2010HelpfulShare Response from AssistantStuttgart, Guest Relations at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 29, 2010Dear KrisLeicester,  Thank you very much for your positive feedback and your friendly praise.
