As a last minute decision we booked a stay on-line at Movenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport. What a great place to stay. Accommodations were outstanding. The breakfast buffet was included in our booking and it was wonderful. Staff in the bar and restaurant were friendly and very helpful. Rooms were large and had all the essentials. Fantastic quality and service.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 16, 2019Dear Guest,   GREAT!
