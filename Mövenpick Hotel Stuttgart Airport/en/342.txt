This was a wonderful experience and having stayed at Moevenpick Hotels world wide this is one of the better ones. The only issue I had, was with the clear glass that separated the bathroom and bedroom. You could see the person taking a shower. Breakfast is one of the most excellent breakfasts that I have seen or had in quite a while staying in any hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 24, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your stay with us and your lovely feedback on TripAdvisor.
