I stayed here for one night in August after an evening flight from Brussels to Stuttgart. Didn't have the time to explore the hotel so my review is only based on the reception, my room and the breakfast.  Don't have that much experience with staying at airport hotels but don't think you can get anything better than this.  Room was clean, spacious and quiet. Bathroom, exactly the same with a nice rubber duckie keeping me company in the shower.  Breakfast was maybe a bit pricy but there wasn't anything missing as far as I could see.  All staff friendly and professional. Location is just superb as it's literally a 1min walk from the terminal.  Definitely one of the best hotels I have ever been while travelling for work in that price range.
