We chose this hotel based upon its Tripadvisor ratings and its proximity to the Stuttgart Airport. It was one of the best hotels at which we stayed during our trip to Europe, albeit one of the most expensive. But it was worth it. We walked to the airport and took the train to Stuttgart, making transportation easy. Even though it is directly across the street from the airport, it was quiet. I would not advise staying here with someone other than a spouse, as the window between the shower and the bedroom might be a little awkward. As a married couple, this did not bother us. If I had been with a friend, co-worker, or child, this would have been a problem. The staff was first class. I would definitely stay here the next time we were in the area.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
