Please use the hotel website to check prices. I have paid 36 euros for this hotel on the Movenpick website and they're letting me check out at 2pm without extra charges! It's clearly a weekend special offer but it was more than £100 on all other websites. Awesome place, beautiful room and seconds walk from the airport. It doesn't get better than this!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest,  Congratulations, you are our lucky person!  In all Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts worldwide we are working with the best price policy and we always offer the best available room price at the time of booking. We offer in addition very attractive prices during off season. Please let me inform you that on your booking day we were working on a system switch and in this process an undetected fault has been emerged in the hotel system. So this was your benefit to get this good bargain.  It is a big pleasure to see that you were happy about your stay and you had some special aha-moments.   We are looking forward to welcoming you back and wish you all the best in the meantime.  With kind regards Laura Liebel – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe  Read more
