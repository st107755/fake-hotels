At the end of April I stayed at the Mövenpick for two nights. All in all a very nice hotel. The room was spacious and clean. I felt very comfortable in the room. The bathrrom was spot-clean and well equiped. Desprite the location right next to the airport: Very quite. Storing of the luggage after check-out was no issue whatsoever. Breakfast was very expensive, so I skipped it. Unfortunately free Wifi is not offered for the standart rooms, that would be a nice feature. I pool would be nice aswell. Will return for the fair next year and stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Assistant at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 11, 2012Dear guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share your experience with us.
