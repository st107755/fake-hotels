VERY VERY nice hotel and VERY close to the airport. Don't let that fool you, you will not hear a single plane. the rooms are very cozy and nice. The bathroom design may not be comfortable for people traveling as a friend group as the restaurant is visible all the way from the bedroom. the staff are very helpful and the train station/subway is very close. if i ever go back to Stuttgart i would stay nowhere else for sure!Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 31, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your feedback and your stay in our property.  We are very happy that you enjoyed our location and that you highlighted our friendly staff. Thank you for your recommendation.  Thank you also for your comment regarding the window in the bathroom. The idea of the hotel´s designer was to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. Nevertheless the bathroom windows are equipped with a roller blind, so that our guests have the possibility to separate the two areas.  Dear guest, we would be pleased to welcoming you back again and wish you all the best in the meantime.  Kind regards  Jürgen Köhler, General Manager –Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport Read more
