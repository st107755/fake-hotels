The Movenpick is literally steps away from the Airport.  The hotel is very nice, good facilities, and rooms are comfortable.  The best part is rolling out of bed and catching your flight.  Brunch is twenty euro so I just ate at the airport instead, which is fine.   Glad to have stayed here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare Response from AssistantStuttgart, Sales Assistant at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 8, 2009Dear nomad633,  Thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your opinion.
