We stayed at the Movenpick at the weekend and were surprised at a few things. 1.. How close it actually was to the airport 2. How quiet it was considering we were right next to the airport 3. How big spacious and what a lovely hotel it was.  We really enjoyed our stay here and the convenience to get to the airport to jump on the train into Stuttgart was great. Would really reccomend staying there.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear guest,   What a pleasure - your rating is highly motivating!
