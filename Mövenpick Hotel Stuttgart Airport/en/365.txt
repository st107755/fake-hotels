Pros: Very spacious rooms, well sized bathroom, great breakfast, nice lobby with some sweets on the counter, 3 min walk to airport. Cons: frosted glass bathroom doors, with an unfortunately large gap between the doors, so not 100% private; not well sound proofed, but many planes don't fly by, particularly at night, so sleep is not disturbed.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 18, 2016Dear Guest,   Many thanks for your great feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.   It is great to read that you enjoyed the stay with us, especially our great breakfast, our rooms and our distance to the airport.  Thank you for your comment regarding the door in the bathroom. The idea of the hotel´s designer was to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight and a glass door which is useable for the bath but also the toilet and therefore does not close completely.   We will look forward to welcoming you back again to enjoy our sweets and more.  We wish you all the best for the meantime.   Kind regards   Victoria Zimmermann – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe  Read more
