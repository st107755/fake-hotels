I stayed there for one night because I was in transit, flying the next day from Frankfurt to Panama, the hotel was fantastic, spacious rooms, friendly staff, big beds, right across from the Stuttgart airport terminals, you can walk, if your flight is early in the morning they offer coffee and croissants.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 15, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind feedback and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
