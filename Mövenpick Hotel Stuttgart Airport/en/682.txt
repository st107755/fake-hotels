While travelling home from our holiday in Croatia we had a stop-over at Hotel Mövenpick in Stuttgart, located directly in front of the airport. We chose the hotel because of the very good reviews we read on Tripadvisor and so right we were. We travelled along the E52 so it is ideally located about 3 minutes from the exit and they have their own (hotel) parking space in the garage. As a lot of visitors already stated you feel welcome from the very first minute, the rooms are very nice and you hear no sounds at all from the airport. And the restaurant is worth a visit also, we had dinner and breakfast there and both were very, very good. And it is indeed directly in front of the airport so when you ever fly out or in to Stuttgart Airport, or are looking for a stop-over somewhere…Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 22, 2013Dear Mr Oldenhof,  Thank you so much for your great feedback.
