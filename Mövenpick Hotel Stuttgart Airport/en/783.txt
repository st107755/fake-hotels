This new hotel has replaced an earlier Movenpick Hotel that next door. The hotel delivers all the facilities and benefits that Movenpicks are renowned for. The room was spacious, and free internet - with decent bandwidth - was a nice surprise. The restaurant was excellent, with an extensive menu. Breakfast was very good, but the cost was rather steep. This is a perfect hotel for anyone needing an airport stopover or visiting the brand new convention centre, but the middle of Stuttgart is also easily accessible using the excellent S-Bahn system.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear pandalf,  Thank you for having taken the time to give us your feedback.  The Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Messe did effectively close in December  2011.  The Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe is open since 2007 and offers design & technology with Mövenpick standards.   It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay in one of our Executive rooms with free Internet access as well as our Food & Beverage offer.  Furthermore, I registered that you found the price for the breakfast buffet as inappropriate.  I would like to inform you, that we also offer the possibility to have breakfast a la carte. Then you have the benefit of just paying what you consumed. On the buffet, we do offer a wide variety of different types of food, beverages, eggs and all the coffee specialties are included in the price of € 22, 00. Thank you for your comment and your understanding.  Dear pandalf, we in fact know that there are many hotels in Stuttgart and so we would like to say thank you, that you have chosen us and we are looking forward to welcoming you in our hotel.   Kind Regards Guest RelationsRead more
