located at the airport of Stuttgart, the hotel is of course very convenient when having a connection or a late flight and further travel by car. although 4 people were behind the counter at check-in, only 4 were actually checking in, even when 8 people were waiting. took around 30mins to check in. hotel is modern, clean and spacious, this is applicable for the rooms as well. Strange thing was that the toilet was not flushed... maybe the cleaning lady had an urgent matter... I got a candy when checking out to compensate, which is a bit silly... Overall a good stay, with friendly staff.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 10, 2012Dear Jimmy,  Thank you very much for having shared your opinion on Tripadvisor.
