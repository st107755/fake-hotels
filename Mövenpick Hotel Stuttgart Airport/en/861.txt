I stayed in this hotel as I had a very early flight from the airport the next morning and a long trip the day before.  The lobbey is fabulous, with changes for check ins displayed on TV screens and you couldnt be any closer to the departures area!  Very much a business hotel.  I was the only guest I could see not wearing business attire!  The room was lovely, quite large and with lots of little, thoughtful extras like a rubber duck for your bath and a letter apologising for the noise from a building site accross the road which didn't bother me at all. I didn't eat in the restaurant preferring a quick snack in the airport. Heartily recommended for those leaving early the next morning! Read moreDate of stay: March 2005HelpfulShare
