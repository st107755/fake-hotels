Excellent quality rooms and attentive staff. Breakfast whilst good are worth 22 Euros I am afraid and I am sure that more people would take this if it were a more reasonably price. Ideal for my early return flight from the airport (1 minutes walk) in the morning.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 15, 2012Dear John H.
