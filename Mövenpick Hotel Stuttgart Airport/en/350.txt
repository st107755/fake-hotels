The hotel position is excellent. 5 minutes walks from both Stuttgart Airport Terminal 1 and the Stuttgart Fairgrounds. The hotel and the service are both excellent. we were upgraded to the suite (the hotel was almost fully booked) and the rooms was a dream; deeply clean, luxurious, comfortable. the Spa facility is nice but I expected a little bit more, considering the level of the hotel. Prices are a little too high but probably in line with German standards and the fair period.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 7, 2016Dear Guest,  It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe. Thank you for your wonderful feedback and motivation.  It is nice to read, that you were happy about the upgrade to the suite and you had some special aha-moments. It is unfortunate that we could not meet your expectations in the case of our hotel prices however, to supply this type of quality at this prime location and in order to pay the employees at an acceptable level we need to charge these prices. We also have a best price guarantee in place and offer in addition very attractive prices during off season.  We are looking forward to welcoming you back and wish you all the best in the meantime.  With kind regards Laura Liebel – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe  Read more
