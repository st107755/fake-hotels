I've been going to Mövenpick Hotels since the 80's. Not exclusively, but for last minute travel plans, you can't go wrong. Fabulous rooms, great restaurants and knowledgeable staff make this hotel decision a winner. Just a great comfortable stay with maximum relaxation impact after a long miserable trip.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 9, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for your positive feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
