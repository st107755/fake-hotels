I've stayed at this hotel a number of times and it's always a real treat. I love the fact that you cannot hear the planes AT ALL - which is somewhat unusual for an airport hotel. Also, the doors close gently and quietly, so you're never disturbed by fellow guests. The food is yummy, the rooms are well equipped and the location of the hotel is great too. There's an S-bahn at the airport, so you can get anywhere for 4.10 Euro. The staff are great too; everyone is fluent in English. The beds are really comfortable too.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your great feedback and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
