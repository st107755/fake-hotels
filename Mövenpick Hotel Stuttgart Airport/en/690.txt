Was in Stuttgart for a few days on business and had a great stay here. Clean well appointed rooms. Walking distance to airport which is a plus. Breakfast buffet was great...little expensive at 22€ but probably typical for the area. Would recommend to others.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear guest,   Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and for recommending us to other Tripadvisor users!
