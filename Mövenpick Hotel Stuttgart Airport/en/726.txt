Very good and very modern airport hotel at stuttgart echterdingen airport. Its quite big for an airport hotel, with a nice design from outside an the interieur. they have excellent rooms with a lot of space, comfortable beds, a really nice and new shower and everything else one would hope for. the stuff really understand what it means to be in a rush if you need to check out fast. they are very nice and kind in doing the things. all in all the mövenpick is a good place to stay for a stop over or for visiting an exhibition.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 31, 2013Dear CMS00,   thank you very much for staying with us at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
