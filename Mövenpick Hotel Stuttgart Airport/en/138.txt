I only got to know the parking price at checkout. Quite abusive price. The room price was okay but when including the parking price it is just not worth it. The location is far from Stuttgart Downtown. For the overall price including price it is better to have a hotel downtown.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from jkoehler, Geschäftsführer at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 3, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you for your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport and your feedback on the various channels.  Regarding the price for parking we can tell you that our parking garage is managed by an external company. Therefore we can’t offer parking for free but with a reduction of more than 50%. The fee for parking in our garage for an overnight guest is € 21,-. Our parking lot is located next to the terminal and our location is an ideal situation, however, there are about 4000 parking spots in the close proximity to the airport and therefore our hotel. It is certainly not a hidden charge as, like in every public garage, at the car entry and the pay machine we have clearly pointed out the prices and we are sorry that it didn’t catch your eye. In addition, the booking channel you have used shows clearly the parking fee under information. Your posting on that channel that you have paid € 25,- is obviously a mishap. You are certainly right about our location being at the airport and not downtown, however public transportation to the city in around 20 minutes is right across at the airport.  Dear guest, we wish you a happy summertime and remain  with kind regards from Stuttgart  Jürgen Köhler, General Manager - Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport Read more
