This is a lovely hotel just minutes from the airport and I found everyone was very welcoming and friendly. Nice and light open public spaces and the room - bathroom were of a very high standard and very comfortable. Rail connection to the city centre within airport and it is only 30 minutes by train. Great hotel ... Highly recommend.
