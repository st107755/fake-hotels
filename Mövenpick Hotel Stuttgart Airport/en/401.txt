Located ideally just a few minutes stroll from the airport terminal, this is an impressive hotel Check in was very friendly and efficient. My superior double room was just that, superior. Plenty of power sockets which is generally lacking in hotel rooms. Good desk space for working also. The bed was extremely comfortable and bathroom very well fitted Extensive hot and cold breakfast selection which is rare for a German hotel Very impressed overall and will certainly return on my next visit to StuttgartRead moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations  at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 7, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
