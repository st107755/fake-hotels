Very nice hotel, 200m from arrivals so very handy for the airport.   Excellent bar food and classy restaurant upstairs. Rooms excellent modern and comfortable.   It has a nice gym downstairs.   Only problem with the visit was that the broadband in the hotel was poor and not good enough for business traveller. It's supposed to be upgraded in 2015.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 29, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on tripadvisor.com.
