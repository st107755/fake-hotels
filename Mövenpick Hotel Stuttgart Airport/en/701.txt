This hotel is very high quality, and is just across from the arrivals area, this is reflected in the price. Although having stayed here on business several times I would strongly recommend it. I have never arrived soon enough to eat there in the evening but the breakfast is excellent, with a wide choice and to a high standard.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 18, 2013Dear Andrew,  Thank you very much for having stayed with us and for having taken the time to share your experience.
