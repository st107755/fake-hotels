I stayed at the Moevenpick last week, during a conference held in the same hotel. The location is great! It's exactly 4 walking minutes from the airport, the view of my room (5th floor) was fantastic, and I didn't hear any airport noise. The interior design of my room was simply overwhelming, the effects of a glass window between bedroom and shower, plus cleverly arranged mirrors made the room look even bigger than it already was. The service was prompt and very friendly, the food was excellent. One minor drawback was the keycard, that took three attempts to make it work - but also here the personnel helped promptly. All together a place I can definitely recommend!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 2, 2012Dear Alex A,  Thank you for staying at our MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and for your comment on TripAdvisor.com.
