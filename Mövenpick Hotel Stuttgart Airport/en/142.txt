The room is great. Quiet, comfortable beds, great shower.  If you don't like the glass wall in the shower, you can pull down the shade. Price very reasonable for a hotel of this grade. The bar and personnel were very knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant was excellent.  Great wine list.  We started with beef tartar which was excellent and then had scallops and pasta for our main course - superb.  The spicy scallops were a great compliment to the Pinot Grigio wine.  We had vanilla ice cream (excellent) for dessert with espresso.  To finish off, a 7 year Cabana Club rum. Great evening - great hotel - we'll be back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 28, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your lovely feedback and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
