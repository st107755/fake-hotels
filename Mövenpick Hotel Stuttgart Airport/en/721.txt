Staying for one night, very stylish room and bathroom. Bed was very comfy too. Food were really good too and the breakfast in room was great! Little flower and a great mix of fresh food. Close to e underground if you have time for a quick visit, about 15min from Stuttgart center. Overall a great hotel, just missing a pool to be perfect and maybe a bath for the people that like a soak. Plus just 1 min walk from the terminal!Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 7, 2013Dear guest,  thank you for having shared your positive feedback about your stay in our hotel.
