I stayed here my last night in Stuttgart, as it is walking distance to the Airport.  It was a lovely property, and the room was fantastic!  If I were doing business at the Airport, or the Messe, I would have stayed every night.  Unfortunately, it's not really convenient if you are doing business in the downtown Stuttgart area.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 28, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind feedback and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
