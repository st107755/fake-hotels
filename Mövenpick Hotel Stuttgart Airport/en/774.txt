Booked 2 nights but stayed one night as it was enough to see the exhibition.it is a very excellent choice for that purpose as it is just a minute from the airport and few minutes from the Messe.  The rooms are big and the food is good.but if u are in Stuttgart u can see the city as well and it is about 30 minute metro ride or may be even less.  Stuttgart is a nice city to see.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Assistant at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 21, 2012Dear guest,   Thank your for your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and your review on Tripadvisor.com.
