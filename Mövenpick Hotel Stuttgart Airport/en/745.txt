I had just finished a 45-day deployment to Germany from the US. I took a few days holiday on the end to go to Budapest, but I couldn't take all of my luggage with me. Further complicating the situation was that my flight back to Budapest from Stuttgart got in just before midnight. The Movenpick staff worked with me to safely store some luggage while I was gone, AND allowed me to check in really late. I could not have had a better experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 10, 2012Dear PanamaZac,  It is very rewarding for us to read that you have appreciated the service provided by our team and that we could meet your expectations during your stay.
