If you have an early flight, this is the perfect hotel for the night before - it is a five minute walk to the terminal. The rooms are totally soundproof with excellent windows. The rooms are ultra modern, especially the bathrooms. The restaurant is quite qood, and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The service is very good - the front desk will get your boarding pass for you.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 1, 2012Dear guest,  Thank you for having shared your feedback on Tripadvisor.
