We were attending an exhibition at the Messe, which is just a 3-4 minute walk from the Hotel - very convenient location.  There is a subway station in the airport, again just a few minutes walk, for easy access into Stuttgart centre.  Staff very friendly, breakfast was excellent.    The rooms were quite warm at night, and the 'window' from the bedroom into the shower could be off-putting to some people!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear Jon,  Thank you for your feedback on Tripadvisor.
