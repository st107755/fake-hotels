We stayed at the hotel the night before an international flight.  This put us right across the street from the Stuttgart airport, which was perfect for our early morning trek with luggage to our gate.  The hotel was beautiful and extremely quiet for being beside the airport.  Everything was clean and comfortable.  We used the free wi-fi (free for the first 24 hrs) with ease and enjoyed supper at the restaurant. The price was great through a travel website, too.  We will stay here again when we return to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 31, 2015Dear guest,  We are very glad to read that you had an enjoyable time at our hotel.
