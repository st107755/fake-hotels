The food is good, service is outstanding, and it is a nice property overall. This is my choice for a place to stay when I have late or early flights. Nice to be able to get off the plane or train and just relax in a clean, quiet setting while you are waiting for your train or you are too tired to deal with the autobahn after a transatlantic flight. There is a place next door that will clean your car as you long term park at the airport..Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 25, 2016Dear guest,  I read your positive feedback with great pleasure.
