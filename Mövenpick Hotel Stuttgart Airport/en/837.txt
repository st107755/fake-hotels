This is one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed at. The rooms are very modern and well appointed. The location is fabulous with such an easy walk from the airport and so close to the Conventon Centre. The bar is roomy yet has a homey feel to it. All staff that I have interacted with have been excellent. Finally, I appreciate that in room cable internet is complementary.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare Response from AssistantStuttgart, Guest Relations at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 10, 2010Dear SE_AD_49,  thank you very much for your feedback on Tripadvisor.
