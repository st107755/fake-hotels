Based there for 2 nights in Stuttgart and surrounds. Not exactly budget accomodation but for what you get it is in about the right price bracket. Good things :  comfortable, extremely convenient for airport (120 seconds from hotel door to security check for lufthansa!) comfortable beds, excellent bathrooms good security, helpful staff. down sides : rooms still struggle to keep cool even with ac on full blast, restaraunt is very expensive, parking although convenient should be complimentary for hotel guests or more discounted (€18 for 2 nights was steep I thought) all in all i was satisfied with my stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 28, 2011Dear Mr. Simarsden,  Thank you very much for providing us with your candid opinion what allows us to improve our standards according to our customer’s wishes and also to solve problems that creep in to the daily work routine.
