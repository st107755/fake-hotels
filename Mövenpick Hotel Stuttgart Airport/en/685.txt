Hotel is located just 1 Minute by walk from Airport Terminal. Nice rooms, slept very good, near no noice from Airport. I know this Hotel from long ago and stay allways there. Sad, dont know if its only in Summer, but Hotelbar is closed on weekends. I liked this bar so much. Of course they serve drinks in Restaurant but its not same style. I liked as well the bathroom an the shower. check-in and out is done fast.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear “pavouch”  Thank you for having taken the time to give us your feedback.   It is great to know that you feel well with us and that you enjoy coming back when you are staying in Stuttgart.   Our bar is open again on weekends as well, from 5.00 pm to 1.00 am. It was effectively closed during the month of August , at times of lower occupancy. I am sorry that you could not enjoy a drink at our Message bar. We did convert our lounge area to provide you with the same offer as the café & bar, however I can understand that the atmosphere was not the same. Our team at the bar is back and ready to welcome you during your next stay!  We are looking forward to welcoming you soon again.  Kind Regards Tiaré de Vries Online reputation managerRead more
