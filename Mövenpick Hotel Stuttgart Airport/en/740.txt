Myself and a friend stayed at the hotel for a long weekend as w  This is a beautiful hotel in a prime location with amazing, genuine and friendly staff - from the minute we arrived we felt really cared for and valued. We stayed for three nights to attend the Cannstatter Wasen with a friend who lives is Stuttgart.  The decor and feel of the hotel is very well done, it keeps a classic business style with subtle modern twists to the place. The room we stayed in was fantastic - large, comfortable, bright and airy, very comfy bed and good quality bedding. The only reason I haven't given the hotel 5/5 is there wasn't a door separating the bathroom from the room and there was a window from the bedroom into the shower which was caused a few embarrassing moments.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear R B  Thank you for having shared your opinion with us on Tripadvisor.
