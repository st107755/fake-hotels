Always my first choice when in town.  Location is excellent, the Stuttgart Airport Terminal is literally a one minute walk across the street, the S-Bahn is just as close, as is the A8 Autobahn.  Very good soundproofing, extremely comfortable beds, great bathroom, very clean throughout and the breakfast is definitely one of the best I have experienced in all of Germany.  And that says a lot, because Germany is a country with excellent breakfasts wherever you go, but this hotel's breakfast buffet is outstanding in every respect.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 18, 2016Dear guest,  Thank you so much for this wonderful and detailed comment on TripAdvisor.
