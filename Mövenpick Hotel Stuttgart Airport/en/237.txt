Very convenient for Messe and airport. Excellent rooms. Good business hotel and good - if expensive - buffet breakfast. Probably the best choice if you are attending a show at the Messe but not ideal if going into the city. No noise from the airport.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 8, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback on TripAdvisor.
