Clean and modern with great facilities.   Very easy to get to from the airport as well as the S Bahn.  The rooms were comfortable and had all of the amenities needed including robes and slippers.  The staff was very friendly.  While the breakfast buffet is quite extensive, at 20 euros overpriced for someone like me who is a light eater.
