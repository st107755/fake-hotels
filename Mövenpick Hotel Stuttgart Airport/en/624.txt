My first time at this very nice, modern hotel. Excellent location to walk to from the terminal. Very comfortable room, in the usual Movenpick way. Service levels very high, very pleasant staff.  I ate in huge restaurant for dinner, breakfast and then lunch the following day. The food was superb in every way! This obviously comes at a price, which was fairly expensive, especially the underground car parking charges...40 Euros for the overnight charge! Overall however, an excellent hotel, at a price and ideal for a late or early flight from StuttgartRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 15, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and for having taken the time to give us a feedback about your stay on tripadvisor.com.
