This is a nice clean hotel with friendly staff.  It is a 2 minute walking distance from the airport and the Messe, but you do not get disturbed by any noise. Very convenient.  The rooms were nice, clean and spacious.  I will use this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 24, 2013Dear martgr10,   thank you very much for your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
