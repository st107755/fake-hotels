A couple of years ago I booked this hotel because I had a meeting at the airport in Stuttgart.  I was very impressed - great rooms - excellent breakfast!   What you can expect of Movenpick.   But also a very regular and affordable connection to the center of Stuttgart via tube/train. Now I even book this hotel when I have business in the center of Stuttgart.  Great value for money!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 9, 2018Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your lovely feedback and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
