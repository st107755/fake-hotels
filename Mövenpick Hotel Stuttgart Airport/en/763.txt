Besides the fact that it is very conveniently located less than 1 minute from the Stuttgart Airport, everything about the hotel just seems to click.   Only gripe I have is the hotel price varies quite a bit like the stock market.   It's usually finally due to the many conventions and seminars that are conducted there.   I loved the wifi which is available at almost all corners of the hotel.  Breakfast is superb with huge range of breads and croissants.   And of course the strawberry jams......  They also freely display the apples and sweets and even have water and apple juice for you to drink, free of charge.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 4, 2012Dear AndrewTan5255,  Thank you so much for your review on TripAdvisor.com about your stays and the experience you've made in our MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
