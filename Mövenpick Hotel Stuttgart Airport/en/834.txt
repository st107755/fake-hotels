My husband and I frequently travel to the US from our home in France and always stay at the Moevenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport before departure.  The location is fabulous - only steps from the terminal.  However, best of all is the hotel itself.  The rooms are lovely, the staff friendly, helpful and polite.  The restaurant is excellent, both in terms of food and service. The ambience is warm and welcoming.  Additionally, we have stayed at other Moevenpicks, in Berlin, Egypt and Jordan and have found them all to be equally fine.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare Response from AssistantStuttgart, Guest Service at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 20, 2010Dear Ms. Ghminiter,  first of all we would like to thank you for your recent stay with us.
