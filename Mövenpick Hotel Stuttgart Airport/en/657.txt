I chose to stay at this hotel because I had an early flight out of the airport, and it was literally right outside of my terminal. The room was expensive enough, but on top of that, they charge for breakfast and internet. For how much the hotel is, they really over-charged. I had dinner here as well, and ended up paying almost 40 euros for 4 prawns, a salad, and a glass of wine. The room was comfortable and clean, and the staff was friendly. They also have a gym and sauna, which I didn't take advantage of, but seemed like a great area. Also, the windows are soundproof, so you don't have to worry about hearing planes all day. Overall, good stay, but make sure you plan your budget!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Administrator at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 7, 2014Dear Guest,   Thank you for having given your opinion about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com.
