Perfect if you arrive after 1 pm. This hotel is my  preferred hotel in Stuttgart. I just wish they had more than a restaurant since after staying there a few times a year the menu becomes boring . ....Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 26, 2016Dear Guest,  We are very happy to be your favorite hotel in Stuttgart. Many thanks for your feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.  I regret that you missed some more choices on our menu. Next to our restaurant “Trollinger”, in which we serve a range of different international, Swiss and regional meals, we serve a choice of snacks and smaller dishes in our Message Bar. We also have seasonal menus during eastern or summertime for example. On request and availability, our kitchen team will be happy to prepare a meal of your choice at any time. Also, right across the hotel, you will find the restaurant “Red Baron” the only star decorated restaurant at a German airport.  We will look forward to welcoming you back again soon and wish you a great time.  Kind regards  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
