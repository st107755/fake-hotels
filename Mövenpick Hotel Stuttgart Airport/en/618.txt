We stayed at this hotel for a Short City Break. It is right next to the airport and the Messe for events. Staff was Friendly and spoke English. The Spa was small with no Pool but a Normal and a Bio Sauna as well as a Steam room. The Restaurant is Excellent and the Breakfast is great. Sleeping with a open Window can be a problem in rooms facing the Airport due to departing planes but with closed windows it is quiet inside.  Using the train from the Airport to the City center takes about 25 min and runs every 20 minutes or so. The Shuttle to Metzingen Outlet city also runs from the hotel and back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relation at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 28, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you very much for staying at the Mövenpick Hotel in Stuttgart and for having shared your experience on Tripadvisor.
