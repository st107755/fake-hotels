Connected to the airport so was great for my early morning flight.  Very swift check out and obviously used to travelers who need to get to the airport on time.    Good sized rooms and very quiet.   Bar was lively .... being just before Christmas I think there were a few parties in there so may not always be like this.   Breakfast was also good.  Would use again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 21, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to give us such a great review!
