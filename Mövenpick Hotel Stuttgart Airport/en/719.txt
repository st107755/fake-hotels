I stayed here on a business layover and was pleasantly surprised by the high standard of decor, cleanliness and staff. Sometimes Airport hotels tend to be purely a bed for the night. This my friends is not one of those hotels. I highly recommend this hotel. My only suggestion for improvement is to provide totally free wifi to residents, but other than that don't change a thing!Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 18, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for staying with us and for your positive feedback on Tripadvisor!
