One of the best airport hotels anywhere! Good restaurant and high quality from Swiss Movenpick company. Very convenient and close to the airport if you have an early flight, but close enough to the centre that you can taxi in and back easily if you want to.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 21, 2017Dear Guest,   Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
