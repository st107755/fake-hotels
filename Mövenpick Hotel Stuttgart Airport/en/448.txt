Excellent hotel, couldnt get any closer to to airport with excellent links to stuttgart centre. The roon was spotless and couldn't be faulted, we didnt eat in the hotel as we were in stuttgart all day but the food did look good  but it was a bit expensive. As we only paid £124 for 2 nights it was excellent value for money and i would recomend this hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your lovely review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe  We always strive to exceed expectations and provide a nice experience both in the hotel and in the restaurant.
