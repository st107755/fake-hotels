Sandwiched between the airport and the trade fair it's location is perfect for this purpose.   Reception staff were friendly and informative. The rooms are modern and clean. Wifi is average. Waiting staff were very helpful and friendly and bar staff were excellent.  I really enjoyed the food in the bar and restaraunt. Would definitely revisit should I be back for the Control expo  Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 15, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your lovely comment and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
