I’ve been staying at the hotel for a conference, rooms are very nice and elegant, cool bathrooms with all comforts, refrigerator and nespresso coffee machine. Customer service was amazing, great breakfast and meals, and the fact of being in front of the airport makes it super easy to reach from other countries, without the need to get a taxi or a car rental.  A very pleasant stay for (not cheap, but) reasonable price (175€/night, breakfast included).Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 22, 2017Dear guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback and your appreciative words.
