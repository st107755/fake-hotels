First time here. Two nights stay were excellent, room, bar, dining all great. 2 mins walk to the check-in desk at the airport, excellent for a 6am flight. And best of all the price was great value for money considering the quality and location.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 23, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your great review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
