From the minute we walked in the door, it was pure calm.  What a nice place.  We certainly didn't expect this superior level of quality at an airport hotel.  The room was exquisite.  The bar was great and even got to watch a terrific Bayern / Barcelona game on their three big TV's.  Beer on tap was great.  Room was clean an truly quiet.  We expected plane noise, but never heard anything through the triple glazing.  Highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 20151 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 18, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.
