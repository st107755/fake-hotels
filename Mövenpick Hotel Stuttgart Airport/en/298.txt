This hotel is so well situated at Stuttgart Airport that my instructions where simple:upon exiting terminal its the building to the left and cross the walkers bridge.It worked and my room was well  appointed for my next flight next day to Munich.The breakfast buffet was great and everything throughout the hotel clean,well kept and almost Scandinavian interiorism.The hotel is modern and I do recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 21, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
