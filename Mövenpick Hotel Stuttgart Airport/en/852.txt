If have stayed at this hotel twice.  Rooms are clean and in good condition.  Service is good.  Restaurant is very good.  Hotel is very convenient to Stuttgart Airport and Convention center. Parking at the hotel is expensive.  I would rate a solid 4 stars and would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
