Comfortable rooms right next to the airport with the Messe nearby.    We only stayed one night so we didn't use the bar or restaurant but the staff were very friendly and efficient.   Car Park 6 is under the hotel at a charge of Euro 19 per day The only thing I didn't like was the window between the bathroom and the room.    There was no blind and some of us like privacy in the bathroom.

Great, that you found our location convenient and that you enjoyed our friendly staff as well.  I regret that you didn’t like the window to the bathroom. It was the idea of the hotel´s designer to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. We also have a few rooms without a window which can be requested during your next reservation.  It would be a pleasure to welcoming you back again. We wish you a successful New Year 2016.  Sincerely  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
