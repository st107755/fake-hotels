Very clean, quiet and luxurious.Very friendly staff. Comfortable room with exquisite bathroom. Excellent choice if one needs to be close to Stuttgart airport or Stuttgart in general. We would appreciate a faster free wifi connection and a less pricey parking although its convenient location makes this a worthwhile choice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 5, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for your feedback and your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.  It is a pleasure to read that you like our luxury hotel as well as our friendly and professional staff. We are happy that you enjoyed our comfortable rooms and our convenient location.  Regarding your comment concerning the cost for parking, I can tell you that our parking garage is managed by another company. Therefore we can’t offer parking for free but with an reduction of more than 50%. Our parking possibility is located next to the terminal and our location is an ideal situation.  We do offer free internet with 1 mbps in all our Superior rooms and with 5 mbps in all our Premium rooms, Junior Suites and Suites.  We will look forward to welcoming you back again in the not too distant future and wish you all the best for 2016.  Kind regards  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
