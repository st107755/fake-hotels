Just walk from the terminal to the hotel (hope it is not raining .)  It is a large hotel with all the facilities and the airport with restaurants and shops an easy walk.  There is station in the airport so the transportation to Stuttgart is easy 3.30e for  a ticket .  The price is high but it buys a lot of convenience.  I would have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, but they did not have an airport  shuttle on weekends.  The shower had a glass window to the bedroom that had no screen or cover so in the bedroom you looked into the shower.  Watching someone else shower might not please  everyone.  As a single it did not bother me.Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
