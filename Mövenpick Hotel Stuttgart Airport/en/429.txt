These folks are true provessionals and my overall experience was very good. We missed the mark on a few areas to make this airport hotel truly a great value for the money;  Parking for check-in was confusing, therefore poor; The bed was too hard and had no adjustment; the wifi was difficult to access. All other aspects of the hotel were very good and the locataion still makes this location a preferred one for myself and my employees when we come thru Stuttgart.
