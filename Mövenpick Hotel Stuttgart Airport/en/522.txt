Very briefly, the hotel benefits from a perfect location in front of the terminal and a nice early breakfast with free selection of croissant and coffee. Location is great for an early morning flight! Clean and very nice rooms. The restaurant in the hotel is really nice as well.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 24, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your wonderful feedback on Tripadvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
