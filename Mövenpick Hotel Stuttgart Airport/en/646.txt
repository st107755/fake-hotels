Excellent location for visiting the adjacent fair. Very clean, very tidy, very comfortable rooms, very good breakfast. Stayed there with a broken hand in a cast, encountered extremely good staff on all levels except management: had to leave one day early for unforeseen surgery, management insisted on 90% [sic] payment for that last out of three days, despite a four days early warning from my side and a fully booked house. All staff on all levels handled my predicament with outstanding helpfulness, so from management I would have expected a similar level of compassion, i.e. a decent handling of my issue, alas, I had to learn differently. From personal experience my recommendation is: a highly recommendable hotel, but don't expect too much from management when issues occur.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from jkoehler, General Manager at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 2, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your detailed feedback about your stay.  We are happy that you enjoyed our breakfast service and the helpfullness of our employees. Please rest assured that I have relayed these comments to my employees as this type of praise is an accelerating incentive for the future.  I am sorry to hear your comment regarding the management and our flexibility. Your reservation was booked in combination with a special group rate inclusive of certain stipulations for a company event and after consulting the organizer we were advised on the rule performed regarding the cancellation charges. I am sorry to note that this left a bad taste with you regarding the management of the hotel.   I do hope however that the experience you've had in the hotel with the service and quality will make you come back and enjoy your next stay even more.  Best regards  Juergen KoehlerRead more
