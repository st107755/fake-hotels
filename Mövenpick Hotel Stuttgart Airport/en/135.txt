Have been here a couple of times now, when the budget allowed it, and it is a true pleasure staying in this hotel.  Spacious rooms with all facilities, very quiet rooms and great service.  The breakfast is amazing. Bit problematic as you want to taste all!!  I didn't go to the restaurant bit went to the lobby bar every time as the atmosphere is great with a nice drink and food menu.  Location is perfect for having a car, catching a plane or take the S-bahn to the city.  I'll be back for sure!! Highly recommended.
