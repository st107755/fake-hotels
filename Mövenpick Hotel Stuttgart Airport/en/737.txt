Spent last night of our German and French holiday before flying out of Stuttgart to USA.  What a nice feeling to turn in your rental car, walk to the hotel and relax.  Really a world class business hotel, and it has everything you need.  On-site restaurant was outstanding for both dinner and breakfast,,,,after eating our way through our holiday, we didn't need to be eating more but really enjoyed it.  Should have used the nice fitness center :-) .  As you would expect, prices are a bit steep if you get a low end room (as we did): 30 euros for breakfast buffet for two (actually pretty typical from our experience) and 12 euros for internet access. Rooms extremely quite for a hotel right at the airport....actually much quieter than most in-city hotels we used.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 18, 2012Dear Ken S,  Thank you for having taken the time to give us your great feedback about your stay in the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
