What a lovely hotel this is and you can walk to it from the airport! The rooms are well equipped with mini car, flat screen tv and everything you would want from a hotel. It’s fitting are excellent and a lot very feel to it! Staff are great and the breakfast was great too! It was beanie for money at £100 a night! I would definitely recommend staying here! Great hotel!
