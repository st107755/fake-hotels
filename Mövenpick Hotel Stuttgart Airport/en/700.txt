It is a very good hotel for business trips, especially if you don't need to stay int he center of the city. It has good road connection to all surroundings, and there is absolutely no noise from the airport/planes within the hotel (great isolation).  Staff is very friendly and rooms are spacious and modern, with great bathrooms (you even get a little rubber duck haha). Nice breakfast with good variety. It is also one of the few hotels that still has smoking rooms.  The negative, no free WiFi. For the price of the room you pay you expect to have WiFi (as in any hostel and above in Europe). And if you really need it and decide to ask for the price, prepare to be shocked...  Anyway, for a short stay it's a very good option.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear “Maastricht Traveler”  Thank you for having taken the time to share your opinion about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
