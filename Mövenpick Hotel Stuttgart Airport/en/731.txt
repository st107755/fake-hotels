This is a great hotel with great service and a nice room.  The location is fantastic for early morning flights and there is zero aircraft noise within the room.    I really liked the heated tiles in the bathroom.  The window in the shower to the rest of the room (as noted by others) is a bit unusual, but no big deal.    I should have asked for an 'airport view,' as i ended up with one looking towards the highways, but no big deal.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 21, 2012Dear Traveler,  Thank you for sharing your impressions about your stay at the Moevenpick in Stuttgart on Tripadvisor.
