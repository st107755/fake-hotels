Booked 'blind' in a hurry, needed to be close to airport (200m from arrivals/departure door!) and Movenpick delivered! Classy place, great team, huge room, brilliant breakfast, good value. Can't fault it one bit, will be checking out other Movenpicks from now on.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 7, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
