Stayed here due to the fact that BA cancelled our evening flight without notice. Walked from terminal directly to hotel and they had a room available. Very efficient check-in with Florian who even gave me a shaving set and toothbrush kit FOC, as had only planned a day visit. Was able to have a late evening meal at 11pm as restaurant closed at 11.30pm. Good food, nice selection of beers and fast service. Breakfast was excellent - nice staff. Room was well appointed, clean and modern. Good bathroom too. Easy check-out and would book again. Thank you for a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 16, 2012Dear RUSS 1602,  Thank you for sharing your  feedback on Tripadvisor.
