I regret that we did not live up to your expectations concerning the air condition. You have the possibility to adjust the temperature in the room three degrees up or down until the pre-defined level of 18 degrees is achieved. Please let us know during your next reservation so we can cool down the room before your arrival.  Being at the airport, we offer an excellent sound proof with our windows however, once opened the noise level is certainly higher and the air condition stops working as well.  Nevertheless we hope that you had a pleasant trip back home and we hope to welcome you again soon. In the meantime we wish you all the best.   Kind regards,  Jürgen Köhler - General Manager, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
