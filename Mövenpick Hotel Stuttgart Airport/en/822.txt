Have stayed here several times and all my stays have been excellent. The hotel is right at the airport. Location and service couldn't be better. I like the restaurant as well, of course always sampling the Moevenpick ice cream as a dessert. Will definitely stay again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
