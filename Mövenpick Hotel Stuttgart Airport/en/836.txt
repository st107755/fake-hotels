The hotel is in front of the airport, just 5 minutes walking and the quality of service is excellent. Rooms are big, comfortable and quite stylish (in some of them is possible to see the shower from the room through a transparent glass on the wall).  The only problem I can mention is that. the first night I stayed there, I was bothered by a strange and continuous noise (like a click) apparently coming from the windows.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare Response from AssistantStuttgart, Guest Relations at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 30, 2010Dear Paoletor,  thank you very much for your feedback on Tripadvisor.
