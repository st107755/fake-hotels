I recently stayed at the Muvenpick on business. It is conveniently located across from the airport terminal, but is a lengthy subway ride to downtown.   The hotel is modern and beautiful with very unique flare, notice the international coo-coo clocks in the lobby. Each bathroom has a tall window that can see into the bedroom.  I mentioned the service because a collegue forgot his glasses and the restaurant gave him a pair of his choice to use for our two-day trip. The front desk also gave me an umbrella when they noticed that it was raining and I didn't have a jacket.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 30, 2011Dear Uh60josh,  First of all we would like to thank you for your recent stay with us.
