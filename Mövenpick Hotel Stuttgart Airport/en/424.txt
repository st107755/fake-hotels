I've stayed here during my business trip. It's a modern hotel close to airport. My room was comfortable, bathroom was spacious with good facilities. Free wifi works good. The atmosphere inside hotel is quite sterile. Breakfast was very good, buffet offered many options from the healthy corner to the salami or pancakes. Receptionist are professional, but not overly kind.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 12, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your feedback and your stay in out Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
