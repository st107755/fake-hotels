It has been an enchanted place to stay ! Close to the airport and no nuisance and close to the ICT MESS. I appreciated your welcome and even if they gave me at first a non smoking room, they changed it quickly and offered me a chocolate bar. At the bar, I was well served and in timely manner ! Thank you so much !
