Stayed at the Moevenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe for the first time since the new hotel was opened a few years ago - and was impressed! The new hotel is even better than the previous Moevenpick at the airport. Great rooms, wonderful breakfast, a very good in-house restaurant, parking in the basement (a bit expensive, though!) and state of the art sound insulation - you could hardly hear big aircraft take off! Add to this a friendly and very helpful staff and a splendid fitness/spa department, and the result is Moevenpick at it's best!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 22, 2013Dear Frank,  Thank you so much for this great feedback.
