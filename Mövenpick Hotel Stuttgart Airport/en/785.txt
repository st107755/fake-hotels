The Moevenpick Stuttgart Airport is my favorite hotel in the Stuttgart area. I stay there quite frequently since it has an outstanding service quality. The hotel itself is very stylish and modern. All the rooms I stayed are very nice and clean.  The best thing about this hotel however, is the service!!! All the personnel are very well trained, considerate and very passionate! Other hotels can do nice and clean rooms too, but this one has a very nice atmosphere because of the people working at Moevenpick Stuttgart Airport.  Make sure you stay at the Airport Moevenpick.  The Restaurant Trollinger is also highly recommended as food quality and service are outstanding too.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 21, 2012Dear hrueschen,    Thank you for having taken the time to give us your feedback; it is with a great pleasure that we have read your comment.
