Just 200m from the airport until you arrive at this oasis of tranquility. From the moment you check in, with Swiss chocolate on hand, as it is a Swiss hotel chain, you feel transported into a lap of luxury and this continues into the rooms with yet more squares of deliciousness at the sides of the bed. The room was comfortable, quiet and felt like an escape after a busy day. The staff were lovely and couldn’t do enough to help. Access into the centre of Stuttgart is so easy with the Straßenbahn or S train taking just 25 minutes and at a cost of €2,90 really affordable and the journey was enjoyable. Take S2 or S3 which run frequently.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 4, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
