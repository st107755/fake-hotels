This hotel was an excellent choice for staying the night before our 6am flight.  We were able to easily walk to the airport at 3:45am. It was nice to not have to get a taxi. The hotel is modern, so clean and very comfortable. We will stay here next time we come to Stuttgart!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 12, 2017Dear guest,   What a pleasure - your rating is highly motivating!
