Convenient location next to the airport.  Stayed here two nights, first upon my arrival in Stuttgart and again a week later prior to my departure.  The rooms were very comfortable and the internet connect connection excellent.  I'd definitely stay here again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 22, 2016Thank you for your feeback!
