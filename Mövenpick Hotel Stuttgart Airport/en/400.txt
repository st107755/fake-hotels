Excellent service, room was quiet, in very good conditions and quite clean. Location was convenient for a business trip (50 m from airport!) very well connected to downtown. Breakfat was great wide variety of foods with an excellent service. Check in and check out were smooth and driven with kindness and efficiency.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 7, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your wonderful feedback and the recommendation on Tripadvisor.
