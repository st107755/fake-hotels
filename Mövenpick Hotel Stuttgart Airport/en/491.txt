It doesn't get any better than this. A short walk across the street from the airport terminal. If you have a function at the conference center it's also very convenient. The room interiors are modern, clean. We stay here 2-3 times per year and have never been disappointed. Garage is reasonably large but if there is a function at the conference center it could be difficult to find a space. Never had breakfast there since we get out early. I just walk across the street and get a coffee there. Easier, faster and sometime I am leaving before the coffee bar opens. Overall, the best place to stay in the region.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for those wonderful lines on Tripadvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
