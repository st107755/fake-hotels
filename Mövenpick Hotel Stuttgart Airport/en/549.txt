Very convenient location, 5 mins walk from arrivals at the airport. Room was very large and very comfortable. Quality of decor and cleanliness very high. We ate and had drinks on the terrace next to the bar area on a nice warm evening and it was very pleasant. Bar and waiting staff were very good. I would recommend this hotel and will return for a future visit when travelling for business.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 20, 2015Dear guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.
