This hotel has fantastic decor throughout and very high standard of cleanliness. Room was spacious, nice furniture, very modern shower and WC layout, and comfortable bed ( love the German bed and duvets) . Hotel is located just outside terminal building.  Staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Wifi was very good Hotel is circa 30 mins taxi ride to the city. Good was nice in restaurant but I felt it was overpriced for what was on offer. Breakfast was good.  .Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
