The location of this hotel is superb.  I have stayed here more than once, and feel looked after and valued during my stay. The staff are great, and the breakfast is excellent, with a new miniature juice smoothy being produced each day, and lovely coffee.  I would recommend the Junior Suite for a real feeling of luxury!
