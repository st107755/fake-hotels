We had a great experience. The food and service were of a much higher quality than one would expect at an "airport" hotel. We would stay again the next time we visit Germany. The room was well designed and roomy. The bed linens were very comfortable. We actually slept well the night before our flight which is unusual for us.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 20, 2016Dear Guest,  thank you so much for your lovely comment and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
