This hotel is the exception. I witnessed the staff going above and beyond to provide excellent guest services to many guests. Room designed, décor, cleanliness sets the example for other 5 star hotels. For hotels in Germany having Air conditioning and wash clothes in the room is a BIG-PLUS and Movenpick does. Parking is convenient, available, and reasonable. Being next to the airport presented not problem with noise. Free internet service is more than sufficient.
