Excellent location to the Stuttgart airport.  Great hotel and rooms, at a great price.  If breakfast is purchased separately it is very expensive. Get it included with the price or skip it...25 euro per person.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 29, 2017Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport and your feedback.  We are proud to read, that you like the great location of our house as well as the comfort we provide our guests in our rooms. Thank you also for positively highlighting our room prices.   Regarding your comment of our breakfast charges, we do offer only sustainable and regional products as well as our own brand products at the breakfast buffet with over 150 items including all warm beverages and a large variety of on the spot made items. Therefore we think that the price is justified and an a la carte option is also available. Just contact our restaurant team at your next stay.
