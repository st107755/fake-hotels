I have stayed in this wonderful hotel from 15/01 - 24/01/2011 and I have to say one thing: The hotel is truly a five star hotel not only because of its structure, but also because of the way the management of the hotel reacts in any issue may arise from the clients. SPECIAL thanks to Ms. Heike from the Main Restaurant, she is realy a very friendly and very helpful person, you must meet her, also Ms. Julia the waitress, and not to forget Mr. Steffen Buechs, the Front office Manager and his team. You are the reason to come again next year to your hotel! Keep doing this extraordinary job you are doing.
