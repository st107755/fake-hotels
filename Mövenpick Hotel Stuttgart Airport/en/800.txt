I have stayed at the Stuttgarrt Moevenpick on several occasions as I come and go from Germany. The hotel staff are excellent and always quick to respond to any concerns. As  business traveler you appreciate having the great service, good food and comfortable room!! For those who like to exercise, you can take a 3 minute walk to the Bosch  parking garage and make you way across the highway to miles of walking/running/biking trails. I take full advantage of this each time I am there. The food in the restaraunt is good and a decent wine selection is available. My only complaint was came from my last trip...I was eating solo and a table of 8 sat next to me. My server forgot about me and only served the large table....however that was the only bad experience I have ever had at this…Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 8, 2011Dear LexKYtraveler,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share your experience.
