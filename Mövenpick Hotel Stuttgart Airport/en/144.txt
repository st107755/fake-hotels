This hotel was very fancy. Darkening curtains do not have the option to close so sunlight comes in every morning. Shower has glass window into room so don't stay with anyone you aren't comfortable showering in front of!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 26, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your positive feedback regarding your most recent stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.  Great that you gave us the highest score on Tripadvisor – thank you!   Thank you for your comment regarding our curtains. In all of our rooms we have blackout curtains, which are closable and are hidden behind the décor curtains. The transparent curtains are used for visual protection during the day. For your next stay please do not hesitate to contact our employees of the reception to assist you.  Concerning the window in the bathroom we can say that it was the idea of the hotel´s designer to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. The door of the bathroom will either close only the toilet or the whole bathroom. We also have a few rooms without a window which can be requested during your next reservation.  Dear guest, we will look forward to welcoming you back again soon and wish you all the best in the meantime.  Kind regards  Jürgen Köhler, General Manager - Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport Read more
