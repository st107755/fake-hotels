comfortable bed, clean bathrooms, a/c system is good, reception is friendly, breakfast is good, everything you can ask for with a hotel.  Only thing is that I think they should have a Bell desk to help people around.  I mean , it's near the airport and all.  Anyways, pretty nice stay.  and again, tripadvisor should consider half ratings.  This place is definitely a 4.5 rating.  This hotel not inside the city obviously, so very convenient if you need to catch a flight.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear Guest,   Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
