The hotel is just opposite of the terminal in walking distance. Very proficient and helpful staff. Rooms are fantastic and have been renovated recently. It does not really matter whcih floor. Restaurant and Bar are ok, service at breafast was a little low during my last visit. The hotel is ideal for a late evening arrival or early morning departure. It is also ideal for "fly in" meetings, as STR airport offers relatively good connections within Europe and Germany. Internet is unfortunately an extra charge 12 € for 24 hrs.  Great Gym in the hotel, easily accessible underground garage.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear „fedn“,  Thank you for having shared your opinion about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
