I simply cannot believe that I was able to stay at such a wonderful hotel for such a reasonable room rate. The room was fantastic, there was absolutely no noise from the airport, which is about 1-minute's walk from the hotel, the staff are simply excellent, the restaurant is 5-star . . . I cannot say enough good things about this hotel!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
