I recently had a wonderful time in Movenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport; and was particularly impressed by the bathrooms. As the cleaning lady had been in only moments before, they were exceptionally clean. We stopped to use a roadside bathroom on our way and were pleasantly surprised by the stark difference between them. They had a great playlist, mood lighting, and a convenient coat rack. Overall, I had a very enjoyable time there and can't wait to go back. ♡♡♡Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 25, 2018Dear guest,   Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
