The hotel is just across the street from the airport and just a few hundred meters from the Messe. So the location cannot be better. On top of that, the hotel is very nicely decorated with a contemporary, chic style. The room is very comfortable as well. The breakfast buffet is well-stocked with good quality -- except, I would have thought that the pastries would've been better. The croissants were a bit soggy. But that is really not that big a deal. Overall, I was very surprised by the style and quality of the hotel. The staff is professional and courteous as well.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 22, 2012Dear Jay K,  Thank you for sharing your experience at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
