The whole hotel is stylish and elegant. People at the reception desk and in the restaurant are wonderful and very helpful and welcoming. The breakfast buffet offered a huge choice of food. The room was clean, very comfortable, unbelievably quiet (which is very important to me), there were three different pillows on the bed, and of course, there were a couple of welcome chocolates and a free bottle of water. There was also a writing desk and a nice armchair with a footrest. If I ever come back to Stuttgart, I know where I am going to stay :).
