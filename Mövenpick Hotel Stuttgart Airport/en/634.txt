This is the most fantastic airport hotel I have ever stayed. It was 5 star, quality, the hotel and the rooms were just fantastic, we had everything we needed. We didn't have breakfast as we had an early flight to catch, but we did smell the coffee in the lobby and that told us it would have been great. We also had room service the night before and it was worth every penny. We would definitely return next time we are in stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 13, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your wonderful feedback on tripadvisor.com.
