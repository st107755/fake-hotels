Our aim is to provide our guests a comfortable and friendly atmosphere. Therefore we are very happy that you enjoyed your stay and the location of the hotel as well as the offer in our Restaurant Trollinger. Please be sure, that I will share your commendation with the whole team.  Thank you for your comment regarding the window in our bathroom. The idea of the hotel´s designer was to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. The door of the bathroom will either close only the toilet or the whole bathroom.  Please take into consideration, that we also have a few rooms without a window. Should you be staying with us again, please do not hesitate to share your preferences directly with our reservation team. We would be happy to book a suitable room for you.  Dear Guest, we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the near future. In the meantime we wish you all the best.
