The Movenpick is located literally on the other side of the road from the main Stuttgart airport terminal building - superbly convenient for late flight arrival or early morning take off.  The hotel is very well equipped, with modern stylish décor and fittings, excellent bar and restaurant.  You also do not need to worry about noise from the airport - despite being right next to the main terminal, the hotel is very well sound-proofed.  This is a very convenient hotel when you do not want any travel to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 26, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
