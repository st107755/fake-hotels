The hotel is right opposite the terminal building, only about 100m walk.  My room was spacious, well appointed, with a very comfortable bed.  Good quality bathroom (but a shower, no bath)  The restaurant was good with a reasonable range of choices from smaller to larger meals.  There is a gym but the sauna was superb - two saunas, a steam room, hot and cold foot baths and a line of jets that spray cold and cold water at your legs.  My employer undoubtably got a better deal on my room then the 315€ that appears on the hotel web site, nevertheless a 3€/hour charge to use the internet did seem odd.  Ok in a budget hotel, but not here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Rover54,  Thank you so much for your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and for your detailed comment.
