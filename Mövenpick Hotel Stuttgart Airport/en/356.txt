Location next to main highways is great; we were able to drive to all the places we wanted with no problem. Also, beds are super comfortable so we could rest very well from our long days of sightseen. Parking, even though is 21 EUR per day, was very convenient for us. Would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 31, 2016Dear Guest,   Firstly we would like to thank you very much for your great comment and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
