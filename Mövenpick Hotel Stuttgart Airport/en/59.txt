I rate this as an excellent as it’s to expectations and those are pretty high, and I had a problem which was resolved.  These split single beds get on my wick, it’s a pain but hardly life threatening.  Saying that, there was blood on the sheets and after 2 phone calls a very friendly and polite member of staff came and changed the sheets. She had a certain degree of horror on her face seeing the blood so we changed the bed as a team :)  I do think the room service menu could be expanded somewhat (and changed!) but the food was hot and the ice cream cold :)  I like this hotel, there’s some charm about it that I cannot put my finger on, maybe it’s just the Movenpick charm or the fact I love their ice cream and jam.. I’ll certainly be back next time I am flying from Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 13, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to write your review.
