Sehr praktisch, aber teuer. Die Zimmer sind gut, aber mit einer seltsamen Glaswand zwischen Dusche und das Bett. Das Essen ist wie erwartet in einem Mövenpick Hotel: ausgezeichnet. Der Service ist ohne nicht beschweren. Das Parken nicht einfach und für viel Geld.Mehr lesenAufenthaltsdatum: Januar 2016Übersetzung bewerten HilfreichSenden Antwort von moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung im Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportBeantwortet: 25. Mai 2016Mit Google übersetzenDear guest,   Thank you very much for your feedback and your stay with us at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.   It is a pleasure to read that we have fulfilled your experiences again and that you also highlighted our food and service qualities.  We can see that we did not correspond with your expectations regarding our prices. I can assure that we have a best price guarantee in place which assures, that we always offer the best available room rate at the time of booking. To offer a quality in product and service like we do and our guest expect a certain price level is needed.   I can read that you didn’t like our glass wall between the bath and the bedroom. Our designer, Matteo Thun wanted to create a bathroom with natural daylight and therefore the wall is partly made of glass. We also offer a few rooms without a window which you can request with your next reservation.   Regarding the parking fee I can tell you that our garage is managed by an external company. Therefore we are happy that we can offer our hotel guest a reduction of more than 50%. Our parking is located next to the terminals and the location is ideal to reach both hotel lobby and airport.  We are looking forward to welcoming you back again and wish you all the best in the meantime.  Best regards Laura Liebel – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Mehr lesen
