And the winner of the most charming, conscientious, hard-working, dedicated hotel owner is ...... Matteo.  He made our trip one of the most wonderful ever.  To be greeted by him and his staff at the private taxi dock at sunset is to feel as if you are in a James Bond movie.  The breakfast, all coooked personally and individually to one's requirements by Matteo, are outstanding.  He and his staff make one feel like the most honoured guests ever, and remembered all our names.  The hotel itself is like a dream, and the views are outstanding.  You can see the photos posted by other reviewers, and they're all that and better.    This is one of best stays in Europe I've ever had, and I cannot recommend it too highly.Read moreDate of stay: November 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
