Exceptional hotel with attentive service from the multi-lingual Bruno, Matteo, Oliver (thanks for the prosecos and Aperol) and others.  Ample hot breakfasts with eggs and coffees prepared to order.  Special thanks to Rosalba!  Spacious room with period furnishings.  Minibar included.  We had Room 101 which looked across the terrace to the canal, and yet there was no noise from the canal which we noticed.  While very close to the Rialto Bridge, it is an easy walk to St. Mark's as well as to other neighborhoods.  And, even tho located near a large department store, the hotel itself is very quiet.  We would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
