After many hours on TA trying to find "THAT" hotel Al Ponte Antico was our choice. From the booking to checking out everything went smoothly. Alex arranged our water taxi booking. Arriving by the water taxi straight to the dock is an experience not to be missed.  We were greeted by the owner Matteo and Alex but of whom addressed us by our first names. Matteo is very passionate about this property and was enjoy showing us around. Our room didn't have a canal view (our choice) as there is a wonderful terrace that is available any time of the day. like every other post has written, the breakfast was a delight. Sitting on the terrace enjoying the canal traffic is mesmerising. our room was spacious, quite and very clean. The bathroom was large and modern with a heated towel rail.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
