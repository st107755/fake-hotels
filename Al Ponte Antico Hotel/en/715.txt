I took my son on a trip to Italy for his graduation. The Ponte was one of the hotels we stayed in during our whirlwind trip throughout Europe and was by far the best. Matteo is a master entrepreneur and clearly leads from the front in his property. The humble owner of the hotel takes your luggage to the room? Where else does that happen? Matteo pays close attention to every detail of his establishment and it shows. Alex, one of his staff, is also a gem of a person. His patient, warm style will help sort out any questionâ€¦from restaurants to directions to history. This place not only is a gem with regard to the service and staff, but the location can not be beat. If you're looking for one of the best hotel experiences of your life, the Al Ponte Antico is it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
