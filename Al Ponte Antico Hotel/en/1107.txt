We had a fantastic stay in this butique luxury hotel. Even though we had no reservation with them the owner himself picked us up from the Rialto Bridge and gave us a good rate. The hotel staff was very welcoming. They all called us with our names and I think that shows caring and respect. The service was beyond excellence that sometimes we felt "Is this for real". After staying in this hotel you expect more from other hotels too which sometimes can be a problem:)))    I can not thank enough for the hospitality they have shown to us.  Thank you  Filiz & YusufRead moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
