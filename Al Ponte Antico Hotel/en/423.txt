This 7 room, family run hotel is perfectly located.  We were in the Junior Suite overlooking the Grand Canal. It is well-appointed. The location is just right for easy touring.  The service is excellent. The breakfasts were first-rate. The staff is friendly and capable. The owner, Matteo, is a fine person and runs a great hotel. We could not have been more pleased.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
