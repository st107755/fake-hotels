We have just returned today from Venice and I couldn't wait to post my review. Just as with all the other comments, I cannot compliment Matteo and his staff enough. I have never been greeted as warmly and their tips and recommendations helped to make our anniversary stay very special. Due to exceptional high tides, we had to vacate our suite for one night, but they were so helpful that this all just added to our adventure. Breakfast was also a lovely relaxing experience with freshly cooked omelettes.  I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel and would love to return.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
