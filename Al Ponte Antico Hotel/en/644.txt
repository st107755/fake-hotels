Absolutely fantastic in service, location and comfort. Matteo and his team will treat you like royalty. There is not a better place to stay in Venice. Great food and sight seeing recommendations.  You'll walk in the place and they'll know you by name on your first visit- incredible. Can't wait to get back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
