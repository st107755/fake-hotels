This was our second trip to the Al Ponte Antico since 2009, and we are pleased to report that it was even more wonderful than we remember.  This time we were able to share the experience with my partner's mother for the conclusion of her first trip through Europe.  Matteo (the owner) and the entire staff worked hard to make us feel at home, and since this was our second visit, it was almost like visiting friends who we hadn't seen in far too long.  I'm sure there are many nice hotels in Venice, but we will never even consider staying anywhere else.  If you like authenticity, good food, friendly staff, and a perfect location, you should stay here.  We'll be back as soon as our travel schedule permits.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
