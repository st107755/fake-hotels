We stayed for two nights a this wonderful boutique hotel (only 9 rooms)  The staff and the owner were the great but the best part was our nightly cappucino out on the balcony overlooking the canal and the Realto Bridge. It was breathtaking and very romantic.  After our dinner and night on the town it was just a beautiful place to end a wonderful evening.  Breakfast -which was incredible- was served there also.  The owner, Matteo, has a few other similar hotels which we would love to visit. Everything about our stay was unsurpassable!Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
