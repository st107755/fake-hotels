My wife and I ended our 15 day trip to Italy at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel and truly enjoyed our stay.  As others have noted, the staff is the key to the hotel's success.  Alex, Oliver, and Matteo were like long time friends greeting us every morning, afternoon, and evening by first name.  They helped make reservations and offered tips for getting around.  Rose alba (sp) was a great breakfast host.  The hotel is small with only 9 rooms, but the views and location are remarkable.  Because of the size, the breakfast buffet was not as abundant as you may find at a larger hotel, but it was certainly sufficient.  You definitely want to spend time on the terrace each morning watching the boats on the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
