The location of the hotel is superb and the staff were excellent, however, the room we had was right next to the landing platform which was pretty noisy at times, especially first thing in the morning!! Considering we had paid extra for a canal view, we feel we should have been accomodated on an upper floor. The room itself was excellent, however, the shower could probably benefit from an upgrade. Given the short nature of our stay (4 nights) we did not raise these fairly minor issues with the owners and in fact we thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Venice and would most definately go backRead moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
