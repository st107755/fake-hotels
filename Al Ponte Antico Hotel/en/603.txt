We actually stayed at Locanda Orseolo, their B & B on the Orseolo Canal but were recommended Hotel Ai Reali for a romantic "setting". They have a perfect small terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge. I ordered some chilled Prosecco on ice and they arranged for rose petals to be scattered on the patio and we had it all to ourselves over the noon hour. We danced to some romantic music we brought on the IPAD/Bose soundlink - wow, it was magical.   The owner, Matteo and all his staff were great. We were amazed how they knew our names immediately and addressed us by name to ask if we were pleased (we were).Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
