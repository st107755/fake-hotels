This was an amazing hotel. The staff were lovely and very helpful. At night the views were beautiful from the terrace, and the breakfast was lovely. The bread was very good and so was the cakes. I would stay here again and recomend it to a friend.Read moreDate of stay: October 20092 SavesHelpfulShare
