A fantastic hotel just off the Grand Canal. The highlight was the terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge where we took breakfast each morning of our stay. I particularly recommend the scrambled egg! The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. They were able to recommend nearby restaurants and sightseeing highlights.  Easily accessible by water taxi to the front door. Great central location.  Thanks for your hospitality.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
