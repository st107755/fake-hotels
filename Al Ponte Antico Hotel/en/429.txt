Recently stayed here for two nights.   We had chosen a relatively small room without any view, so there was no surprise there.   It perfectly suited our needs.   Location was excellent -- seems like it was centrally located to just about everything.   Terrace overlooking the Grand Canal was simply lovely.  Pleasant, peaceful, great views -- beautiful place to sit and have a cocktail or coffee or enjoy the great breakfast.  But what truly sets this place apart is the truly incredible staff that is so personal and hospitable.   Within a few hours, everyone -- and I mean everyone -- knew our names, and they were so very helpful with recommendations, directions and great service.  I can't recall ever staying someplace where the management and staff were so over the top nice.  Fromâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
