We stayed at the Al ponte Antico Hotel for three days early in November. All we had heard about Venice  was true ;  expensive but beautiful. Even with the high price tags it was worth the trip ; and the hotel provided excellent advice on what to see and where.. but more importantly WHEN. The best time to see the city is before about 10:00am when the day tripper tourists arrive. before this there are few crowds and it is easy to stroll over the old pavements and admire the architecture (even the hotel was a work of art!) without the jostling. Then go and have a long lunch or a rest at the Hotel which has views to the Rialto Bridge (About 50 mtrs away) and up the Grand Canal - just take in the sights. After about 4:30 the crowds thin out and that's when we started seeing the cityâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
