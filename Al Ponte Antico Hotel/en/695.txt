Arrived by water taxi from the station mid morning and were not expecting any great fuss as the rooms were not available until the afternoon, but had the attention of the owner and staff lavished on our group.  Prosecco on the terrace,  well we felt like film stars. Booking in was effortless, as was all the correspondence leading up to our stay. Shown the lovely rooms when we returned in the afternoon. All in our party happy with these. The way they have turned a very old building not designed to be a hotel into one is charming even though some rooms were at the back with no window views, we accepted this as a trade off for being where we were, which is probably one of the best locations in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
