At the risk of sounding repetitive, I want to totally agree with 'cmangum' 14 October 2010 below. I selected this hotel from all the good comments on this site but wasn't sure what to expect. We stayed in one of the large 5 star hotels in Venice on a previous visit as part of an organised tour.

This is only a tiny hotel but its character, location and especially all the wonderful staff make it just so special. Mateo, Rosalba and Oliver especially, make this an experience not to forget. Being right on the Grand Canal with their own dock means easy access by water taxi to/from the shipping terminal or airport.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
