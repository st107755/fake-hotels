From the moment we stepped ashore nothing was too much trouble for Matteo and his team. Our Junior suite was spectacular and very large. On the side of the Grand Canal and so close to the Rialto Bridge which greeted us each evening with spectacular floodlighting. It was so easy to walk everywhere and the water taxi to Murano from this hotel so convenient. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the canal was very romantic and the food choice and quality exemplary. I miss Matteo's coffee from his spectacular machine.We have shared our enthusiasm with friends and at least 1 couple have already booked later in this year.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
