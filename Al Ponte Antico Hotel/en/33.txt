The hotel is amazing!  We were met at the dock where a water taxi had been arranged for us from the train station.  They welcomed us and showed us around the beautiful hotel.  The rooms are lovely and spacious.  The owner and his wife personally serve breakfast with many home baked treats and wonderful cooked to order eggs.  The terrace has a beautiful view of the canal and Rialto Bridge.  Every staff member personally introduced themselves and were so helpful! Would definitely stay here again if we are in Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
