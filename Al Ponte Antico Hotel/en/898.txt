We stayed at this beautiful Hotel in December, 2012 for 5 nights in a Junior Suite that was right on the Canal.  My husband, teenage son and I had plenty of room in this enormous room.  Beds are firm, but we like it that way so we were very comfortable.  Our son slept on the sofa bed so he could lie in bed and look out at the Canal and watch the world go by.  It was a fantastic experience, it's in a great location as out the back door of the Hotel is the busy back streets of Venice.  There are many shops and restaurants very close by, you are spoiled for choice.  The shopping in Venice was fabulous also.  We could not fault the staff, they always greeted you by name and were genuinely interested in what you had done that day and were also very keen to offer advice if you askedâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
