From the moment we were greeted upon our arrival via water taxi we knew we were at a very special place. The service, rooms and food are the very best.   Our stay here was one of the highlights of our entire trip.   We would highly recommend a stay in this wonderful hotel.  Simply said... It was outstanding!Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
