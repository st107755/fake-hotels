This is the best hotel experience that we had in all of our time in Italy. Matteo greeted us and spent a good amount of time telling is about the hotel and Venice. He was great. We had a great breakfast each morning and the staff was always top notch. The terrace has fantastic views. This is the place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
