This boutique hotel is a tiny gem. It is an historic building, carefully updated by owners, owners with a strong sense of Venice and who are great hoteliers. The staff know your name and learn your preferences. The property is next to the Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal, with a gem of a terrace on the second floor to watch the world float by, night or day. Our room was carefully designed as a Venetian dream yet with a modern bathroom.  Need a restaurant idea? They had great ones and set us up with crucial reservations. Breakfast was laid out with exquisite care, including made to order omelets or crepes.  Location does not get better than this. Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
