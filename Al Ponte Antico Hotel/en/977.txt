This is a fantastic hotel. We arrived by water taxi from the airport straight to the door and were assisted from the boat by staff and welcomed by Matteo. Our stay was a week long and during that time we felt like royalty. We had a room at the back with an outlook to a small alleyway ( a very Venetian view). It was lovely. The room was quite big and beautifully decorated. It was gorgeous. the terrace overlooks the Grand Canal and is open for use any time. If we were tired we just sat on the terrace and watched Venice pass us by. Our own little oasis of calm. Ponte Antico is a little gem. thank you Matteo, Bruno, Christiana, Oliver, Rosealba and all others for making Venice such a special place for us. Love to you all.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
