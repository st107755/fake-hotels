We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico from the 9th to 12th of May! What can we say from the moment we arrived we were treated like family. Matteo greeted us personally showed us his beloved hotel and paved the way for the most amazing 3 nights! Thankyou Matteo, Alex, Rosealba, Oliver and Thomas for making our dream holiday a reality. You have a right to be proud of your amazing hotel! It still feels like it was a dream sitting on your portico drinking Spritzers gazing at the Rialto Bridge watching the gondolas floating past on the Grand Canal Amazing beyond anything we imagined, absolutely loved this place and the staff. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
