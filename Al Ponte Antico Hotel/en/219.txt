This is a boutique hotel with only nine rooms and offers a level of service that few hotels can match. From placing the booking to waving goodbye the owner and staff have been attentive and friendly in equal measure without being intrusive. The hotel is located in an ideal spot and unusually in Venice has a veranda where you can sip a cocktail or enjoy breakfast with a view of the Rialto Bridge. Breakfast was delicious with a wide range of options. Loved the crepes! Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
