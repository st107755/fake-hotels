We stayed 2 nights in a room that literally faced out to the Grand Canal.  Everything about the stay was delightful - from meeting the staff as well as the owner (who cooks superb omelets for you for breakfast) to the room itself (very spacious, inviting, comfortable).  The location is excellent as you are about 10 minutes of walking away from San Marco square.  We went in November and the crowds were not that bad.  We relied on the hotel's recommendations for dinner and were very happy with the choices (1 was full of Italians, a good sign that you aren't dining in a tourist trap).  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who feels that the quality of their hotel room is integral to a successful vacation.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
