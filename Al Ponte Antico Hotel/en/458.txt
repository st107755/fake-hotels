I have been to Venice tons of times and know it quite well, so decided to take my girlfriend there. what a time we had!!! location is fantastic, literally 1 minute from Rialto Bridge. you have this amazing terrace where you can have breakfast overlooking the bridge. you can arrive by boat taxi, as we did, and feel like you are in a movie! secondly the service is amazing. everyone is really kind and the owner like to always have a chat and is a very charming individual the room is nice, TV w/SKY movies etc etc with a comfy bed.  recommended and I would definitely go back thereRead moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
