Myself and my partner (were in our mid 20â€™s) stayed here for two nights in February 2009. The hotel was easy to find and we were greeted warmly by staff. The hotel has lots of character which added to the charm of our Venice trip. The hotel was clean, the room was good and the breakfast in the morning is amazing! Try the traditional tiramisu! We did not book a canal view but we had our breakfast on the terrace each morning.   We cannot fault our stay here. We had an amazing time in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2009HelpfulShare
