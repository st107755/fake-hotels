From the moment we were greeted at the water entrance by our first names to the time we were waved off it 4 days later we felt we had reached heaven. Our bedroom, room 101 sumptuously decorated, looked out over the terrace to the Grande Canale. We spent many pleasurable hours on that terrace just watching the world float by as the view is incredible. All the staff were attentive to our every need and nothing was too much trouble, booking concerts, recommending restaurants and places to go. We have never known such quality of service. Breakfasts were wonderful. We were celebrating our 40th anniversary and Matteo and team made sure it was a memorable one.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
