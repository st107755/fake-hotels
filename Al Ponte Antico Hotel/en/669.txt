My daughter and I were fortunate to stay at Al Ponte Antico Hotel for 2 days in late October.  Most reviewers have captured the essence of this quaint hotel:  Service.  We were greeted by name, by EVERY staff member.  I often wondered, if our passport pictures were posted in the Staff rooms so that every guest is felt welcomed each time we are encountered.  This was truly amazing as I have never experienced this before.  Beyond the wonderful service is the fantastic location; delicious breakfast served in a beautifully restored room; and clean rooms and common areas.
