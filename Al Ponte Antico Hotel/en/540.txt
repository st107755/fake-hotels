We took the vaporetto from St Lucia to Rialto. Since our luggage weren't so heavy, it was alright but note that you have to walk over a bridge to get to the hotel if you take the vaporetto.  When we got there, they greeted us by calling our name. After a week of traveling in a foreign country, it was so warm and welcoming. They tried to make our stay comfortable as much as possible, the whole time.   Since we were on our honeymoon, they had a prosecco ready in our room! We were very touched. The breakfast was great and the owner himself makes you an omelette!  When leaving, we took water taxi which could dock at the hotel so it was very convenient.  We just fell in love with the whole hotel!!! Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
