I cannot say enough good things about my husband and my recent stay at Al Ponte Antico. We stayed for two nights and were so impressed with everything. The location of the hotel can't get better, it is on the grand canal with a fantastic view of the rialto bridge. The staff and owner, Matteo, are so friendly and helpful. We loved our included breakfasts, complete with omelettes and cappucinos, on the terrace each morning. Every staff person knew us by first name and warmly greeted us each time we returned to the hotel after exploring venice. Venice is a beautiful, magical city and i would recommend staying here during your visit. Thank you Matteo, Oliver, Alex, Thomas and Rosalba for your generosity and helping me love my first trip to venice. We will be back!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
