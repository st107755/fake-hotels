Unbelievable service and location!  They were marvelous in all areas of their establishment!  We were greeted by the owner and given a short tour with details of the restoration of the property.  It was absolutely beautiful!  Our very large suite had a king and a also a queen sleeper in a separated sitting area.  Our three windows opened directly onto the canal at the Rialto Bridge - gondolas came gliding by regularly as did the vaporettis.  The windows were new and bocked all sounds when closed!  The location was premier fr walking everywhere, which is the way to see Venice.  Breakfast was wonderful - omelets, meats, etc. - and was included!  We can't wait to stay again!Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
