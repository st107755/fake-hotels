This is a wonderful intimate hotel in a perfect location.  The staff is extremely helpful and accommodating.  We had a junior suite with a large window opening onto the Grand Canal.  We enjoyed watching the canal from our room.  The terrace is the perfect place for breakfast and to sip wine and watch the afternoon "traffic" go by.  This was the great start to our 19 day trip through Italy.  My only criticism would be the incredibly small shower in the bathroom.  No bigger than a phone booth!  I understand the restrictions and difficulty updating a building built in the 1500s.  The location more than makes up for the shower, but it would have been nice to have a larger bathroom considering the very large size of the room.  Matteo and his staff do a great job.  We'll be back!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
