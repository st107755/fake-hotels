Our family arrived via water taxi from the airport and was welcomed by the most personable and hospitable staff!  The location was perfect to explore the streets of Venice and easy walking distance to all of the main points of interest.  The rooms were beautiful and each one was unique.  Breakfast was prepared in the most elegant style in their gathering area and sipping wine on the balcony as we viewed the Rialto Bridge overlooking the Grande Canal was completely enjoyable!  If you are looking for a private and quaint stay where every staff member speaks to you by name.... look no further!Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
