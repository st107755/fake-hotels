We loved our stay at this charming former palazzo!  The location is incredible ... every morning we had breakfast and every afternoon we had drinks on the beautiful little terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the Rialto bridge .. cannot be beat!   The hotel's beautiful heavy fabrics ooze authentic Venetian charm.   The gentlemen who work there were wonderfully helpful with restaurant reservations and other advice.  We can't imagine staying anywhere else when in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
