We had a wonderful stay at this hotel in Venice. The owner and staff go out of their way to make you feel at home and provide assistance to ensure you have a great trip. The room was very nice, with a modern bathroom. The breakfasts were delicious and we really appreciated the view from the terrace. This is a perfect location for sightseeing in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
