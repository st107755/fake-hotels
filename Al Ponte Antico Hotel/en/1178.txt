A magical night that we will never forget.  We can only support & agree with every positive comment made about this hotel.  It's magical - everything from the rooms, the staff the balcony and the location.  Like others this was slightly out of our price range but we thought why not treat ourselves . . . and we were certainly treated! If you are contemplating staying at Al Ponte Antico, just do it! Thanks so much to the beautiful Matteo and Oliver for making Al Ponte Antico the highlight of our Eurpeon trip.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
