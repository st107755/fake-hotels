We spent a few days in this very convenient Hotel on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge. We found it to be very welcoming, comfortable and had an excellent breakfast on the balcony overlooking the Canal and Bridge.  We requested a low level room and were not disappointed in the lovely ground floor suite we had with a private terrace on the Canal . We found the staff to be very friendly and all spoke very good English. They were happy to advise us of locations and restaurants in the surrounding area. Worth a return visit.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
