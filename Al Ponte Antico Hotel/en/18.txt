We visited this hotel for my partners birthday.  From the moment we arrived to the afternoon that we left the hotel staff couldn’t do enough.  This has been the most friendliest hotel I have ever visited.  The terrace overlooking the grand canal is beautiful we could have stayed there all day.  We wouldn’t stay at any other hotel in Venice as it has such a great location and a warm friendly atmosphere.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare
