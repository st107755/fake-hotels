Spent a surprise long weekend here and it was all I could have hoped for and more. Our room was fantastic and the breakfast was superb. The staff couldn't do enough to help (but were never in our way) and we had everything you would want for a romantic break. The best thing about this hotel was the private balconies though, looking right onto the crowds on the Rialto Bridge from the peace of the balcony with a drink in hand...and even better, they don't let anyone not staying at the hotel in! The only other places with half as good a view were crowded and busy. We whiled away a few hours at night watching the world go by. Will def go back to get away from it all again, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed inRead moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
