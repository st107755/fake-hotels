We stayed at Al Ponte Antico in September 2014.  I almost don't want to write a review so that the place remains a bit of a hidden gem but Matteo and the rest of the team deserve public accolades.  From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed and respected.  From Alex's greeting, his knack for making a fantastic Spritz, and giving us a great lead on a wine shop and dinner; to Matteo's clear leadership and enthusiasm for his business, together with his warm welcome and engagement with us during our time there, and to Oliver, Tomas and Rosalba -- every one of them remembering our names upon a single introduction.  At every turn, regardless of position or job, Al Ponte Antico team's considerate and splendid client service was coupled with a sincere passion and care for its guests. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
