My girlfriend and I have been lucky enough to stay in many hotels around the world at our comparatively young age and this is the finest hotel by far. No five star hotel can supply the experience that Al Ponte Antico and its staff do. Rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with antique furniture, try the junior suite overlooking the grand canal for soemthing extra special. Breakfast was the finest I've had with Matteo on hand to cook omelettes or pancakes filled with anything and everything.The service was brilliant. Matteo was full of suggestions and we felt leaving that we genuinely made friends with our hosts. We will be back next year when hopefully the rock concert won't be called off! Thanks to Matteo and all the staff, Paul & Eibhlin. Read moreDate of stay: June 2007HelpfulShare
