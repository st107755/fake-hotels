After walking past the hotel entrance a couple of times, we finally found it and the hotel is amazing. We were shown around before we set out and given a map (which is helpful!) The staff are really friendly and are happy to help with any queries. The hotel is set in a superb location and the views from the balcony are amazing! I would definitely stay here again if I was to return to Venice. Had an amazing couple of nights. If you aren't sure about where to stay you've GOT to stay here you won't regret it.
