Probably the best location in Venice. Just a mere 100 meters from the Realto bridge. We atayed at the Junior Suit, facing the Grand Canal with an absolutely perfect view of the bridge. But even more amazing, being on the ground floor, or should I say,  the water floor we felt part of the life on the canal. Zero distance to the trafic of Gondolas, Vaporeto, Water Taxi, cargo boats, yet everything was so quiet. We really felt as taking part in a scene. Every worthwile attraction is within short walking distance, no more than 20 minutes, and most attractions are even 5-10 minutes walk.  The suit is very spacious, the building is a 14th century one, restored in an impressive manner. The staff really addresses al its guests by their first name, and it does indeed feel good.
