We spend two nights here over a weekend. It as an amazing stay with a great location on the grand canal, extraordinary personalized service and a beautiful terrace which overlooked the canal and the Rialto bridge. Breakfasts were great sitting on the terrace. We lugged our suitcases to the hotel after catching the ferry but we would have been better to catch a water taxi right to the door for 50 Euros. This is what we did on the way back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
