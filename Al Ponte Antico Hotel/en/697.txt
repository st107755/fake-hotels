My husband and I stayed here for two nights to celebrate our anniversary - we were greeted at the pier by Matteo the owner, and from that moment on everything was perfect!

The staff were extremely attentive and remembered our names, i would definitely recommend for a special occasion.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
