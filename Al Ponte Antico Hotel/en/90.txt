We loved our stay here. Itâ€™s right on the Grand Canal, and you can take a water taxi to and from the hotel. The owner is so friendly, and he personally cooks made-to-order breakfast dishes once a week. The reception desk was helpful in recommending a good vegetarian-friendly restaurant. The location is quiet, our room was magical, and we look forward to returning. We had the most wonderful experience here and highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
