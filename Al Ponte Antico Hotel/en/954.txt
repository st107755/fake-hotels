This is a fantastic hotel with excellent service and genuine effort to please.  While it does not have 5 star amenities (who needs swimming pool, golf course, and tennis courts when in Venice), I have never stayed in a hotel with greater service.  Near the Rialto Bridge with its own dock on the Grand Canal, it is an easy walk or water taxi ride to anywhere in Venice you care to go.  The balcony overlooking the Canal is a wonderful place to have breakfast or to relax in late afternoon with a glass of wine.  We could not have been more pleased with the hotel and the great staff that Mateo has in place.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
