Wonderful location is just one thing that makes this hotel so special. Friendly, helpful service and the feeling that they are genuinely pleased to see you add to its attraction.  The rooms are very comfortable, although the showers can be a bit snug. Rooms overlooking the canal are of course very special - but all guests can enjoy canal views from the terrace at breakfast or from the charming bar/breakfast room. Knowledgeable advice about sightseeing and eating is always on hand, and we certainly would always make it our first choice when returning to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
