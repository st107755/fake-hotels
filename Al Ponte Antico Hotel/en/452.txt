Fantastic location - fantastic staff - nothing more nothing less. Great recommendations on what to do and where to eat - places we would not have been able to find on ourselves.  Great breakfast on the terrace watching the canal - especially recommend the pancakes with chocolate:)   A must place to stay.  Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
