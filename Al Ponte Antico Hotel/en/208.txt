From the 1st moment of contact with this hotel everything was top notch.  They stayed in contact with us and aided us in all our travel needs before and after arrival.  Upon stepping off our personal water taxi we were greeted by the owner, Mathieu who promised us our time in Venice would be "magical" and he proved it with every facet of our stay.  Even through pouring rain and flooded streets, the staff here lead us to the most wonderful restaurants, shops and sites.  The room was spectacular, we stayed in the suite that had its own private terrace, a gorgepus living room with amazing views of the canal.  Breakfast was served every morning and to our pleasant surprise our host Mathieu was at the helm preparing made to order omlettes and crepes, all with fresh local ingredients.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
