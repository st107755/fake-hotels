This is a wonderful boutique hotel with 9 lovely rooms.  We fronted onto the Grand Canal and had wonderful views, including one morning when boat after boat of rowing Santas went by.  Mateo and his staff each treated us like princes.  Breakfast every day was fantastic and we never bothered with lunch.  Thanks, Mateo!Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
