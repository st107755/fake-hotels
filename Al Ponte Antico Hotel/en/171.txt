My wife and I stayed in a junior suite overlooking The Grand Canal in early May 2018. All of the positive revues at this site were right on. Our windowed opened giving us a view up and down the canal. It was heaven to me watching all of the action. Breakfast on the veranda looking at The Rialto Bridge was to die for. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. This is a hotel with no fancy reception area, it is small, and very difficult to find from the street, however, it ranks with one of the best experiences we have had at any hotel including the best of five star hotels.It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
