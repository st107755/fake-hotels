We stayed only one night in Venice and that's all you need for Venice. This hotel is in a great location on the Grand Hotel but not the easiest to find --must pay attention to signs! Only 9 rooms in the hotel so the staff greet you by first name every time you walk in which is wonderful! Super friendly and extremely helpful! If you are ok with spending a little extra money on a hotel then this is the place to stay at!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
