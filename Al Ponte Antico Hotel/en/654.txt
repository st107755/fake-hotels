Al Ponte Antico- beautifully restored 14th century palace perfectly positioned to enjoy the view of the grand canal and Rialto bridge from its terrace. Note however when booking the superior room overlooking the canal, you need to either be a late night reveller or sleep soundly as guests may partake of the glorious view in the early hours and disturb your sleep. Matteo the owner upon hearing of my interrupted night offered to upgrade me free of charge to a quieter room. Their hospitality was wonderful so if you're after a boutique and intimate experience right in the heart of Venice, the rooms are comfortable, the breakfast delicious, it's hard to go wrong here.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
