This must be the friendliest hotel in the world...Matteo and his team of Alex, Thomas, Oliver and Rosealba are the perfect hosts, watching over the guests and taking great care over every detail.  The location is wonderful, right next to the Rialto bridge, perfect for the Vaporetto and walking into the best shopping and tourist spaces.  Everything about our trip was perfect, including the advice given on restaurants, shopping and where to visit.  Breakfast was delicious and served in the most delightful space with a view over the canal.  My wife and I think this is probably the most friendly hotel we have ever stayed in anywhere worldwide.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
