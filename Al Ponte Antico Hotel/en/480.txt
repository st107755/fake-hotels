This is one of the best hotel experiences I have had. The location is perfect, the view from the balcony spectacular but most notable is the service. We were welcomed on the water on arrival and addressed by name each day. This was a very special touch that makes this hotel unique. I am already planning my next trip to Venice and would not consider staying anywhere else. The price per night is also very reasonable for the service and standard. Thanks to al the staff for making the final days of our trip so special!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
