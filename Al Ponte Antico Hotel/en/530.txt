Authentic 14th century Venetian boutique hotel. Owner Matteo has so much passion for his hotel, it's literally his centre stage. Service is beyond exceptional, every member of staff knows each and every guest by first name. Matteo serves a breakfast that rivals no other, he is also the chef making the hit breakfast himself, dressed each day in a different colorful chefs outfit. Beautifully furnished in true Venetian style. Good water pressure for an old building and the location cannot be better. If you don't stay here you will have missed out on a very special experience in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
