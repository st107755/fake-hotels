Greeted by name on our arrival by charming owner Matteo, our stay could not have been more perfect. We learnt how he had restored the old palace to its current glory and the made the best use of the space to create 9 bedrooms, beautifully decorated and with everything you could need. Our room, 102 looked like it had the best view but it didn't matter much as the balcony was a great place to sit and take in the view over breakfast, personally prepared by Matteo himself, or during the day. All the other staff knew our names and always offered to help us with whatever we needed. The definition of personal service. We will definitely be coming back. Grazie Matteo.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
