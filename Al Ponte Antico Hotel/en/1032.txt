We couldn't have been more delighted with this hotel.  Matteo and Oliver offered excellent restaurant suggestions and arranged a water taxi at 5 AM to the airport!  Everything was seamless.  The only thing I would have liked was a bit more light in our inside room.  The cleanliness of this boutique hotel and friendliness of staff were exceptional.  We would definitely return but book a room on the lagoon.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
