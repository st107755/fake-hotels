Every morning, to view the Grand Canal as it comes to life, is a treat beyond measure-EXCEPT-for the dedicated, professional staff at this small, intimate hotel.  Good as it gets-quiet, personal, beautiful breakfasts-you forget that you are a guest and leave truly believing that you are family and will be missed.  There is nothing too grand to ask-jet lagged and sitting on the lovely terrace overlooking the canal at 3am was a blessing-felt safe and well cared for.  The problem is-you will not want to leave this haven.  Thank you all-including having laundry done, crepes for breakfast-immediate transport arranged-restaurant recommendations that were spot on-quiet rooms-wonderful shower and bathroom-left not wanting to leave!
