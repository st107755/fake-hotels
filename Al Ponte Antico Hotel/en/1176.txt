My wife and I were scheduled to stay two nights at this wonderful hotel.  The staff is excellent and the location and ambiance with the balcony are beyond description. With the vocano, we found it necessary to stay three extra nights and the hotel management was nice enough to reduce our rate for the extra days. You will not find a better breakfast than that prepared by Matteo on each morning. Oliver prepares "Spritzis" on the balcony in the afternoon. All of the staff is extremely well trained and calls you by name each time they see you. Their enthusiasm for Venice certainly makes this the place to stay!Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
