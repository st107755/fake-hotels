I adored my stay in Venice and it was largely due to this hotel!  My husband and I were greeted by name upon arrival. The hotel has its own dock so we were able to go straight from the airport to the hotel.  The location of this beautiful, old palace simply can't be beat with the view of and proximity to the Rialto Bridge.  We had a delicious, fresh breakfast on the terrace every morning. The staff was attentive and professional.  We were so impressed with the service at the Al Ponte Antico that we will seek Matteo's other hotels outside Venice during next trip to Italy!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
