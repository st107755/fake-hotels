My husband booked this hotel for my birthday present, and he does like to do plenty of research, we read the trip advisor comments and to be honest they  sounded a bit too good to be true but  we have just arrived back,  and the comments are exactly right !!  The location itself is worth the price !! You have to get up early for breakfast just to make the most of sitting on the terrace there is so much to look at.  Matteo and his staff treat you more like friends than guests and nothing is too much trouble, we can't wait to go back !!Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
