I spent two nights at Al Ponte Antico while in Venice in late November and found the service to be exceptional.  The hotel has an intimate feel where staff greet all guests by name.  The staff go out of their way to assist guests however possible, including restaurant tips, transportation advice, and anything else one might wish to ask about.  Romina, Alex, David, and Thomas always had a smile and warm welcome when I returned to the hotel.  Matteo, the owner, could not be more welcoming.  There is a balcony that overlooks the Rialto bridge for guests to use.  There is no other place I would consider staying in Venice in the future.  Al Ponte Antico provides an experience in customer service of the highest order.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
