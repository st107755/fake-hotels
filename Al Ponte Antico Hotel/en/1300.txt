not sure there is too much more to say than all the other reviews. what a stunning hotel. but the staff are the ones who make this place stand out. the upgrade to canal view room was a nice bonus. the breakfast is so good u dont want to leave the hotel! hot chocolates, crepes, omlettes with your choice of ingredients and the tiramisu are the highlights. loved the terrace, even though it was cold the views are so good we sat out there every night for a few hours to watch sunset with some drinks. in summer i would prob sit out there all day. if u are going to venice make sure u stay here and u certainly wont be disappointed. as per the heading this is the best hotel experience i have had, thanks to gigi and the others. we will be back!Read moreDate of stay: January 2009HelpfulShare
