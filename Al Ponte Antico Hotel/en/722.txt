What can we say... Matteo, Alex, Oliver, Tomas - thank you! Amazing hotel in the best location. On checking in, were taken to the private terrace overlooking the Grand Canal for some gorgeous local wine. We felt like royalty as people in gondalas stared up at us, wishing they were there!  Our room was stunning and huge, brilliant air con (which was very much appreciated). Breakfast was amazing, with Matteo the owner whipping up fresh eggs and pancakes each morning, along with a plentiful, local buffet. Recommendations for restaurants were given with detailed directions and we enjoyed them thoroughly! Coming back each night, Tomas was funny and happily poured us late night drinks on the terrace while cracking jokes.  We cannot wait to come and stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
