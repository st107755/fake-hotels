We spent four nights here in 2010 and found the staff truly amazing. Breakfast and the parlor are exceptional. Balcony overlooking the grand canal is lovely. The primary imperfection was the beds, much too hard for a comfortable sleep. This place could be perfect if that were fixed. Also, the rooms are a bit dark and cramped. Ours did not have a view. The bathrooms are quite nice. The location is perfect.Read moreDate of stay: October 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
