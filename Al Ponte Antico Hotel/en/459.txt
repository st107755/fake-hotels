The service and attention at this nine room palazzo on the Grand Canal is unparalleled. They really do greet you by name every time they see you - even staff you have not met before. The breakfast/bar area and balcony overlooking the Grand Canal and the Rialto bridge is for guests only. (The Rialto bridge is currently being restored so expect an obstructed view.) The view is exquisite. Some rooms have a canal view, others are off the breakfast area, and others are facing inward towards other buildings. Bedding is sheets, blankets and bedspreads. The AC was wonderfully cool during our hot visit.  Arrive by water taxi to their private dock. Sincere thanks to Matteo, Alex, Max, Thomas and all the great staff and to Bruno (not onsite) for the booking help.  Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
