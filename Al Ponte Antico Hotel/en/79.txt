My third visit to this lovely hotel and I am already thinking about when I can come back. Beautifully situated with a terrace looking out at the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge I donâ€™t think there is a better hotel in Venice. Every member of staff know your name and seem genuinely pleased to serve you. Excellent breakfasts, beautifully decorated rooms and helpful, friendly staff.p, a real gem.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
