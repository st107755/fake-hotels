We are in our sixties and stayed at this hotel for three nights 20-23rd April 2012. The location is exceptional with an extremely rare balcony (open to all residents) looking onto the Rialto bridge. Excellent place to sit and stare. There are only eight rooms with the owner and staff offering unprecedented attention. Breakfast was excellent with numerous restaurants for evening meals seconds away. It  is convenient for everywhere you might wish to visit. Transfer to and from by water taxi is a must.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
