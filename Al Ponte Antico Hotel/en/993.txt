We have stayed at the Al Ponte Antico on our recent trip to Venice in March. It is a wonderful place that provides one with a true Venetian travel experience. The hotel is located by the Rialto bridge, right on the Grand Canal. We stayed in one of the larger rooms with a view of the canal. I have one word – magical! The Al Ponte Antico is renovated old palazzo and we had exposed Corinthian column in the room. The morning coffee on the terrace overlooking the Rialto was unforgettable. But what makes this hotel even more special is it’s owners and staff. They are always there for you and they really know how to make one feel at home. I am already looking forward to my next trip to the La Serenissima.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
