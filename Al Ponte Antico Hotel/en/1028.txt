My husband and I stayed in this hotel to round out the last few days of our vacation. The service was impeccable, and the location was great. The rooms were decorated in true Venetian style and thankfully had "air conditioning". The bed was a little hard, but we slept well after walking and sightseeing all day. This boutique hotel only has 9 rooms and we got one of the rooms with a view of the canal. We could see the Rialto Bridge from our window. It was also great to step out of our room and have breakfast available. This hotel has a neat sitting area along the canal and you can just enjoy watching the boat traffic. I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
