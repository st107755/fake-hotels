Our 2 night stay at Al Ponte Antico was wonderful!  We arrived from US tired.  Our room was available early - Room 101 right off the terrace.  The terrace offered stunning views of the Grand Canal and was such a lovely spot to relax any time of the day.  The staff is extraordinary - going above and beyond on all levels.  The breakfast was plentiful and the coffee delicious.  The only negative about the hotel in my opinion was the shower...as is the case with most European showers...the bathroom was quite large, but the shower petite (and I am only 5'6" 120 lbs) and virtually impossible to bathe without soaking the whole floor with water.  I would highly recommend staying here - and if we return to Venice someday we most certainly would try to stay at Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
