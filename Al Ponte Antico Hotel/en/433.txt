What a beautiful hotel.  From the minute you arrive you can't help but relax thanks to the very attentive, friendly staff and the beautiful terrace looking over the grand canal, The breakfast, cooked by Matteo the owner was great. We stayed in a standard room which didn't have views of the canal but as we literally only slept in the room it didn't matter.  The little terrace made up for any missing view in the room. Would go back again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
