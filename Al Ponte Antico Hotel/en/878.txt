Stayed here for our first visit in Venice and we couldn't be wrong choosing this place!  The staff restaurants recommendation were fabulous, the room was very clean and the decor was just we expect to find, very Venetian ! If we will ever be back to Venice we will try to stay here again, booking a lots in advance!Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare
