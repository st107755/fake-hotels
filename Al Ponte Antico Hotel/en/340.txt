Hotel is right on the Grand Canal by the Rialto bridge. We caught a water taxi from airport directly to hotel where the staff was waiting for us. Owner Matteo and staff are super friendly and their service is terrific. Every day but one, we ate breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Rialto bridge. Matteo cooks omelettes to order, and the rest of the buffet is terrific also.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
