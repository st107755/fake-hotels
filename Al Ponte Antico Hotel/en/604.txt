We arrived by taxi launch from the airport straight to their little jetty right by the Rialto Bridge. It is the ONLY way to arrive! Met by really friendly and helpful staff, and the owner, who takes extraordinary care to ensure you get the most out of your stay, and avoid the pitfalls and tourist traps. Lovely terrace for breakfast and drinks overlooking the Grand Canal, and very close to the heart of everything. Seemed to us the perfect balance of location and comfort, without the extortionate prices charged by the more famous hotels.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
