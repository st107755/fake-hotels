The art of classic hotel service and hospitality is alive and well at Al Ponte Antico.  From the moment of arrival, we were treated as valued guests, greeted by all staff warmly by first name, and given the highest levels of attention.  The property is incredibly intimate yet regal, with classic Venitian touches throughout.  The small terrace was an epic respite from the bustle of Venice, but still allowed for taking in the sights and sounds.  I would proudly and enthusiastically recommend this gem of a boutique hotel to anyone seeking the highest levels of service, comfort, and peace. Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
