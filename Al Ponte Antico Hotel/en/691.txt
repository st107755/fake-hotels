All the other great reviews are accurate.  My wife and I stayed at Al Ponte Antico in early September and took the mini suite room with the picture window that looks directly out on the Grand Canal.  Unique experience.  Matteo, Alex and the whole staff were excellent.  Now our go to hotel for future Venice visits.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
