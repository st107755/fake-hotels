After the wonderful  Foscari Palace last trip profound disappointment at arriving here for my 50th. Very expensive to have hard bed on grand canal next to noisy Rialto water taxi platform Ground floor onto canal means cold and noisy stone floors and sound of furniture being dragged over our heads upstairs. Not like the brochure. Argument over request for tea in evening as no tea/coffee facility in room. Can hear our kids through wall to their room. Ruined planned 50th birthday.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
