I agree with all that has been said here. The experience of this hotel compares to none. It starts when they greet you by name when you step in the door of the hotel. Sitting on the balcony in the morning, overlooking the canal, with breakfast, watching all the deliveries by boat as the city awakes or at the end of the day with a Spritz, watching the activity of the canal, this was the place! The only complaint, we were in Room 4 and the ceiling into the bathroom was very low, my husband who is 6'3'', hit his head walking in the doorway to the bathroom and was unable to stand erect in the shower due to the low ceiling. Small annoyance compared to everything else wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
