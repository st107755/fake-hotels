Spent five nights in this lovely boutique hotel.  Superb facilities, comfortable beds, lovely linens, delicious breakfast, but most notably, extraordinary care and attention from every staff member. We were greeted by name from the moment we walked in and guided throughout our visit with thoughtful sightseeing and restaurant recommendations. Minutes from the Ponte Vecchio but tucked away in a quiet side alley. The owner Mateo has groomed an extraordinary staff that leaves you feeling welcomed, valued, and comfortable. And the hotel is a great value on top of all that. Venice is a singular experience, and Al Ponte Antico is a singular hotel. We will return. Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
