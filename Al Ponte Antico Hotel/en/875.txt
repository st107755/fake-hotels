Perfect location. Wonderful view of grand canal and Rialto Bridge from the terrace. Friendly staff who really care.  Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is amazing. Champagne on the terrace in the afternoon even better! Street entrance is enchanting and very close to the Coin department store. 10min walk to St Marks Square.  We will be staying again next time in Venice. Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
