Our three-night stay in July of last summer was immensely pleasurable.  Al Ponte's service is exceptional, personalized yet unobtrusive.  With breathtaking views of the Grand Canal, the location was convenient to  to the major tourist sites, shopping and restaurants--it was quite easy for us to return to the hotel multiple times daily.  Our favorite part of the stay was having drinks and breakfast on the balcony that rested over the Grand Canal (see picture below) not to mention conversations with the charming and engaging owner.  The breakfast menu far surpassed what one would expect from a B&B.  We hope to return to Venice again, and will definitely stay at Al Ponte.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
