We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico the second week of January with our college age daughter.  Originally, we had booked at their sister hotel Locando Orseolo, but were given the choice to "upgrade" to the Al Ponte Antico, which we gladly accepted.  We were given a junior suite overlooking the Grand Canal.  Our room was beautifully decorated, and our daughter enjoyed the view from the windows in our room.  Matteo and his entire staff were very gracious and made us feel very welcomed.  As others have posted, breakfast was delightful, from the fresh eggs to the crepes.  I would not hesitate recommending this charming hotel to anyone.  Thank you to everyone at the Al Ponte Antico for a truly delightful stay!Read moreDate of stay: January 2009HelpfulShare
