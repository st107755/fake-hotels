There were so many positives, starting with the attentive staff, particularly Matteo who is rightly proud of his hotel & Alex who was always swift to help.  The terrace is fabulous - it is on a slight being in the canal so that you have an excellent view of the Rialto in one direction and northwards up the Grande Canal in the other.  We could happily have sat there watching the gondoliers and other boat users whilst sipping Bellinis for longer than we did.  The bedrooms are of a good size and furnished in a grand, antique style whereas the bathroom are modern - ours (103) was a good size with a double basin which was useful.  The housekeeping was immaculate.   Breakfast represented an excellent choice with Matteo on hand to provide whatever choice of eggs/omelette etc preferred.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
