I stayed in a junior suite for 2 nights for my honeymoon and I couldn't fault the service my wife and I received. The location is very central with short walks to all the points of interest and good views of the Rialto bridge and grand canal. The staff are amazing and take the time to remember your names and very helpful for ideas of places to eat and how to avoid tourist traps. Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
