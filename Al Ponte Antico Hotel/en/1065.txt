This was the first time we stayed in this hotel during our visit to Venice. We have visited Venice few times before but this was the best ever and although the stay was a little bit more expensive but it was worth every penny!!! It has made our stay wonderful and we are planning the trip and saving the money to come back next year!! If you ever go to Venice don't hesitate to stay in the place as it's based on Grand Canal and you are in the heart of wonderful city of the mystery and charm! You can enjoy the Grand Canal in solitude from this place and if you are not the one for the tourist crowds try it out! Unforgettable holiday indeed! Memories will be cherished forever!Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
