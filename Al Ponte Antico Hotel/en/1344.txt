After disembarking a 12 night Mediteranean cruise, we had one extra night in Venice before returning home. We wanted it to be special.  And it certainly was. The Al Ponte Antico is a beautiful hotel. The location is great. The views of the canal and Rialto bridge are wonderful. But the most outstanding feature to this hotel is the owner, Matteo. His love for the hotel and the city is contagious. We would epecially like to acknowledge Armando for assisting with booking and arrival. And Oliver that shared helpful history and information about the city making our short time well spent.    If you are looking for a truly magical place to stay in Venice, this  is it!  BP Kansas City, MORead moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
