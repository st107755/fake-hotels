No wonder this is on the Top 25 best hotel list! Beautifuly decorated rooms and hotel. The service was absolutely amazing. Wonderfully charming and helpful owners. They really took care of us and had the best tips on local restaurants and places to visit. The location is unbeatable with unforgetable breakfast views from the hotel balcony to the Rialto. Once in a lifetime unforgettable experience for us and I would really love to go back some day.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
