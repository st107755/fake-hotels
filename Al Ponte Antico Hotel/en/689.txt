Over the years, I've stayed at many top hotels, like the Ritz, Four Seasons, Trump, Miami Fontainebleau, Halekulani, the Palm, etc. But I found this hotel gave me the best experience ever.   We were greeted by Bruno, the owner, as we disembarked the water taxi (by the way, thats THE way to get there). Everybody called us by our first names throughout our stay. Our kids felt welcome and my wife and I loved the tour of the property. We cant wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
