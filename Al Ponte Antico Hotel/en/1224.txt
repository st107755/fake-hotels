This is it... no need to look further. The perfect hotel in Venice. Perfect location, stunning views, beautiful rooms, amazing service, best breakfasts that we had on our holiday. We were only able to get their most basic room with a courtyad view and the room was still lovely. The view from the hotel balcony was worth the trip to Venice. Thank you Al Ponte Antico Hotel - our stay in Venice was perfect - you really do deserve top placement on Trip Advisor.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
