Fabulous hotel with a terrace to sit and relax.  Picture perfect location.  Very comfortable and clean and ideal for exploring the city.  Staff are super and Matteo will treat you to a great omelette in the morning. They make you feel like you are the most important guest they have ever had, and they do it to everyone.  Highly recommend this hotel, and will be back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
