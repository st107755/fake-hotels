After a wonderful week of skiing in the dolomites, this hotel was all I needed! Due to its location, we had easy access to all major attractions but could also retreat whenever we wanted to. Matteo and his team are simply superb.  After a long day of walking around, you can go out to the terrace and enjoy your favorite drink while watching the gondolas go by. The views are simply breathtaking over the Rialto bridge.  Kudos to Matteo and his family for discovering this gem and turning it into one of the finest boutique hotels of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
