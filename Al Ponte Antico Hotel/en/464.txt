Exactly as I expected and maybe a bit more... This hotel is a must to stay in when you visit Venice... It is clean, organized, everything you need is available. The team were very very helpful with recomendation for places to visit and to eat. I read before a review about some privacy issue and noise coming from breakfast area, I can say that there is nothing like that. The hotel is calm and quite, I like that every one knows our names and always smiling to us.  Thank you Matteo and thanks to all of your team... I will visit your hotel again whenever in venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
