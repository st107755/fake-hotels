What can I say, Mateo, Oliver, David, Tomas, and Signora were all amazing!!! Such great personal attention was given to us.  And the view from the terrace of the Grand Canal was well worth it!!  As was Mateo's eggs at breakfast.  Oliver and David made excellent recommendations for food too.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
