We just stayed in this hotel on May 21 at the end of our cruise.  All the furnishings, etc. are new.  We did not get a room with a view because none were available.  Our room was beautiful with a Venetian glass chandelier.  We had a jacuzzi tub and towel warmers.  The breakfast terrace is just as it is on the website.  It was very cute.  The staff was very nice and very helpful.  We paid 200 Euros.  I also loved the location, close to the Rialto bridge and vaporetto stops.    I highly recommend this hotel for location, cleanliness and beautiful, elegant rooms.  It is what you want your hotel room to be in Venice. Read moreHelpfulShare
