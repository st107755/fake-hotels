Sitting on the perfectly situated balcony overlooking the Realto Bridge with my last Campari Spritz before saying goodbye to this most wonderful of hotels. The staff are magnificent & pamper you from the moment you step over the threshold. Thank you to all the staff at Al Ponte Antico, it is your manners and guest relationship which leaves an indelible mark on everyone that stays. Thank You, Barry & Carol Moore Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
