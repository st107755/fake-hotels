New Years experience in Venice, what a place!perfect view, perfect staff, perfect hotel!  This is truly a gem in Venice!  You have to understand that there’s a lot of places in Venice that try to take more money than they should, people that are not the nicest in the world, have a very difficult approach to tourists, but this Hotel is just not it! In here you realise how everyone is excellent at their job! Everyone is pleased to have you here and how you can enjoy your time as it was timeless vacations! One of the best hotels I’ve seen! My congrats to the management!  Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
