We expected a lot, due to the very positive Tripadvisor evaluations of the hotel and its top ranking. And it was exactly like that - and sometimes even better. Think of anything...decor, rooms, location (with a perfect view on the Rialto bridge from the hotel's terrace)...it was just perfect! But what was most impressive to us was the impeccable service. Matteo and his team don't only know your name. They are very helpful, polite, friendly at all times - simply great!Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
