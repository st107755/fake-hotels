All I can say about our stay in Al Ponte Antico is it was wonderful! I mean from the very first step out of the water taxi into the hotel the services was impeccable, the room was beautiful and huge. Loved seen the owner's passion and love he has for this place and all of his guest. We can't wait to go back and stay with you guys again!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
