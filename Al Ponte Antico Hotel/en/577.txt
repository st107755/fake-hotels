Lovely big room done in the style of an old palace. Fabulous balcony over the grand canal for breakfast and drinks anytime. Central to Rialto bridge. Nothing is too much problem for the staff, very friendly and attentive and all of them know you by name.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
