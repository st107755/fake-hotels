Dear Barbara, Bruno, Alex and Igor,   we just wanted to drop you a quick note to say a big thank you for a fantastic stay at your beautiful property, as well as the upgrade to the amazing canal view room!   From the minute we arrived by river taxi and were greeted by the lovely Igor with a big warm smile as we docked on to the pier, we were overwhelmed. We absolutely LOVED the feel of the hotel, everything is so authentic and personal and with so much attention to detail.   In my industry, I see so many hotels which thrill for different reasons and have something distinct to offer to a group or individual traveller, however your property is really something special and both Markus and I cant wait to be back=)   We have already recommended you to our friends so more lovely German people coming your way =)   Until then, all the very best from sunny Germany,   Natalie & Markusâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
