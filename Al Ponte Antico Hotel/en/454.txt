This boutique hotel was amazing. The owner, Matteo welcomed us on arrival and was so friendly. All the staff were very friendly and helpful,especially Alex and Oliver who helped us plan what to do, where to eat and I can honestly say made our stay so special and allowed us to do things we wouldn't have found on our own! the breakfast was gorgeous too and so fresh with lots of choices. The view from the balcony was so beautiful and it's a great location as so central. I can't recommend this hotel enough.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
