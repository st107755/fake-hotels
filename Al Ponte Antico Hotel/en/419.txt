PROS  Great location.  right on the grand canal.  Restaurants and shops conveniently close by.  Responsive and friendly staff remember your name and preferences almost immediately.  Decor is luxurious old venetian palazzo.  Our room was luxurious and well appointed with views of the Grand Canal.  TV english was okay.  WIFI was very good.  Bathroom was spacious and shower pressure excellent.  Lots of closet/storage space.  Outdoor terrace was the highlight of the hotel.  It is small - just six or so tables but right on the Grand Canal.  Delicious Breakfast or generous cocktails overlooking the activity on the canal were special moments during our stay.  CONS  None at all!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
