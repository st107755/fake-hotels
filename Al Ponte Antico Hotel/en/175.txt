This is quite a hotel, small, beautifully furnished, perfectly located quite close to the Rialto bridge, directly on the Grand Canal. In fact, the delicious breakfast will be enjoyed on an outside terrace with that spectacular view. The owner and staff will strike you as the friendliest and most helpful you will ever meet! When I return to Venice, i know where Iâ€™ll be staying!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
