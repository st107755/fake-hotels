Incredible stay in the heart of Venice. The location could not be beaten - in the heart of Venice with a guest balcony looking directly on the Rialto bridge. With only 9 rooms the service was the friendliest we have ever experienced with every single member of staff knowing us by first name and the owner Matteo the absolute pinnacle of a good host.  Can't recommend this hotel enough and I will be back without a doubt.Read moreDate of stay: August 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
