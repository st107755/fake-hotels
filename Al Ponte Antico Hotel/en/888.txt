I agree wholeheartedly with all the reviews of al Ponte Antico posted here: this is a beautiful boutique hotel; the rooms and bathrooms are spectacular; the sitting areas are calm and serene; the overall design and architectural feel, superb. The staff members are charming, professsional.  I will never forget the time that we spent there  This hotel is excellent.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
