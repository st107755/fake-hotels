There are not many hotels in Venice where you can sit on a patio overlooking the Grand Canal facing the Rialto Bridge.  tripadvisor was right on again.  This hotel is small and so authentically Venetian.  The owner and staff were warm and friendly and made us feel as if we were royalty staying in a palace, which is what the hotel was previously.  The only negative part is we were only staying for 1 night and it would've been a perfect place to stay for a few days.  If you're looking for ultra modern, this isn't the hotel for you.  If you're looking for a truly Venetian experience, this hotel is simply amazing!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
