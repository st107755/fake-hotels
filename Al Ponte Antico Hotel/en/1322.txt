While the hotel does have a fantastic location, beautiful interior, and wonderful style - its greatest assets are Matteo and his staff. They give you the hospitality one would expect was only received by royalty - and they are truly so helpful in everything. As the hotel only has 9 rooms, you will never get lost in the crowd and the small things like Matteo using your first name, and his great drinks and food served on the terrace truly make this place exceptional. This hotel desreves the number 1 spot here.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
