We stayed for one night before joining a group tour that was more budget oriented and we are glad we got a peek at a top end hotel. The Al Ponte Antico has it all - the views are exactly what is pictured and the room (at least ours) was huge with a living room area overlooking the Grand Canal, with a friendly and helpful staff, sumptuous furnishings in the common areas and rooms. We spent a few hours just watching the Canal traffic float by our big window. The Rialto bridge is currently being repaired, has scaffolding/screening on it, as does a large building across the Canal from the hotel, so the view is a bit marred from that, but still beautiful and relaxing.  Very good breakfast, full, not the usual continental, with basically the same view our room had.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
