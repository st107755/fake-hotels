My wife and I recently spent a three night honeymoon at Al Ponte Antico and it was everything we'd hoped it would be.  Venice is an expensive city and is largely populated by tourists.  It's been that way for over 500 years!  This hotel is an elegant little retreat with excellent, personal and friendly service.  The room we had was clean, well kept and quiet.  The staff are all very attentive, from the cleaning staff all the way up to the owner.  The balcony overlooking the Rialto bridge is a great place to relax with a Spritz or a Negroni and watch the world go by - the kind of place you hope to find while you're wondering around the city, and then you realise you have the perfect spot at your hotel!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
