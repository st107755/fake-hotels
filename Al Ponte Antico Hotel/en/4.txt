Matteo and Barbara are such lovely hosts. The hotel itself is fantastic with very tastefully done interiors, attention to the tiniest details and a superb view. Our room had a very cute patio extending onto the grand canal right by Rialto bridge and it was such a great experience to be able to walk out there and sit outside whenever we wanted. The breakfast was yummy served on a gorgeous terrace.. overall we really felt like we got a flavor of loving Venetian luxury right in the heart of Venice. Thanks Matteo for making us have such a wonderful stay ! Read moreDate of stay: September 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
