This hotel was everything that we had hoped for.  My husband and I were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and wanted to special place in Venice.  The hotel was beautiful, the view from the terrace was amazing, and every person on the staff was friendly, kind, and helpful.  If we are lucky enough to return to Venice, this is the only place we would ever stay.  This hotel made Venice our favorite place in Italy!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
