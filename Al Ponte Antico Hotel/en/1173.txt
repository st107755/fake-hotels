I've never been bothered to writre a reveiw before as once home i never made the time but this is by far the best hotel i have ever stayed in. The owner and his staff were the nicest people and nothing was to much trouble. The location could not be any better and to sit on the terrace with a glass of wine looking on to the grand cannal was heven .this is the place to stay. debbie ukRead moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
