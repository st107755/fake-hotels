Pros: 1. Location, location, location--between the Rialto Bridge and the Rialto market on the Grand Canal, five minutes from a vaporetto stop. 2. Extremely friendly and personal service (Oliver's resturant suggestions over a six-day period were spot on). 3. Facility is a beautifully restored palazzo that shrieks "expenses be damned." 4. Spacious terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, perfect for boat watching over breakfast or before-dinner drinks.  Cons: 1. Al Ponte Antico is, in fact, not really a hotel. With only nine rooms, it's a tarted up b&b of your dreams. Personally, I like the relative anonimity that a hotel offers a traveler. At Al Ponte Antico, like it or not, you're part of an extended Ventian family.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
