Everything about the hotel is excellent - it may not have the facilities of a 5 star hotel but the customer service (Matteo, Oliviero, Rosalba et al) is better than any 5 star hotel we have ever stayed in.  Would re-iterate everyone else's comments - if you visit Venice, you must stay here - it makes the trip that little bit more special.
