My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The staff were amazing and so so helpful. The rooms were perfect. The location of the hotel was great! We got a water taxi right to the hotel door from the airport which added to the experience . I can't wait to go back again some day!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
