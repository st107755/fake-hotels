My husband and I stayed in Venice during the summer bank holiday and were immediately impressed with the service and comfort of Al Ponte Antico.  The staff were extremely helpful and the location is "to die for".  Just beyond the steps of the Rialto bridge down a convenient alley, away from the crowds.
