We stayed here for 1 night only in Oct 2014. We had never been to Venice and might not ever see it again so this was definitely the best best hotel to stay in to experience Venice. The hotel was just how  I imagined a traditional Venetian hotel would be. We were truly spoilt. The hosts were amazing making you feel very relaxed but also made you feel that you were very important to them. This was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed in but it was well worth it to experience the beauty and romance of Venice. ❤️Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
