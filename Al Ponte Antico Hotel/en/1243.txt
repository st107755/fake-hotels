This hotel is rated #1 for a reason.  Our room was stunningly beautiful, with an incredible view of the Rialto bridge.  Our hosts, Oliver, Thomas, and Matteau, were the most charming and genuinely helpful hosts we have ever encountered while travelling.  The location is perfect for a lovely visit to Venice.  And, compared to the Bauer and Luna Baglioni, the price is a true value.  We loved it.  We will be back.  I would add my great photos from our room, but I cannot get them into the right format.  The photos taken from our room are the best in the whole trip.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
