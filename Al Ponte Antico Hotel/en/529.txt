This 9 room hotel is spectacular! Being a small hotel has great advantages. We were always greeted by name and were well taken care of. The service at this hotel is tops. The biggest highlight was the breakfast. Made to order by the owner Matteo. Amazing cappuccino, omelet and crepes. The view from the deck was fabulous! You can't find a better central location. Thank you to the staff and Matteo. I would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
