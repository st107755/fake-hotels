This is our second stay and everything was as charming as the first time 4 years ago  The rooms are elegant with views over the Grand Canal to the Rialto bridge, the team are so very attentive and the breakfast is first class.  This really is the only place that we will stay when visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
