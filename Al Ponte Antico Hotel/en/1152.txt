Staying at this gem of a hotel is an incredible experience from the moment the boat lets you off at its private dock. We had a beautiful (and large room) with views right on the Grand Canal. The friendly and excellent staff greets you by name and Matteo is a charming and gracious host. Sitting out on their  terrace enjoying a spritz in the early evening with the Rialto Bridge practically close enough to touch is magical. I can't imagine a better place to stay in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: September 20092 SavesHelpfulShare
