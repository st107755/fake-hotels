The owner of this boutique hotel deliberately hires people NOT from the hospitality industry. He hires them for their qualities as people. And that is the difference that makes a difference. With only 9 rooms, every staff members recognizes you and calls you by name, even though you haven't met you yet. (A copy of your passport at check in helps.)  Best location in Venice on the Grande Canal near the Rialto bridge. Be sure to have breakfast on the veranda overlooking the canal to watch the city come alive in the morning.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
