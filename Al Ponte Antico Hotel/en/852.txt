Our family of four (2 teenage kids) stayed at this fabulous hotel for 2 nights at the end of June. We were so impressed with the hotel and it's location but mostly with the wonderful staff. Oliver at the front desk and Thomas the night "watchman" were so incredibly kind and accomodating. We missed them for days after our departure. A true gem of a property and worth every penny spent!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
