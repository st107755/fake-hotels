We spent a week with the Peruch family at Al Ponte Antico and had an amazing time.  The staff is super friendly, greeted us by name, and prepared fabulous breakfasts.  Our room was delightful, facing the Grand Canal.  Shutters kept the room quiet at night. We enjoyed evening cocktails on the balcony, soaking in the sights of Venice. Cannot wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
