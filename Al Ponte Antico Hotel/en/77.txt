We and our kids spent 3 nights in this lovely Hotel, a real jewel tucked away from crowds but at the same time located in the heart of Venizia! Wonderful breakfast, amazing staff. A special mention to GIGI, a true Italian gentleman of class, elegance and charm. He gave us plenty of tips on what to do, eat and visit. He even cooked breakfast for us one day making special capucinos. Thank to the owner Barbera for this special stay! Richard"Bill" & FamilyRead moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
