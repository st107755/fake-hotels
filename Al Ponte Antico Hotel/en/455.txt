Our first visit to Venice and we hit the jackpot with this hotel.  The location is right on the canal at the Rialto bridge with a private balcony for resort guests only. Awesome breakfast and coffee served every morning on the balcony and in the evening you can enjoy a drink on the same spot to watch the gondolas and the beautiful sunsets. The hotel owners and hosts were so warm and welcoming offering numerous recommendations for local shopping, eating, and things to do.   Large rooms have old charm and elegance as location was a 14th century location updated with very modern bathrooms and amenities.  Rooms were a bit expensive but worth the extra money for the location, ambience,and hosts!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
