Matteo deserves the highest praise and rating. We felt very welcome the moment we stepped into this beautiful property at this gorgeous and yet convenient location ( right next to the Rialto bridge). Quickly we were called and greeted on our first name basis..( we had a big family of 6). Even when we came back just before midnight and when we had breakfast the next morning, the new staff already knew our names before we introduced ourselves.  Talking about breakfast, eating simple but delicious breakfast overlooking the Rialto bridge was just magnificent. The rooms themselves were beautifully decorated with old Venetian charms with all modern amenities.  Matteo and his team gave excellent advice on where to go for meals and how to get the best out of Venice.  We all love thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
