My husband and I just left this wonderful hotel.  We would describe it as going back in time where employees remember your name,how you like you coffee in the morning to the perfect Aperol Spriz at Spritz o'clock.  From Mateo the owner to his employees, they truly care about your comfort during your stay, they think of everything, Stay here for the perfect holiday with the one you love Peggy and Graham USARead moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
