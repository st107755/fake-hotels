My husband & I stayed here for our anniversary & my husbands birthday. The room was spacious, clean with a dressing area & lovely bathroom. We have travelled alot & it's probably the most ornate hotel we've every stayed in. The view is to die for & Venice is amazing! Matteo is the perfect host & left a chilled bottle of Proseco in our room for my Husbands birthday. I don't normally eat breakfast but the choice & eggs personally cooked by Matteo the way you like them is just not to be missed. I can't recommend the hotel highly enough.Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare
