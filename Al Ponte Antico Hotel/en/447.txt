Stayed for a weekend to celebrate my 50th & our honeymoon. We were blown away by the hospitality by Matteo the owner but also by Alex, Oliver, David, Thomas & all the other staff!! They made our feel extremely special and treated our as royalty!!  The hotel itself is amazing and something that makes you go WOW! The room we had was beautiful. The views from the terrace where you can have breakfast or drinks in the evening are spectacular.  This boutique hotel is truly special and so are the staff.  We will be back and will not stay anywhere else apart from their sister hotel. Thank you Matteo and his staff for a wonderful and truly memorable stay!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
