We had room 103, it didnt have a view of the canal, but was gorgeous anyway, with high ceiling, comfortable bed and lovely spacious bathroom. The staff, as others have said, really genuinely care for you, and take the trouble to know you by name, an incredibly friendly thing. Their advice was spot on for restaurants and day trips. Polite staff, jaw dropping terrace, we had breakfast everyday overlooking the Grand Canal, watching the world float by. Expensive, but good grief, its worth it. Thank you Matteo, Alex, Rosealba,Oliver and Thomas (who helped us with 2 extra pillows at 4am as my wife had heartburn!!!) One day we will return, and take the watertaxi to the front door rather than walk from the bus station!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
