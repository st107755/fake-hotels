In October of this past year we were iin Italy for a month and the first and foremost memory for both of us was our stay with owner Mateo and staff (hi Alex) at this hotel. The amazing room with windows opening onto the Grand Canal, breakfast cooked to order and eaten in an intimate setting, historic building with traditional decor, afternoon espresso on the terrace, private water taxi dropping you off at the hotel's private dock, and the staff that makes you feel like family as soon as you meet them.... What is our favorite? You have to stay there and let us know.  Great 35th anniversary and 60th bday present we gave ourselves.  Oh yeah, Venice is beautiful and the food great, too. Thank you for great memories... Sharon and Gary ChinRead moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
