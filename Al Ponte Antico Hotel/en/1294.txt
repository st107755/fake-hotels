We were at Hotel Ponte Antico in March for the weekend. This is a jewel box of a hotel on a fantastic spot on the grand canal not far from the rialto bridge. Besides its central location, the best thing about this hotel, as others have mentioned is its friendly and helpful staff.  As soon as our feet crossed the threshold of the hotel, we were addressed by name. We have not had this type of personal service at any hotel we've ever stayed at. Matteo and Oliver made our stay in venice truly extra special.Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare
