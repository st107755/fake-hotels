Positioned perfectly to capture the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal, Matteo & his passionate staff ensured we wanted for nothing, cooked our breakfast & met our every need. With only 9 rooms, the 12th century palace has been lovingly restored to its romantic best. Our spacious room faced the canal with the best vantage point to view the busy waterway, with a spectacular terrace for coffee, breakfast or your cocktail of desire. A truly unforgettable stay, a must for loved up couples wanting an authentic Venetian experience! Cannot recommend highly enough, we will return!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
