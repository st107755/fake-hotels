The only thing more dear than the hotel is feeling that you are so welcome in their special place in Venice. This hotel is very popular and with Matteo and  Bruno unwilling to let the hotels popularity get to their head they deliver hospitality as if you were the first and most important customer. Rooms are a piece of art as are the common areas of the hotel. Breakfasts are as good as they get. The only negative is that by writing ANOTHER good review it becomes increasingly difficult to book on short notice to this fabulous spot in such a fabulous City.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
