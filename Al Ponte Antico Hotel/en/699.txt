We had an absolutely fantastic time at Al Ponte Antico staying for two nights last week (28th & 29th). The hotel is stunning and there can not be a better location in Venice.  Matteo, Allessio and all the staff were fantastic, very welcoming and attentive, this is without question by far the nicest hotel experience we have ever had.   Many thanks guys for making our stay so enjoyable and memorable.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
