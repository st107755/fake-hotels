Matteo, the owner and his staff have prefected the art of hotel management.  They knew and remembered our names and were available every moment to help in our visit to their great city of Venice.  They made dinner reservations for us and recommended several places. They provided maps to help us navigate the streets and get from place to place. The breakfasts were to die for, (Italian breakfasts are not like the USA) but Matteo made them individually for us from scratch. The hotel was beautiful with the best location in Venice.  I will go back here every time I visit.Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
