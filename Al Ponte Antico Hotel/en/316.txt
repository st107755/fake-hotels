We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for three nights before travelling home on the Orient Express. We had a brilliant time. The staff are lovely and helpful making dinner reservations for us. The hotel is beautiful and in a brilliant position for sightseeing. Matteo the owner makes fantastic breakfast omelettes. Would highly recommend the hotel.
