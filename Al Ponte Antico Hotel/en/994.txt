My wife and I arrived in Venice after a long flight. Matteo, the owner, was standing at the door and greated us by name, and asked if he could do anything to help us relax. We didn't even say who we were and he was escorting us to our room. Talk about a great first impression!   The hotel is small and gorgeous inside. The decore is pure Venetian; our room had a rich blue and gold silk wallpaper on the walls and ornate wood furniture. Matteo's staff was unbelievable helpful and recommended some of the best restaurants in the city.  All in all, I will never stay in any other hotel in Venice. The Al Ponte Antico is the best place to stay in Venice and maybe in all of Italy.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
