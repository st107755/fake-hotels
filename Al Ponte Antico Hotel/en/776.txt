I don't think I can put into words how wonderful this experience was for my husband and I. We have never felt so special, taken care of and like royalty the way the staff at Al Ponte Antico made us feel. We were greeted on the water upon Arrival and every morning, by first name. It truly felt like home away from home. Matteo, Katrina, Thomas, Oliver and Romania went above and beyond and provided exceptional service . The room was quaint and cozy. The location is amazing. The breakfast was perfect and a beautiful way to begin each morning. The balcony has breath taking views. I am so thankful for the staff and beauty of this hotel. We frequented the bar with Thomas at night, and it was such a fun way to end the night! If you are ever in Venice, it would be silly not to stay here.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
