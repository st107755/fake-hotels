This was our second trip to Venice and we spent two days at this beautiful hotel prior to leaving on a cruise. My family had three rooms, all excellent, but my wife's and my room was the best. It was the first floor suite where you could open the living room windows and have a fantastic view of the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge. See the Hotel's webcam, which is on the terrace above our room,  to get an example of the view to the left from the first floor suite. The view to the right looks down the Grand Canal. The owner of the hotel was very gracious. All of the hotel staff were excellent and very helpful leading up to our stay and during our entire stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
