This was our second stay at this small, imitimate hotel housed in an old palace on the Grand Canal and close to the Rialto Bridge. We were welcomed as old friends and greeted by our first names. We were cosseted by all the staff for our 4 nights with nothing being too much trouble. As and when we return to Venice we will have no hesitation in booking here again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
