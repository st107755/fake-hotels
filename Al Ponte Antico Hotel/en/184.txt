We stayed here for 2 nights in May.  Probably is the most personalized service we have ever received at a hotel.  The owner, Matteo was there for our arrival and greeted us by name, showed us the property and our beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge.. amazing.  Matteo made us breakfast every morning and the variety of baked goods and specialized coffee was delicious!  Alex, Thomas and the rest of the staff all greeted us by name everyday.We felt very special.  With only 9 rooms, the special attention is unlike any place we have ever stayed!  Thank you for making the beginning of our Italy trip so memorable!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
