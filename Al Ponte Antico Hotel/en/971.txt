I noticed this hotel had rave reviews so I booked it.  Bruno and Mateo immediately make you feel welcome upon arrival.  Taking the water tax from the airport to the hotel was great and in an instant you felt the ambience that only Venice can offer.  I personally loved the hotel and could not really find fault with it (well, the bathrooms are small).  The location is great--you can walk everywhere.  It is a great hotel with wonderful owners and a lovely view.  You will not be disappointed!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
