A good enough hotel. It has a terrace with view of the Canal. The rooms (certainly ours) are small (we checked with others). The beds (at least ours) leave much to be desired (we checked with others). The breakfast is also good enough but there is more to life than an egg. The table buffet is about the size of my desk.  Venice is a very expensive city so don't be too surprised at the price. Instead, do two things - look at a big (even chain) hotel or check down below the level of websites and you will find better and cheaper.Read moreDate of stay: April 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
