Matteo and his staff at the Al Ponte Antico are what made this such a special place to stay.  Yes, the location is fantastic.  Yes, the hotel was very very nice.  Yes, the view from the breakfast terrace has to be seen to be believed.  And yes, Venice can have that effect on you.  But it was the service and the people that made our stay all the more special.  Matteo made dinner reservations for us each night at places he suggested and they were always spot on.  Drinks and a friendly chat on the terrace of an evening before heading out for the night were always a highlight of our day.  And the fact that the staff made you feel like friends staying for the evening at their home rather than merely a guest in their hotel made us very sad to leave.  We can't wait to come back!
