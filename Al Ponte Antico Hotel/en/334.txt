This hotel is in the perfect location right next to the Rialto Bridge. The staff was so helpful with restaurant recommendations and tips on exploring the city. We had the breakfast option which was a huge breakfast buffet and cooked to order eggs which you can eat on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the bridge. Highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
