What a start to my first trip to Venice ! Water taxi from the airport directly to the hotel and we were welcomed on arrival by the manager Alex. This is a small hotel with 9 rooms located on the Grand Canal. The hotel is decorated in the traditional Venetian style. The small terrace offers a wonderful view of the canal and the Rialto bridge. Guests can enjoy breakfast here, drinks or simply just sit and watch the activity on the canal. You have to experience it to appreciate the location. Walking from the hotel you are immediately in a busy shopping street, with cafes and restaurants nearby. It was a wonderful experience, thank you Matteo and staff.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
