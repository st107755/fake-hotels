My wife and I just returned from our fifth visit to the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. It remains one of our very favorites. The location, very near the Rialto Bridge is fantastic. The rooms are wonderful, neat and clean and furnished in classic Venetian style. We love the rooms which are directly on the Grand Canal, a truly unique way to stay in Venice. The terrace where breakfast is served is absolutely amazing, the view over the Grand Canal looking at the Rialto Bridge, priceless. I can't imagine a better view exists. The terrace is also open at all times for cocktails or simply viewing life on the canal. I could sit there for hours! The team led by owner Matteo, is fantastic. They always great you warmly by name and are ever present to help you enjoy Venice and all it has to offer.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
