We had the opportunity to visit Venice in late June 2015 and stayed at Al Ponte. This 9 room boutique hotel is located on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge and within walking distance from major attractions like Piazza San Marco. The staff is very friendly and will do anything to please you. Client satisfaction is a top priority. They even learn your first name upon arrival. Matteo, the owner, prepares breakfast every morning and will not hesitate to provide information and refer great restaurants. The outside terrace on the Grand Canal is unique and outstanding especially in the morning when having breakfast. I strongly recommend and will return without any hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
