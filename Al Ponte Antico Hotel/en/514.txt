The Al Ponte Antico is the best hotel we have stayed in for service and location!  The personal service was outstanding, all the staff knew our first names and went out of their way to make our stay perfect and enjoyable. The 14th century hotel was perfectly located on the grand canal by Rialto bridge for all the beautiful sights of Venice. The decor in this boutique hotel added to the experience of a beautiful city.
