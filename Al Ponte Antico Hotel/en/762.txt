We just spent three nights in room #108 that opens onto the Grand Canal.  Really spectacular.  Also, the service in this hotel is the best I have ever experienced.  The personal touches make it like staying with friends.  This hotel will be the standard by which all our future hotels will be judged.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
