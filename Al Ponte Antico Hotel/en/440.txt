The experience begins the moment you are welcomed at the hotel.  The staff use you name and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are large and beautifully furnished - making you feel as though you have stepped back in time !! Breakfast on the terrace is a fabulous experience with eggs to order or pancakes of your choice.  The location is perfect with a map and easy to follow directions given to ensure you don't get lost - cannot recommend highly enough - an idilic hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
