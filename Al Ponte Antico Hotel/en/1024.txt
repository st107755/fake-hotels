Al Ponte Antico is a converted 14-century palazzo in the Cannaregio district that is run by a couple of brothers who insist upon personalized service for all the guests. The hotel and its rooms are absolutely gorgeous. Breakfast was the best we had in Italy (especially the made-to-order crepes) and the breakfast terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is stunning.  Cannaregio is not nearly as touristy as San Marco but offers plenty of shops and restaurants. It's a short 10-minute walk to the heart of Piazza San Marco.  Love the Al Ponte Antico!Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
