Another visit to Venice, and back to our favourite hotel. The room was at the back (a "classic" room), large and very comfortable, with TV, sofa, good bathroom, and good, big bed. Breakfast was excellent-eggs as you want, pancakes etc. Coffee very good. But the best is where you eat it-on the balcony, overlooking the Grand Canal. Oh..and drinks before dinner on it as well. A very memorable evening-us, an English and American couple, a few wines, a BIG thunderstorm, all huddling under the umbrella, getting slightly wet, but not wanting to go inside, watching the vaporettos go by. And yes the Rialto has graffiti, but move on.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
