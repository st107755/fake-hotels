This was a complete splurge but oh so worth it! On a quiet side street in the heart of everything, and our elaborately decorated room( damask wallpaper, chandalier, velvet and brocade furniture) had 2 Windows directly on the Canal.

More gracious and attentive service could not be had and whatever you do, do not miss breakfast. Do take a private water taxi from the hotel's water stop and feel like a celebrity.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
