LOVE, LOVE, LOVED it! First, SPECTACULAR view (we didnt have a view of the canal from our room but breakfast on the terrace was all we needed) & STUNNING decor throughout hotel. Second, probably one of the best locations for finding your way back from being very lost. (lol...it's a Venice thing to do) And then the staff were divine (even got to meet owner!) I have to give a shout out to Thomas (note to self: pack light) cuz he made us laugh a LOT & Rosa was so very nice to my niece - just all around CLASSY crew.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
