We were treated like royalty.  Being greeted by name as our water taxi pulled up to the private dock was just a taste of the wonderful hospitality of Matteo and his staff.  The rooms are fabulous, the location can't be beat, the breakfast is marvelous, but what made our stay truly remarkable was the attention we received from everyone at the hotel.  We can't wait to return to the hotel. We were in Europe for 17 days and only stayed here for 1 night, but it was a highlight of our vacation.  We were 7 people from teenagers to a grandparent and each of us was made to feel special.Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
