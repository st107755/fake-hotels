This hotel is within feet of the Rialto Bridge. Our room had a great canal view, with a large shared balcony right outside our door for breakfast (the best breakfasts we had on our month long European trip) and afternoon cocktails.  The room was large well appointed with a comfortable bed and large bathroom. Air conditioning was great. The real stars of this hotel are the owner and staff. Everyone took an interest in you, they were always available with a story, directions great restaurant suggestions, etc.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
