This beautiful small palazzo was perfect in every way.  From the gracious hosts, to the beautiful rooms, the fantastic view, the amazing location, the delicious cappuccinos, the impeccable service and the welcoming staff..it was truly a wonderful experience.  My son and I spent five perfect days in Venice last week and so throughly enjoyed this marvellous city. Our experience was enhanced by the kind, helpful and welcoming treatment by all of the members of this fantastic hotel.  I would return to this hotel without question if I have the opportunity to visit this magical city again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
