This was my second time to stay here and I would come back again and again. Take a water taxi and be delivered right to the door where you will be greeted warmly. This is a very old building, beautifully maintained. There are only 9 rooms, each is different and ornate with 12 foot ceilings. The beds and linens are very nice. As nice as the accomodations are, it is the wonderful staff who will impress you. Every person who works here will call you by name.  Gigi will draw you a map to the best restaurants. The breakfast each morning is truly amazing and wonderful. Eat on the balcony right on the grand canal and view the Rialto Bridge.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
