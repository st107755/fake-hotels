We had a 4 day stay. All the detail is covered in previous reviews.  The terrace location, atmosphere and views are superb, the Spritz's are refreshing.  I travel on business worldwide and choose the tried and trusted chains and receive good but impersonal attention, the Al Ponte Antico is the exact opposite with a very personal service.  The management of the hotel from Matteo and team is the epitome of the hospitality trade, nothing too much trouble and attention unmatched in my experience across the world. They really understand that you are looking for a once in a lifetime stay and they all step up and deliver.  If you go to Venice looking for an experience then book it now, it will not disappointRead moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
