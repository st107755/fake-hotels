The reviews for this hotel speak for themselves and there isn’t much more to add! The best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone knew us by name and made us feel very special. The rooms are a good size and have an optional view for a few extra £££. We didn’t have a view but made good use of the terrace which must be the best view in the whole of Venice. Enjoying the amazing breakfast and watching the Grand Canal wake up was unforgettable.   We were given excellent recommendations on how to spend our time in Venice, pointing us towards some lesser known local spots and making our holiday truly memorable. I wouldn’t hesitate in staying here again and hope to be back soon!Read moreDate of stay: August 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
