What an amazing experience.  I have pretty high expectations, as I do seminars and key notes on customer service for a living.  I was blown away!  Personal, but careful not to be obtrusive.  An amazing personal introductory tour of this 15th century castle, turned boutique hotel  by the owner, Matteo.   Breakfast personally prepared by him as well.  A staff that truly cares.  An awesome view of the Rialto bridge from one of the very few properties with a second floor terrace.  If we ever get the honor of returning to Venice, we will not consider staying anywhere else.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
