Our visit began with my husband and I being greeted at the taxi dock by the owner. After a quick tour, we were shown our gorgeous room sand our luggage had already been delivered. The room was simply sumptuous with beautiful fabric covered walls and matching fabric throughout. The view from the room was of the Grand Canal, just past the Rialto Bridge. Watching Venice's version of traffic was a fun spectacle each day.   Mateo, the owner, listened carefully to our requests and always more than delivered. We were greeted by name by every staff member. They remembered our preferences and gave good suggestions for dining and sightseeing.  Whenever in Venice, this will be the first choice for where to stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
