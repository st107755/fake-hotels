We recently stayed at this hotel for 5 days and I can not say enough good things about it. Alex and Matteo and all of the staff have taken customer service to a new level. They make you feel like you are part of their family. The hotel is central... but expect to get lost as soon as you walk out the door.. but thats the best way to explore a city. Drinks on the terrace are a must - and the breakfast's are to die for... Seriously, this is a fantastic little hotel with great people.... please consider it for your visit.
