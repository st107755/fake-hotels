Our second visit to Al Ponte Antico within a year. We came at the end of 2013 and were so impressed I did my first ever Tripadvisor review (Dec 12013). This time we brought our four teenage-student age sons, and in fact created our whole summer holiday around the chance to revisit this perfect gem. They were equally impressed, not just with the ideal location and views but more than anything with the exceptional staff. Thank you Matteo and your team for another wonderful stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
