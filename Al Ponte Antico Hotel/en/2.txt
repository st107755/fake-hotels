We took a water taxi which dropped us off at the private dock of the hotel. We were met by a staff member at the dock. Upon check-in at the hotel, the staff member (sorry I cannot remember his name) gave us a tour of the nine room boutique hotel and explained the history of the hotel. Originally, we were scheduled to arrive on a different date with a Grand Canal view. Since we had to change our travel date, we could not have a Grand Canal view. Originally, we were disappointed but after arriving, we were glad to have a more quite room. The room was nicely decorated and comfortable. However, the hide-away bed couch was a little uncomfortable. The balcony from the hotel over looks the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. What views!!!!Breakfast was definitely a highlight of the day. Homemade breads and desserts were served with breakfast. I could have eaten the entire lemon cake!!! Eating breakfast on the balcony was a beautiful way to start the day. Also, having nightly cocktails on the balcony was an enjoyable way to end the day. We have traveled worldwide and we have never had the detail to service as offered at this hotel. When we were introduced to new staff, they already knew our names. The small touches really matter. Besides the beautiful hotel and wonderful staff, the location was convenient to many of the tourist sites as well as the water buses (if so desired). I have always wanted to visit Venice and see the sites but staying at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel was almost the best part of our vacation.
