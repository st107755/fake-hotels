Absolutely the friendliest and best hotel staff I have ever encountered.  Matteo, Alex, David and Oliver took care of my every need competently and professionally.   A great location for a hotel on a canal a few feet from the Rialto.   And Matteo fixes a darn good breakfast too.  I would stay here regardless of whether my room had a direct canal view or not.   The view from their outside breakfast area is fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
