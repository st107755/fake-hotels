What a wonderful hotel in Venice. We stayed for four nights. Matteo, Oliver and the rest of the team are so wonderful and so helpful! They treated us like close friends from our arrival to our departure. The hotel is a jewel, and the breakfasts, even by European boutique standards, are out of this world. Our room overlooked the grand canal, and had easy access to St Mark's Square, the Rialto Bridge, and the Vaporettos. They couldn't have been nicer, and more helpful, from morning cappuccinos to restaurant recommendations and reservations. There are more famous hotels in Venice, but none have the charm and the friendliness of Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
