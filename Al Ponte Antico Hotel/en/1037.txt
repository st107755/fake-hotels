We stayed at Al Ponte Antico to celebrate our 25th anniversary; everything the other reviewers write is true. The warm welcome with champagne for our celebration,the helpful advice, the lovely little talks and the beautiful clean rooms and superb breakfast. The most beautiful is the balcony that everybody can use. We had a room with view on the Canal Grande but you don't need it, you can sit the whole day on the balcony and watch the traffic. Tip: spend money on a watertaxi to get to the hotel, it's worth it!  Matteo thank you again and we hope to come back. Hubert and DorienRead moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
