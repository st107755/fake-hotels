We stayed for 4 days in October having booked on the internet. It was just  as we had been led to expect from other reviews that were very accurate.  Our arrival was anticipated because the staff were monitoring arrivals at the airport and were therefore aware of delays.  As it was our honeymoon we were welcomed with chiiled sparkling wine in our room with a card signed by all the staff. This certainly helped us settle in.  We had the Junior Suite which must have one of the best views in Venice. We were tempted to spend so much time watching the world go by on the Grand Canalthat we had to make ourselves go out to see the rest of Venice.  Staff were charming, helpful and attentive.Nothing was too much trouble. Every guest was made to feel very important to them.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
