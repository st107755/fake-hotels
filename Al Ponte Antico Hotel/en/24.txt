During our recent trip to Venice we stayed at Al Ponte Antico. This is a charming, small hotel right on the Grand Canal with a beautiful view of the Rialto bridge. We found it to be very unique, having only 9 rooms, and creating a sense of being immersed in the city and the culture.  The owner is also a charming man who is hands on daily.  The breakfast buffet itself is spectacular with a variety of pastries, baked goods, fruit, and a station for fresh eggs and omelettes.   From the time we arrived we were treated with a personal touch.  The entire staff had taken the time to learn our names before we stepped off the boat into the hotel and we were consistently greeted with our names throughout our stay.  This personal touch gave us the feeling of being familiar in a new place. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
