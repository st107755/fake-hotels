We stayed for four days in this Hotel. We were delighted! This is a small hotel that made our stay in Venice a dream come true. The location is excellent: close to the Ponte Rialto. From there is easy to walk all around the city. The place is beautifully decorated. The service was fantastic! Mateo, the owner and his crew were making sure that every detail was taken care off. Mateo cooked breakfast one morning, and we could tell that he enjoyed making the guests feel at home. Every one from the hotel greeted us (all the family) by our names and gave us great recommendations for visiting places, restaurants, etc. You won't find this kind of service in any "standard" hotel even if it is much more expensive. The hotel has a patio that overlooks the Grand Canal were we had breakfastâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
