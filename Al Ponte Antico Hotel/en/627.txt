We spent 4 nights in this boutique hotel beginning of April 2014. We were extremely lucky they had a room for us - looks like they are fully booked all the year round.And it is very easy to understand -it is located in the old Venetian palazzo, next to Rialto bridge but from its calmer more silent side.
