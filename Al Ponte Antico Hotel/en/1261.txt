We only had one night in Venice (I know WAY too short) and decided to make that one night extra special. Well, we could not have picked a better place to spend that one night. We had a room with the ultimate view - right on the canal and a couple of meters away from the Rialto bridge. The room was beautifully decorated in true plush Venentian splendour. The bathroom was a bit dissappointingly small & cramped compared to the lovely spacious 5 star room. Matteo and his staff were phenominal, from our welcome to the magnificent breakfast (best we had in al of  Italy). IWhen we go back to Venice we will head straight back to the Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
