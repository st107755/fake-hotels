My wife and I recently spent two nights Venice celebrating her Birthday.  Venice is densely packed with tourists and it was a quiet charming small 9 room refuge to hide after a long day from the crowds. It was small, intimate and has a rare terrace with a 180 view of the Grand Canal and Rialto.   The two Venice iconic locations are Rialto Bridge and St Marks and you're next to one of them.  The decor is old and authentic like you've stepped back in time.  You won't be disappointed.  Good breakfast and nice attentive staff who knows your name.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
