We travel a lot and stay in many cool and unique places.  Everything from 3 stars to 5 stars.  I have to say Al Ponte Antico Hotel in Venice is one of the best places we've ever stayed!  Matteo (the owner) is very hands on and greeted us personally when we arrived. Such a nice touch after a long travel day.  The staff is amazing!  Every person on staff knew us by name before we even met them and they always greeted us when we arrived back at the hotel after a day of combing the streets of Venice.    Location is amazing.  Views of the Rialto Brindge from the terrace.  Breakfast was also amazing and Matteo works the kitchen as well.  Like most places in Venice everything is walking distance, but this location is really ideal.  10 minutes to any of the big attractions or 30 if youâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
