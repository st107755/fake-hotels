Let me start by saying you will not find friendlier, more attentive, and more personal service anywhere. Mateo and his staff were absolutely wonderful. The hotel is small, nine rooms in total, so there is a feel of intimacy. Within minutes of arrival you are on a first name basis with the staff. You have the feeling that the staff is looking for any opportunity to make your stay better. And then there is the location. Close to everything yet away from any noise. But nothing prepares you for the view from the terrace. Spectacular! My wife did not want to leave. The Rialto bridge to your left, the Rialto market across the canal, and a beautiful view of the canal to your right. Plan to spend a good deal of time here.  Our room was small but nicely appointed and fully functional.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
