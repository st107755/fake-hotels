I took my wife for a surprise trip to Venice to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I chose the hotel because of the high recommendations on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed.  The hotel is elegant and in a great location but it is Matteo and his staff that make it so memorable.  They could not have been more freindly or helpful, whether it was to recommend restaurants, advise on things to do or simply providing a "Spritz" on the terrace in the evening. The hotel has its own landing stage, so if you really want to "Push the Boat Out", get a water taxi straight from the airport to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
