We throughly enjoyed our three night stay, our room was spacious but with little natural light due to the age and position of the hotel. The owner and all the staff were charming, helpful and knowledgeable, nothing was too much trouble. Venice itself is easy to walk around, the standout memory was a concert in The Opera House, golly that is a magnificent building. Closely followed by sitting on the hotels balcony watching the comings and goings on The Grand Canal. It is expensive, in my eyes, but Al Ponte position is worth every penny I really loved my time sipping cocktails in the sun.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
