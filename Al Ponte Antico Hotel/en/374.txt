Fabulous little hotel beside Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. Charming boutique hotel, Venitian style. Breakfasts cooked as you waited by the owner. Brilliant. The staff were all brilliant and we had great advice on lunch and dinner spots, really enjoyed Da Mamo retaurant that they advised.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare
