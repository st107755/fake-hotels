Perfect place to stay. Venice was beautiful at this time of year and we were especially lucky with the weather - brilliant sunshine every day! Matteo & his team were the usual excellent hosts and after our 4 night stay I felt we had completely unwound and relaxed. We stayed in one of the suites with an amazing view of the canal and it was definitely worth paying that little bit more. The only bad point - we had to leave!Read moreDate of stay: February 2008HelpfulShare
