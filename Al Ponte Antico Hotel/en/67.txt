On a scale of 1 to 10, the Al Ponte Antico Hotel in Venice is an 11! As the majority of reviews have mentioned, the staff at this gem of a hotel is top notch. Barbara, Oliver, Igor, Gigi, Alex and Rosalba went out of their way to make our 2-night stay memorable and enjoyable. In addition to the incredibly personable and gracious staff, the hotel boasts an ideal location, authentic decor, delicious breakfasts including made-to-order omelettes, large/amazing bathroom (rainforest shower!) and stunning views of the Rialto Bridge from the terrace. My husband and I are very picky and highly recommend this hotel. If you are lucky enough to stay at this very special place, book it without reservation!Read moreDate of stay: June 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
