From your first step onto the hotel's private dock on the grand canal and being greeted by the staff...you know you've made the only choice for a hotel stay in Venice.  Mateo and staff are always there for you, if needed.  Starting your day with a breakfast of full American favorites cooked to order, to the convenience of the tourist, shopping and local spots.  Also during the day at your return to the hotel for an afternoon break there is staff to make you a cappuccino/espresso from a work-of-art copper machine enjoyed on a terrace overlooking the grand canal.  To coming back to the hotel and it's always open honor bar.  Just look at the pictures.  Love Venice and the home - away- from home we found.  Thank you Mateo and family.... The Chins, sorry it took so long to write. .â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
