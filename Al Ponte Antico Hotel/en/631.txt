We spent 2 nights with our 2 teenager daughters , 2 separate rooms. We were warmly welcomed by Matteo ,the owner ,and his staff Alexander and Oliviero. You just feel special to them. The room with Gran Canal view is stunning, venetian style, very high ceiling, and beautiful terrace on the Rialto bridge, the pictures shown on their website is real ! The bathroom is small  but well fitted except maybe for a shelf or a little chest of drawers and a magnifier mirror. Breakfast freshly cooked on demand by Matteo, eaten on the terrace facing the Rialto and the water, what a lively show ! Everything was made to make our stay  in Venice wonderful , all the staff seemed to really want to please you, excellent tips for restaurants ,excursions, taxi boats etc... We'll be back if we canâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
