This hotel is just wonderful.  Not only is it situated in the perfect location with a view to die for from the terrace, but the warmth of the welcome you receive makes it utterly perfect.  Mateo and his team ensure that you have the experience of a lifetime from the moment of arrival until the second you check out.  There is nothing at all to fault here and I recommend it whole-heartedly - just go, and leave the rest to Mateo, Oliver and the others.  You will not regret it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
