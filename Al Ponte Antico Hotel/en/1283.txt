Well, what can i say??  This hotel was fabulous. I have never written a review before, but this hotel deserves it. We had a deluxe room overlooking the river, which was large, clean and beautiful. The wonderful terrace was the highlight of our whole trip. The location is superb. Matteo and his staff are a delight. We will return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
