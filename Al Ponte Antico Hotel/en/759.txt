I just want to reiterate the excellent comments of others, the service at this hotel is amazing, and nothing is too much trouble. Our room overlooked the Grand Canal, which was wonderful in the spring sunshine. I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on our return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
