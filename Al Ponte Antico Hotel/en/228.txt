We stayed in the suites as there were 6 of us.  Before arriving, we were worried that the rooms would be cold and drafty being on the ground floor so close to the water, but that was not an issue at all.  The rooms were very spacious while feeling cozy and comfortable.  It was very nice.  We loved the ride in the water taxi from the train station to the hotel.  It's so romantic to arrive via water taxi.  I echo all the positive things everyone else already said about the hotel.  We were greeted by Matteo.  What a treat to meet the owner of the boutique hotel and listen to his passionate story about the hotel renovation.  We loved our stay. Thank you everyone for making this such an unforgettable experience.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare
