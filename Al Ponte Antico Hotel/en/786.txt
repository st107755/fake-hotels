It's true!  Just as many reviewers have indicated - this is a gem.  The staff is amazing.  They know your name when you arrive and great you by name the entire stay.  Fantastic location.  Walking distance to many attractions, shops, and restaurants.  We enjoyed breakfast and evening drinks in the fabulous balcony overlooking the canal and Rialto bridge.  Wish we could have stayed longer!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
