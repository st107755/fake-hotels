We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel for 2 nights in July 2007.  The location of the hotel cannot be beat - they have a lovely patio that sits directly above the Grand Canal.  It is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast or a drink.  The rooms were comfortable, clean and modern.    The true draw to this hotel, however, is the owner and his staff.  Matteo loves the city of Venice and wants all of his guests to enjoy the city as much as he does.  The staff were always ready to assist with a dinner reservation, directions or even an umbrella.  Matteo personally cooked our breakfast and made sure he was present for our arrival and departure.  This hotel is all about the people and experiencing Venice the way it should be with the help of locals who love the city!!!!  Dave & Kimâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2007HelpfulShare
