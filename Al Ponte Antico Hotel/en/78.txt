My husband and I had a wonderful time at this warm and beautiful 14th century palace with all modern conveniences. The location is perfect - so close to the Rialto Bridge and on the Grand Canal for infinite watching of the boats and scene changing. The staff all had infinite patience for our repeated questions and could not have been more warm and welcoming. Thanks to Alex, Gigi, Igor, Oliver and Tomas,  and to Barbara for wonderful, made-to-order breakfasts. If we return to Venice we would never consider any other place for our home in Venice.
