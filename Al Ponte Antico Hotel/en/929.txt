We stayed here on the last day of our honeymoon and it was AMAZING. The owner and his staff were by far the friendliest and most accommodating hotel staff we have ever met. I felt like I was in a 5 star hotel. The owner upgraded our room because of our honeymoon and provided us with a bottle of NICE champagne. He helped us with our travel plans for the next day. I think the view and the decor really made the atmosphere so romantic. But THE BEST PART was the industrial air conditioning in the room. After waling around all day in the hot summer heat, coming back to the room was just like paradise! We didn't even bother going out to eat, we had the best view outside our window.  This hotel deserves its rating and very  much worth the money.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
