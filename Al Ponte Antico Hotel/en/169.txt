We were on our 30th anniversary trip and this small boutique hotel was wonderful!! Great location right on the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. There is a beautiful terrace that is right on the canal that we spent breakfasts and drinks and nightcap on every day! I think we had the smallest room which was very charming but did not have a view. The owner Mattel was so great!! He is also the breakfast chef and is really good. The hotel has 9 rooms so everyone who works there knows your name. Everyone was just so kind and helpful. We totally enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay there again if we are ever lucky enough to go back!$Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
