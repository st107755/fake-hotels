We stayed here for our anniversary, and it was beyond our expectations. The staff were outstanding, the best service we have ever encountered, and the best breakfasts in the world. The cappucinos, homemade crepes and omelettes made by Rosalba, Oliver and staff were so good. From the restaurant suggestions to directions, Oliver, David and Armando were more than helpful. We were treated to the most spectacular view of the Grand Canal in our beautiful room , and spent many an hour sitting at our open window watching all the gondolas and boats go right past us and under the Rialto bridge. Do yourself a favour and stay at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
