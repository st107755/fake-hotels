This beautiful little 14th century Venetian palazzo has to be one of our favourite hotels.  We have travelled around the world both on business and on holiday and have never received such personal, attentive and friendly service.  There are only nine rooms which have been beautifully and lovingly resorted by Matteo, the owner.  He and his wonderful staff could not have done more to make our stay truly exceptional and the location and terrace right on the Grand Canal overlooking the Rialto bridge are outstanding.  We loved our holiday there and would not want to stay anywhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
