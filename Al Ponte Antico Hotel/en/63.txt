This is a truly remarkable boutique hotel run by the Peruch Family.  There are only 9 rooms, so if it's available, book it!  Even prior to our arrival, they reached out to ensure a truly first class experience.    The staff are all gems!  From Barbara (the owner of the hotel) to Alex, Gigi, Oliver, and Rosalba they all knew our name, and truly went above and beyond to ensure that this was an unforgettable stay for our family.  The personalized service was really unique, and we felt very privileged to enjoy it.  They made us feel so incredibly at home!    The views are simply divine, and the best in Venice with wonderful views of the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge.  The location is perfect, and in walking distance to literally everything!  Thank you for making this trip anâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
