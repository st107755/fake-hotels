We planned on saving the best hotel for last on our trip and we planned well! If you are not looking for the most modern, but the most Venecian stay, with great service and a view of the Grand Canal at your disposal, stay here! Thanks Armondo, David, and the staff for your hospitality.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
