Firstly we have to say Hi and and a big Grazei to Matteo and the amazing staff at Al Ponte Antico who made our stay with them very special for us and our friends as they do with all their guests. We stayed for 4 nights in this boutique hotel where everything was thought of by the staff to make our stay perfect.  Great location, typical Venetian and spacious rooms with comfortable bed and beautiful quality linnen. The shower in the bathroom was very low and hard for my husband to fit under but hey, it's Venice and the rest of the bathroom was ample room.  Great breakfast buffet on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal with a view of Rialto Bridge.  We would go back to Venice just to stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
