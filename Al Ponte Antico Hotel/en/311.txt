We spent two nights at this hotel in mid-June as part of a 25th anniversary getaway.  The service was incredible, the rooms were comfortable, and the location was excellent.  This hotel's veranda, which overlooks the Rialto bridge was open at all times for relaxing and watching the parade of life down the grand canal.  Bruno, Oliver, Alex and the other staff members were very hospitable and friendly.  We had a truly wonderful time.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
