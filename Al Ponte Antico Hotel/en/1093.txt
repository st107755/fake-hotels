Excellent location and personal service.  We loved having breakfast on the terrace with its beautiful view of the Rialto bridge and grand canal.  I would definitely recommend this lovely hotel.  The owner and his staff are so helpful and patient.  They will make you feel like a personal friend!   My only challenge -- and it was my fault for not being prepared -- were with the mosquitoes at night.  I came home with lots of bites.  It's not the hotel...just Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
