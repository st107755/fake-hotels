Absolutely terrific Hotel. Matteo and his team do an excellent job. They were on point with activity timing and recommendations. Water taxi arrival and departure were lovely.  The breakfast options are too numerous to list. All are delicious believe me ..... I tried them all. LOL. The Terrace looking on the canal is the BEST. There is no better breakfast, pre-dinner cocktail and nightcap spot in Venice. Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
