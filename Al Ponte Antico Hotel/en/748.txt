My husband and I just got back from 2 weeks in Italy and 3 nights in Venice staying at the Al Ponte Antico hotel.  Our stay at this charming hotel was by far the most memorable as we received such amazing personal attention and customer service from all of the staff and the owner Marcel.  The hotel is in a great location next to the Rialto bridge and is one of the few in the city to have a terrace.  We received excellent restaurant recommendations and they were incredibly helpful with all of our needs and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.  We will definitely stay with them again the next time we visit Venice and I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a small luxury hotel experience in a great location with personal attention from a caring staff. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
