One of the most happiest ever stays at this Beautiful Hotel in Venice. The staff are amazing and the Owners, Matteo and his wife Rosalba are genuinely the best hosts ever. Extraordinarily the staff meet your every needs and make this hotel stand out from any other. Superb recommendations on where to eat, what to do, how to get there.  A terrific view of the Rialto bridge, gondolas and Grand Canal are enjoyed  from the Balcony with Heaters drinking a bottle of Prosecco . Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.
