This was our second visit to the hotel. Inevitably, after our first wonderful stay in March, we had very high expectations. The hotel and all its staff did not disappoint: it is just a perfect way to visit Venice. Watching the sun go down (even in November!) over the Rialto Bridge from the terrace of the hotel is a wonderful way to end the day. With all the other great reviews of this hotel, it is difficult to find anything more to say. If you are looking for a perfect stay in a truly characterful hotel, then this is your place.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
