Our room was right on The Grand Canal and it was perfection.  One can just sit back and watch the world go by.  We loved the breakfast room and eating on the balcony watching Venice wake up to UPS and other assorted delivery boats.  The balcony was equally captivating at night sipping Bellinis and watching the gondolas.  The hotel is atmospheric and you truly are surrounded by Venice.  I can't wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
