Started our trip here and it couldn't have been better!  The location on the Grand Canal very near Rialto Bridge is the best.  Grab a bottle of wine, sit on the balcony in the evening and watch the gondolas and boats on the Grand Canal...magical!  Matteo and the whole team made our stay extra special with their lovely welcome, tremendous hospitality and terrific service!  Just wish we had been there longer...guess there is always next time!Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
