Upon arrival by our private water taxi and being greeted by Matteo at the hotel dock, we knew that Al Ponte Antico would be a memorable experience!  The hotel and location are both breathtaking and surreal -- we felt like we had stepped into a set of a movie.    After a day of sightseeing, my husband and I enjoyed relaxing on the terrace, sipping prosecco, and watching the gondolas and boats along the Grand Canal.   Thank you Matteo and Alex for making us feel so welcome.  I dream of returning to Venice and Al Ponte Antico!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
