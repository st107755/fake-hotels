Imagine being treated like family from the moment you arrive, having the most glorious view of Venice and enjoying wonderful breakfasts on the best balcony terrace you can find.  That was our experience at Ponte Antico.  Thanks so much to Matteo, Rosa Alba, Oliver, David and Thomas, you made us feel special and cared for from the first moment to the last.   I stay in around 50 hotels per year with my work, but have never enjoyed such personal service and care. With just 9 rooms the team get to know you, what you like to drink in the morning etc  If you can possibly get it, go for the Junior Suite overlooking the canal, the view is to die for. This was our first weekend away from our son in two years and we feel like we've been away for weeks.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
