My wife & I stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel for 4 days last week.  We parked our car at the airport long term parking lot #4 & took a water taxi (110euro) directly to the hotel's quay on the Grand Canal, a stones throw from the Rialto bridge.  It was very convenient & an excellent way to see the city from the lagoon.  The hotel is a magical place,  I have never met a staff so attentive, friendly and wanting to please!  At the end of a long day sightseeing, it was like coming home to our extended family.  All of the reviews were spot on, this is truly a one of a kind hotel, it was hard to leave.  I would highly recommend this hotel!  Thanks to Matteo & his staff for a great experience.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
