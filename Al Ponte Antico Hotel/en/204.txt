When booking our Venice trip we wanted to have the full Venetian experience and this small (9 room) hotel ticked all the boxes.  The hotel booked us a private water taxi and arriving at the hotel by its own waterside entrance on the Grand Canal feels just so special.  We stayed in the Deluxe Room which had amazing Grand Canal views and was really spacious and felt more like a suite.  The breakfast area/bar is just spectacular and has the most amazing terrace with full view of the Rialto Bridge. The owner Matteo and all the staff are absolutely wonderful and always address you by your first name so the service always feels incredibly personal and warm.  If you want to do Venice properly then you really must stay at this gorgeous hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
