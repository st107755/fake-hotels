We stayed at this hotel 3 nights during the later part of February.  Matteo and his staff allowed us to feel as if we were staying in a private home.  All employees were kind, gracious and welcoming.  Alex and Katerina in particular made our stay comfortable with their thoughtful service.  The all inclusive breakfast and personal service included home made pastries and local, farm raised eggs.  The structural idiosyncrasies of a historically remodeled building (i.e., low bathroom shower and ceiling) were more than offset by the terrace overlooking the Rialto bridge, charm and warmth of the staff.Read moreDate of stay: February 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
