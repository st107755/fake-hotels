We spent two nights here after a 12 day cruise. We were greeted upon arrival by water taxi by Matteo. He introduced himself and called us by our names as did everyone. We never handled moving our luggage. A special thanks to Rosaldo for taking care of us for breakfast and Matteo's handcrafted omelets with his secret mix of herbs. Alex provided excellent restaurant recommendations and Oliver was kind and most accommodating. If you are fortunate enough to get a reservation here I cannot give a high enough score that this Hotel deserves. Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
