My girlfriend and I stayed here, and it was a very pleasant experience. The hosts, including the owner, are extremely helpful and always willing to offer suggestions. They do not push anything on you and worked with us to find restaurants/ activities that would be the most memorable. The view from the terrace is amazing and overlooks the Rialto Bridge. Having a glass of wine there as the sun went down was a perfect end to a long day of exploring. The breakfast was delightful as well and can be enjoyed on the terrace. Yes, the hotel is expensive but overall the experience was amazing and I would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
