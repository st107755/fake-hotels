Want to feel like Venetian royalty?  Stay at Al Ponte Antico and allow Matteo, Alex, Oliver and the rest of the staff treat you.  This is probably the nicest, warmest, kindest hotel where we've stayed.  They provided on point restaurant recommendations and reservations.  The terrace is beautiful, the perfect spot for a late afternoon apertivo.  Thank you so much Matteo and staff!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
