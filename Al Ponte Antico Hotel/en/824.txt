This is the best hotel to stay in Venice. Enjoy breakfast on the balcony and watch the movement on the Grand Canal. Add a day just to sit there from morning to night with coffee (best coffee machine in Venice) or have a good glass (several) of Italian wine at night Go out in the day for meals. Go to bed after midnight. Wonderful staff -  like staying with friends. Try it you will not regret it. There are not enough stars to describe Matteo and staff.
