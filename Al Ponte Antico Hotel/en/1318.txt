We stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Antico for 2 nights at the begininng of October prior to a cruise. We had a junior suite on the first floor. The room was huge with a magnificent view of the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. In the afternoon we would open the large windows and sit watching the Venetian world go by.  Matteo and his staff treat you as if you are family from the instant you arrive. Everyone is on a first name basis and every detail is thought of.  The location is convenient to everyplace in Venice.   Everything that has been said by other reviewers about breakfast on the terrace being  wonderful is absolutely true.  We have already booked the same room for our visit to Venice next year! I can't think of a better recommendation than that.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
