From the moment we were welcomed off the water taxi at the hotel's own private landing station, we were made to feel very special by Mateos, the owner and the staff at the hotel. They took time to get to know us as friends and throughout the weekend gave us really helpful, unbiased advice about everything we asked. Had a great weekend and would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to other travellers. We have never been to Venice before and, often, places do not meet your expectations. This could not be further from the truth for Venice and Hotel Al Ponte Antico. Venice surpassed expectations and I can't think of anywhere better to stay that at Hotel Al Ponte Antico. The only one slight negative I can mention was that we stayed in a Classic room which was smaller than we expected.Read moreDate of stay: March 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
