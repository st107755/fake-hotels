We stayed at this lovely traditional hotel for 3 nights in September and had a fabulous time. We arrived by water taxi and was greeted by the owner Matteo. The hotel is situatied right on the Grand Canal by the Rialto Bridge and has a terrace overlooking the canal, which is ideal to eat your breakfast or just have a drink. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was large,comfortable and very quiet.  We would have no hesitation to recommend this hotel to anyone who likes personal service.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
