We recently stayed for six nights at the hotel. Everything worked out as described by Tripadvisor: smooth transport by watertaxi (pricey, but what isn't in Venice?), wonderful first impressions on arrival, as our luggage was whisked to our room. From then onwards everything went like a dream: a nice breakfast with eggs cooked to my specifications, restaurants booked, all our cares  looked after in the nicest and politest possible manner. On my wife's birthday a bunch of  beautiful flowers was organized; and a bottle of prosecco, together with rose petals and a card, materialized! And everyone congratulated my wife. In the course of forty years' travelling, one of our best hotel experiences. Impeccable standards of excellence.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
