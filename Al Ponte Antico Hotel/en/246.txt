We were celebrating our Golden Wedding Anniversary with a stay in Venice and then an Adriatic and Mediterranean cruise. We wanted to stay in a hotel overlooking the Grand Canal. This hotel was perfect or "perfecto"!  From the moment we stepped out of our private speedboat we felt like celebrities!  We sat on the terrace with a glass of wine while we waited for our room to be available and that table seemed like ours for our 2 night stay - breakfast and evening we enjoyed fantastic views of the Rialto Bridge and the Canal. Thank you Matteo and all your staff for making this one of the highlights of our special celebration holiday.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
