The location was close to all the best shops and restaurants.  Best of all it had a beautiful view of the Rialto bridge from the terrace.  Its an old palazzo that is steeped in history. It has been beautifully renovated and gives you a sense of traveling back in time.  The hotel is immaculately clean, very comfortable, very well equipped with all modern amenities. The staff were magnificent - very helpful, warm, and attentive. The room was ultra comfortable, very quiet and excellently equipped. It has its own private dock so we were able to get a complimentary water taxi to Murano.  I definitely would stay here again in future visits.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
