We spent four nights at this wonderful hotel in October and it was a dream come true.  The service is outstanding, the staff is wonderful and the accommodations were better than we could ever expect. The breakfast buffett was the best we had on our month long trip to Europe and we stayed at many nice hotels.  The owners and staff treated us like long lost friends and anticipated our every need.  Venice was a major bucket list item for my husband and it couldn't have been more satisfying.  Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the canal was spectacular.  We felt as if we were Audrey Hepburn and Carey Grant on holiday from Hollywood.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
