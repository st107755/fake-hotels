Wonderful friendly service, outstanding position and no words to describe the view. Just sitting on the balcony makes one feel immersed in daily Venice life. And inside takes one back to the splendor of an old Venetian palace. The staff cannot do enough to make your stay with them as pleasant as possible. Can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
