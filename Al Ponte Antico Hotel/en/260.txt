Everything about this hotel was perfect.  It was small with only a few rooms.  It is in a perfect spot in Venice adjacent to the Rialto Bridge which can be seen from the hotel.  I was greeted at their private dock on the Grand Canal by the owner.  Everyone knew our names and greeted us at every opportunity.  The bar area, outside patio overlooking the Grand Canal, and especially our junior suite with windows that opened directly over the water were all spectacular.  If you can get a reservation here, which is tough, I highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
