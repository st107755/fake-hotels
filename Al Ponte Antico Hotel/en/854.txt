We stayed at Al Ponte Antico after a 12 night mediterranean cruise. What a special place, we were warmly greeted by name & taken to the terrace for a coffee as our room was not ready  yet. This hotel was my favourite spot in Venice, so beautiful to sit on the terrace overlooking the grand canal & watch the workings of Venice. We did this for breakfast & after dinner having a drink. Our room was lovely, we did not have a canal view but would not complain, huge bathroom & perfectly air conditioned. Thank you to Matteo, you are an impeccable host and your staff are so warm & friendly. Thank you to Oliver, Alex & Rosa for all your help & advise. Pricey but worth every cent! When I come back to Venice,this is where I would stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
