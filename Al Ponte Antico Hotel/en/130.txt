Not easy to find -- down a narrow alley from a chocolate store - but once you get there - lovely d√©cor, friendly staff, a engaging owner who makes breakfast everyday and a view of the Grand Canal from the terrace (for drinks/breakfast) that is one of the great experiences of life (ie does not get better than this) ... our room had no window, but we did not care - comfortable and with a modern, well equipped bathroom -- would stay again -- just a wonderful small hotel with wonderful staff.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
