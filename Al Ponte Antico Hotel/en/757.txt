Al Ponte Antico sits on the grand canal with a view  a 5 star view of the Rialto bridge. We were so graciously upgraded to a grand canal view room, that despite the location was quiet and peaceful.  The hotel is a work of art that is as lovely as the beauty of Venice.  The best expresso in Italy! Even if it was an ok lodging, I would go back just for the expresso.....but the breakfast was as good as the coffee.  You are greeted by name every time by various staff members that graciously help you navigate their city.  The hotel is so beautiful with huge Murano glass chandeliers, rooms  are wallpapered with brocade fabric, and my husband claims they serve a 'mean' limoncello which I am sure tasted even better with a view of the Ponte RialtoRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
