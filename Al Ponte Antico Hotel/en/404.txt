Our traveling companions had stayed with Mateo previously and insisted on going back to the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. Wow, were they right! The staff is expertly trained and very focused on providing exceptional service to all guests. They could not be more friendly, helpful or accommodating. The breakfast service is very extensive and the food is delicious. The deck overlooking the Rialto Bridge and the Grand Canal is a wonderful place to enjoy a cocktail.   Everyone comments on the location of this hotel. But you must understand that while it is in a great location convenient to all attractions, it is also about 50 feet down a small walkway from the main street. Thus, it is also very quiet. We would absolutely stay here again. It was just a wonderful experience.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
