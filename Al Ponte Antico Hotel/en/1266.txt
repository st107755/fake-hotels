Echoing everything said before. I have never been anywhere before where staff were so attentive and genuinely interested in making the stay as perfect as possible. From restaurant choices to what to do (and not do!) all of the advice was to help us get the most out of our stay. Matteo is such a gracious and witty host. The view is just stunning. We spent 3 hours on the terrace just watching the canal. It is amazing to see it in the different lights as night falls. Breakfast is fantastic. The eggs from Matteo's grandmother's farm are best I've tasted and the coffee machine has to be seen to be believed. All in all it was a perfect stay and I don't hesitate in recommending it to others. We will be back to Venice and there is only one place we will stayRead moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
