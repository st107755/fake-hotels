I visited Hotel Al Ponte Antico in July 2007 with my husband and family. We arrived to a warm welcome, comfortable well appointed roomsand a level of service seldomly seen in large hotels.  They gave us great advice on where to eat, organising bookings on our behalf.  This family run Hotel and their staff truly understand the needs of travellers and go the extra distance to give you a great experience.   Highly recommended for families.
