We came to Venice to celebrate our honeymoon. We could not have picked a better hotel. The staff was absolutely amazing, very welcoming and helpful. The location is great as the hotel is located at the centre of Venice and transport from there is also very easy to find. Breakfast was to die for and the rooms very spacious and traditional. We will definitely go back when we decide to visit Venice again.thank you for having us!  Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
