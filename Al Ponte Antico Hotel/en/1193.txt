I read the Trip Advisors Top Hotels in Italy and Al Ponte Antico was rated #1. I can't tell you what a great place this is but more importantly how comfortable everyone makes you feel.  From the first day you will feel as if you have known everyone for years. Ive been to Venice enough times to appreciate the different areas. This hotel has a great location just in Cannaregio where you can avoid the big hustle and bustle that occurs when youre near Piazza San Marco.Upon my return to Venice ......I wouldnt think of using another hotel or B&B...unless its their other guesthouse named Locanda Orseolo.
