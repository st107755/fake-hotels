Out of all the Hotels I have stayed at - this place has the best customer service - hands down! They greet you by your name. They are available 24x7, they are very attentive, understanding, and are such gracious people. This is a small beautiful boutique hotel in a great location. There is a terrace where you can sit and just enjoy the view of the canal and the Rialto bridge, or sit and enjoy a cappuccino and their wonderful breakfast spread. I am now hooked on blood orange juice!   The hotel was a 14th century palace- it has great character, the rooms are nicely decorated, and the main dining/greeting room is classy.   We will defiantly return again, and I highly recommend this place!   Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
