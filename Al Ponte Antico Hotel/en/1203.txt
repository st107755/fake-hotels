This family of hotel keepers (they also own Locanda Orseolo near San Marco) are passionate about service.  This family and their staff are incredible...We were blocked in Venice with the snow storms and we just had a great time because we felt at home with Matteo,Barbara, Rosalba etc...I forgot a couple of names but they were all extremely friendly. Both hotels are very nice (we stayed at both) and breakfast is marvellous. They will make you feel like you were part of their family...and yes, you will meet the whole family :) There is only one comment appropriate for these hotels...WE WILL BE BACKRead moreDate of stay: December 2009HelpfulShare
