My wife and I just spent 3 days in this beautiful hotel. From the moment we pulled up to the hotel we were made to feel Incredibly welcome, the staff knew us by name and their pride in the hotel is clear and understandable. It is classically Venetian, quiet, well positioned and the terrace overlooking the grand canal is, in my opinion, the best place in Venice to enjoy a Bellini (which I think is better than those served by Harry's Bar). I can't recommend this hotel strongly enough and I can't wait to go back. Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
