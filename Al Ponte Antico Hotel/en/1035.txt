This hotel was a great find on TripAdvisor. We arrived on foot and the directions given to us were excellent. Oliver and Matteo welcomed us to the hotel and we had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal. Oliver helped us with our sightseeing and gave us great suggestions for restaurants. We enjoyed having a drink with a snack in the afternoon on the terrace watching the busy canal. Our room was very large with high ceilings. The breakfasts were great with a crepe or eggs cooked to order. Look forward to returning sometime in the future.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
