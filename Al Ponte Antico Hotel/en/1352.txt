It's hard to think of anything to add since all the other glowing reviews say it all. I can only say that yes, they are all true and yes, it really is that good! The location is fantastic and that terrace on the grand canal a real gem. People going by on the vaporetti were looking at us and pointing as it really is unique to have a terrace on the canal and right by the rialto bridge as well. It is the most fantasic spot in Venice to have breakfast, a coffee, an aperitif or nightcap. The bulding is renovated beautifully in traditional Venetian style with gorgeous fabrics, glass and frescoes. The staff are great. - more like staying with friends than hotel staff. It was fantastic to arrive by private water taxi as it drops you off right in the hotel - expensive but worth it forâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
