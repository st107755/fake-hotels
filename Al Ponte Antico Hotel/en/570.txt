We stayed in a suite on the ground floor, facing the Grand Canal.  You couldn't beat the view! Fitted all 4 of the family in with no problem. Lovely welcome from the staff, who were helpful & friendly and gave good recommendations for restaurants. Breakfast room is full of character, and eating on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is fabulous. Try the homemade pastries!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
