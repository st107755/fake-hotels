This is a tiny hotel on the Grand Canal just near the Rialto Bridge. The terrace is gorgeous in the morning light while you have an omelette or crepe or in the evening when you are enjoying an Aperol spritz after a day of touring. The staff is extremely helpful and suggested walking tours and good restaurants. Some rooms look over the interior streets so be sure to ask for a canal view if you want that.
