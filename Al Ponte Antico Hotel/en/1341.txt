Having booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor I was confident the hotel would be what we were looking for.  The many great reviews still do not do this hotel justice.  The hotel is beautiful and charming, location is fantastic and the service is absolutely impeccable.  Having stayed in many hotels in Europe I have never experienced service and hospitality as that at the Al Ponte Antico. I could not recommend this hotel enough, with only nine rooms you are looked upon as individuals, not room numbers.  The staff are so friendly, I guarantee you will not get a hotel experience like this anywhere.  Don't stay anywhere else, this hotel is simply The Best.Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
