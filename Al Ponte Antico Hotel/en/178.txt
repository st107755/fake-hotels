This was our third stay in Venice and our first at Al Ponte Antico Hotel.  We will be back!  The service by Mateo and his staff are really second to none.  The location near the Rialto is also perfect.  If you're ever lost in Venice (and trust me...you will be at some point), the Rialto signs are everywhere and you can always find your way back to this little gem of a hotel.  The breakfast was superb with fresh cooked to order eggs and omelettes by Mateo, and homemade pastries by his wife.  There is something for everyone.  Rosalba was a true gem serving up fresh cappuccino and making sure we had everything we wanted/needed.  Every employee at this location was superb.  If you want to be pampered and stay in a perfect location, then I urge you to book here.  You won't regret it!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
