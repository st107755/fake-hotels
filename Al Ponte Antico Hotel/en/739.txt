I highly recommend this hotel. It is well-located, with views of the Rialto Bridge (if you pick the right room). We stayed on the ground floor overlooking the Grand Canal, and these are by far the largest and best two rooms in the hotel. The staff are extremely welcoming and treat guests with amazing respect. No staff member remained seated if we spoke to them at reception, they would always stand. Breakfast was always exceptional out on the beautiful terrace as you watch the world go by. The terrace was also a great place for a drink late (very late) at night. The hotel caters for arrivals in the wee hours of the morning as well with a welcoming drink on the terrace and dinner if required.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
