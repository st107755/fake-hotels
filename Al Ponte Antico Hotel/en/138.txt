My third trip to Venice, my sister's first, for two nights prior to boarding on a cruise.  I spotted this and took a look at the reviews.  Normally I take a look at hotel reviews, eliminate the extreme best and extreme worst and figure the truth is in the middle.  However, I had never before seen such glowing reviews without a negative word.  It's a small hotel, so I booked it early.  From the first, my dealings with Al Ponte Antico were amazing.  At once an email confirmation, personalized, and offering any assistance we needed in arranging transportation to the hotel from the airport.  They continued to be amazing as I had to change the reservation a few times due to changes in flight schedule and the addition of a second room for a friend who also decided to cruise with us. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
