Love this hotel! Right on the Grand Canal, a water taxi drops you right at the "doorstep" and the hotel staff greets you. From then on you are greeted by name by every staff member who introduces themselves, you are pampered for anything you want and you have one of the best possible locations for exploring Venice.  This hotel was the home of wealthy venice merchants who spared no expense. The ceilings are original and marvelous, but the hotel has all modern accomdations including the important hot water and a comfortable bed.  Beware there is no elevantor so everyone must go up/down one flight of stairs.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
