This is a small but truly wonderful "palace" hotel within a stones throw of the Rialto bridge on the Grand Canal, you could not wish for a better location.  The owner and all the staff are absolutely fabulous, it was our second time back and I am almost not wanting to rave about this place in case it gets booked out for our next visit to Venice. It serves a lovely breakfast but no meals, this does not matter as you are surrounded by dozen's of good restaurants. it is a boutique with only approx. 12 rooms. Just perfect and well worth the spend. The terrace is just perfect for a beer and for watching the amazing activity on the Grand canal etc.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
