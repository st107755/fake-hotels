We chose this hotel for our 5-night stay based on T.A. ratings and the photos on the hotel  website and we were so glad we did! Staying in this elegant little 9 room "palazzo" was a memorable experience. Our suite (#108) was huge and comfortable and the view of the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge were spectacular. Mateo's staff was the best we've ever seen -- anywhere. We could have lingered all day enjoying the huge breakfast in the elegant breakfast room, but there were way too many sights to see, all just a short walk or a quick vaporetto ride away from this terrific location. We will definitely return!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
