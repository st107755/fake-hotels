We were only in Venice for one night and were celebrating our 5th anniversary. Matteo and his amazing staff made our stay so memorable and special. From the perfect location to the private water taxi dock to the beautiful breakfast (a rare find in Italy!) I have nothing but praises for this place! Thank you Matteo for our special night in your hotel - we hope to come back someday for a longer stay!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
