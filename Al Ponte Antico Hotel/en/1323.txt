We had 1 night at the Al Ponte Antico, and the only complaint was that it was not long enough. Even though the weather was terrible, it did not spoil our time in Venice. The room we had was huge for Venice (or Europe for that matter). Mattheo & staff were warm & welcoming. The recommedation for dinner was also very good, and we recommended it to some friends as well. The best Sea Bass ever, according to my husband. The coffee at Al Pnte was excellent-it took 3 weeks before I found another decent cup! Location cannot be faulted. Just can't wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare
