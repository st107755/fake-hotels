I had booked this hotel after reading all the reviews on TA.  Even though I have discount travel priveleges at other properties this was just to interesting to pass up.  What a great decision this turned out to be and worth the $$.  Booked room 101 about 9 months out.  Arrived Oct. 4th and decided to pony up for the private water taxi from airport to hotel.  Friends, this is money well spent! In my opinion you can skip the gondola if you like.  After traveling all night to arrive into Venice the transfer was spectacular and brought tears to my eyes.  2 people, 5 pieces of luggage, believe me you don't want to struggle at this point.  The hotel has a private pier right on the grand canal.  BIG LESSON here- You will be able to access this if the water rises.
