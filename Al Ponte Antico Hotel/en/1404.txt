Magnificent!  My wife and I stayed for several days in May.  Our room was beautifully decorated and very spacious. Breakfast had all the usual European foods, but with delicious 'made to order' omelettes!   Great location, right by the Rialto Bridge.  Every day we relaxed with drinks on the terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal.  BEAUTIFUL!  Matteo was the most incredible host, always helpful, friendly, with great recommendations for touring.  His restaurant recommendations were EXCELLENT!       I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again and I would love the opportunity. Read moreDate of stay: May 2007HelpfulShare
