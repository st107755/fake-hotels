We were lucky enough to stay at this hotel for my husband's 50th birthday.  Apart from its fantastic position near the Rialto Bridge, the main thing that makes this hotel stand out from the rest are the owners and the wonderful staff.  They really could not do enough for you.  From recommending the different areas of the city to explore and the best times to do it to explaining some of the history of the hotel.  When we come back to Venice, we shall definitely return to the Al Ponte Antico.  No other hotel will do!Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
