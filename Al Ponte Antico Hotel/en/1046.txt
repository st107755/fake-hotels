My husband and I spent a couple of nights here at the end of August. We arrived at the hotel by water taxi which was amazing. The hotel staff treated us like part of the family from the minute we arrived until we departed. Breakfast on the terrace was a great start to our day. In the afternoon we had spritzers and waved to the tourists on gondolas,water taxis and vaperettos. We enjoyed the company of other guests on the terrace late in the evening whilst having a night cap. Our room was grand, spacious and clean and looked onto the grand canal.We now have treasured memories of a fabulous trip to Venice and when we return we will definately stay at Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
