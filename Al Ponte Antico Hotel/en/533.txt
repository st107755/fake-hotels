Romantic, wonderful, service second to none! We have just returned from Venice after a three night stay in Al Ponte Antico- it is truly one of the best hotel experiences I have had- it is more than the room, the surroundings- it is the personality of the place thanks to Matteo and his team. We were greeted warmly and felt at home immediately- the staff recommendations on where to visit in Venice were excellent- the passion that they all have for their beautiful city is infectious- I know we will be back- the winter was a great time for a visit and now it simply means planning a return trip!
