My wife and I stayed at this wonderful hotel on the first stop of our European vacation. I can't say enough about the entire staff. I've travelled quite a bit and have never had such a positive experience at a hotel. Perfect location with a view of the canal and Rialto Bridge. Short walk to anywhere on the island. Their own dock for private water taxis. Highly recommend. Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
