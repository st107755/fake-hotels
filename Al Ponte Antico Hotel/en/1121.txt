The Hotel is exactly as described on the website. We had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal, it was perfect. Mattaeo and his staff were both extremely professional and friendly. Made to order eggs on the terrace for breakfast were a great way to start the day and a nightcap before bed the perfect way to end it. The hotel is easy to find and within walking distance from everthing. I would highy recommend Al Ponte Antico to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
