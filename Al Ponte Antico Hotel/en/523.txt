We arrived at the hotel via water taxi and greeted by a member from the hotel by name. All the hotel staff speak to you as if you were part of the family. They cannot do enough to help your stay or to make you feel comfortable.   The location is quite special. The terrace overlooks the Rialto bridge. Absolutely fantastic!! Very close to many lovely restaurants site of interest.   What a fantastic stay for our honeymoon. Would highly recommend.    Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
