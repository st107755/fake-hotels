Of our 17 days in Italy, this truly was our favorite hotel we stayed in.  Everything about it is just perfect!  Location is right on the Grand Canal with the most amazing view of the Rialto.  The rooms were large and decorated beautifully.  There is an amazing breakfast every morning.  Matteo (the owner) and the rest of the staff were fantastic.  They made us feel like royalty from the moment we arrived!  It was very hard saying goodbye to them 3 days later!  I can't recommend this hotel enough!  We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Venice!Read moreDate of stay: July 20097 SavesHelpfulShare
