This Hotel is a real find. You get the friendliest of welcomes from all the staff who are happy to help you with recommendations, directions and reservations. The rooms are decorated in venetian style, clean and comfy. We had breakfast on the terrace overlooking the grand canal and Rialto bridge every morning. Matteo the owner cooked us omelettes to order and the coffee is great too. The small number of rooms means service is attentive and the atmosphere is calm and relaxed. The location is perfect, being so central nowhere is too far to walk and the vaporetta stop is less than 5 minutes away. But once inside this intimate hotel you leave all the hustle and bustle behind! We love coming to Venice, this is our eighth trip and we have stayed in five other hotels over the yearsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
