A delightful boutique hotel almost next to the Rialto Bridge with sumptuous decoration and a wonderful terrace view of the comings and goings of the Grand Canal. Breakfast is pretty much what you'd expect with the usual mix of fruit, cereal cold meats, cheese and some hot options. Undoubtedly the best thing though was the people. I don't know how many staff they have (perhaps 10 or 12) but literally every one was both delightful and super friendly. They are a credit to Matteo, the hands on owner, who was himself the perfect host.Read moreDate of stay: December 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
