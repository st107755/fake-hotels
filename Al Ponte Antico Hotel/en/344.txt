There is only one place to stay in Venice and its at Al Ponte Antico with Matteo, Oliver, Alex and the rest of the amazing staff. Spent the last few days of our honeymoon in Venice, and as per a friends recommendation, stayed at Al Ponte Antico. Both my husband and I have traveled all over the world and can not compare any of the hotels to the this spot. The service was above and beyond, the location is so convenient and you can't go without mentioning the terrace which I could have sat on all day.   Simply put, this is the only place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
