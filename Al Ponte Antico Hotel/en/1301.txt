I've never really been one to worry about service at hotels too much, and been more concerned with rooms/location etc as always found it much of a muchness.  Quite frankly Al Ponte Antico has changed my opinion on this for ever now as it is only after service this good, that you appreciate how much of a difference it can make. From our welcome late at night from night porter Tomasso, through Rosa's magnificent breakfasts and Olivers dangerous late night "Spritz" the staff were so friendly and so helpful that they made every moment an absolute pleasure. Couple this with great rooms, reasonable prices (even with terrible pound to Euro!) a perfect central location and fantastic views across the Grand Canal, and it adds up to the fact that I can't reccomend this Hotel enough.Read moreDate of stay: February 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
