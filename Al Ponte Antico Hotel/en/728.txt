This was our second visit to the Al Ponte Antico hotel in Venice. Everything was perfect with our recent stay just like the previous trip.  Top service from a great staff and family who truly care about their guests.  There is nothing better than a made to order breakfast on their balcony overlooking the grand canal, just sitting and watching the boats drive by.  I could sit there all day. The food is fabulous, the rooms beautiful old Venetian charm, and the best location available. What else could anyone ask for?.  Matteo you have it all figured out, and know how to welcome a guest and keep them coming back. Thank you for a wonderful stay, love your staff as always !   Until our next trip to Italy.......Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
