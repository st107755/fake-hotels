Very good location. Near Rialto bridge. Excellent breakfast. Friendly staff. They call all their guests by their names with special attention. Depending on the room, it can be a dark one as the buildings are very close each other. This is very typical for Venice. Very nice stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
