My wife and I stayed here for one night in August and had a great stay. True, the service level offered is quite different to what we have come to expect elsewhere - its much more personal than usual. We were fine with this as on such a short trip recommendations for eateries was welcome and it was nice to feel that the staff took the trouble to know our names personally.  The hotel itself is beautiful - we feel that it was very authentic and nicely presented. Our room was not huge but was very well appointed and gave us a feel of a true Venetian room. Breakfast was lovely and all members of staff were very helpful.  Our overall view was that the hotel was stunning, well positioned for a water taxi and we were very well looked after by the staff. We will visit again for anotherâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
