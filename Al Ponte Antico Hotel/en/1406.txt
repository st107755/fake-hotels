Have just returned from a 3 night stay here and would readily recommend the hotel to everyone.  It is ideally located on the Grand Canal with fantastic views from the terrace, day and night (and your room if you're lucky to get the same one as we did).  Hotel transfers are usually tedious but if you travel by water taxi from the airport, the transfer to this hotel's private dock is a part of the Venetian experience not to be missed.  Despite the central location, our room was spacious and quiet.  Matteo is a refined and charming host whose command of English will, no doubt, put many of his future English-speaking visitors to shame!  Ben fatto and grazie to the whole team; I could have stayed for a month. Read moreDate of stay: June 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
