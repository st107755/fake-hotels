What a wonderful hotel. Service was great, staff are knowledgeable and kind. I had one of the best holiday ever at this hotel. Window opened onto the grand canal and I could watch the life of this city using the canal everyday. A wonderful terrace for watching and dining. Great service from all the staff and lots of interesting information on where to go to dine and how to avoid the crowds. Breakfast was cooked to your order whilst you sat on the terrace watching life on the canal. Attention to detail was unbelievable and perfect. To all at the Hotel - Thank you for making my visit to Venice such a great experienceRead moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
