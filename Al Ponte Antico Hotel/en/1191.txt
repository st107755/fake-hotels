I've never experienced such a friendly and charming atmosphere in any Hotel worldwide. Al Ponte Antico hotel is as genuine as the owner Matteo and his staff. The stay proved to be the best choice I could make to transform a quick visit to Venice into a lifetime memorable experience. Do not hesitate to book it, even if you stay for just one night you will feel like at home. Truly the best hotel in Venice, hands down.Read moreDate of stay: March 2010HelpfulShare
