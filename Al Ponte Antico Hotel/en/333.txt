We have just returned from a few days at this wonderful hotel.. the location is breathtaking.. the breakfast delightful and the view from the terrace is amazing.  The real other stand out was the team.. matteo the owner makes a special  effort wth each and every guest.. Alex provided us with the very best recommedations for food and always greeted us wth a smile and a warm welcome ... Oliver also with excellent history of Venice, super courteous chap.. Richard the night manager was a treat and great fun with his knowledge of Venice.. I feel trrrible as can't remember (I think rosa?) .. the beautiful lady who helped wth breakfast was always smiling and lovely and really looked afternoon us.. I shall miss my freshly cooked banana and chocolate crepes! Really couldn't faultâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
