Going to Venice you have fantasies of the beautifully decorated hotel suite with Venetian embroidery and old world elegance. Of waking up to a view of the morning rush on the Grand Canal. A breakfast that only royalty is used to. Of walking into an oasis of serenity styled by a Hollywood film crew. Of being waited on by a staff that seems geniunely wants you to have time of your life and will do any and everything to make sure your stay is beyond comparison.   If you have this fantasy then stay at the Al Ponte Antico. If don't - then try somewhere else.  I actually finally logged into tripadvisor to post a review about lthis hotel because it is truly remarkable. If you're reading this it means you're looking for the ultimate Venetian stay - look no further. It's better than anyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
