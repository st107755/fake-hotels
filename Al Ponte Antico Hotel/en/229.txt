We stayed in two rooms in December- the deluxe and the deluxe with a view of the canal. Both rooms were excellent-very clean and comfortable.  The hotel, an old palace, has been restored beautifully. The breakfasts were a true delight. The terrace was really a highlight. The location, near the Rialto Bridge, could not be beat. The service we received from the entire staff was truly exceptional. Everyone remembered our names. They went beyond our expectations in terms of providing professional and friendly recommendations for dinner, tours, etc.  I would highly recommend this hotel. It is worth the price.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare
