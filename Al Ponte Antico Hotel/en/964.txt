The hotel is very well located and the owners (2 brothers) are just very very helpfull and more; they'll talk to you for hours about Venice, restaurant, place to see, etc. The breakfast area is Magnifico. Rooms are nice, quite large in comparison to some other hotel I have been in Italy, spain, Ireland, Miami... The only complain was about the shower which did not always have pressure, we did not say anything, too busy discovering the city, up to the moment we were paying and they had a very nice gest by giving us a discount.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare
