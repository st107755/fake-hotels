Our third visit and probably should not be writing this as we don't want it to be too popular!! But Matteo, Alex, Oliver and Rosa deserve every bit of praise and thanks for another first class experience. Right next to the Rialto bridge, on the water but small and with tonnes of character, excellent service, great rooms and superb breakie. We will be back!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
