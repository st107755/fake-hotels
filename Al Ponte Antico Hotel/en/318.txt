We chose Al Ponte Antico for our honeymoon - and are so pleased we did! Matteo and his team are wonderful and very welcoming. You can tell they take pride in their work and want visitors to have an enjoyable time. The hotel is in an ideal location right near Rialto Bridge (which helps with getting around) and the 24/7 outside terrace over the Grand Canal is magical. We hope to return soon and will encourage our friends to stay there.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
