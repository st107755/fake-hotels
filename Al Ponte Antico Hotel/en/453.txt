We stayed at Al Ponte Antico for two nights. We absolutely loved this hotel! The customer service was the best I've had anywhere in the world. Matteo, Alex, Oliver, Thomas, Rosalba and the entire staff we're amazing. Everyone knew our names and went out of their way to make our stay amazing. Stay he is you are ever in Venice!
