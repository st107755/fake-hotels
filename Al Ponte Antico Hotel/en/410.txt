The hotel itself is lovely, the location is great, with a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal, which makes for some memorable moments. Matteo and the amazing team of staff he has assembled, made the stay particularly enjoyable; their hospitality and helpfulness are exceptional in a competitive industry.  A huge thank you to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
