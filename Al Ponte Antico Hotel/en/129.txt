Mateo, the owner, has created a wonderful small boutique hotel with the most amazing staff. These reviews do not lie.  We spent 3 days here pre-cruise and really did want to leave. The breakfast was so delicious. We began and ended every day on the balcony with the Rialto bridge as our backdrop....priceless. Alex,Thomas and Rosealba made our stay so memorable.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
