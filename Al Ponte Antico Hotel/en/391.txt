Celebrated my 60th Birthday in magnificent Venice staying at the magically beautiful Al Ponte Antico Hotel. Pictures on the website are very accurate but the wonder of sitting on the terrace watching the world on water go by is beyond description. The location is amazing in every possible way. Mateo,the owner, takes such pride in his hotel ,rightly so,and he and all his staff go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. The classic room even though it had no canal view was perfect as the terrace was always open and heated as desired. Wonderful experience, loved it .  Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
