This place is magical! It's a 14th century building with many original and beautiful features preserved and restored. Matthew and his staff are some of the absolute best in the business. Every employee knew our name before we arrived. They made us feel right at home - we wanted for nothing. The location is superb with views of the Rialto bridge from the terrace. Everything about the stay here was perfect. If you truly want to experience all of the romance and charm that Venice has to offer, stay here.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
