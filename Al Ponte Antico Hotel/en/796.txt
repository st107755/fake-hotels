Al Ponte Antico lived up to expectation in every way. I'm  very happy I trusted the trip advisor reviews. Ground floor deluxe room (facing the rialto bridge) must be the best room in the city. Such a beautiful room with exquisite 14th century furnishings and d√©cor. We had romantic evening drinks overlooking the water, and morning greetings from the gondoliers.  This hotel is intimate and antique - a refreshing change to those snooty chain-hotels with expensive price tags and garish/bland decor  The service is exceptional. I have travelled all over but I can safely say that this is the friendliest hotel I have ever visited. Staff know your name, and go out of their way to help you enjoy the best of Venice.  I will certainly return some day. ElisaRead moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
