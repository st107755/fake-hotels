From the moment we were met at the water entrance until the time we left, we were treated to the ultimate in customer service by Mateo and his staff.  The rooms were beautiful and the breakfasts impeccably prepared.  The highlight of our day was sitting on the veranda watching all of the action on the Grand Canal.  I can't recommend this hotel strongly enough !  Looking forward to a return visit !!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
