Wow, we had the pleasure of staying at Al Ponte Antico hotel for 3 nights and we weren't disappointed. Its a beautiful small hotel, in a great location but what did it for us was the exceptional service we received from the owner Matteo and his staff. Situated on the grand canal, beside the Rialto bridge the location is superb, you are within walking distance of everything Venice has to offer.  Matteo and his staff were the friendliest we'd ever encountered. They recommended great restaurants too helping us to avoid some of the more touristy places. Our room was very comfortable and the breakfast was really delicious.  We can't wait to visit again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2010HelpfulShare
