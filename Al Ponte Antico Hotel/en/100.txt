From the moment we arrived  to the minute we left , we were treated & cared for like family. Its nice to stay at smaller hotels , where you feel like your the only guest there.  The hotel is in a excellent location , close to everything & on the grand canal with a private taxi dock. ( this is very helpful )  The breakfast is excellent , with beautiful eggs cooked to your preference each morning. The cappucino machine is out of this world. Worth a visit just to see this amazing   machine. My Family all enjoyed our stay.  Thank-you to all staff at the hotel for your hospitality !Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
