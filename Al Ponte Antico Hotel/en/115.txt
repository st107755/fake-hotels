This posh palazzo in the heart of Venice could not be better. From the beginning of the reservation process, through check in etc, simply top notch. The staff is incredible, always available for every request, smiles abound, and impeccable service. We apparently hit Venice during their rainy high tide season. There are times during day when water is covering streets, coming in city doorways really amazing. No problem here, there are wooden walkways placed from their private dock to the entrance, feet remained dry.  It is really incredible to be staying in a 14th century palazzo that has been meticulously restored to its original glory. And the terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge is divine. The spot for breakfast, aperitifs, conversation and a front row seat to watch Venitiansâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
