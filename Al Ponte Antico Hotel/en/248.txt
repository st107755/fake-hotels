It’s difficult to get better than this; the sought after location; the opulence of the hotel; the excellent customer service and all in such an beautiful city. You are treated like family in this hotel and nothing is too much trouble. All of the staff are so helpful, pleasant and staying here has been one of the highlights of our trip. Matteo and his team are a winning combination. We stayed in a junior suite with a canal view and the room was stunning. We can’t recommend this hotel enough. If you are in Venice and there is availability, then stay here, it is worth every penny! Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
