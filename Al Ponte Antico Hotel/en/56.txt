This was our fifth trip to Venice and our fourth stay at Al Ponte Antico. It was as always Amazing. We had the Junior Suite in the lower level, and the view from the room is just incredible, you can watch Venice go by right in front of you. Service as always was excellent. They truly make you feel at home. We let them know in advance that our daughter was turning seven years old during our trip and they had arrange for a surprise for her in the room when we arrived so it was an excellent touch.  Breakfast was as good as always, and the drinks cocktails they prepare are excellent.  We are already looking forward to our next visit to Venice and of course to our next stay at Al Ponte Antico.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
