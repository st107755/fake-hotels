We have just spent an amazing few Days in Venice and this hotel was simply outstandingly. It's small and cosy whist being in the middle of Everything And still remains quiet!! Terrace overlooking the grand canal to enjoy breakfast from is breathtaking. Ample Choice of buffet breakfast staples. The room was beautifully decorated and provided all we needed. The staff are the thing that make this hotel, they treat you like long lost friends and always address you by your name. They were very good with recommendations and handed over to the next shift to remind us of the direction we needed to go. Excellent location for everything, stay here it's so worth it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
