We found this charming hotel on Trip Advisor and it was betterbthan we had been led to believe.  The location is perfect (right next to the Rialto Bridge), the dining area is beautiful, the food (at breakfast) is very good, and the rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. But what makes this hotel special is the staff. We had our whole family there in a couple of rooms, and they always knoew wgere everyione was.  When you come to the dining room, you are greeted by name and everyone remebers when you have chosen on past mornings.  In fact, everyone knows your name, and everyone does all they can to make the visit perfect.  From maps and directions to reservations and recommendations,the staff made us feel like family. There are surely grander hotels in Venice, but I'm not sureâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
