We just finished a week long stay in room 108 and it really was the Venice trip you dream about. The view up and down the grand canal from this suite is amazing. The terrace has a similar view but from above so you are not looking right out at the gondoliers! The room we stayed in was very large with a bedroom and sitting area with a large opening double window so you can view the grand canal. The bathroom is small but totally functional. We did have a problem with small ants in the bathroom during our stay, the staff did try a couple of times to get rid of the pests but they just kept coming back so we just dispatched the ones we saw in the morning, it wasn't a big deal to us.  This hotel provides a very personal experience that larger properties have difficulty delivering.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
