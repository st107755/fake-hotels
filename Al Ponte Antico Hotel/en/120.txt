As soon as Oliver welcomed us to the hotel, I knew we would enjoy our stay at the Al Ponte Antico. Hotel service of the highest order. From the owner Matteo’s delicious breakfasts and coffee to Rosealba’s efficient service, all the staff here know how to make your stay a totally comfortable experience. Nothing is too much trouble.  The Grand Canal is a big part of everyday life in Venice - the gondolas, water taxis, service boats, vaporetto ferries. You can watch it all go by from dawn until late in the evening on the excellent hotel terrace.   There is truly only one place to stay in Venice - the Al Ponte Antico Hotel.  Thanks Matteo and all your team. Greg & Chiharu.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
