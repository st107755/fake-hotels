Beautiful boutique hotel with outstanding service. Quiet rooms and great location. This is the first small boutique hotel my wife has ever loved. The bar stayed open until 3am just for us to talk with our friends! Can't wait for their new Tuscany property to open!Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
