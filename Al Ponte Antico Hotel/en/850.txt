The best breakfast and the great location!!! I was impressed! I highly recommend this one! the location is in a very quiet neighborhood far from the busy and noisy part of venice. it is very close to vaporeto station (san stae). The front desk is always has good recommendation for attractions, they also book your taxi to or from airport. You easily can reach the hotel by water taxi (vaporeto). the room was decent size, the bathroom is big. the rooms were in a different place from the actual front desk and breakfast. good experienceRead moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
