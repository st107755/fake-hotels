We stayed 3 nights in late May 2014.  The greeting we received from Matteo Peruch, owner of the hotel, was fantastic and set the tone for our visit.  His staff was helpful in every way and made our short stay in Venice a very memorable one.  Breakfast on the terrace, cooked by Matteo, was a highlight...good food and an unsurpassed perspective on the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge. Thank you Matteo, Oliver, Rosalba, and David for a great time.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
