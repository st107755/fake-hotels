We have stayed at this hotel 3 times since 2009, and it is simply our favorite hotel in the world, and we have stayed in a lot of great places.  The owner and staff are very attentive, helpful, and make us feel like we are part of their family when we visit.  It says a great deal about the hotel that most of the staff have been there for nearly a decade.  Sitting on the terrace is perhaps the best way possible to unwind after a busy day of exploring Venice, and with continual renovation and improvement, the hotel is more beautiful than ever.  We can't wait to go back a 4th time!Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare
