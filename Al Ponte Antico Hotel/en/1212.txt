The level of personal service I experienced during my stay has completely changed my perception of how a hotel should take care of its guests.  The combination of service both at the hotel and ability to recommend activities and dining that enhanced my experience of Venetian culture was outstanding.  Remembering my birthday was a great touch as well.  Unfortunately any other hotel I stay with in the future will be a disappointment compared to my stay with Hotel Al Ponte Antico.  While it is not cheap to stay here the staff's ability to save time and recommend economical activities and dining makes a stay here a good value.Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
