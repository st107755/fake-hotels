This is a very small hotel with a focus on personal service. The small team all know your name before you arrive, and chat to you about their recommendations and experiences. The owner is very personable and a great cook, and the breakfast terrace facing the Rialto Bridge is fabulous. We found it a very relaxing and pleasant stay.  We used some of the resturant recommendations and they were great. Ideally I'd have liked our room to be a bit larger and quieter ( we may have been unlucky but there was a political rally and a concert right across the river which made it hard to sleep) but the location is so central you probably have to expect that. Generally we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
