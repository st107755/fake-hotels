Romantic and amazing. Staff treated us like royalty from minute one with details like knowing our names, helping us find the sights and welcoming us with chilled prosecco and handwritten note congratulating us on our wedding. The terrace overlooking the Rialto and Grand Canal is prettier than the pictures. We loved room 109 as it was large, beautifully decorated and the windows open right out to the Grand Canal!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
