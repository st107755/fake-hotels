A truly excellent hotel, stayed here for a long birthday weekend here. The staff were exceptional, went above and beyond - nothing was too much trouble. Rooms are lovely, location spot on and breakfast perfect. Couldn't ask for more. Would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare
