This is our second visit here and wont be the last . Great service as always , so warm and friendly and excellent location.  Some people have complained about small rooms or only small buffet and eggs for breakfast but this place and the staff MORE than make up for it .  See you again soon 👍Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
