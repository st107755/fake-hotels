This was our second stay at the Al Ponte Antico and it was as fantastic as the first time. The same staff as last time pandering to our every whim they made us feel so welcome again and the service was exemplery.  Just sitting on the terrace every morning watching the world go by at about 5 miles an hour was so relaxing our favorite hotel in our favorite city. Thank you  Matteo, Oliver, Thomas, David, Alex, Roseba and all the staff who remain, more or less, behind the scenes. Ciao until next timeRead moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
