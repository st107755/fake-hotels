Benefited greatly from Tripadvisor reviews for years and finally feel motivated to write my first review of a well situated property with exceptional staff and owner. Every member of the staff was warm and friendly and made our stay memorable.  The hotel has immense character, with a rich history behind it. We stayed at the suite, Room 108 and it was an unbelievable experience to open the windows and look into the Grand Canal with the gondolas and other boats sailing by.  Matteo, we look forward to staying in your other properties in Italy in our next trip to Italy, to enjoy this type of welcome and service.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
