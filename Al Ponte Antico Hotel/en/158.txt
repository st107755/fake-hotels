We had a wonderful time in Venice staying at Al Ponte Antico Hotel. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and we wanted a special hotel in Venice.  Matteo and everyone on staff were going out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. We were greeted by Matteo on our arrival and he gave us a tour and background history of his hotel. Our room (#5) was very quiet, spacious, and  comfortable. We loved spending time on the terrace to watch the sunset or gondolas go by. Breakfast was fabulous! The hotel was located in a great area-easy to find since it was close to the Rialto bridge. Thanks for a wonderful stay!Read moreDate of stay: June 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
