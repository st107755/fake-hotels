We stayed 3 nights in the middle of July.  The hotel is in a centrally located place to everything. Boat bus taxi stop is only 50 meters away. Hotel is very clean and nice.  The location of the hotel was in a quite place just outside of all the hustle and bustle.  The staff was great and very helpful.  The hotel sent directions in an email after booking with spot on directions to get you there.  The free breakfast was also good.  Cannot say enough about the staff  and we would stay there again.
