This hotel is expensive, but other than that there's nothing to complain about and plenty to love.  It's in a lovingly-remodeled old palace right on the Grand Canal, with beautiful furnishings, an ideal location very near the Rialto Bridge, and wonderful views from the canal-side rooms and from the hotel's canal-side terrace.  It's very small and family-run, and the owner was clearly very proud of it when he showed us around after check-in.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful - many many dishes, including some hot dishes made to order.  The staff was always extremely helpful and welcoming.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
