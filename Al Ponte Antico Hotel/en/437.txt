We can't say enough good things about Al Ponte Antico! From the moment we arrived Matteo the owner made us feel so welcome and special on the first stop on our honeymoon! All the staff at the hotel greeted us by our first names the whole of our stay which made us feel special! After exploring the city and having an evening meal we returned for a really comfortable and quiet nights sleep. The breakfast on the terrace was delicious (Matteo's a great chef and the scrambled eggs were divine!). We look forward to returning on our Anniversary! Thank you for an amazing stay!
