This place is an absolute delight from the minute you walk down a small narrow alley up to the twinkling lights greeting you at the entrance.  The location is simply the best you will find.  It is near so many attractions and only a short walk from the water bus stop.  Service is impeccable.  Everyone knows you by name and will bend over backwards to assist in anything.  The breakfast is great, particularly the fresh fruit, ham and cheese croissants (melt in your mouth), omelets and pastries.  The view from the terrace is stunning.  The rooms are quite large, certainly more than I expected.  Not a flaw to be found.  Wifi worked great.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
