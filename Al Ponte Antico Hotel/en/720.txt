We just spent 4 nights at this incredible boutique hotel. If you want to be treated like royalty and stay in a beautiful palace...this is the place for you.  The owner Matteo and his staff make you feel like you are staying in their own home.  They call you by name and make you feel so welcome.  Enjoy a Spritz on the terrace.  The view is to die for.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
