The magic of Venice was made more special by Mattoe, his staff and this wonderful small hotel. We celebrated my 60th birthday in a most memorable way by staying at the Al Ponte Antico and it lived up to all of its reviews. We had a wonderful room, lovely breakfast and supurb wine in the most beautiful glasses on the terrace where we shared laughter and good conversation with others. Greetings to everyone we met. We feel we made friends in Matteo and his staff and cannot wait to go back. This kind of hotel is very hard to find and we would love to keep it a secret but that would be selfish. Go if you can, its worth it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
