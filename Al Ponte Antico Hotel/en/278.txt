This hotel is a small hotel located on the Grand Canal close to the Rialto Bridge. The owner, Matteo, and his staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The rooms are very comfortable with mini-bars and showers. The hotel has a particularly nice deck for breakfast and drinks in the evenings!  Three tips for travellers wanting to visit Venice and stay here: 1. Try to get up a little earlier to see the Grand Canal gradually come to life in the morning. You may even see the Rialto Bridge with no one on it! 2. Definitely try Matteo's omelettes. 3. Tomas makes a great Select Spritz.Read moreDate of stay: August 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
