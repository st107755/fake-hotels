This is a lovely small hotel with only eight rooms, kind of like a bed and breakfast.  From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed.  Matteo greeted us by name as did all of his staff.  David, Thomas, Oliver, Lorenzo and Rosaria (who made the best eggs every morning) were all so friendly and accommodating.  Our room was awesome with a wonderful view of the Grande Canal.  This stay was the best part of our 40th anniversary celebration.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
