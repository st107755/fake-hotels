Hotel Al Ponte is an absolute pleasure to stay at from arrival to (reluctant) departure. The attention to detail, welcome from staff and exceptional location have made it an incredibly memorable trip. The views of the Rialto Bridge are fabulous and the Aperol spritz are pretty good too. We'll definitely be back! Thank you. Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
