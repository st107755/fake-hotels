We were lucky to stay at this most charming hotel in September 2012.Not only did we have the best room in the hotel(108),but it was the first stop on our 4 weeks in Italy,it did not disapoint. The owner,Matteo, and staff, especially Oliver, treated us as friends not strangers.Their passion for the hotel and Venice was very evident.We enjoyed every moment of our stay and would never conisider staying anywhere else when we are ever in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
