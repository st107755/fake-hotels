This 9 room hotel is beyond beautiful along with the friendliest staff we've ever encountered.  The owner, Matteo was so warm and welcoming and definitely knows the hospitality business.  After one night, we said "big mistake....we didn't plan on staying more than 3 nights".   Our room was beautiful and very comfortable.  We travel a lot but this hotel was really the best we've ever stayed in....I'm scared to post this review.  Thanks for great memories!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
