What a wonderful place, a treasure!!! My husband booked this trip for my Christmas present (2011) and we did the trip on the 23rd of March 2012 for 3 days. I had no input on choice of hotel but he wanted to choose a romantic place and he picked the perfect onel!We were welcomed by the owner who knew our names, we were looked after by every single members of staff. They helped with everything: restaurants, itineraries, things to do, tips etc etc The hotel is very conveniently located. We took the boat from the airport, it took about 50min and the stop is 5min away from the hotel.  The hotel is fantastic, so comfortable. The balcony is the perfect place to have breakfast - and what a brilliant breakfast they do! or a drink mid afternoon to recharge batteries. We were so well takenâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
