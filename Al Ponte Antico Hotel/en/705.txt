The owner, Matteo is charming, passionate, and serious about his role as the owner of the hotel. He greeted us at reception very fondly and gave us a proud tour of his hotel, talking about its history, renovation and current success.   Our room was at the back with three windows which didn't let in much light because of the high surrounding buildings but the spacious room was lavishly decorated in old Venetian style. It was the last leg of our Italian honeymoon, and Matteo had provided bottle of bubbly on ice and rose petals in our room and then proceeded to thank us for choosing his hotel. It was very touching and completely unexpected. We instantly drank it on the terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge. A stunning view.
