Nothing was too much trouble. Fun, friendly and charming service set this hotel apart and surpassed all our expectaions. Sitting on the gem of a terrace with a chilled beer (drinks are very reasonable by Venetian standards) gazing out onto the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal it is easy to lose a few hours observing the hustle and bustle. Location is ideal, a short walk from the main water buses that serve the major attractions.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
