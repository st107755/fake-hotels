Believe all the great reviews you see here.  This hotel is excellent for its location, service, atmosphere, and the quality of the rooms.  The staff goes out of their way to make you feel special and attend to your every need.  The terrace, with the commanding view of the Grande Canal, is a magical place for breakfast and dinner drinks.   The surrounding area is full of shops, restaurants and quaint cobblestone streets.   The service, by far, is what sets it apart from most hotels.  You will not regret staying here.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
