Myself and my husband stayed here for 1 night on the 11th of August. The hotel is a magic place and I didn't want to leave. The owner Matteo greeted us on arrival, everyone of the hotel staff were so incredibly friendly and helpful we felt like honoured guests. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Many thanks to all the staff, Armando, Rosalba, Max, and a special thanks to Tommaso who was on the desk at night and gave us the best restaurant recommendation (I think it was called Baraboa). All I can say is if you are going to Venice stay at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
