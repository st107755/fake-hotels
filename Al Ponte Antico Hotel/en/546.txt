My 87 year old mother & I stayed at this wonderful haven for 3 nights and 4 glorious days.  They took better care of my mother than I could.  Everytime we arrived Mateo, Alex and the rest of the staff were there to welcome us back.  They helped walk her to her room and even got her from water taxi to dock safely.  The  egg's Matteo made for breakfast could possibly be the best sunny side up egg with cheese i have ever tasted, something about the seasoning & cheese he added, Yum! If you are planing a trip to Venice you will never stop talking about this as the highlight of your visit. Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
