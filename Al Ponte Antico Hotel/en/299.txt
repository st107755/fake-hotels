Stayed in this hotel for two nights treated like family by the manager and colleagues.  If I go back to Venice I would only stay here👍 Awesome views and great breakfast cooked to order. Rooms in great and the details in the hotel are award winning. Great value for Venice and its location. See the photos they do not lie!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
