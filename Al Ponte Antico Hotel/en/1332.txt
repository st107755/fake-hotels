Can't stop talking about our two night stay  19 Aug to 21 Aug in Venice.  Matteo the hotel owner and all his staff were so welcoming and friendly, always available to give us directions and telling us where to eat.  Our room was beautiful with a view to die for, and the terrace with the view of the Rialto Bridge, just watching the world go by whilst having breakfast was an experience not to be missed.  After a day of sightseeing and walking it was perfect just to come back to the hotel and sit on the terrace.  Would highly recommend this hotel as it has everything on a wish list.Read moreDate of stay: August 2008HelpfulShare
