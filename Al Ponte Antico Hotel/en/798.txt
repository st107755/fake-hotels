We stayed in the Junior Suite at canal level which was the best located hotel room we've ever had, hence my first ever trip advisor rating. Wonderful views from the room watching the gondolas, and Venetian life in general float by. Breakfasting on the terrace, and sipping an evening drink felt like being in the middle of a film set. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, as other reviewers have commented. There was slight evidence of being so close to canal level - powdery plaster in a couple of places, but that was to be expected given the amazing location. The bathroom was small too, but again, to be expected given the location. Would love to go back.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
