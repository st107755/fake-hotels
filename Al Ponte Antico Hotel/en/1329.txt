My husband and I spent a lovely weekend, just after the carnival so it was really quiet. This small hotel is in an excellent location, right by the Rialto Bridge. Our room had a spectacular view over the Grand Canal.  You could spend hours just watching the world float by the window  - I had to drag my husband away from it to go sight-seeing.  The hotel owner, Matteo, could not do enough for us and was full of really helpful suggestions as to what to see. The breakfast was lovely.  The bar/breakfast area was richly furnished wth beautiful fabrics and antiques.  It felt like we were honoured guests in a private home. Very conveniently situated as the Rialto vaporetto stop is about 5 mins away.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare
