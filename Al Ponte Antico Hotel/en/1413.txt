This hotel is a real find.  Situated by the grand canal yet quiet, beautifully decorated in the Venetian style with period furniture  and  exquisite attention to detail in the rooms which are styled indidually as suites.  The chandeliers in the rooms are to die for!  The hotel is spotlessly clean.  Our room did not have a canal view but this did not matter as we could sit on the terrace at the end of the breakfast room and watch the world go by.  The breakfast service was immaculate, served by a very friendly lady and her assistant.  Nothing is too much trouble. We were fogbound at the airport and had to stay at the hotel an extra two nights (a pleasure!) we were treated like old friends.  We have stayed at hotels all over Italy and this is by far the best - cannot understandâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2007HelpfulShare
