The two stand out features of this hotel are its  position in the city, - Right on the grand canal and a short walk to all the main sights. The second aspect is the staff who are outstandingly helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We had had a ski bag stolen in Milan, and they helped us deal with all the formalities and associated difficulties of that process. They also went out of their way to get us set up for the next part of our holiday- altogether a fabulous effort.  We had a room overlooking the endlessly fascinating grand canal- beautifully decorated and big - (except for the shower which might be the smallest one I've ever been in)- however, that was no problem.  All  in all, a small (9 rooms) boutique hotel, well positioned, beautifully appointed with outstanding staff.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
