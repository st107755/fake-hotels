It's all been said and now that we've been, I can say it's all true!  Perfect in every way, an absolute dream place to stay in ANY city, but throw in the terrace on the Grand Canal with the Rialto Bridge view and it's hard to top !  All the staff were amazing, but a special GRAZIE to my darling TOMMASO the Night Manager...I wanted to pack him in my suitcase and take him home!  BACI Tommaso!  Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
