My husband and I visited Venice recently during our Honeymoon and had the pleasure of staying at Al Ponte Antico for 2 nights.  I was initially hesitant about staying a tiny hotel (9 rooms only) as I wasn't sure how the vibe would be (too lonely? too isolated?).  We were BEYOND pleased with everything this hotel had to offer and frankly, wouldn't stay anywhere else when we visit Venice again.    First, Al Ponte Antico has the most delightful, friendly, and accommodating staff.  They made a point to address us in a very personal manner and were extremely helpful in providing great dinner and other Venice-specific recommendations.  They all had a love for their jobs which was clear in how the entire team worked together and in the way they interacted with the guests.   â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
