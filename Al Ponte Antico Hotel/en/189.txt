Privately owned and operated, this hotel is a gem!  From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel at home and well taken cared of by the entire staff.  Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable, including the owner, who makes custom omlettes to add to the beautiful and filling breakfast buffet. Location - perfecto! I have been to Venice several times, but this was my first time at Al Ponte Antico.  It will not be my last!Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
