The hotel stays in a true venetian palace with a great view of the Grand Canal and the Rialto bridge. The room is very cozy and the service is the best that a hotel can offer. Thanks a lot for all the staff of Al Ponte Antico. You made our stay in Venice just perfect.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
