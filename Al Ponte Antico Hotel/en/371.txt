One can't say enough about this wonderful establishment. We stayed on the ground floor, overlooking the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. The Palace itself was stunning - and Bruno was rightfully proud of it, showing us all the details which he had carefully restored. And he is an amazing chef - cooking a custom breakfast for us. It was small, intimate, but yet a Palace in an amazing location. Truly deserves all of its high accolades.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
