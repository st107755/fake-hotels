What a great location, right at the side of the famous Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal.   Matteo and his team look after you superbly and have great knowledge of the area. Always willing to share a recommendation or assist however they can,  The room was very clean, well furnished and comfortable but unfortunately didn't have a view. The terrace where drinks or breakfast were served more than made up for this. The only thing wrong with the view was the graffiti on the bridge, which blights many parts of venice. Come on council, tidy it up!  Visits to Murano and Burano were excellent and a nice break from the City itself.  Thanks for a great and very memorable stay, superb hospitality.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
