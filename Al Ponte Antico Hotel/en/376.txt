The Al Ponte is a very small Hotel (9 rooms) located in the heart of Venice - overlooking the grand canal and Rialto Bridge. Location is perfect. Rooms are exceptionally well appointed. Without exception, the staff were fantastic and they went out of their way to make sure you felt special. I know it might cost a bit more but believe me when I say it is well and truly worth it in every sense of the word.We had a wonderful time here and would definitely stay here again if we ever came back to Venice.Do yourself a huge huge favour and stay here - you will not be disappointed. If you are coming to Venice I would strongly recommend you also book a night of opera at Musica A Palazzo - its opera like you have never experienced before. Unbelievable - I LOVED IT.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare
