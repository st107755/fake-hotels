Just back from a 4 night stay in Venice for my birthday and sadly only stayed in this magical hotel for the one night however what a fantastic introduction to a truly magical place. We were made to feel so welcome, special. The service is impeccable!!! It's an amazing building - the d√©cor stunning and very comfortable and very well positioned to get around Venice. There is a lovely balcony over looking the canal where we enjoyed a welcome drink although we stayed in January! We are already planning our next visit and won't be staying anywhere else - it really is a fantastic experience...thank you so much...Sarah and JonRead moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
