What can I say - a superb place to stay. The staff are all, without fail, so friendly and attentive. Everyone is made to feel so welcome and all of the staff always take the time to chat with you (and always know who you are). The place is beautifully and carefully restored and in the most amazing situation for Venice. It's a great place to sit and watch the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge. I've stayed in many hotels over the years and can truly say this is the best. We will most definitely be back. Thank you to you all for a very special stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
