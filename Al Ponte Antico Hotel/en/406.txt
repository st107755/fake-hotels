this hotel is perfect . . We were picked up from the airport in a private wooden speedboat and after the best trip across water into Venice, we were greeted by the owner Matteo. . The service and attention is exceptional . . Not only Matteo but all the staff know you by name and cannot do enough for you.  They are also one of the only hotels with a veranda and we are overlooking the Rialto bridge , . . Again perfect !!!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
