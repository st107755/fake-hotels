Beautiful location with stunning views. Matteo, Alex, Oliver, Rosalbo, Gigi, Igor, Tomas and David are an outstanding team who are entirely focused on ensuring every guest is beautifully looked after like a member of their family. Thank you to everyone for making our stay so magical and the wedding of my son and daughter in law on the beautiful terrace was perfect in every way. The room was lovely and the breakfast with the home baking from Barbara each day was something we looked forward to every morning. We made some wonderful family memories at Al Ponte Antico and would recommend a stay to all. Thank you Matteo and the rest of the Al Ponte Antico family xxxRead moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare
