My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of November.  It was truly one of the high points of our trip to Venice.  The service was among the warmest and most personal that we have experienced at any property anywhere.  The location, right on the Grand Canal, is terrific.  The breakfast included was very good.  The experience of sitting on their terrace, overlooking the Grand Canal, sipping a hot chocolate, and just watching the traffic pass on the canal was an one not to be missed.  Our room, which overlooked the Grand Canal, was spacious and comfortable. The only negative would be the shower, which was the smallest I have ever used.  The hotel is pricey, but overall, well worth the splurge.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
