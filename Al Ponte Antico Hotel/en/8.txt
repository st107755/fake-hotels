What a wonderful, wonderful stay at Al Ponte Antico! It just felt like home. Perfect location, stylish original interior and wonderful people going out of their way to make you feel truly welcomed. What a start of the day with Barbara’s home-made cakes on a calm and scenic terrace looking right at the Rialto bridge! It’s all about people like her and her wonderful husband Mateo that make all difference and create a personal, loving experience. Tante grazie for making our stay truly special.Read moreDate of stay: August 20202 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
