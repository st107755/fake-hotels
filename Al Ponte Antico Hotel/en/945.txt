Small hotel with amazing rooms. The hotel is a former palace for a family of aristocrats. The walls and ceilings are original. The interior design is breathtaking with murano glass chandeliers in the rooms and amazing works of art on the walls. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly yet professional. An amazing breakfast with eggs and pancakes cooked to order plus a stunning buffet of fruits, breads, jams, cheese, yogurts and fresh fruit  juices are included in the rate.
