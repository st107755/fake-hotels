My husband, two adult children and I stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel in Venice for two nights.  The owner was an absolute delight and glad to help in any way.  Our room faced the Grand Canal.  We felt like we were on the water and could touch the boats passing.  Such a fun experience! The upstairs veranda was a lovely place to start the day with a very nice breakfast included in the price. The rooms are well appointed with period pieces, modern bathroom setups and working AC. Five minute walk to St. Mark's Square and 2 minutes to Rialta Bridge---fantastic location!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
