We stayed for only one night. This hotel is an incredible gem. The people who work here give friendly service like no hotel I have stayed at in the world. I give it 5 stars and more for service, the delicious breakfast, the awesome location on the Grande Canal. Two issues that would bother some. Bathrooms are small and the bed although dressed with high quality sheets is not a five star bed. It did not bother me but might some. A great value by Venice standards. Beautiful suite with a veranda on the canal.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
