The staff at Al Ponte Antico treated us like family on our three night stay in Venice. This was probably the best overall experience I have ever had at a hotel. When we arrived at the airport we realized our checked bags didn't make it and would be arriving the next day. The staff at the hotel took care of the luggage issue for us and it was in our room the next day. The terrace view and breakfast spread was amazing. And staying next to Rialto bridge makes finding your way back to the hotel very easy. But the best part of the stay was the interaction with the staff and discussing what to do and the best way to do it while in Venice. Great folks. Highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
