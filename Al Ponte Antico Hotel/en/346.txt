Great hotel, lovely attentive staff and a perfect location. We booked room 109 with its own private terrace overlooking the Rialto Bridge. You can sit here in the afternoon and watch the world go by whilst sipping on a cool bottle of bubbly.   Truly great location and a must for Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
