The reviews are spot on.  We have stayed in Venice several times and this is our favourite hotel so far. The location is great to explore Venice from and the style of the hotel is just outstanding.  The team at the hotel are so friendly and helpful which just makes the stay so much nicer. The terrace was my favourite part of the hotel. Breakfast sitting there and evening drinks just made my holiday. There are heaters so even if it’s cold make sure you use the terrace and enjoy the views.  Will certainly be coming back here.  Oh and I can’t do a review without mentioning the breakfast! It really is lovely home cooked food and so delicious. Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
