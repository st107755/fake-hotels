When planning our trip to Venice we consulted 'TripAdvisor' to  decide on our accommodation. At the time of planning Hotel Al Ponte Antico was under renovations and so based on reviews, we decided to book Locanda Orseolo. As our departure date approached, we were informed that Locanda Orseolo was closed for the duration of our stay. However, Bruno (one of the proprietors of both establishments) offered us an upgrade to Hotel Al Ponte Antico- gratis.  Venice is of unparallelled beauty and likewise Hotel Al Ponte Antico stands alone. We have travelled widely and have had the privilege of staying in some of the world's best hotels. However, most pale in comparison to Hotel Al Ponte Antico and none match the personalised approach that make this hotel such a special experience. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2009HelpfulShare
