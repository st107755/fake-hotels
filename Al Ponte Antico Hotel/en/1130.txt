Our recent stay at this hotel was fantastic.  The location can't be beat, the service was non-stop terriffic, the room was clean and spacious and the breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal was fresh and fabulous.  Try to get room 101 or 102, they seem to offer the best views.  Matteo is a great host, and good cook.  This palce is a true value.  If you book here, you won't be dissapointed.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
