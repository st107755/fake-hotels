Our stay at Al Ponte Antico was perfect! Matteo and his team are so friendly, polite and helpful. We felt completely at home and our room overlooking the Grand Canal was simply beautiful. The hotel is in a great location for exploring all areas of Venice. The terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge was the perfect retreat for breakfast or evening cocktails. We cannot fault anything about our stay and we hope to return again some day.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
