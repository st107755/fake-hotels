My wife and I were on our honeymoon and spent 3 weeks touring Italy.  Matteo and this hotel are still the subject of many of our stories.  And we stayed in many 4-5 star hotels.  This place has it all.  Service, location, spacious rooms with a view and gourmet breakfast on the terrace every morning and wine in the evening on the Grand Canal!!!  Unbelievable!  And, Matteo is the keystone.  He is so passionate about his work.  It is "his life".   Without a doubt when we return to Venice, this is the only place for us to stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
