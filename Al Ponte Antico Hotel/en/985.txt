We stayed at Al Ponte Antico in April 2011. It was a truly memorable experience for all the right reasons. Each morning we ate our delicious breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal watching the endlessly entertaining morning rush hour of boats. There are many reasons to stay here but, above all, the personal service at this hotel is truly exceptional. Matteo, Bruno and every member of staff treat every guest as if they were royalty or like the dearest old friends.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
