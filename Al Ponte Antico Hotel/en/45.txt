This hotel made our visit to Venice magical. The owner greeted us personally and gave us a tour of the hotel and the staff was excellent from the first contact until we left the property. Everything was absolutely wonderful and perfect. We chose the Junior Suite and highly recommend it. Opening the big windows to the grand canal is an experience we will never forget. If your budget allows, give yourself this treat. Also, everything was clean, room temperature comfortable, WiFi worked perfectly. I can't imagine that any other hotel in all of Venice could match Al Ponte.Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
