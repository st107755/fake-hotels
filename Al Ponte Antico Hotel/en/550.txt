Stayed for 2 nights prior to going on a cruise. Staff are very attentive and welcoming. The view from the terrace is magnificent looking at the Rialto bridge and the hustle  and bustle of the Grand Canal.  The breakfasts were very good as was the room. Hope to return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
