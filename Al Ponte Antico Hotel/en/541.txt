What a dream come true to cruise down the Grand Canal in your private water taxi and pull up to your hotel only to have the proprietor, Mateo, greet you by name!  I felt like a VIP and the personal, exceptional service did not stop.  The hotel is extremely clean and well maintained.  The private terrace overlooking the Renaldo Bridge is perfect for enjoying the beautiful breakfast cooked by Mateo.  The staff was extremely helpful in giving directions and recommendations for dinner.  We were always greeted by name and felt the staff was interested in making sure our stay was perfect.  This hotel is a hidden gem.  I look forward to returning.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
