My husband and I have just left Hotel Al Ponte Antico today and it was the best start to our Italian holiday. Alex & Matteo could not of been more helpful and welcoming for our first time in Venice as well as all the staff are so lovely. They gave us so many good suggestions and restaurants choices and and they were all excellent! My husband's luggage was lost and they went above and beyond to try and find it for us. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the terrace for breakfast is amazing. The rooms are spacious with a large bathroom. We will definitely be staying here next time we come back to Venice. Thank you Alex and Matteo for the most amazing time in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
