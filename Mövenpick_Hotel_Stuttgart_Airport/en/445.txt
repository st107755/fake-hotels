It is in such a way that you can regular the temperature in your room by yourself. You also have the possibility to contact us before your arrival so our technical department can set the temperature a bit higher in your room. Otherwise our Housekeeping helps you with a second blanket or a hot-water bottle.  We will look forward to welcoming you back again soon.
