First time but would come back. Hotel has everything a regular traveller needs and you feel at home. Mini bar misses red wine but with bath ribe, however no cleaning stuff in the gym. But then I'm being picky. Great breakfast where omelet is brought to your table. But may be I was a friendly exception. Staff works with functional hospitality. So quick, personal and not over the top. Cleaning staff was also really engaged to make it a succes. No I do not work for the hotel but they have a lot of things organised in the right way.
