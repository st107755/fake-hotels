Across the terminal 3, you can see the hotel and walk within 5 minutes to the lobby.  Lovely entrance to the hotel, with open structure and good architecture. The staff at the reception are good and helpful.  On the same floor, you have a beautiful classy restaurant were they also serve there breakfast in the morning. On the ground floor you have a cosy bar, where we helped well. Also they checked very well of your needs during your visit.  Hotel room are spacious and feels warm. I love the walk in shower and the great design of the bathroom. The room is clean and have good insulation. Further the center air conditioning is not noisy at all.   Overall I will book this hotel again because its location near the airport and the great staff.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 9, 2016Dear Guest,   thank you very much for your lovely feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on TripAdvisor.
