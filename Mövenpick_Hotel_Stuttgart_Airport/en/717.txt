Arrived late at night and didn't feel like heading into town to find a hotel before a train ride the next morning, I decided to stay at this hotel. Just outside the airport, this has been such a pleasant surprise. The staff were very nice and polite, room was spacious and had everything needed for the overnight stay. I can't fault the hotel and even enjoyed a quick snack in the bar. Overall I think this has been perfect in all areas.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 26, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your positive feedback.
