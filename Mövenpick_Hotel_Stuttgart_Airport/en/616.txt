My husband and I stayed here the night before flying home. It was an excellent evening. The bed was very comfortable and the room's layout was stylish and very pleasant. The service we had was friendly and professorial. We would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relation at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 29, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you so much for your very positive feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
