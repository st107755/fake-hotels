What a great hotel is this. From the way they received us, the room, the service and the restaurant. Staff is very friendly. The beds are perfect (maybe because the hotel is brand new) even my partner slept like never before. If you want you can ask reception for 5 different kinds of pillows, several kinds of duvets and blankets. If you have a child and they forgot their teddybear you can buy one here! And do not forget the glass of champagne that we got while checking in, because it was almost new year!!  I recommend this hotel to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 9, 2011Dear Mrs. Piavg,  We would like to apologize that you had to wait for our answer to your feedback.
