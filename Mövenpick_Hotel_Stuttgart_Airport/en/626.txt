I was in Germany for a business trip that had me out in Dinkelsbuhl, which is about 2-2:30 hours away from the Stuttgart airport. At the last minute I decided to book a room here so I wouldn't have to worry about morning traffic and missing my early international flight. Best decision I could have made. Amazing hotel, incredibly fair price, lovely room, and equally lovely staff. Very kind and courteous, which was greatly appreciated since I checked in at about 2am and had to get up at 7am. I will stay here any time I am in Stuttgart before I fly back home and would suggest the same to my friends and colleagues.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 3, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your fantastic feedback about your stay on Tripadvisor.com.
