The family stayed at the Moevenpick overnight before flying out the next day. Spacious rooms that were connected made for a great night for 4 people. Beds were very comfortable, room service delectable (highly recommend the curry wurst or if you are really hungry the burger) as well as the breakfast buffet.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 12, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for your fantastic comment about your stopover for the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com.
