The hotel is so closed to the airport and congress center, that it is really  convenient for professional events with an international audience. The staff is always very nice, Breakfast is really good and starts at 5:30am which is convenient when you have an early flight. The restaurant menu is very good as well as the bar. The rooms are comfortable and very well decorated with a modern style.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 20, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback of your most recent experience with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
