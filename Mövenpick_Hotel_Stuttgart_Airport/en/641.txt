Got a good deal via booking.com, rooms very nice and spacious. Transport connections good with train station from airport, also a few shops and restaurants if you dont want to use hotel. Good points, free spa and sauna, bad points cost of internet, should be free and fast these days. Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 5, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your recent visit at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
