Perfect situated for my business trip. Just 50 meters from the terminal. May be a bit expensive, but it's quiet confortable,spacious rooms and friendly staff. Perfect for meetings or just to spend the night before an early flight. I'll come back.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 5, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you for your great feedback on TripAdvisor.
