We stayed here for one night when visiting an exhibition, and the location is absolutely perfect for that, being between the airport and the exhibition centre, an easy walk from both.  It was very good value for money at the rates we paid (through the airline as a package), although others reported paying quite a bit more.  The rooms were comfortable, and breakfast was excellent in the morning. I would certainly stay again if in a similar situation.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 21, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
