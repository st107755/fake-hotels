What a sad indictment of Stuttgart that its top rated hotel is stuck out in the luxurious, scenic surroundings of the airport!   Good job everything you need is there. The staff are great - particularly the guy running the bar on the night of our stay who was truly exceptional. The bar food was good - a burgerfest - and thanks to the guy mentioned above, service outstanding.  The room and public areas were all well appointed and well designed, and our overall experience was way above what we expected from a chain hotel at an airport; a very nice surprise.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 12, 2011Dear simonpennysmith,  First of all we would like to thank you for your recent stay with us.
