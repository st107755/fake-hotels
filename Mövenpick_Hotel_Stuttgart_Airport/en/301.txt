Lovely hotel in a very convent location . The rooms are beautiful and the front desk staff were great . Dealt with gentleman I think called Sacha on front desk who was excellent and a credit to the hotel . The rooms are clean and light and thought  the glass shower wall helped it have a light and airy feel. All in all a fabulous hotel stayed before and will stay again  Read moreDate of stay: September 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 21, 2016Dear guest,  it is a perfect motivation to read  your top comment about the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart  Airport & Messe .
