One of the best business stays I've had in a Hotel actually.  + Quiet room (even though it is literally next to the airport), clean and very service minded staff. The breakfast, which is an important factor when I choose hotels, was excellent! If you are visiting the Stuttgart Exhibition centre, this hotel is spot on. Aprox 40 meter from the Airport entrance and about 100m walk to the entrance of the exhibition halls.  - The bathroom did not offer complete privacy since the door was made of frosted class.

Great to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you gave us the best value in all sectors. Thank you for your comment regarding the window in our bathroom. The idea of the hotel´s designer was to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. The door of the bathroom will either close only the toilet or the whole bathroom.   We hope you had a pleasant trip back home and we will look forward to welcoming you back again in the not too distant future.   Kind regards,  Laura Liebel – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
