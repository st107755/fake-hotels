Making my first trip to Germany to meet my family (I was adopted) arriving May 1, 2013. Traveling abroad and unsure as to where to stay (I am told my family is spread out within an hour of Stuttgart and one in the city) we found this hotel on-line. During the reservation process I was informed we would have free Wi-Fi in our room so we can maintain communication with our children in the states; however, after receiving my 10 day reservation confirmation I do not see WiFi as part of my reservations. I hope, with so many uncertainatites in my near future, this hotel does not fall short of expectations and promises. Very much looking forward to this trip!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 24, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you for having booked the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart  Airport & Messe.
