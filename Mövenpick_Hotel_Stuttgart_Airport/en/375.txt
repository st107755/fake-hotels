Stayed one night. April 2016. Early flight next day so chose to stay here despite wanting to go into the city centre.  Cab ride from city centre was 30 euros - a lot when it's 4euros by train but I had several heavy bags.  Located literally 500 yards from the departure lounge - perfect - even with the bags.  No stairs - nothing and it's next door. Lobby very large and modern if a bit clinical.  Reception really friendly.  But the rooms.....beautiful.  Solid oak black door with lovely chrome fittings on every single room.  Inside furniture was high quality. Showers lovely.  Good gym/sauna. Excellent breakfast. Would stay again just for the rooms.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 25, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback on TripAdvisor and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
