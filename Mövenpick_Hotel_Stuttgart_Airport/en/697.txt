This is such a great hotel that is steps away from the airport terminal. Everyone on the staff was super professional and friendly. I was only here for one night and would recommend for travelers like me who fly in late and have to leave early. Rooms was very comfortable and the bathroom was first class. I had dinner and enjoyed my meal. Thought that breakfast was included with my room rate. Probably the most expensive mistake of my trip. If I had known that it would cost me 22 euros I would have eaten more than yogurt and a croissant. Oh well! My fault. The breakfast choices were terrific.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 3, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you for having shared your experience at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
