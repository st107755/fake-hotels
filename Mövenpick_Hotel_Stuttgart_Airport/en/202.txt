The hotel staff were excellent!  The décor of the hotel room and public spaces was very nice.  Food was very good. Great value for price paid.  Upscale and welcoming property. Highly recommended if you have business at the convention center (Messe) nearby.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 12, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
