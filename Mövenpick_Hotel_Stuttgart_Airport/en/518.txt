Great balance of comfort, quality service & convenience. You don't even feel at an "airport hotel". Hotel personnel was courteous and not overwhelming. You feel comfortable and secure within the hotel premises. Room was very nicely appointed with quality materials which was in good balance with the cost you pay for it.
