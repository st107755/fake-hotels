It is obviously convenient to the airport but worth mentioning that it is a short stroll, not a bus ride from it. I was meeting several people, arriving at different times. So, quite frequent attention to our table with new drinks and (very good) bar food, was no problem for the friendly and efficient bar staff. The room was superbly appointed, the bed comfortable and the shower powerful. Breakfast was excellent. A superb 'all-rounder' for the business traveller, which would also be a comfortable base for a longer stay.
