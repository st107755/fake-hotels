The hotel is absolutely comfortable for business trip. But be careful about 2 little things. If you have a room on the 6th floor it can happen that at 6.50 a.m. in the morning people start to work on the roof, making' noises and walkin' around. What is nice if that when you phone for that, the answer is "we'll stop it immediately" but nothing happens. The second attention is the restaurant. They are not fast, also when the room is not full of people, waiting time for service is too long. Quality of food is not bad, they are nice with people, but slow, incredibly slow.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from jkoehler, Geschäftsführer at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 11, 2015Dear guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
