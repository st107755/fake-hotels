Had a one night stay on the 20 October 2019 in the Movenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport. The Hotel is very clean and fantastic quality. The airport terminals are less then 2 min away perfect location. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a meal in the restaurant at the night and the food was outstanding quality. There was also a gym and spa area which was very very good no extra costing. The rooms them self was modern clean and to a high standard . We definitely come again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 23, 2019Dear Guest,  GREAT!
