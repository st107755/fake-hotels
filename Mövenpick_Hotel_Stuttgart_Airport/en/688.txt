I always stay at this hotel when travelling to Stuttgart. It is located right across the airport terminal, with good connections downtown through the subway. The hotel has probably the nicest and most stylish rooms of all hotels I have stayed at in Europe. Only drawback (if you are sharing room with someone) is that there is a big window between the room and shower, and I have not found any way to close/block the view from the room into the shower. The hotel has a very good (but fairly expensive) breakfast buffet, and also a good, although small, fitness center.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear”bbrandal”,  Thank you very much for staying at the Mövenpick Hotel in Stuttgart and for having shared your experience on Tripadvisor.  It is a pleasure to count you among our loyal guests and to read that you like the location of the hotel as well as the room amenities.   Should you stay with another person, please do not hesitate to mention it to our reservation team. We do have rooms with a separated bathrooms. Regarding our rooms with a glass window between the bathroom and bedroom, they are especially meant for our guests travelling alone. The architect´s idea behind this concept is to let the natural light enter into the bathroom as well.  For your breakfast, you always have the choice between the breakfast buffet and our breakfast à la carte if you wish so.  We are looking forward to welcome you back during your next stay in Germany and wish you all the best in the meantime!  Kind Regards Tiaré de Vries Online reputation managerRead more
