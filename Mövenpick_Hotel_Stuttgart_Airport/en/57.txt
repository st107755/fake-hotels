Stayed here for 3 nights in room 1101. I thought the room would be noisy, but it was fine. The room itself is good, bt why design a shower that is bound to leak water onto the floor?? Ate in the hotel restaurant 2 nights running with colleagues and whilst the food is good, the service is hopeless- not the waiting staff who were polite and reasonably attentive, but the speed of service. On the 1st occasion it took 40 minutes for the starters to arrive and it wasn’t much better on the 2nd night!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 3, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for staying at our hotel and for sharing your experience.
