The room was spacious.  The bed very comfortable.  And the walk-in shower to die for.  It had a window into the sleeping area.  Great for watching TV if you are alone.    Even though the airport is right across the street from the airport - there is no noise from the airport.  But.....from the hallway. Quite noisy.  Disappointing.  The lounge is lovely.  The service OK.  The wine selection FABULOUS.  The cake....not so fabulous.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 18, 2017 Dear Guest,   thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport &  Messe.
