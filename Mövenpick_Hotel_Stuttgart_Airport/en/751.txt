We stayed at the Movenpick for 4 nights recently while visiting Stuttgart for a wedding. I cannot say enough about this hotel. It was wonderful in every way. The location is excellent - steps away from the airport and train system. The rooms are beautiful and spacious - very modern design and extra clean. And, the breakfast is top notch. We travelled Europe for 2 weeks following our stay at the Movenpick and the breakfast at Movenpick was far superior to any other hotel we stayed in.  The hotel staff was also great - very accommodating to all our needs.  Highly recommend the Movenpick.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 28, 2012Dear KStroupe,  Thank you so much for this great feedback, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay and that you have highly recommended the Moevenpick Hotel in Stuttgart to other Tripadvisor users.
