A missed flight forced me to stay overnight here. I had bed (extremely comfortable) and breakfast (delicious rosti and german sausages). Breakfast served until about 11 a.m, which was ideal....one could make it brunch!  The rooms are adequately spacious and the bathrooms have an oriental feel to them, with black basalt stone type tiling and walk in showers.  The hotel is right on the airport concourse and convenient for check in, but beware the lifts - you need your key card to operate them, a useful security measure, but one which confused me to start with.   Ideal and very fit for purpose!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Assistant Front Office Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Juridique,  thank you for taking the time to share your opinion with us.
