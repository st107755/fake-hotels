I have stayed at Stuttgart location several times. It is very convenient to STR for departures.

It is always helpful for us to get feedback on how our guests such as yourself are feeling within the hotel.  We are happy that you enjoyed again our convenient location at Stuttgart Airport.  The coffee station near the lobby was ordered by our conference guests and marked as a coffee break for the event. We are sorry that this was not obvious enough recognizable.
