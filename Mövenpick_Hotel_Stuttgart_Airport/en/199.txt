I usually stay here when flying in or out of Stuttgart airport as it's so incredibly convenient. It's an excellent hotel, with friendly, helpful bilingual staff, and I've always enjoyed my stays here. The restaurant is a little expensive, and the parking, although discounted, is typical of inflated airport pricing.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 18, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your positive feedback and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.  We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you highlighted our friendly and helpful staff. Thank you for this motivation!  Regarding your comment concerning our restaurant prices, we do aim at guaranteeing a great choice of dishes at a very good quality, excellent service and fair value. We regret that this was not your impression and we hope that you still enjoyed your dinner or lunch in the restaurant. In regards to your comment on our parking prices we do feel that a € 1,- charge per hour for restaurant guests and € 21,- for overnight with 24 hours is according to market and location while many downtown parking spots are far above these prices.    We are looking forward to welcoming you back again in the not too distant future.  In the meantime we wish you all the best.  Best regards  Tanja Rollny – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
