The rooms are clean and spacious enough (we had a twin double bed room in the 5th floor). The employees are friendly, well trained and skilled. Food is good and the breakfast buffet did meet our expectations as well. The location is very convenient, if you like to be close to the airport. My only complain regards the very hard & uncomfortable mattress which I didn't like at all. Overall we were very happy and recently I have been to a hotel next door which was not half as good as this one.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 17, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stopover at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com.
