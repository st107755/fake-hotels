It was an amazing stay at Moevenpick hotel in Stuttgart! The room was spacious, well designed and very quiet. The food at the restaurant was great, especially the meat. The cocktails at the bar were also great, and the steam room was "too steamy", also the water foot massage in the spa center. The service and the friendly staff made our stay great. We could have used a swimming pool facility as the temperature was very high. Definitely will stay again whenever we go back to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 16, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on tripadvisor.com.
