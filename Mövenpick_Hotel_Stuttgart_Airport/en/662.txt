Moevenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe has always been my first choice and its so far the best choice if heading to Stuttgart to participate at or walk a show at the Messe. Well appointed rooms,Great hospitality,Good food and drinks selection,an Attentive Staff and Excellent service are the hallmarks of this fine hotel property.  What also makes me most amazed and delighted that the cheerful bartender in the lobby bar always remembers that my drink should have only 1 ice cube....
