I chose this hotel based on the previous reviews and wholeheartedly agree.  This is a great hotel and the fact that it is on the airport premises makes it even better. Check in was a breeze, even though I arrived at 10am.  Very nice Fitness Center with new equipment.  Dinner in the restaurant was excellent with great service and delicious food. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Stuttgart!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 7, 2013Dear “ContrastQueen”,  Thank you for your great feedback on Tripadvisor!
