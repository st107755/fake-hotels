Great hotel close to Stuttgart airport. Bit of an adventure to get to checking area with car. Once there all was well. Recommend if you need to drop off rental and short time to get to airport. Continental breakfast was not much. Bread roll, jam coffee and juice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback on Tripadvisor and the time you spent in our hotel.
