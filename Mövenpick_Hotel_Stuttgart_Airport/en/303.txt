This hotel is a really nice place to stay. Good insonorisation. Very near from the airport (1 minute walking). My room was very spacious and very well equiped. The bed is very comfortable.  Lot of choice for the breakfast in a very very pleasant room. Staff is friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 21, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
