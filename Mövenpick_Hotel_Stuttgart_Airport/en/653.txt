This hotel is located less than 100m from the terminal at the airport.   The rooms have modern decor, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom very nice. It's very clean.  The hotel also boosts a good bar with great bar food, and an above average fitness/ wellness centre. One of my favourite hotels.  Service in the bar and reception was very professional and friendly.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 14, 2014Dear Guest,   thank you for your great feedback for the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
