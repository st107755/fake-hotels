The hotel appears to be very new and it is in great shape with nice rooms. It is literally across the street from the airport terminal so you can walk several hundred feet to the hotel.   Food and service at the hotel was good and consistent. Parking was 30 Euro and you have to deal with that every time you leave the hotel with your car. You pay only 1x per day but you need a new card every time you leave with your car. Not convenient.  The gym / spa facilities were very good.
