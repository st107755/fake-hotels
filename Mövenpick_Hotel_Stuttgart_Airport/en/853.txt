We stayed here 1 night as we had an early flight from Stuttgart airport the following morning. The room was very luxurious with a very trendy bathroom. We didn't have breakfast as we had to leave so early & it was expensive. We couldn't eat 25 Euros worth of breakfast at that hour (or at any hour of the day come to that) Staff were all very polite & efficient & it was a 5 minute walk to airport check in desk. The room was expensive but you are paying for the convenience of location. It does what it says on the tin.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
