Charges extra for parking, Internet and breakfast. Just give us one price instead of trying to hide the fees. It feels a bit cheap to get charged all these extras from what should be a quality hotel.   Thanks                      Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from jkoehler, Geschäftsführer at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 13, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you very much for your recent visit at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and we appreciate that you took the time to let us know where you were satisfied with our hotel and what could be improved.  We regret, that not all additional costs were apparent for you however we feel, that the heading of the comment could be misleading. At no time we are hiding any applicable costs and rates. We publish all fees on our homepage as well as on different booking sites like the one you booked through.  In addition our front office team is pleased to inform our guests about these things on arrival. Our menus in the restaurant for breakfast or other meal periods clearly show all charges applicable as does the Guest Service Directory including the Room Service Menu.  The Wi-Fi in our hotel is free of charge in all room categories. In our Superior category you can use 1 MB Internet for free with three devices, in our Premium category 10 MB without any charge. We do not know how your comment came about as we see none of the charges you mention as being consumed.  Regarding the breakfast, I would like to inform you that you have the choice between the buffet where all hot drinks, egg specialties, fresh juices and much more is included and a smaller breakfast à la carte with individual prices. For your next stay please ask our reservation department for a rate including breakfast.  As for the parking it does not make sense to us to increase all rates for inclusion of possible parking as not all guest arrive by car. And unfortunately we cannot offer the garage for free as it is operated by a separate company and is also an expensive venue. We feel though, that the rate, reduced by 50% for hotel guest, is a very good deal.  We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again and wish you all the best in the meantime.  Kind regardsRead more
