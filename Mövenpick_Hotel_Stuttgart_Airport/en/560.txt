Lovely rooms with great shower. Good English language TV options beyond 24 hour news. Lovely staff. Breakfast overpriced  I would stay again but not eat breakfast.  If coming from the airport it is not well signed to the hotel... Go out the door and you will see it.

It is a pleasure to read that you found the rooms very lovely as well as the friendly staff.   Regarding your feedback about the breakfast, we charge 23,50 EUR for our breakfast buffet. Our products served on our buffet consist of organic ingredients, regional products as well as our own Mövenpick brand products. Our highest aim – not only at breakfast times – is to ensure the best quality of all our products. In addition you have also the possibility to choose a breakfast à la carte.  Thank you also for your note regarding the way to get into our hotel from the airport. The distance between our Hotel and the airport is 50 metres. If you go out from the airport you can see our building directly on the other side of the street.  We appreciate your comments, because honest criticism gives us the motivation to improve and maintain our high standard and great hospitality.  Best Regards,  Anja Winter – Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
