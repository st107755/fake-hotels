It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay – thank you for your time to write this guest review.  Referring your comments about our design I have the following background for you: The glass between bedroom and bathroom is caused by daylight, which is really rare in hotel bathrooms.

We feel sorry that we could not reach your expectations with the other points in the room.  Thank you for your recommendation on TripAdvisor and by the way, you were the lucky one to catch that price as we have some very limited specials from time to time.   We wish you all the best and look forward to welcoming you back again soon.   Best greetings   Anne Spieth – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe  Read more
