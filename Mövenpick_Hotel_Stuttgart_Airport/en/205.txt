Love the room and the stay at the hotel. The only issue I had was that the staff was not as polite as I anticipate like in the states. When I explained I had issues for an company event I was planning - they pushed back and advised I did not understand my contracts. Also- when I asked the front desk ladies to asist in potential locations to eat in the city - they seems confused that I was asking for such a request. I would definitely stay here again - due do the cleanliness of the hotel and the amazing rooms. The location is point on as well.
