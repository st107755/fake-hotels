I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for two nights, whilst working at Messe. I work all over the world and have occupied so many standards of hotel.  Simply put. This hotel was up there with the best. Absolutely everything, inside and out was spotlessly clean and the attention to detail, incredible. All that I personally, appreciate.  Plus the hotel staff were very friendly and polite. Which makes me very fond of Germany throughout the cities frequented. I will definitely book this hotel on my return whereby, hopefully, I will have enough time to visit the Mercedes museum.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Enjoy your stay.
