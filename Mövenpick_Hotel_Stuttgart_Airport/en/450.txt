I stayed at this property for 4 days to attend a conference in Stuttgart at ICS. This hotel is literally outside the airport and you can walk to this property. The hotel is nice and the service is great. My room was clean, comfortable and spacious. The hotel wi-fi is free and the restaurant in the property has good food. Downtown is around 25 min train ride and will cost around $4 one way.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 24, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
