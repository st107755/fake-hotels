It has been a fast business trip as usual.  Late arrival, and i was not willing to go in the city at that time.  Just go outside the airport and you will get a fantastic isle to stay. Excellent dinner, excellent room, excellent services !  You'll wake up a little bit earlier to get the city, but it's Ok anyway.  Enjoy !Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 29, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
