Thank you for your appreciative words regarding our convenient location as well as your room and our sumptuous breakfast buffet.  Thank you also for your comment regarding the window in the bathroom. The idea of the hotel´s designer was to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. Nevertheless the bathroom windows are equipped with a roller blind, so that our guests have the possibility to separate the two areas.

Kind regards  Jürgen Köhler, General Manager - Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport  Read more
