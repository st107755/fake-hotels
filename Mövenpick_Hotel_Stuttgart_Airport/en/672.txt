The hotel is just opposite the airport, 100 meters to walk and you're there. The place looks quite and new and modern. The rooms are very modern with very nice bathroom and layout. I've spent a very quiet night an didn't hear any noise due to airplanes. The restaurant has very nice menu of traditional local food and even vegetarian selection.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 16, 2013Dear Alex,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience at the Mövenpick of Stuttgart.
