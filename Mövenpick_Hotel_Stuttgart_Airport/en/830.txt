Stayed here for a couple of nights on business, and would definitely stay here again. Its about three minutes walk from the airport. In fact there are two Movenpick hotels. One looks newer and is about 30 seconds walk from the airport, also more expensive. The one we stayed at is probably a little older, but dont let that put you off. I would stay there again without a second thought.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, checking in and out is a pretty quick process. Rooms are a good size and have a TV and minibar, unfortunately no coffee making facilities, although this did not bother us too much as we had a few drinks in the bar. The restaurant is pretty good also, I thoroughly enjoyed my evening meals and the buffet breakfast proved more than a match for us. Greatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
