The consistently good reviews speak for themselves. There is little to fault about this hotel. Modern interior with large spacious rooms. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Complimentary chocolate in the room along with fruit in the lobby. My room was facing the runway and I had no issues with noise. Only qualm is breakfast was expensive.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 10, 2012Dear strawberry_501,  Thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your opinion.
