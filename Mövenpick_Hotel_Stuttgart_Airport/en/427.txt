Excellent property located across the street from the Stuttgart Airport. The staff at the front desk was welcoming and informative.  The rooms are outstanding.  Very well appointed, comfortable bed and the bathroom was fabulous. I will definitely book this hotel again in the future.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
