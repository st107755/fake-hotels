The title basically say everything. Easy to reach from the airport arrival area you can even take the luggage cart to the room if you want. You will find a clean and spacious designed room even having Swarovski looking door knobs at the cabinet doors. After a quiet night you will find a breakfast providing everything needed for a good start into the day. Even fresh honeycomb. Needless to say eggs are prepared to your orders à la minute. Service extremely professional and friendly. For 120 Euro for 2 pax including breakfast an outstanding price performance. Certainly will be back!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 25, 2016Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your positive feedback and your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
