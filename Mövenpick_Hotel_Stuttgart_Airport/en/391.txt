Good standard hotel, walking distance from the terminal. Rooms comfortable, modern and clean. Walk in shower, no bath. Window from bedroom to bathroom could be great fun or bit uncomfortable for some. Hair drier could be more powerful. Efficient service, short taxi ride from the city centre. Recommend for a short or business stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 24, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
