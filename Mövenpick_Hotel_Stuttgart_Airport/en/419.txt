This Hotel was very comfortable and convenient for the airport!  It was wonderful to walk across the street right into the airport.  The dinner within the Hotel restaurant was delicious, and with high quality food!  Will absolutely stay at this Hotel again, and will advise my colleagues as well.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 3, 2016Dear Guest,  It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and that you like our convenient location as well as the quality in the Restaurant “Trollinger”.
