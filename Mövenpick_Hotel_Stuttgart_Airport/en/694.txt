I was departing very early from Stuttgart after spending time there for a business trip and so I decided to stay at the airport hotel the night before my flight.  The minute I stepped into the Moevenpick I was immediately impressed.  The hotel is very modern, clean and new.  The rooms are very comfortable with all the creature comforts you might expect in an upscale hotel.  Very tastefully decorated.  I had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and the food was fabulous.  I much preferred this hotel over the hotel where I stayed in town plus it was a fraction of the cost.  I highly recommend it!Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear „raek115“,  Thank you so much for your rewarding comment and for recommending us to other Tripadvisor users.
