It has a great location you can reach a different places from their to other cities in Baden-Württemberg.  it is good for all events. The restaurant and the food is delicious. The hotel atmosphere is great. The service is fast. The rooms are clean.  Maybe they don't have a swimming pool but that is not a big deal.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Verkaufsleiter at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 7, 2015Dear guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.
