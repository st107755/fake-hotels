I booked in for a night here to catch a very early morning flight and i was very impressed. firstly the hotel is literally a two minute walk from the terminal, the decor is great and it's modern and spacious. The rooms are massive and very clean and kind of funky with very cool decor. The service was great here as well and the bar staff friendly and attentive. As close as it was to the airport the rooms were soundproofed and i didn't hear one plane pass by. I was gutted that I only had seven hours here and would come back for a longer visit.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 25, 2017 Dear guest,  Thank you so much for this wonderful and detailed comment on TripAdvisor.
