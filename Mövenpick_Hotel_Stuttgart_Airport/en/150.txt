Great hotel right outside the airport arrivals. Modern clean and very comfortable. Great value and a good breakfast, the only downside was the ridiculously long wait to check in and when you got to the desk it took a good 10 minutes to get checked in, I have never experienced such a slow check in ever!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you for your review and for your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.   Perfect, that you value our convenient hotel, especially the cleanliness and our sumptuous breakfast buffet.   Regarding your comment concerning the waiting time at the reception, I regret that we did not come through to your expectations. Please be sure that our employees do everything to be there for you as fast as possible and that this situation does not meet the standard of our house. I cannot really say if it was because there were many guests checking in or because our system was the issue. I definitely want to apologize for any disappointment and we will do whatever possible to improve that situation.   Dear guest, we hope you had a great trip back home and we are looking forward to welcoming you back again soon during your next trip to Stuttgart.
