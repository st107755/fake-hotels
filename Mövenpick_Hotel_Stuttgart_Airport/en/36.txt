Rooms are specious and clean. Bathroom too. Breakfast is perfect. Staff is very nice and helpfull. Airport is 3 minutes away. I was there for a business trip and conference was right next to the hotel, less than 5 minutes away. So perfect hotel, perfect location, I really have nothing I could complain about. :)Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 25, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
