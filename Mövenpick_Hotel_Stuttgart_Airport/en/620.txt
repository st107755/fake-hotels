The Hotel is close to the airport and has a great entrance with acceptable gym. The parking entrance is across the street but you must chose the entrance with Hotel sign. After parking the car you may simply take the lift and you will find yourself inside the hotel. The lift can go straight up to your floor without the usual security stop at the lobby . The restaurant at the GF was great and the food was super delicious . The worst thing was the urine smell on the 3rd floor, it was really discouraging but inside the room was ok. Another bad thing was the glassed shower that did not have any curtain so if your 2 in the room the person inside the room should close his eyes.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 24, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on tripadvisor.com.
