As it is literally 100m from the terminal, I always stay here when I have an early flight home out of Stuttgart. This is a very good modern hotel with comfortable rooms and a good restaurant.   The breakfast fare is also good and Moevenpick's own fruit yoghurts are simply the best on the planet!  Like all airport hotels, prices depend on how far ahead you book, and if there is a conference nearby it gets booked out fast and becomes expensive. But if you know your itinerary weeks in advance it is very good value for money.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you very much for your lovely review on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.  We always strive to exceed expectations and provide a nice experience both in the hotel and in the restaurant. Therefore your feedback is very important for us and we are very happy that you like our convenient location as well as the comfortable rooms and our high quality restaurant. We want to say thank you again for your great comment regarding our Mövenpick fruit yoghurts.  It is right that our price depends on several factors. As in all Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts worldwide we are working with the best price policy. This means we always offer the best available room price at the time of the booking. On one hand on the booking situation in the hotel and on the other hand events like fairs and so on. If the demand for the hotel rooms increases, the room price goes up too.  Dear Guest, we are looking forward to welcome you soon again and in the meantime we wish you all the best.  Kind Regards  Anja Winter - Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
