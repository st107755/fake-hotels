quality of airport hotels can be difficult but not for this hotel. Beautiful, nice staff, good rooms and great atmosphere. Directly next to terminal so easy to walk too and also short walk to the car rental garage. They gave me a free upgrade as a first visitor, felt really nice and welcome.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019RoomsLocationServiceTrip type: Traveled on businessHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 2, 2020Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
