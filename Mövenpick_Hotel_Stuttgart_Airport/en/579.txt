A business trip brought is to this luxury hotel, two steps away from the Stuttgart airport,just across the road. Wonderful service,very clean and comfortable, delicious food, probably one of the best i know. Next to the Stuttgart fair it is nearly always booked. Don' t expected nice views there, there aren't. And this hotel certainly is not cheap.But because of it's location and quality it is worth what it costs. The perfect  business hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 2, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for your positive feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
