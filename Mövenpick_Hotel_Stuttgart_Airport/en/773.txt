One of the things I like about Germany, is that the culture is very hands on, no fuss. This is exactly what this hotel is about, excellently located a sidewalk away from the airport, you walk into a modern lobby, no one insisting on carrying your bag for a 5 Euro tip, up to check in, and straight to your modern, stylishly decorated room. Room has all necessary amenities (except CNN), and the shower looks on to the room. Going out? walk to the train station in the airport terminal, and you're connected to the city. Will definitely stay at the Movenpick again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Assistant at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 21, 2012Dear guest,   First of all we like to thank you for choosing our hotel and your time to describe your stay with us.
