Best airport hotel I have used in 40 years of travel.  Every aspect of the stay was excellent.  Will certainly stay there in the future.  All people are tops at their job and do not let you down.  Very quiet rooms.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Verkaufsleiter at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 7, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on tripadvisor.com.
