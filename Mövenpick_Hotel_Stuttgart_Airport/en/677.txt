Stayed at this hotel from Saturday to Sunday in order to attend a friends birthday party in Stuttgart. Was a loud to check in a bit earlier to get ready for the party. The check-in was both pleasant and efficient.  The room was awesome! Check their site or book a stay. Highly recommended and one of the coolest hotel rooms I have stayed in the last few years. The rate was reasonable on the weekend!  I did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but understood they have both buffet and ala carte. Look really good as I ran past to catch my flight :-)  I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I go back to Stuttgart. I paid 30-40 Euro to and from anywhere in the City by taxi, and it is a simple walk to the terminals at the airport. Worked great for me!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 7, 2013Dear „Tuscany Reviewer“,  Thank you so much for your rewarding feedback.
