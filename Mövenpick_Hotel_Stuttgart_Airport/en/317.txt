I stayed here overnight connecting flights on my way home from a trip. This hotel is right across from the airport and very easy to get to. I checked in late and the staff was very friendly. Definitely get breakfast included with your room- they have a delightful spread; bread station, meats, cheeses, made to order eggs, yogurt, and lots of beverage choices. The room was around $145 and definitely worth the price for the convenience factor, comfort of the room, friendly staff and great breakfast.
