We stumbled on this hotel by complete accident as on one trip we were getting in so late that getting to our final destination would have been questionable. since then, we have stayed here at least 5 times. The location is ideal to a wide range of towns. The rooms are excellent by area standards. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 23, 2014Dear Guests,   Thank you so much for your helpful feedback to many other TripAdvisor users and travellers.
