We stayed at the Movevepick on and off for two weeks over Christmas vacation.  The rooms are immaculate, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the food was awesome!  I highly recommend this hotel.  It is just across the street from the airport which makes it super convenient for travelers, and I never noticed any airplane noise while were were there.  Can not say enough good things about this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 9, 2011Dear Mr. suem040,  thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your opinion.
