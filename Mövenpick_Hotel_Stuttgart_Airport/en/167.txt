Spent one night in this hotel, which goes well beyond the standard airport hotel. Superb atmosphere, high quality materials and finishing, professional staff, very comfortable room where you can finally have a rest in total comfort and silence. Good breakfast (even if slightly expensive, 25 euros!).
