i Stayed at The hotel for One night during a fair and i liked The hotel a lot. The room was spacious, clean and had modern furniture. The Bathroom was fully equipped with a seperate toilet. Comfortable bed and good sleep. Breakfast was great for 12 euros with fresh Omelettes and Overall a Very good Selection. Even though The Hotel is right next to The Airport, no noice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 20, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
