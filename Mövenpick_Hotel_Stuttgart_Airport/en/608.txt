We have stayed here several times before morning flights back to the states. It is consistently good.  Rooms are comfortable, staff is nice and food in restaurant and bar is much better than in many hotels. Parking is rather expensive as I found last week since it was the first time I had needed that service. Overall a great airport hotel. 3 minute walk to the terminal.

It is a great pleasure to read that you enjoyed the professional service as well as the atmosphere and the tasty food in our Restaurant Trollinger. Thank you for these positive comments which I am happy to share with my colleagues.  Regarding your comment concerning the cost for parking, please take into consideration, that our parking garage is managed by another company. Therefore we can’t offer parking for free, but with an reduction of ca 50%.  We are looking forward to welcoming you soon again in the near future. In the meantime we wish you all the best.  Kind regards  Beatrix SteinmetzRead more
