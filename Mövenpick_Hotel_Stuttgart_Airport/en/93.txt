The Mövenpick has me used to the good life. Right across from the airport which is a very big plus for me, decent, clean, comfortable rooms, with good internet connection and little to no noise save for the occasional passer by in the hallway. Breakfast is very good with a large selection of most of your all time favorites. The restaurant is good enough in terms of selection and the food is actually very satisfying. Room service, always very accommodating as is the rest of the staff. Do yourself a favor: if you're in town and need a place to stay for a short business trip that is also near to the airport and with very good standards, then go with Mövenpick. I doubt you'll be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: November 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 24, 2017Dear guest, Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay in Stuttgart.
