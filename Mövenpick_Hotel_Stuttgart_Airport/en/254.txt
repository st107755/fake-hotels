Great Stay for Airport, location it is good, service it is good, it could be better rate but in general it was worthy for the price. Cleanliness very good, smiley people and ready to help in anytime if you need them.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 27, 2016Dear Guest, I really appreciate you taking your valuable time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
