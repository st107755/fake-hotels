I stayed at the hotel during a business trip, while i had a very early flight in the morning. I can say that it was a great choice. From the hotel you can walk to the airport in a minute. The hotel is very clean, rooms are big enough - bathroom is designed super modern and chic.The breakfast is ideal - but not a great buffet - starts at 5:30 so you can have your breakfast before you leave. I checked my luggage in the airport, and then came back to hotel and had my breakfast more relaxed...  The staff is very very very friendly. Even though i checked out at 6:30 in the morning they were energic and smiling. I would definitely recommend to everyone who will stay for short time - and do not have time to loose on the way.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 26, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your feedback on tripadvisor.com  and your stay in our property.  We are happy to see that you highlighted our great location as well as the service and hospitality.  I cannot really interpret your comment regarding our breakfast buffet. With over 150 items the variety is a great one and the alternative with a la carte is also there.   We will look forward to welcoming you back again soon and wish you all the best for the meantime.
