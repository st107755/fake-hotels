Just spent two nights at this hotel. Nice room, friendly atmosphere and an excellent restaurant. My room was a decent size, very clean and very quiet.  The staff at this hotel gave excellent service - they were polite, attentive and anticipated my every need. I never had to ask for anything twice - and often didn't even need to ask at all! As well as staying there I also attended a small conference in one of the conference rooms - and again this was run smoothly and efficiently by the staff. I would certainly book there again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 22, 2011Dear Julie G,   We are always thankful for comments of our guests, because this gives us the possibility to develop our service standards to our client’s satisfaction.
