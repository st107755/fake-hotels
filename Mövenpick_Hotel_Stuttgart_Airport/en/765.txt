Situated 5 min walk to Stuttgart airport, this hotel is new and excellent. Large and welcoming lobby, big room with large bed. A special attention has been made to make you feel comfortable in a cosy environment. Very good situation to the airport for sure but also if you want to attend a congress at the exhibit center (you'll have to cross the road!). No noise at all despite the closeness of the airport. Breakfast is huge with an amazing choice of anything you can think off, but quite expensive (22€). Restaurant is high quality with a large choice of wines.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 2, 2012Dear fguitteny,  Thank you very much for your detailed and positive review on TripAdvisor.com.
