We stayed here for one night to catch a flight the next morning. We booked a Junior Suite since we were traveling with a child. We were just blown away by this room! OK, it took like 5 minutes to figure out how to turn on the lights LOL. You need to put your card key in the slot! But when the lights came on, WOW! The room was gorgeous. The fold out bed for our child was huge. Everything was of the absolute highest quality. My wife jumped for joy at the full-sized bath tub. I could go on and on. The restaurant was quite good as well. Obviously, the hotel also has easy access to the airport....a 30 second walk to the terminal. Yes, this place is not cheap, but they certainly deserve their prices. I would stay here again absolutely!! Great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 28, 2018Dear Guest,   What a pleasure - your rating is highly motivating!
