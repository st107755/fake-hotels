Service restaurant very poor! The lady was not very kind and did not even brought back the amount of money exceeding the bill! (Tip is optional not compulsory!). Poor behaviour for such a hotel. Hotel excellent and breakfast too! Very clean. Highly recommended.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 23, 2016Dear Guest,  I really appreciate you taking your valuable time to share your experience with the TripAdvisor community.  It is a pleasure to read that you found our hotel excellent and that you enjoyed our rich breakfast buffet as well. Many thanks for your recommendation.  Regarding your comments about the service at the restaurant I can assure you that this didn’t meet our idea from our regular high quality hospitality. Please apologize that the waitress forgot to give the change. I can only assume that the waitress misunderstood and thought that the difference would be the tip which of course is not compulsory. I shared your feedback with the team and hope that we have the chance to impress also with the service at our restaurant on your next stay.  Your patronage and loyalty are highly valued and appreciated. We will look forward to welcoming you back when your travels bring you back our way.  Best wishes  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
