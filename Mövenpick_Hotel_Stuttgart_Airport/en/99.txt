I stayed in this hotel 4 nights in junior suite. The location is very good when you are attending the conference in the exhibition center just around the corner. I’s also good for a stay close to the airport.  My suite was appointed very well and had a generous size. The windows are sound-proof what is very important for a good night sleep. The bed is comfortable, and bathroom is modern.  The hotel has 1 restaurant and 1 bar. The food in both venues is good, but nothing special. The only negative is a very slow service at the egg station at breakfast. Annoying if you don’t have much time to wait for your fried eggs.  I recommend this hotel for business travelers.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 7, 2017Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your feedback and your stay in our property.
