This is one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. I chose it for the location but was bowled over by what I got. Steps from the Stuttgart airport (itself a good experience). My room was large and comfortable, with plush carpets, nice linens, room safe, tea kettle and supplies, a luxurious bathroom/shower, and --rare for hotel rooms -- a comfortable chair and lamp for reading. The hotel is gorgeous, from lobby to bar to even the elevators, and staff are friendly and welcoming.I really can't recommend this enough and will seek out other Movenpicks on my travels. Truly excellent.Read moreDate of stay: January 2020RoomsCleanlinessServiceTrip type: Traveled on businessHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 10, 2020Dear Guest,   What a pleasure - your rating is highly motivating!
