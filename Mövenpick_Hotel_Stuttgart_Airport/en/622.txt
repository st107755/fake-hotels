A very classy hotel.  We went there on vacation, and did not feel the “business-like” environment.  Everything is provided for, with “Deutsche Gründlichkeit”, i.e. well organized.  Rooms are clean and quiet, and cosy.   The restaurant is very, very good.  We went there for dinner, and enjoyed.  And as usual in Germany, breakfast is abundant,  varied and fresh.  It is hard to stop going to the buffet, given the variety of tasteful food. One point for attention: as the hotel is very near the airport terminal, traffic might be congested at rush hours.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 21, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on tripadvisor.com.
