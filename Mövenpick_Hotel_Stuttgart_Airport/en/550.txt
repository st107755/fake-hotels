My second time staying here in 12 months. This is a great business hotel, everything you need for a pleasant and productive stay. Rooms are well appointed and very comfortable (though the black decor is an acquired taste), bathrooms are beautifully designed. There are loads of power points and the aircon is excellent. The restaurant has a great selection including German and Swiss favourites. Buffet options for all meals are well stocked. Convenience to the airport is unmatched - just step out and you're there.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 14, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback on Tripadvisor and your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
