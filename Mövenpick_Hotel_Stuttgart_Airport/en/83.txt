It is only 100m from the Stuttgart airport terminal, so no taxi needed.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear guest,   Thank you very much for your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport and your wonderful rating on Tripadvisor.
