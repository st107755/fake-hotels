The Moevepick at Stuttgart is fantastic. Great location, great food, great staff and a good nights sleep! The rooms are very quiet, which is not always the case being so close and when facing the airport. I was placed in a disabled room for the first night, which for me, being quite tall, is not very comfortable. I was moved without hesitation. Will definitely stay again and it will by my only choice at Stuttgart Airport!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 26, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you for having shared your experience on Tripadvisor.
