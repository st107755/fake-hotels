I spent a couple of nights here as I was attending an event at the Messe (100 meters walk). It's a very nice modern hotel, very clean with nice and quite funky rooms. The restaurant and food is decent hotel food, if you want better Stuttgart is only 20 mins away. The service was exceptionally good throughout my stay from check in to room service.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 29, 2012Dear alanps,  Thank you for sharing your opinion with us on Tripadvisor.
