Very convenient for very early or late flights. Def business persons hotel. Bayer was having a conference while we were there. Breakfast was very nice but very expensive. Room was big and quiet. Nice room touches. Bed was comfy.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 10, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback on TripAdvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
