If you are coming or going from the Stuttgart Airport, this hotel could not be in a better location.  We have stayed here before, and we will stay here again whenever we fly out of Stuttgart.  The food in the restaurant is great.  We have enjoyed it both times we stayed at the hotel.  The staff is extremely helpful.  However, there is one thing you definitely need to know if you plan to stay here.  You must tell them when you make your reservation if you will be having children or nonfamily members staying with you in the room.  Both times we have stayed here, our room had a glass wall separating the  shower from the bedroom.  So unless you want everyone in the bedroom to watch you take a shower, you need to be sure you get a room without that glass wall.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe. It is always helpful for us to get feedback on how our guests such as yourself are feeling within the hotel, as improvements can only be made following valuable comments.  We are happy that you like our hotel as well as our convenient location and the helpful staff.  Regarding your comment concerning the window to the bathroom, was the idea of the hotel´s designer to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. It is right that we also have a few rooms without a window which can be requested during you next reservation.  It would be great to welcoming you back again and for the meantime we wish you all the best.  Kind regards,  Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
