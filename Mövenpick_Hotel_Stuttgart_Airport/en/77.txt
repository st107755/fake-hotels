Enjoyed a lovely dinner with wine The spa is to die for - very beautiful, relaxing, and clean. Breakfast can be a quick or strung out affair. The offerings are plentiful, tastefully presented, and excellent quality. The TV channels in multiple languages are of abundance. The closest you can get to the airport.  A great last minute booking.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 27, 2017Dear guest,  Many thanks for your great feedback and your appreciative words.
