The Moevenpick is a very high end hotel within a few minutes walk of the Stuttgart airport.  They had a nice bar with good service.  The restaurant was a little lacking for such a high end hotel.  The buffet did not look very good for the money.  The rooms were nice with a very fancy bathroom that had a glass pane that allowed you to see into your room.  If you're travelling with a guest that you DON'T want to see you in the shower, that could be a problem.  The only  significant downside was the cost of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 11, 2012Dear PJT_NJ,  Thank you for your feedback and your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
