I spent one week working in stuttgart and movenpick was a nice surprise to call home. It’s almost inside the airport but you can’t hear anything inside your room. Rooms are brand new and stylish. Breakfast is amazing! The spa/sauna/gym is also above the average... the downside is  the distance from the downtown, but there’s a subway station inside the airport Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 15, 2018Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your lovely comment and your stay with us.
