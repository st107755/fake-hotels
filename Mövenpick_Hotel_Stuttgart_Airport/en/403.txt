We have organised surprise weekend away for our son's birthday. The stay in the hotel was brilliant ! We have enjoyed the spacious and comfortable Junior suit. All the small details made our stay more special. On my sons birthday after coming back from exploring Stuttgart surprise awaited on us in the room. There was a lovely little cacke with happy birthday message and a card. We have had brilliant weekend thanks to Mövenpick staff. I will definitely stay there again and would highly recommend.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 26, 2016Dear Guest,  I really appreciate you taking your valuable time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
