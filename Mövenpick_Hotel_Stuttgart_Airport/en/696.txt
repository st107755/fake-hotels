The location is so great, just in front of the Stuttgart Airport/train connection to Stuttgart Hbf. It is also extremely convenient to travelers for early flight schedules. I like this hotel and I am used to stay at this hotel twice a year. The room is very clean, quiet and the bed, pillows are excellently comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 3, 2013Dear Daniel  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback about your experience at our hotel.
