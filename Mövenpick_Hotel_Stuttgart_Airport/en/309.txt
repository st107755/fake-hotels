We stayed here before our long-haul flight back to Australia as we had to be at the airport by about 8.30am.  We left the hotel at 8.25am and were at the check-in counter at 8.30!  Despite being so close to the airport (literally over the road), the sound-proofing is excellent and the bedding is comfy.  You can catch the S-Bahn from the airport into the city and go out for dinner, see the museums etc.  It's all very easy.  I would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 24, 2016Dear Guest,  thank you so much for your lovely comment and your recommendation on TripAdvisor.
