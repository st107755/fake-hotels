I booked this hotel because it is on the airport property, and we could easily walk into the terminal directly from the hotel. The room was perfect.  Very high quality towels and bedding.  The bathroom facilities were excellent.  We got plenty of rest because the room was quiet. We also enjoyed the bar and had a drink there after we checked in.  The hotel staff at the font desk were always helpful. This hotel was the perfect way to end a nice, long visit to Germany.  We will be back again next year and stay at the Movenpick.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 7, 2017 Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your stay with us and your lovely feedback on TripAdvisor.
