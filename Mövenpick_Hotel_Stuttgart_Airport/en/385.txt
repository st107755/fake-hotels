Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel as a last minute weekend break for one night and really enjoyed our stay.  Ideally located 2 minute walk from the airport although you wouldn't know once at the hotel as we didn't notice any noise at all. Friendly and helpful staff, no problem at all when we requested a later check out. Beautiful, clean room and bathroom. Lovely spa facilities. We ate in the hotel restaurant for dinner which was fantastic food and service, as well as breakfast the next morning where there was lots of choice. Overall a great choice, you won't be disappointed.
