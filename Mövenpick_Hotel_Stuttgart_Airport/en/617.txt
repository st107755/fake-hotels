I stayed recently for a couple of nights at the end of a big work trip, waiting for partner to start holiday. I cannot say enough about the staff - the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever come across anywhere in the world!  the hotel was comfortable (partner thinks it's the most comfortable bed he's ever slept in), very clean and great location to airport. the food in restaurant was very good and staff very helpful. i went across to the airport both mornings and grabbed something cheap there, located close to subway makes an easy trip into Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 29, 2014Dear Peta S,  Thank you so much for your rewarding feedback.
