Just steps away from the airport Terminals and the S-Bahn, this hotel is perfectly situated for any traveler.  30 minute S-Bahn ride to the downtown areas (3.60 euro one way).  The hotel is new, modern and has all of the amenities any holiday traveler or business traveler could ask for.  What sets this hotel apart is their level of service.  They quickly resolve any issues you might have in a friendly and professional manner.  Checkin was smooth and hassle free.  The room was spotless, comfortable and quiet.  Overall - the perfect place to stay!  When we travel to Germany, this hotel alone will have us flying into Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 16, 2013Dear „SlotF16“  Thank you very much for having shared your experience about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
