We are happy that you like our convenient location as well as the comfortable and clean rooms. It is right that our location is great. It takes only 20 minutes from the airport to the city centre.  Regarding your comment concerning the price, I can say that our price depends on several factors. As in all Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts worldwide we are working with the best price policy. This means we always offer the best available room price at the time of the booking. On one hand on the booking situation in the hotel and on the other hand events like fairs and so on. If the demand for the hotel rooms increases, the room price goes up too.  Suggestions and critics always help us to improve ourselves in order to meet our guests expectations. Please be assured, that your experience at our restaurant “Trollinger” didn’t met our idea from our regular high quality hospitality and I like to apologize for this inconveniences.  It will be a pleasure to welcome you back during your next trip to Stuttgart. In the meantime we wish you all the best.
