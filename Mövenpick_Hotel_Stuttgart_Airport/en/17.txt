Bed mattress is sooo uncomfortable it makes sleeping impossible. No black out drapes to make it dark making lights in night cityscape seem like day in your room. Staff were not friendly or helpful. In fact, they were useless. Forget about staying here! Location is its only positive aspect, except even with that, you have to be walking IN street WITH traffic to get to airport, very hazardous and unsafe indeed with luggage and many vehicles! They did not consider your safety in this matter at all! Go elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 27, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you for your review.  We are a little bit confused if your feedback refers to our hotel as there are some aspects that do not match with our house: All our rooms are equipped with black out curtains and new mattresses. Moreover, our hotel is located only 50 metres from the airport and you do not have to cross a street to get there.  Dear Guest, we would appreciate if you could please make sure that your review is on the right site. We are looking forward to your feedback – thank you in advance and best regards,  Jürgen Köhler, General Manager – Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport Read more
