I arrived late in the evening and left right after breakfast and therefore my review is limited. The good things are that the hotel is within a walking distance from the airport, the staff is friendly and efficient and the breakfast is just what you need to start the day with. The down side is the room, it's a little old and worn, and the quality of my sleep was not as good as I hope it will be.Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 9, 2011Dear Mr. ybaram,  First of all, we would like to appologize for the delayed response.
