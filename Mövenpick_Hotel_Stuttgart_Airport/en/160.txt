Really convenient and facilities and staff are excellent.  I have stayed here a few times and it always delivers a good experience.  Breakfast and meeting areas are well located and high standard.  Location just a walk from the airport makes travel on early/late flights easy, I worked at the hotel while waiting for my flight knowing it was 5 minutes walk to the check in desk when I was ready.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 10, 2017Dear Guest,  We really appreciate you taking your valuable time to share your experience with the TripAdvisor community – thank you!
