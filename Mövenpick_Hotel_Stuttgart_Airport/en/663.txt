I stayed at the Movenpick 2 nights in October. I voiced a few issues in their email survey... and was surprised to get a well thought out - personal letter from their GM (Mr. Kohler).    He explained that his staff was working the issues, and provided a rebate of 50  Euros in compensation. (He didnt have to do that)  It is clear to me that the reason this hotel is rated so highly, is their staff is very dedicated to the comfort of their guests.  I would stay there again...
