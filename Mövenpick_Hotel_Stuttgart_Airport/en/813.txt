We leave Denmark early in the morning and have 2 hours in Stuttgart Airport before we should continue our travel. We went to the bar in the lobby just next to the airport. The waiter in the bar came fast and with a smile and super service he gets us what we needed. He also went to the reception for us and pick up the codes so we could come on our mail server. The environment was nice and friendly, soft music, good internet connection and power for the laptops at the table. All in all a very nice experience. I can only recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 3, 2011Dear Hansen_Esbjerg,  Thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your opinion.
