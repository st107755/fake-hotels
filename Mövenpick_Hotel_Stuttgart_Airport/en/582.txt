stayed one night ahead of flight out of Stuttgart airport which is a 2 min walk from hotel. Good hotel - polite staff, nice decor, rooms decent size, well appointed, modern and spotless. Importantly they are very well sound insulated which was a concern for a location on any airport. Restaurant was fine - nothing special and breakfast was good. Good wifi made working easy. Would definitely return if travels bring me to this part of Germany again.
