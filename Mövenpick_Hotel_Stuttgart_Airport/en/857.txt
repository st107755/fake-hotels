My husband and  I stayed here in May as we had a 7:00am flight out the following morning. The check-in was efficient and very friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant with friends from Stuttgart and it was really excellent and great value for money - 10 out of 10. The rooms are very modern and sleek with a great bathroom and very comfy king-sized bed. The early check-out was also very friendly and efficient - when we said we did not have time for breakfast the lady at the front desk gave us 2 ice cold smoothies - some sort of berries - great. We got a superb rate through the hotel web side - about 100 euros for the night.Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
