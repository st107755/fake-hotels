Stayed there for two nights. Rooms are quite stylish and spacious. Bathroom is very nice even though the glass door between the shower and the bed might be a bit disturbing if you staying there for two and one switches on the lights in the morning. Rooms are also super soundproof. No noises from the airport which is near walking distance, 50 meters give or take. Staff is very friendly. Check in and check out was super quick and friendly although there were quite lots of other guests checking out.  Breakfast was very good. Lots of choices and good quality.  I can definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again.

It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay with us and above all the well-designed rooms, the convenient location and the friendly staff as well. It is right that our breakfast buffet contains a lot of choices and sustainable products.  Regarding your comment concerning the window to the bathroom, was the idea of the hotel´s designer to provide a bright bathroom with natural daylight. It is right that we also have a few rooms without a window which can be requested during you next reservation.  It would be great to welcoming you back again. For the meantime we wish you all the best.  Kind regards   Anja Winter – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & MesseRead more
