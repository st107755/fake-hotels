I stayed here for two nights and I was so satisfied with both the room, the service and the food served.  First of all the rooms are really cool and contemporary, yet comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was fresh and clean and I liked the many different light sources throughout the room. There is a good size mirror in the room, and a safe to be used for free. Wifi was included and worked sufficient.   The breakfast was extensive, fresh and somewhat innovative. Coffee was served by the table and among others you could have pretzels and energy bars. Of course there were also more traditional options.  The reception area has a very nice feel about it, and the service from the receptionists was impeccable.  I would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 6, 2014Dear Joakim,  Thank you so much for your helpful feedback to many other TripAdvisor users and travellers.
