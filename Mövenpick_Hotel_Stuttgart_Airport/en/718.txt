Although it was a quick overnight stay (and extremely convenient for an early morning departure out of Stuttgart), the Movenpick was incredible! The rooms were beautifully done and well equipped (including the comfortable leather arm chair and functional leather-top desk). And although it is directly next to the airport, the rooms were very quiet. The staff was pleasant and helpful.  And the cost was quite reasonable especially compared to similar hotels here in the US. If you have the opportunity to stay here, don't hesitate to do it!Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 22, 2013Dear Guest,  thank you for having shared your feedback about your stay in our hotel.
