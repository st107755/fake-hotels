Just 1 night stay. This is the 2nd time I've stayed. Everything here is excellent. The rooms, the service, the food etc. 1st class hotel. No noise from aircraft - you can hear it but only just. The perfect place to start your business trip. The restaurant food is very good and not too bad price for an airport hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 29, 2016Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your lovely comment and for your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
