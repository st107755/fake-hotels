I stayed in movenpick hotel stuttgart  in august 2010. Hotel i very good.Best thing is that it is at walking distance from airport that why i just booked my room there so that i can relax as early as i land up in stuttgart after a long journey. Staff, food and all is too good.One thing i would like to mention is the nature of staff.As i was new to stuttgart and also dont know german , I asked staff people which are fun places to roam in stuttgart and they told us in english and help us to guide us which place to go and how to reach the places.Overall a nice experienceRead moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 23, 2011Dear Mrs. urmilvermaa,   First of all we would like to thank you for your recent stay with us.
