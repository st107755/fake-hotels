An excellent hotel located right across the street (literally) from the Stuttgart airport.  The staff is professional and friendly; they anticipate your needs and really do work to make your stay stress free and enjoyable.  The restaurant is very good for all meals and the bar is well stocked (the bartender suggested a tequila, Sierra Milenario Extra Añejo, that I had never encountered in the US - it was excellent).  The rooms (at least the ones I have experienced) are well appointed, comfortable, and quiet. The proximity to the airport should not be underrated.  Shopping is easy and early morning departures and late arrivals are less stressful.  Getting to the conference center is a matter of a short walk.  Getting into downtown Stuttgart is quick and easy.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear guest,  Many thanks for your kind and detailed feedback.
