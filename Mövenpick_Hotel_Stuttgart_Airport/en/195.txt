Great for an airport hotel. Large property, with friendly and helpful staff to greet you and well appointed and nicely furnished rooms. Literally staggering distance from the airport exit.  Nice bar area, with plenty of seating and friendly bar staff. The only hotel to consider if you have to stay at the airport on business and are not on an overly tight budgetRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 4, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel and your lovely comment on TripAdvisor.
