The hotel has been opened in October 2007. Very modern design, almost sterile, a little bit dark. I was upraded to an executive room which has large bathroom with glass walls - you can watch your partner during shower and toilet (hazy glass door) if you like... Poor ventilation in the bathcroom. Beds are very comfortable. The main problem is poor noise insulation from the floor/ceiling. Unless you stay on the top floor you will hear people above you walking around very well, although there is a thick carpet. Since it is an airpot hotel people arrive late and check out early.Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
