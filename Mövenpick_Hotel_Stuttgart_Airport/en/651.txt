Excellent hotel with very large rooms, perfectly furnished (high style, fashion and luxury at the same time). Service is fast and smiley. Huge and high quality breakfast. Location is unbeatable, across the road from the apt and Stuttgart Messe.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 3, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for having given us your feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
