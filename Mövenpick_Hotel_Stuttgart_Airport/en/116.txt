Nice rooms, loved the clear glass in the wall which allowed to see the shower. Cool bar downstairs and nice restaurant upstairs, they also had a few veggie and vegan meals which really made my life easier haha service very high class and atmosphere is very classy.  However the breakfast was 25 eur and if you only eat something like cornflakes or want Coffey with a bagel that's just crazy, so I only had a cup of tea at the bar downstairs.
