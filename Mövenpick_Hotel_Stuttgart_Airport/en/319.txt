I stayed at the Stuttgart Airport location, for one night, prior to an early flight next morning. The hotel is directly across the street from the airport and is very clean and well-maintained. Reception staff are friendly and speak good English.  I did not use the restaurant, but would definitely recommend the hotel as a very good choice, for the money.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear guest,   At first I want to say Thank you for your detailed presentation about your experiences you made during your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
