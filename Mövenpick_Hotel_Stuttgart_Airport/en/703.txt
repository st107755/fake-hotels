Excellent stay at the Mövenpick for business and tourism, totally relaxing rooms, clean and comfortable. Very attentive staff and to provide help with the tour for places close to Stuttgart, I went to the Mercedes Benz museum and from the front desk I got all the details in order to arrive without problems, so it helped me to make a shopping tour in Metzingen they offered me the necessary information and reserves the passage. I just felt a very important person for Mövenpick.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 14, 2013Dear guest,  thank you for having taken the time to share your experience at the Mövenpick in Stuttgart, additionally to your comment about your dinner at our restaurant Trollinger.
