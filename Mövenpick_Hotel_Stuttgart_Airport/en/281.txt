Hotel availability can be a challenge in central Stuttgart during the Cannastatter Volksfest (Stuttgart’s Oktoberfest).  Based on the Trip Advisor rankings we booked a hotel at the airport/convention center.  The Movenpick is a modern hotel with spacious rooms.   The rooms were well appointed.  They also have a small exercise room for hotel guests.  The restaurant is high end and especially nice for dinner (a bit too formal for lunch).  The hotel rates are very competitive when there is not an ongoing convention.  The S-Bahn connection to downtown takes about 25 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Guest,   Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Booking.com.
