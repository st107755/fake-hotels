Stayed here one night scouting out the convention center. Very modern decor and layout. Rooms are very comfortable -- and surprisingly quite given the proximity to the airport. The staff was very friendly, and the breakfast selection was diverse. Great property!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 19, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you for your lovely feedback on Tripadvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
