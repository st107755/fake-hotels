I stayed at the Movenpick Stuttgart for business and found it to be a clean, modern, spacious, very well-appointed hotel that was situated about 10 steps from the arrivals area of the airport.  The rooms were impeccable, with high-quality beds, linen, etc.  The food, both at breakfast and at dinner, was incredibly fresh and creative.  Staff were friendly and responsive.  I would unequivocally recommend this hotel to others, and would stay again!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you so much for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
