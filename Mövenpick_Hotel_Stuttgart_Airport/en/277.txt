Clean, modern, comfortable rooms with all you need for a quick stay or when making airline connection.  Good restaurant and very helpful staff.  Convenient parking.  I would recommend this hotel for first nights rest when flying in from overseas or prior to embarking on vacation.  A bit utilitarian, but a very comfortable business hotel right across from airline terminal.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 27, 2016Dear Guest,   thank you very much for your lovely feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on TripAdvisor.
