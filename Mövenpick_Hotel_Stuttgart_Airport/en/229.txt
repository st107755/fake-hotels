I really enjoyed the stay. I worked at the Didacta fair 2017 and it's very close to Stuttgart Messe Hallen. As I said - lovely hotel, but wifi not up to par. I would love to come back, stay again - but I hope their wifi is better.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 24, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback of your stay during Didacta fair 2017 with us.
