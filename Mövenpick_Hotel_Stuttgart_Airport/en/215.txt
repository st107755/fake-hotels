I traveled to Stuttgart to attend a two day business session. I wanted to stay close to the airport so that it would be easy from a timing perspective. The hotel is located 200m away from the airport. Access is concenient. The accomodation is top class.The food is great. Their facilities are great.  The serice from the staff is outstanding. Have stayed here before and will do so again.
