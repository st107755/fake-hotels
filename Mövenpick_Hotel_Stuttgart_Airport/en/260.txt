Great rooms and amenities. Nice room size and appointed well. Literally right across the street from the airport. Great place to stay if you have an early morning flight. Good restaurant and fitness center. A nice bar if you are looking for a nightcap to relax.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 14, 2016Dear Guest,   thank you very much for your lovely feedback about your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
