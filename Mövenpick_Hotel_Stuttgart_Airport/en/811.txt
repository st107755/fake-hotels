This is one of the best hotels I ever stayed at outside of South Africa. Nothing is over-done, nothing is under-done. Rooms large enough and everything the way it should be.

Well done to management and staff.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 21, 2011Dear VPK-CT,  First of all, we would like to say thank you for choosing our hotel and we are therefore grateful for taking the time and letting us know your opinion.
