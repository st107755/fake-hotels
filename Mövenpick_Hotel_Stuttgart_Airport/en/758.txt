If you are traveling to Stuttgart this is an excelenty option where to stay. It`s not a cheap hotel but it`s value for your money specially if you are flying to Stuttgart as it is ideally located opposite to the terminal building. The acess to get to the hotel is very easy and the rooms are well furnished, kept and mainteined. The breakfast is very expensive.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 9, 2012Dear guest,  We are very glad that the location of the hotel did meet your needs and that you enjoyed the design and amenities of our hotel rooms.
