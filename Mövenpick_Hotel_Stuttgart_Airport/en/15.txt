Extremely well-designed for comfort, this is a lovely place to stay. Bed was luscious and firmness was adjustable with a remote control. Silent air conditioning so a good night’s sleep in silence and darkness. The restaurant is high-class with delicious fresh food offering some Swabian dishes. Exceptionally pleasant staff really put this hotel a cut above very many others. 1 minute walk to the terminal.
