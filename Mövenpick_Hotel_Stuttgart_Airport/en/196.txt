I love Movenpick hotels and the one in Stuttgart is great as well! Location is perfect for fairs visit,  also the airport is just next to the hotel. To reach downtown is very easy by metro, around 20 min. Or by car, but to avoid parking stories I suggest to take a subway. Rooms are big and beautiful, service and breakfasts are top.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 24, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you for your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and your lovely feedback on TripAdvisor.
