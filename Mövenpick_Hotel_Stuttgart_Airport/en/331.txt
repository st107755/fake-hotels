It is a pleasure to hear that you enjoyed our convenient location nearby the airport as well as the good quality of our house.  This year the summer starts really late and during the spring weather condition it is always hard to reach the right temperature as the air-condition system only kicks in at a certain temperature. We hope this is not a reason to visit us not again.  As in all Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts worldwide we are working with the best price policy. This means we always offer the best available room price at the time of the booking. The price setting depends on many factors, like trade fairs and congresses in Stuttgart, meetings and conventions in our hotel and further influences. Many airlines as well as international hotel chains are already working with these price settings. On the website of Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts we offer always the best available rates and early booking offers, on which you can save up to 30%.   We are looking forward to welcoming you back again soon and wish you all the in the meantime.   Kind regards  Victoria Zimmermann – Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
