This hotel is very well situated for those with an early flight or business travelers that want to get in and out. The airport terminal is right across the street and even in -6C weather the hop across isn't long enough to get cold.  The front desk staff are pleasant and easy going. The rooms are contemporary and nicely equipped. Some with nesspresso machines too. Overall well kept and clean.  I only ventured to the restaurant for an early breakfast buffet and the spread was fantastic. Good quality food.  Room service was also good but the menu was too short. Not many offerings for the late night dinner after a flight.  I would come back to this hotel on my next business trip to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Feb 13, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your detailed feedback on TripAdvisor and your stay in our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport and Messe.
