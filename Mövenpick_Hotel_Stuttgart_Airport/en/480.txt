My first stay at a Mövenpick hotel was just lovely... New hotel, modern installations and furniture, fresh colours. But that is less important, as a sense of quality is present everywhere. The room was big and comfortable. There was something odd about the bathroom, as there was no door to the washing area and, like I experienced at some hotels in Asia, a glass window between the shower area and the room. We thought it would be a problem, but in the end it wasn't a problem at all.  The best part was the breakfast, assorted with anything you may wish for starting your day. The parking was easily reachable from the hotel and you can get a discount rate as a hotel guest. Wonderful stay... I would for sure book this Mövenpick hotel againRead moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 16, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you so much for having shared your positive experience on Tripadvisor.
