Possibly the most modern hotel in Germany,but with all the features that one has become to expect of comfort and service of hotels of this group. Seriously, this is an excellent place to stay in Stuttgart particularly if you are visiting the Messe or starting to tour the Black Forest area. The restaurant was perfect and highly recommended with an excellent menu. It's a 50 M walk to the airport terminal and trolleys are available both to and from the hotel. If you're from the UK all the room have a tea and coffee facility!
