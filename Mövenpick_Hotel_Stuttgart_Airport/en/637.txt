Best Hotel for a layover, the airport is literally right there, you just have to cross the street and you're at the Terminal. Yet, you hear absolutely NO AIR TRAFFIC in the room!! Very peaceful and quiet which is amazing for a hotel which is right by the airport. Staff is super friendly, rooms are very spacious and luxurious. The bed was so comfortable I didn't even want to get up! We're staying here every time we're having a layover in Stuttgart, it's worth every cent! Perfect.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 16, 2014Dear Guest, thank you for having shared your feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com.
