Movenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport exceeded our expectations!  From the lobby to check-in, to the room, and beyond, our experience was perfection.  Cleanliness and special requests were well delivered.  The bar was a pleasant experience.  Having the airport directly across the street make our early morning departure stress free. I would definitely stay here again. 5 starsRead moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 4, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
