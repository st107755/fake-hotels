Modern, cleanlic, nice design of rooms and public areas. very comfortable bed, excellent bathroom, shower and all related amenities. early service of coffee for early departures. i had a very nice dinner in the first floor restaurant. just 5 minutes walk from the terminal entrance door....you just go out of the hotel, walk 3-5 minutes and you have entered the terminal.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 27, 2013Dear xipto,  thank you very much for taking the time to give us a feedback about your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe!
