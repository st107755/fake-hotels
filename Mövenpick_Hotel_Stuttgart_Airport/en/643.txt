We just stayed overnight because of an early flight; arrived late and left early. The hotel has the perfect location for that. The room was big and the bathroom beautiful. I am a bit sad that we didn't get to try out the restaurant, it definitely looked like it was worth a visit.  These were the best beds I have ever found in a hotel, I hate the over-soft ones where the whole bed shakes if you sneeze, and it is amazing that they have sound proofed it so well that no noise can be heard from the airport.  I also really appreciated that they had a small breakfast snack available for those who leave before breakfast is served, a cup of coffee and a breakfast croissant made our early start a good one.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 12, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com.
