The hotel is literally a minutes walk from terminal building of Stuttgart airport. The hotel is large and very comfortable, I really appreciated that it was exceptionally quiet in the guest rooms, even with all the aircraft and traffic noises around.  The hotel had a nice bar and I really enjoyed my breakfast in the morning.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 31, 2018Dear guest,  great that we meet your expectations- specially with the quiet rooms!
