I did 1 night here - scheduled a business lunch at the hotel and flew out.  Well above average for an airport locale. I had a junior suite with a comfortable if somewhat compact working area. Wifi was notably fast. The hotel restaurant which is open from before sunrise through 10PM or so turned out to be great for my meeting needs and ther breakfast was very good. 1 night - Junior King suite. Very quiet as well.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 28, 2017Dear Guest,   Thank you for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
