I enjoyed my three nights stay at this hotel . Is strategically located just across the street when you exit the terminal between the airport and Messe exhibition centre . The rooms are big , clean , comfort and quiet . the staff is very friendly and helpful . breakfast and dinner are great . the atmosphere is official . It's a 20 min by train to stuttgart center . Very recommended for business travelers , as a base to visit Messe Center and for travelers who need to reach the airport very easily . less recommended as a base for vacation at stuttgart area .Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 29, 2014Dear Amjd D,  Thank you so much for your recommendation on TripAdvisor.  We are very happy that you have chosen our Mövenpick Hotel for your trip to Stuttgart and that we could meet your expectations. It is correct, the airport is a mere of 50-metre walk away from our Hotel, the distance to the exhibition centre is also only 200-metre. Stuttgart's city centre is accessible by car or public transport within 20 minutes.  We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the near future.  Kind regards   Stephania Zimmermann Guest RelationsRead more
