This is my second time to stay at this hotel the night prior to leaving Stuttgart after a busy couple of weeks of travel and work. One can check into the hotel, turn in the rental car, and really relax in a very welcoming room with plenty of space. Airport luggage carts are at both hotel entrances, and it is a brief and easy walk even with a loaded luggage cart to the departure terminal and check-in desk. The hotel folks are truly friendly and helpful, even with a difficult request (could I have a badewanne please?) in a full house. I will keep coming back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Administrator at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 3, 2013Dear KL M,   Thank you for having chosen once again the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and having taking time to give us a feedback.
