With just a single road separating this hotel from the Stuttgart airport, this hotel is ideally located for those on the go. The staff is very accommodating and helpful. The rooms are pleasant and equipped to deal with your basic needs. The bathrooms are clean and functional while also being aesthetically pleasing. A high plus is the high definition TV and channels which include a large variety and many English spoken ones. Not something you get to see very often in Germany. Breakfast has a selection you become accustomed to and would expect at this level. All in all, I recommend it without hesitation.
