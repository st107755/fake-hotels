Fantastic hotel. Super rooms. Excellent place to stay when you are arriving late or having to fly off early. Friendly staff. Bar is also good to finish off the day prior to taking to the lift to your room.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 28, 2016Dear guest, It is a pleasure that you like our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and that you enjoyed your stay with us.
