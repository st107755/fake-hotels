Was visiting on a business trip, I was so tired and arrived at the Hotel some minutes past 2300hrs, The check in process was so flawless with very welcoming staff and friendly staff, Rooms are great clean and warm Despite the winter, comfortable bed and great breakfast spread.The only downside was I could not get a UK adapter Model - any way  managed to purchase one at the Airport shops. I would definitely visit again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 27, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you for this great feedback!
