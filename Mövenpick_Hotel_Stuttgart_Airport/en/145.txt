Nice hotel and good service. The food was good, the room comfortable, and everything was clean. I only had problems to park my car. The hotel parking was full the parking places outside were too expensive due to the proximity to the airport. We did a business event with 250 people and was good organized, except for the room temperature, which was too cold.

We always strive to exceed expectations and provide a nice experience in the hotel - therefore we are pleased to read that you that you like our convenient hotel as well as our culinary offer and the good organization of your event.  Regarding the parking situation we regret, that our hotel parking lot was already full. Due to our location directly at the airport, we do have limited parking capacities and during your stay we had an extremely high occupancy in our hotel.  Regarding the air conditioning in the meeting room we can say that if one is sitting directly under the ventilation it might be a bit cold. As a solution, the air conditioning can be adapted directly in the room or completely switched off by our technicians.   Dear guest, it would be a pleasure to welcome you back and in the meantime we wish you all the best.   Kind regards   Jürgen Köhler, General Manager - Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport  Read more
