The Location of the Hotel is perfect if you arrive by air, you can find it easy. The romms are excellent, everything works as a 5 star Hotel, they have a very nice "Schwäbisch" breakfast. I rented a car next morning, so that was really the best solution for my one night stay. I am sure it is also a good Location for conferences.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 31, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you so much for having shared your positive experience on TripAdvisor.
