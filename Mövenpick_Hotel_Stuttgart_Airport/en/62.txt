As an airport hotel, it was good, as a hotel in its own right, it was average. I paid way over the odds because of the trade show, so I will ignore this. The room was average and had no bath and a poor a/c. I asked to be moved and was given a fantastic junior suite. The comfort was good. Breakfast was average with very poor service. Coffee was decent though. Bar was ok, with decent cocktails. Reception staff were fine. There was nothing too friendly here though. The staff seemed subdued and disinterested , especially at breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 9, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you for staying at our hotel and for taking the time to write your review.  We are working with the best price policy which means that we always offer the best available room price at the time of the booking. The price setting depends on many factors, like vacation or weekend, trade fairs and congresses in Stuttgart, meetings and conventions in our hotel and further influences. Most international hotel chains are working with these price settings.  We are glad to hear that our staff was able to improve your stay as you were moved into a room that met your expectations. On the other hand, we are very sorry that you were displeased with our service. Please stay assured that this is not our standard and that we are trying our utmost to make the best of your stay.
