Great facilities very helpful staff and very good to eat in. Breakfast did not finish until 10.30 and there was no rush. Airport outside the door and walking distance 2 min to the train station and conference center. Would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 23, 2015Dear Guest,  First of all I want to thank you very much for your great feedback on TripAdvisor and for your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
