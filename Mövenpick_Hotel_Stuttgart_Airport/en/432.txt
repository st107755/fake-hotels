I booked this hotel last minute for a weekend trip to Stuttgart.  As we arrived late this hotel is just across the terminal so perfect and in the morning taking the S-Bahn is easy.  The hotel is modern, clean and staff very friendly and would certainly stay there again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 14, 2015Dear Patrick V,   it is great to read that you enjoy our hotel and that you found the location nearby the airport, fair and S-Bahn convenient as well.
