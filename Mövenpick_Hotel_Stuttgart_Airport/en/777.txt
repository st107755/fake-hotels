We stay at this hotel every time we pass by Stuttgart. It is very clean, the beds are huge and comfortable and the rooms are very quiet, you can't hear any planes from the airport. The breakfast is always fresh and tasty with a wide range of choice. This is the closest hotel to the airport, right next to it, and also close to Metzingen shopping village. Would recommend it absolutely!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Assistant at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 11, 2012Dear bonatella,  Thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your detailed feedback on Tripadvisor.com.
