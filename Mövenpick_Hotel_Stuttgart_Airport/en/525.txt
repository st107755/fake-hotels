You can not beat this hotel for ease of use  Within 20 minutes of landing I was checked in and in my room  Staff are superb. Always very helpful and incredibly friendly. Nice touch on check out of handing over a packet of sweets for the journey. These little touches certainly give it a personal touch  The rooms are modern and spacious   The breakfast is excellent with a wide range of fresh options  Simply can't be beaten in Stuttgart if travelling on businessRead moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 24, 2015Dear Guest,  For your lovely feedback on TripAdvisor we want to say thank you.
