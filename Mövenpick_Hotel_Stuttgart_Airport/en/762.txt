I make frequent business trips to Stuttgart and this hotel is fantastic.  I arrive at the airport late at night, walk across the street to the hotel, and hit the sack in a nice, clean, comfy room.  You would think that airport noise would be a problem, but somehow the hotel is superbly and effectively soundproofed.  I get up the next morning, have a fabulous breakfast buffet, walk over to pick up the rental car, and I'm away to my business activities.  The rooms are great, the spa is great, the restaurant is great, the staff are wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 2, 2012Dear AmateurAdventurer,  thank you for being our guest and for writing this friendly review.
