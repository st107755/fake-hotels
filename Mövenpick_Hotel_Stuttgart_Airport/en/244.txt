Our aim is to provide our guests a comfortable and friendly atmosphere. I’m very sorry, that we didn’t come up to your expectations.   Unfortunately at your booking was no room preference given and at your check In we had only our smoking room Junior Suite available.   So you got an upgrade into our Junior Suite, as my colleague told you at Check In.  We apologize once again for the inconveniences and it would be a pleasure for us to welcoming you again at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe in the not too distant future.  Sincerely,  Victoria Zimmermann - Guest Relations, Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe Read more
