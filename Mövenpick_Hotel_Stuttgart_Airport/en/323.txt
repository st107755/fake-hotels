Movenpick is very conveniently located within walking distance from the airport as well as Stuttgart Messe expo halls. Hotel itself is a high quality business hotel and the premises are in a good condition overall. Staff was neutral but effective, i.e. check-in & -out worked smoothly. I had a burger meal from room service menu and it was of good quality and came quickly. Breakfast buffet is also of high quality so Movenpick is a recommend stay if you plan to visit Stuttgart Messe.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 26, 2016Dear guest,  Thank you for your wonderful words you are sharing on TripAdvisor.
