I stayed in MovenPick as i had a early morning flight out of Stuttgart, The rooms were excellent and this is situated within the airport. The food there is quiet expensive and since i had to leave very early in the morning i didnt get to taste it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Sales Administrator at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 12, 2014Dear Guest,   Thank you for having given your opinion about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe on Tripadvisor.com.
