Excellent location at the airport. All facilities are top. Only during breakfast the waiters might overlook you if you want coffee, which is excellent btw. The bed do have an inflation mechanisms to alter support for various body areas. For me only the head/shoulder area worked, while I would have preferred some extra support for my back. So I deflated all, resulting in a very soft matras, which did work out quite well in the end.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback on Tripadvisor and your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
