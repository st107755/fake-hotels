Near to the airport and the ‘messe’ or fair it is rather a very busy place. Book in advance or prices could explode. I got a nice room but still possible to hear airplanes. Bit surprising but not extremely disturbing. I was there for a fair so crowded but the staff handled it smoothly. Enjoyed the dinner and had a great time at the bar where the bartender gave an exceptional good service. During the breakfast it felt stressful, if you are alone and they clean and serve the table away before you come back from the buffet, I wasn’t that pleased. So this space I would rate under dimensioned.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Geschäftsführer at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 25, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you so much for your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
