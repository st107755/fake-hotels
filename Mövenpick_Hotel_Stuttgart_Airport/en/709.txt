Only booked as we were arriving on a late night flight and needed a hotel close by.  The hotel is no more than a couple of minutes walk from the terminal but has no noticeable noise intrusion.  Really surprised by the interior quality, this is really top drawer stuff matched to perfect service, well done.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 5, 2013Dear Mark,  Thank you for having rated us on Tripadvisor after your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
