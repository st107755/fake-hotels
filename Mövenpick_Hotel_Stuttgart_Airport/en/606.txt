Modern and right across the street from the airport. It's like 50 yards away. It's always staffed which is very helpful if you get in late as most hotels, car rental agencies, etc close by 1100PM. We do a fair amount of travelling to Reutlingen and the surrounding towns and rather than stay down there we stay here. The facilities are nicer the travel time is about the same. Contemporary fixtures. Really a great find for us.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 30, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us and for recommending us to other Tripadvisor users!
