I have stayed here before due to the friendly nature and helpful personnel and the convenience to the airport (right across the street) as well as the subway entrance at the airport to get downtown or other sights. In this stay I had booked a long time ago and forgotten I had booked already. They found the double booking and took care of it without any bother to me making sure I had the lower rate.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relation at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
