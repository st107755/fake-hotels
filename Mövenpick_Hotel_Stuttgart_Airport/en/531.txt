This was an excellent hotel. It was very comfortable, very classy, and very convenient. The rooms are have lots of space, all the modern amenities, and are modern. The breakfast was amazing. All the choices one could imagine and everything of high quality. Staff were professional, helpful, and go out of their way at every opportunity. Also, they have a nice bar / lounge area and Internet worked everywhere in the facilities.
