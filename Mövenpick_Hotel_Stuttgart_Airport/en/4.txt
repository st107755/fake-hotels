We had an early morning flight, so we decided to spend the night at the Movenpick. For convenience, it can't be beat. It was a short walk, maybe five minutes, from the hotel's entrance to the terminal.  The room was quiet, and furnishings were modern and in good condition. Unfortunately, the climate control didn't work that well. Even with the thermostat turned down as low as possible, the room was uncomfortably warm for sleeping.  The bathroom is compact and doesn't afford much privacy, but it was up-to-date.  Front desk staff were professional and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019ValueLocationServiceHelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 2, 2020Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback on your most recent visit to our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport.
