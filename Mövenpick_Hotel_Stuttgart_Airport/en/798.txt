Just arrived around 10PM for a delay of a Flight, and spent there the night before leaving at 5:30 for the next connection. Very nice people at the reception, got all the information and the flexibility to pay in advance in order to avoid issues in the early morning. Very nice, clean, silent and comfortable single room. In the morning, free small croissant and coffee ... great service!!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 18, 2011Dear Superscricciolina,  Thank you very much for providing us with your frank opinion what allows us to improve our standards according to our customers wishes and also to solve problems that creep in to the daily work routine.
