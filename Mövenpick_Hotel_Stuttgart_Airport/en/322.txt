Excellent hotel by the airport, just cross the street and you´ll be there. I stayed just for one night because I didn´t want to sleep at the airport and I had a really earty flight. Great experience, I would recommend this stay.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear guest,  It is a pleasure to hear that you have been excited about our excellent location with direct access to Stuttgart Airport.
