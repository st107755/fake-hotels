Difficult to rate airport hotels as they  have many similarities however the Stuttgart Movenpick must rate near the top. Easy to find. Directly across from the arrivals exit. Rooms very comfortable with all amenities. Staff helpful and friendly.  Excellent restaurant with varied menu and wine lists.This is of course an airport hotel suitable for overnights so you are left  to your own devices for entertainment apart from what is available in the room which is quite all - embracing including room fridge!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Oct 27, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you for having shared your feedback.
