Booked this hotel for business travel. Plans changed and needed to cancel after less then 24 hours from booking time. Initial response was quick saying I would not be getting a refund if I cancelled. When I responded asking them if my booking had been cancelled, no reply. I was completely ignored. Would have loved to get a response to any one of my 3 follow up emails. Will never book this place again. Customer service does not take their jobs seriously.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear guest,   herewith I would like to apologize that you did not receive the proper attention and answers that are expected and that you should have received from us.   Some of our rates, the so-called “early booking rates” are lower-priced and therefore also not cancellable, maybe this was the case of your booking.  I would like to help you further and understand your situation, in order for that I would need the details of your booking (reservation confirmation). I will send  you a direct email  via Tripadvisor with my contact data in order for you to send me the necessary document.  Thank you very much for your comprehension and patience.   Kind Regards Tiaré de Vries Online reputation managerRead more
