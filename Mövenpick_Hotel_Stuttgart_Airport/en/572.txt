I stayed there for a convention in the Stuttgarter Messe. Rooms are basic, but clean, modern shower, nice touches such as fresh green in the bathroom. Breakfast was well organized with lots of different items to choose from. There is a Wifi connection, but as usual the faster the more money you pay, I think is  something the hotel should only offer WiFi for free. TV has plenty of channels to choose from. I stayed in a room without a bath. Toilets are not close to the meeting rooms on ground level, which is inconvenient.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Apr 30, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to rate your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel  Stuttgart  Airport & Messe on tripadvisor.com.
