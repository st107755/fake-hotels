For business a colleague and I had to travel to Stuttgart for a meeting and view a trade show, we decided to travel after work on a Monday and stay on the airport complex in Germany, we decided to stay at the movenpick and I am very pleased we did, upon arrival we walked the five minutes to the hotel from the terminal and was greeted by a professional receptionist who upgraded our rooms and spoke perfect English, she explained everything to us and we ventured to the bar after dropping our luggage off. The room was fantastic, clean and very modern, the bathroom was extremely modern. The breakfast was laid out very well and very enjoyable. good value for money.   The overall experience was fantastic and I would recommend this hotelRead moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 26, 2013Dear andy c,  first of all I would like to thank you for your stay at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
