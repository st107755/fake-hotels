I stayed here on business whilst attending an exhibition. Location, walking distance from Stuttgart airport, is perfect. The cleanliness of this hotel and rooms, is outstanding. Supper and breakfast was self service, good standard of food and plenty of choice. There are windows in the showers which show the occupier to the bedroom, which is not something everyone likes! The bar on the ground floor is great. friendly bartenders and good music. The only slight downside was that not all service staff were great, in the dining area.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 25, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for your positive feedback about your stay at the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe.
