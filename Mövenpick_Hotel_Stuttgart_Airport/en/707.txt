For several reasons the Moevenpick Stuttgart Airport Hotel is the best hotel in town. The location is perfect for business and leisure. It's very easy to reach all places within and around Stuttgart. The service is exceptional. The staff is always professional, helpful and friendly. I'm choosing the hotel for family and business trips.   The Spa and the Gym are outstanding. Ok the gym could be a little bit bigger, but it's never crowded.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded May 20, 2013Dear Michael,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to give us your feedback about your stay with us.
