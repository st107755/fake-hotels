For a hotel that is right at the airport I was truly impressed by the quietness of the room. With windows closed, I never heard a single airplane. The room was as described as were the other hotel facilities. Dinner in the restaurant was good,  and at breakfast I had the best real fresh scrambled eggs ever. Spa and gym facilities are very nice and certainly worth a visit.  Service was excellent - all staff were professional and very helpful in different languages.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jun 26, 2013Dear guest,  Thank you for having shared your experience on Tripadvisor.
