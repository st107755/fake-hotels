My wife and I spent one night at the hotel and we both were amazed.  The hotel is gorgeous inside and the staff were very friendly and made our stay even better.  The buffet breakfast has everything a traveler could want and the hotel's location directly in front of the Stuttgart airport terminal makes it a perfect place to stay for someone traveling through Stuttgart for just a day or two.  There is a subway train at the airport terminal which can take you practically anywhere in Stuttgart so the hotel is a great choice for couples or families who don't mind using public transportation to get around.  I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Assistant Front Office Manager at MÃ¶venpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Bob M,  I would like to thank you and your wife for your stay in our hotel.
