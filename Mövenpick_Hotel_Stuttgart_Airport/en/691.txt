I was shocked by this hotel, in a good way.  We like the old B and B's and staying in apartments, but needed to stay near the airport for an early flight.  Figured we would just write it off as a crappy last night.  This is a really good hotel, airy, friendly, great rooms, and to my utter shock, a very, very, very good meal.  What started as a write off evening ended with a wish that we could stay longer.  Silent rooms, and two minutes from the airport on foot.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Aug 6, 2013Dear Sharon,  Thank you for having shared your feedback.
