We stayed here 3x already and we were again impressed. I love the design, the athmosphere, friendly staff and the food! We had the twingle menu again and it was amazing, highly recommended, pefrectly matching menu for super price.  I love Movenpick hotels for their breakfast. As mentioned, we stayed here third time and this time it was the worst one (comparing to previous stays, but still highly above other hotels). We select this hotel everytime we come to Stuttgart area or to Metzingen and will come definitely again, no need to try another hotel :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Sep 8, 2011Dear alien80,  We are very sorry to read, that we did not meet your expectations during your last stay with us.
