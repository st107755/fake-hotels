We do automatically serve milk next to the coffee but also give you the option to order other coffee specialties and also with cream.  Thank you for having taken the time to share your opinion . We are looking forward to welcoming you soon again.  Warm Regards  Tiaré de Vries Product & Quality ManagementRead more
