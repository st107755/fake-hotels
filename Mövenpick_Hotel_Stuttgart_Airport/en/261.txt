Spacious, beautifully decorated rooms and bathrooms. Everything very clean. Spa area with 2 saunas and a relax area was great as well. Very comfy beds. Great restaurant. No airport noise at all. Check in was quick, there were lots of people waiting upon my departure so the quick check out (you can just leave your keycard in a box if you have already paid) was very appreciated.
