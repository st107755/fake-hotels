Very stylish, modern hotel directly in front of the Airport Stuttgart. Really good service, well designed rooms of reasonable size with modern equipment. But for the double you should have to much pudency, because there is a window between shower and room. The breakfast was really good. The hotel also has a very modern and spotless wellness area with three different saunas.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Guest Relations at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Mar 12, 2014Dear Guest,   Thank you for your last stay in the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and your feedback on tripadvisor.com.
