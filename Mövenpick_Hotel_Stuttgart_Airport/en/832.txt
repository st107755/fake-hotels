Just a minute walk from the airport and still very quiet in the room and hotel. My room was facing the airport but could not hear the noise outside. Rooms are excellent and seem newly done although I am not sure if the hotel is new.  One regular suggestion, pl have free internet for travelers. It is not a luxury anymore but necessity. If you charge Euro 250, it is not much to ask.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
