In the mens toilets there is a 'female model' displayed on the wall. This is an apalling denegration of women. Until the managment of Movenpick has removed this and applogised to its staff (ald let me know they have done this ) I will not return to any movenpick hotelRead moreReview collected in partnership with Mövenpick Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from jkoehler, Geschäftsführer at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 8, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you so much for sharing your feedback of your most recent visit to the Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport & Messe and the excellent rating regarding the employees and service. We do our utmost to serve our guest in the best possible way.  As answered already on the numerous other feedback sites you used to bring forward your comment I regret that you didn’t like the silhouette art of a woman in the men’s toilet. I can tell you that this was the idea of the interior designer Matteo Thun who wanted to show this scissor cuts art (Scherenschnitte). I do not think that the silhouette of a pretty lady denigrates women and likewise due to the right of the architect we will not remove it. Our employees have no offense towards the art displayed in our hotel. I am sorry to read that you will not visit any other Mövenpick Hotels due to thsi fact.  Sincerely  Juergen KoehlerRead more
