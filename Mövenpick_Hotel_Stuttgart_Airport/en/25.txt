All in one I must say that the hotel was a pure pleasure!   From the reception, to the room, over the restaurant and to teh spa area. All so pleasurable and nice! The hotel is most comfortable and as a guest one can feel absolutely relaxed and good. Modern furnitured rooms, are similarly inviting as the spa area!   Hope to be in this nice hotel soon againRead moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Dec 16, 2018Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your lovely comment and your stay with us.
