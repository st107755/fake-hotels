I prefer staying in hotels that offer at least a small fitness center.  This hotel had that plus three types of steam rooms/saunas.   As for the restaurant - I only tried the breakfasts which was pricy but had a good variety.   With a very quick walk from the airport and equally quick walk to the convention center it was the perfect location for this trip.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from moevenpickhotel1, Manager at Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart AirportResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear guest,   Thank you for your stay at our Mövenpick Hotel Stuttgart Airport and your great feedback.
