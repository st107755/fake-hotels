Stayed for a night in one of their small rooms. I must say, it was one of the most unpleasant nights I ever had in a hotel. The staff at check-in was very friendly. Upon entering the room I already experienced a crazy smell. It came from an artificial fragrance machine that was in use. Also, the room had nearly 30 degrees. I switched off the machine and the radiator system and opened the window. After some time I realized that the smell of cold smoke (still mixed with the fragrance)... So, I guess they just used the fragrance to cover it up. Since I was already in bed and it was 10pm I just didn't want to go through the hassle to change the room. I then went to bed, but woke up frequently, cuz the radiator would just not shut down. There was no way to switch it off. Maybe it wasâ€¦
