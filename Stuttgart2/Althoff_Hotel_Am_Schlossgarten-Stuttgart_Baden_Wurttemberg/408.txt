This was my 2nd business stay at the hotel. Again I was struck by its convenience for arrival by train, for enjoying the gardens and the nearby historical buildings by foot and the cultural centre is a few minutes walk away (on both occasions I have walked to the Opera). The outside facade is drab for a hotel of this quality, but the attentive and friendly staff as well as the general condition of the interior makes up for this. The breakfast room is elegant, tables set well apart and the experience of a high standard.
