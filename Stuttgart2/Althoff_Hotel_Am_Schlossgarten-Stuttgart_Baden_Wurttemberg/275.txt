Room was fanstastic: large with a separate entry area. View over Schlossgarten was lovely. Highlight was receiving a happy birthday greeting (in English), for it was indeed my birthday, from the housekeeper as I left the room for the day.  Possibly the most personalised I have ever felt in a career of staying in hotels. An indication of they care they offer to their customers.
