First time to stay here, but what i can say is "perfect" stay during my trip for 2 nights here.  Location is the best for this hotel, just attached to shopping street of Stuttgart and opposite to Hbf; so very convenient for everything.  Service is superb.  Room is very nice and bed is very comfortable.  One of the best hotel during my trip in Germany.  Would love to go back again.
