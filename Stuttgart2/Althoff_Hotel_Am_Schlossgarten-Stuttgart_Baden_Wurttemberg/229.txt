At every step of the way, we received excellent service here. The reservation and charges were always correct; the pillows and bedding were all synthetic (as we requested). Our room was on the 6th floor right by the elevator, but we heard no noise from its operation. It was a deluxe room (32 sq. m) and quite comfortable. The service at breakfast was flawless; we could help ourselves to food, or the staff could bring it-the level of availability of service at breakfast is unmatched at most hotels of my experience. The hotel is very near the railroad station. That is very convenient, and there was no noise. We would certainly stay here again on any journey through Stuttgart.
