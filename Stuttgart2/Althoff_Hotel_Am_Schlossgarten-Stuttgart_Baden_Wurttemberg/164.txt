I find this hotel very convenient for its location and facilities, so I keep coming back. Right at the start of the main street, it offers a quick browsing for the city who came even for a day. The staff is helpful and charming and the breakfast is amazing. The heating was not working properly during my visit so I was provided with a small heater which was not quite enough though. Still, I appreciate the efforts of the staff, even though I think this is not acceptable for a five star hotel, especially in Germany.  I'll keep going back no matter what.
