We arrived at 15:45 and had to wait til 17:00 to get our room only after serious pressure. Check-in was hellish as they would not let us check as a group and had to fill in individual forms. Asking for a good restaurant we were led to a cafetaria round the corner only to find out later there was a quality restaurant upstairs. They excused themselves saying there was a dress code and reservation neede which were both untrue. After ordering breakfast in the room (complementary) thety charged  € 17 which after complaints were a "mistake". Internet charge is € 15 per 24/h. Rooms do not stand up to price/quality standards. Did not feel welcome at all in this place.
