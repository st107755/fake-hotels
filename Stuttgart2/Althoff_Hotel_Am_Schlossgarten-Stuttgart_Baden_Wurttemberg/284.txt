We spent two nights here while visiting Porsche and Mercedes. This is not a five star hotel or even a four star hotel. The location is good for proximity to a pedestrian mall with shopping and restaurants and a large park but that is the only positive. One of our rooms was tired with patched wallpaper and blinds that were stuck in the half opened position that prevented us from closing them fully so that the room was dark for sleeping or opening them fully so that we could have light during the day. The nightlight in our room was broken and there was an empty tissue box in the niche for tissues in the bathroom when we arrived. Although housekeeping did provide us with a full tissue box, the empty box was never removed and we could not remove it because the niche was locked.â€¦
