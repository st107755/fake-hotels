We were traveling to Stuttgart in early July to visit the MB Museum and have a tour of the plant.  This hotel was very centrally located on the park and reminded me of a traditional hotel that has been very well maintained.  The check in was effortless and service very helpful with area restaurant recommendation and we had a nice drink in the bar area which had great service as well. I liked this place and it was very comfortable and somewhat elegant. Nice room but we did not have a view of the park. It ws however, very quiet, with great turndown service and housekeeping.  I would strongly recommend this as a good place to stay when in the area. Breakfast was good too!
