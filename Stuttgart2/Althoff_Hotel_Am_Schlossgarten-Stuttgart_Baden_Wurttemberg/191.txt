A typically German hotel.Well run,lacking nothing but maybe a little bit dated in parts in the corridors and bedrooms.Clean and friendly though.(Which is more than I can say for Stuttgart which was very dirty and downbeat and was very unimpressive.)        Special mention must be made of the very efficient Gerlinde Otto on the front desk who helped with a boarding pass issue I had.She was brilliant and saved the day.Many thanks.
