I stayed here  April 27-30 in this hotel located in a excellent location in central Stuttgart. I was here to see museums and loved the location and the quiet European charm of the hotel.  After a busy day it was nice to have a calm quiet place to refresh for the day.  Having the park next door was a great way to walk and enjoy the locals use the park.  The staff was attentive and the room met my needs.  A very European hotel
