Have stayed at GZ many times but they did not have a room for one of my nights so I tried HAS. Worked out extremely well. HAS, although appearing new from the outside has an old world feel in side. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with wood furniture. The room service I had was the absolute best I have had anywhere and I spend about 3 months per year in Europe. The staff was extremely friendly. No coffee in the room but that is not unusual in Europe. I would highly recommend this hotel, even over the GZ which is a good hotel. One feels more at home here than the GZ>
