The hotel is perfectly located in the city centre in immediate proximity to the shopping streets, central station, museums. Nevertheless the rooms are quiet, some even looking to a large park; I had booked a standard room but to my pleasure I got an upgrade and a very nice large room. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the breakfast offers excellent choice (the marvelous different sausages!!). I had a very tasteful dinner at the terrace with typical south German cuisine,excellent!
