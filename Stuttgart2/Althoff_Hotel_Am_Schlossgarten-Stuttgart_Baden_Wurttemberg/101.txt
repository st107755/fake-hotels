I am a fan of Althoff properties and routinely stay for business or pleasure whenever possible.  The Hotel am Schlossgarten in central Stuttgart provides the best option for five star hospitality in the city with excellent service and comfortable accommodations.  The front desk team immediately met my need for access to the business center prior to check in and offered assistance throughout my stay.  First impressions go a long way and served as a predictor of my experience.  My suite was clean, spacious and well appointed with all of the comforts of a home away from home. The restaurant options on the property were outstanding and the food exquisite.  As the property is aging but still classic, the constructive feedback I might offer is an investment in select propertyâ€¦
