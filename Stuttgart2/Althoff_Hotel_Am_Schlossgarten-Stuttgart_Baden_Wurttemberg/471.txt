Stayed here unexpectedly as I wanted to change my original hotel during my trip. From the get go Am Schlossgarten convinced me that I made the right choice. I went to the desk early morning around nine and asked for a room for two nights. I was promptly quoted an ok price rate and the best thing was the room was ready to be checked in, which I found exceptional so I was able to change clothes and take a shower and leave my luggage there.   When I came back from the day out in town, the room had been newly cleaned (it was clean when I checked in) and slippers and a bathrobe had been arranged to my room. the room itself is cosy and there is air conditioning. Bathroom is ok size and clean. The room has separate inner door so there is very little noise coming in from the adjacentâ€¦
