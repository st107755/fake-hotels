Just returned from Stuttgart and 3 nights in the Althoff Hotel Am Schlossgarten, what a wonderful stay.   Didn't expect much as the price was so good for the city centre and while the Beer Festival was on but Wow just Wow.  Excellent room, excellent service, excellent location for the town, bus tour, train station and underground.  Highly recommended
