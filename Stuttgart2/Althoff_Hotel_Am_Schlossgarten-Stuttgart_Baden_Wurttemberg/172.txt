My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and we had a great stay. The hotel rooms are comfortable and up to date although the bathrooms are not as up to date and the shower is a little on the small side. The staff really make this hotel as they are so nice and friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. I asked for bubble wrap and they brought some up to the room, we asked for restaurant recommendations and they helped and always with a smile. The location is perfect and right next to the central station which was so handy. It's just a short 5 minute walk to the markets and you can also get the S Bahn or train to Esslingen Christmas markets which are nice too. We had a cocktail in the bar and ate at the cafe and both were very pleasant andâ€¦
