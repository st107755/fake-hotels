The hotel is right across the train station. Modern and clean. The front desk staff is amazing-the British lady was extremely helpful. the room was spacious and clean. We had one mix-up with the extra-bed and before we could complain, the front desk got apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast. Our booking was handled by Ms Mullhauser who promptly replied to our emails. The reception gave me an excellent tip to visit the cigar bar at the hotel next door.
