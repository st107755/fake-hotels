For business or pleasure, this is a very pleasant hotel. Good amenities, nice staff and a fantastic restaurant. You can have the option of the bar, upstairs restaurant or their terrace restaurant - depending on the weather.  Service was excellent and location great. One could be in the city centre in a few minutes or at the S-Bahn to take the train to/from airport in 3 minutes.  Although this is listed as a '5*' hotel, it doesn't have a pool or fitness room. However, so often I come across hotels that get 'two stars' just having these, but their restaurant and/or rooms don't match the status.  I'd delighted to say that without the obligatory fitness room, this hotel excels in all areas.
