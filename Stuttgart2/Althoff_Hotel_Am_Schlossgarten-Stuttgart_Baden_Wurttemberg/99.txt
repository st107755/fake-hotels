I was in Stuttgart for business in October, and needed a hotel close to the train station.  This great hotel is right across the street, so the location was perfect.  The hotel itself is very nice, clean and comfortable - the room that I received was much larger than I thought it would be, and I had the advantage of looking out at the park which is right next to the hotel.  In some cities the area around the train station is not always so nice, but in this case, the area is very nice and right next to one of the largest shopping streets (pedestrian) in Stuttgart. Breakfast was great and their are several restaurants right at the property.  I will definitely return here in the future, especially given the outstanding service throughout my stay.
