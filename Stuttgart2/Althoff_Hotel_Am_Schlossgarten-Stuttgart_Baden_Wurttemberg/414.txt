I picked this hotel because of high rating on tripadvisor and wasn't dissapointed: - I think service is as good as it gets in a German hotel. I can't imagine it any better. There were many details to it, but the main thing is that everyone had warm smiles and was friendly and helpful - nothing was a trouble for them, they did make sure I was fully satisfied with everything. - The building is one of those not very nice postwar buildings - but it transforms once you get inside. It was renovated not that long ago inside and even though it wasn't brand spanking new - there were no problems with the room - everything was clean, spotless and in working order - may be a bit like traditional style 5 star hotel but with new fittings. - Bed was nice and comfortable - Evening bed turndownâ€¦
