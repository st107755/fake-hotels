Hotel is very close to main train station and on the edge of the large "garten" a park.  Its 1 block from the main pedestrian street that goes from the station to the old town center.  This street reminds me of the Ramblas in Barcelona with lots of shops, food places, etc.  The old town is very attractive and worth a visit especially during the beer festival season.  In fact, Stuttgart is a real delight.  The hotel is very up scale, but not pretentious and not pricey.  Amazing, friendly staff, and excellent rooms.  Get one with a park view. The breakfast is awesome, maybe the best I've seen in Europe.  The Metro station is right outside the door, and makes visits to the Porsche and Mercedes museums a breeze.  I would stay here every time I go to Stuttgart.
