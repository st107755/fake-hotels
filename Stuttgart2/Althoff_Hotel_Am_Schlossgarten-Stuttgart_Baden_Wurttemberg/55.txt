The hotel is situated adjacent to the former palace, Schlossgarten, Opera House and the Koeningsallee. Easy walk to the older part pf town, the delightful Markthalle cathedral and main station. The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean but slightly old fashioned.  Very comfortable and roomy, they nevertheless evoke a sense of luxury. Friendly staff and great location make for an overall excellent experience.
