Conveniently located across the street from the train station. It is at the edge of a park and we enjoyed having breakfast on the terrace overlooking it. The staff is friendly and efficient. The hotel should merit a top rating, however the wifi was terrible. I had to sit in the lobby to access wifi and even then it was spotty.
