Great hotel for shopping in Stuttgart as it is right next to the main street of shops and walking distance to many boutiques. We arrived by train, and chose this hotel for that convenience. My husband has stayed here before on business trips and recommended that we stay here again. Not disappointed as the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was huge, bed comfortable and bathroom spacious - all clean and well kept in the old gracious European style. So, not modern decor but very comfortable. We ate at the cafe and the food was good but not outstanding. Breakfast was very good. However, one evening we had dinner at the Bernhard Diers restaurant, sitting on the upstairs terrace overlooking the public gardens. Wow, what a great meal, one of the best on our trip - don't missâ€¦
