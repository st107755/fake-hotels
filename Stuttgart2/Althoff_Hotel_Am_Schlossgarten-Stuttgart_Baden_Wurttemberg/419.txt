What I can say - Great location, good staff and very important thing – the restaurant with the star Michelin. I like tasty food. The staff was very kind and friendly and the room was comfortable. Breakfast was fine! but they had not free WIFI. From the room we had a good view to the gardens. Easy to get transport – metro and train. I think this hotel deserves a great rating.
