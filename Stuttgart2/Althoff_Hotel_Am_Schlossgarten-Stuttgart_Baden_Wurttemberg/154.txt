The hotel is a modern building located a few minutes walk from the train station and the main shopping mall. As a Leading Hotel of the World member I was upgraded to a lovely suite. A large comfortable room. Great bathroom, twin sinks. Wonderful towels and bed linen. Very comfortable bed. The front desk staff were excellent. Very friendly, especially Julia, and made everything easy. The breakfast was as you expect. great choices, wonderful service. They even sent out especially for soya milk when they ran out one day. Underground secure parking. Highly recommended.
