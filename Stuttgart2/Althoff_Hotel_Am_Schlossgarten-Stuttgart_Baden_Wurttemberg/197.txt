This hotel is at such a good location in Stuttgart - very easy for subway and train travel but that is not why I love it. There is shopping right around the corner as well as  museums and a great central square to relax and sit in a cafe. The staff here is so helpful and attentive. The rooms are large and comfortable. It is a very good place to stay with family.
