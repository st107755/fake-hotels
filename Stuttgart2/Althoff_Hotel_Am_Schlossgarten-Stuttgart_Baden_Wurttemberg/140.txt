And on the other side of the street is koenigstrasse which I understand is their main shopping street.  I drove there and it was very easy to find, and the turn off the street goes straight into the parking garage. The service is really good! When I got back to the hotel in the evening, the sheets have been turned, there was a little choc next to the bed. The tv was tilted a little towards the bed.
