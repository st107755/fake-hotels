Just love this old German Business hotel. It's really about completely professional discrete service to make your work as seamless as possible.  From the front desk, valet to the comfortable room with sweeping views of Stuttgart, it's just makes a fast work trip a breeze.    The cafe is sublime on a summers afternoon looking out on the park and the main plaza just a stone throw away.  Upgraded to a suite which was just dandy especially without an outdoor terrace.  Loved this old school suite.  The staff really make this place sing, always attentive and smiling with nothing a problem.   With limited hotel choices in Stuttgart, this hotel always blows me away even compared with major luxury brands.  Keep it up Althoff, I love it.
