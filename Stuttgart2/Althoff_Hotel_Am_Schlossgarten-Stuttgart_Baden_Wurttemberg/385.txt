I spent several wonderful days at the Althoff Hotel Am Schlossgarten in late January.   Pros: -Cozy room with a very comfortable bed  -Bathroom well appointed -Bedroom door cancels out all noise -Breakfast Buffet was superb -Staff very friendly and accommodating. -Great location-easy to walk through the downtown area  Cons: -During the week, downtown Stuttgart is a ghost town after 8pm.
