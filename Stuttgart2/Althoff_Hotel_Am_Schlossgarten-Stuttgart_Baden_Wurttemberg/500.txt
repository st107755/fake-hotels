Touted as a small luxury hotel in Europe I would tend to disagree. At the special discount rate of 170 euros a nite, the only thing luxury was the price. Everything was just "okay".  Staff was fine, but not overly accomodating, rooms were fine, but again nothing special.  The towels in the bathroom were horrid, I literally scratched myself with them. Ouch! Up side, they do have high speed internet, rarely found in Stuttgart and they are literally across the street from the train station.   Breakfast is served in the morning, buffet style, but the choices were limited especially compared to the Maritim across town, which is *not* a luxury hotel but an awesome european breakfast.  I was craving toast, but they did not offer a toaster or a even the option of ordering it.  Prettyâ€¦
