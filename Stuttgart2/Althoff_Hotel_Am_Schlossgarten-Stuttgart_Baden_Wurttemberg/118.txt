Althoff in Germany are recognized for their association with signature chefs and Michelin quality dining experience, alas this one in Stuttgart was is not one of those hotels. The hotel was clean and presentable, but not quite the luxury a "5 star" is suppose to provide. The rooms were very dated with the hotel lobby not particularly inspiring. From what I'm told there really isn't any other great options if you want to stay in the city. For business trips it is fine, but not recommended for vacations or anything romantic.
