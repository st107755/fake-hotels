The location just a few metres from the complete building site that is the station these days is ideal, the main pedestrian shopping area just around the corner as well as the park and museum.   The adjacent coffee shop is rather brash in service and with low quality coffee.   I perceived the hotel impersonal with no specific character.   The room service wanted to turn down the beds at 18h, quite insistently even asking whether they could do it while we were in the room.   The junior suite had a large shower but no bath. The shower would have had enough space for a bench or at least for a safety handle, but there was none.   Although we had asked for a room overlooking the park, we were looking into another building, but the room was nice and quiet, apart from people showeringâ€¦
