I was here for just one night and the staff at this hotel was lively. They were quite friendly and offered to help with reservations, etc. My room was a standard one. It was clean and basic. The hotel is right next to a ton of shops -- from department store to clothing stores to a pharmacy and food shops. Very conveniently located.
