I booked this hotel not for price but for its reviews and tbh they didn't falter. The staff make this hotel, Reception, Valet, Bar ALL were very warm and assisting. Maps drawn by the gentleman on the bar for places to eat and drink and the receptionists where excellent even with a free brolly service. Rooms were ok but very clean. Lobby immaculate.  Negative - My only negative point was that the breakfast was 27 euro's each and was VERY expensive for what bit was. Spoilt what was a great weekend a little.
