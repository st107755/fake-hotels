We did not know what to expect of this hotel and from the outside it does not look anything very special.....however, inside it is wonderful. We had an end room overlooking the park and even a small balcony. The service was excellent and the room was spotlessly clean. I enjoy all the little extras such as the robe and slippers, a piece of chocolate every night, Penhaligon's toiletries and the remote for the TV on the bedside locker with the TV guide open at the appropriate page. The hotel breakfasts were excellent and all the staff very helpful. It is in a superb location for the railway station and also for visiting the Christmas markets. We would highly recommend this hotel.
