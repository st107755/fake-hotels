The room was comfortable and had a nice view over looking the park. Shower pressure was great but the bathroom was a bit small.  We used the parking which was very convenient.   Location was perfect for dinner and it was close to the station.   We stayed during the summer festival and it was quite noisy but they did warn us when we were checking in.
