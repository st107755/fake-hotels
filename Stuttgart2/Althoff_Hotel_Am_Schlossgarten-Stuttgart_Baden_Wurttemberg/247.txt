I did not realize that it was just a few short steps from the train station and that I would have loads of shopping and dinner options within a block or two from this very well run hotel.  It is truly top-notch and could not be more convenient.  Particularly if you need to catch a train early the next morning or get to the airport quickly this is a excellent option.  The view from my room was spectacular.  Highly Recommended.
