I just make a short visit / transit at Stuttgart, I only stay there for a night, to have sight seeing in the city. The hotel is at good location, staff is friendly and there provide warm and delicious breakfast, this is what I like it very much.  Room is comfortable and clean, shower is strong, and bath room is not too small. I enjoy staying here,
