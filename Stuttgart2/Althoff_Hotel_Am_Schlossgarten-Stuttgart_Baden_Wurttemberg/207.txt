With a friend, we have a very nice rest drinking in the caf√© of this hotel. The place is also soothing in the middle of Stuttgart ! The waitresses and waiters are very nice. I advise to go there if you want to have a milkshake in the afternoon with a nice view on the garden. Moreover the prices are really good.
