Right across the street from the main train station so its very accessible from the Airport and even from other cities in Germany connected by train. It was very easy to find. Also, very close to the city center where all the shopping and restaurants are located. It is perfect for a first timer and a business traveler. However, rooms are very small and the hotel infrastructure is very old. Smoking Rooms are a no go even if you're a smoker you cannot just survive there. The obviously do no deep cleaning there and rooms are too small to get fresh smell anyway.
