Single night stay - rang at very short notice and was offered one of their last remaining rooms - a junior suite (large room with walk-in closet and large bathroom) - at a very, very  reasonable price.   Room was spacious, clean, modern and noise-free.  Reception staff and concierge/bell desk are very helpful and know their city.  Location very central, at the Schlossgarten as the name suggests and on the same avenue as the central train station. Not situated in the quaintest part of the old town, but there are no 4* hotels much closer than this one. The main (pedestrianised) shopping street is just around the corner. There was some construction work at the adjacent site in summer '11 but this was not noticable when in the room.
