This is a beautiful hotel with excellent service and lovely clean rooms and five star accommodations.   We loved the terrace in the evening and the breakfast in the mornings and the food was beyond excellent. Stuttgart is a crazy chaotic city and this hotel was a welcome respite each evening from everything and we would highly recommend this hotel to all Americans
