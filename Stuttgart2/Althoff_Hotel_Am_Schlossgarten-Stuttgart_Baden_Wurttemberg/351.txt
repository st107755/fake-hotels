The hotel is a bit older, smaller, and dated than I expected from the website, and it wasn't luxury (as in five-star hotel lux--perhaps the suites are great, but a true luxury hotel is all lux, even the regular rooms.) That said, location is very good--downtown, access to public trams, trains, and major roadways--and the service is excellent, both by hotel and restaurant staff. My room was a "superior" room, which had corner views of park, train station, and vineyards (some construction, too, but the hotel was there first). The room was good sized though furnishings are dated (but fine), and the bathrooms were huge. Now, my co-workers must have gotten the lower room and complained about room and bath size, though they don't travel much and are not accustomed to European hotels.â€¦
