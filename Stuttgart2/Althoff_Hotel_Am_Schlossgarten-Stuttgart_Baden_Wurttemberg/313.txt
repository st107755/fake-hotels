The entire staff was indeed first class, but the hotel itself was a bit shy of being a true five star.... with the exception of prices.   Breakfast was very good, but overpriced at 24 Euros and the hotel lacked many of the amenities and luxury you might associate with it's top rating. We experienced problems with our door lock, the safe and wi-fi was horrible.  Overall, we would give them a B+ rating, mainly due to their staff and location.
