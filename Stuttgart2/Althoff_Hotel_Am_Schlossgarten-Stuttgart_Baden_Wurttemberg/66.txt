This hotel is one of the few 5 stars in Stuttgart. The room was small (and I found out I had a suite....). Ac very weak, bad wifi and a very small toilet. I would give the maximum points to this hotel if it was a 4 stars. But how did it get 5? If this hotel gets 5 stars, then how many stars should any Peninsula, St. Regis, Four Season and so on get? 10?  I think whomever is giving out stars in Germany is a little loose. That said the hotel is not bad, but donâ€™t expect to find a real 5 stars.
