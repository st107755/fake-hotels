Really nice stay. Very helpful and friendly staff, centrally located to the shopping area and plenty of places to eat. Easy walking distance to the Christmas markets, as well.  Deluxe Room was large and very nicely decorated. Great amenities. They offer parking for 19â‚¬ per day, but there are several other parking garages in the area that are the same price if you aren't able to park at the hotel for some reason.
