Is situated just off one of main shopping streets and opposite main train station (Hauptbahnhof). Easy to get to from airport (Flughafen) using S-Bahn S2 or S3, journey time 30 mins and costs 4 Euros. Despite central location rooms are very quiet, air conditioned and spacious (and very reasonably priced for such a quality hotel). There is a large park bordering one side of hotel, offering pleasant walks. Tourist Information is just round the corner. Hotel staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and polite, keeping us well supplied with drinks during the tension of the Deutschland v Italien football match !
