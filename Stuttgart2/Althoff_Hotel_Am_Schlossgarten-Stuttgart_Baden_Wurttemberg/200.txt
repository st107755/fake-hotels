The front desk staff were friendly, professional and helpful. They arranged everything including the luggage from the car to the room. This isn't unusual, however the cost of the room was quite reasonable and hence we were not expecting this level of service. The room was large (see photos - sorry about the luggage etc , but at least you know they are genuine images) , the bathroom was clean and tidy. Each evening the bed was turned down, the TV set up and angled for viewing and slippers put beside your bed - a nice touch. We used the bar both nights and found the staff their equally as friendly. Checkout was smooth. No complaints about this property at all.
