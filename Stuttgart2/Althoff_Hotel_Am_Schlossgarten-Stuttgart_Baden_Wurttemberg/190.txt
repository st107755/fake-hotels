This hotel is easy to find and close to everything in downtown Stuttgart.  The Hop On - Hop Off bus stop is just across the street, and the main train station is also very close.  We didn't try the hotel restaurant and didn't pay the additional cost for breakfast, so cannot comment on the food service.  However, the hotel desk staff were very kind and helpful.  This is the perfect place to stay for a weekend visit to Stuttgart.
