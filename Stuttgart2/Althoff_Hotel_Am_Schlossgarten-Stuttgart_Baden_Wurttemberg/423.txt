Really good location, right beside the park and main shopping street.  I have stayed in other 5star hotels in Stuttgart but this was definitely the best location.  Stayed in a superior room which was excellent, small touches like a bottle of water each day and a chocolate at night were very good and what makes this hotel 5star.  I used the hotel bikes to cycle through the park and I would really advise this.  Only slight negative was the lack of free wifi but this was not a major problem.  I will definitely stay here again when in Stuttgart.
