Stayed at the Schlossgarten for 3 nights at their Park Suite with 2 extra beds for my kids.  Room smelled of smoke but got used to it after a while and furnishings were a bit dated but overall very clean.  Had 5-course dinner at their Zirbelstube restaurant and indeed it was very good!  Location of the hotel is superb as it's at the beginning of the shopping street.  Few metres from the main train station and a few steps away from the S/U trains.  Execllent for traveling to nearby excursions.  There's also a self-service laundry just beside the hotel which was a huge plus for us.  Would highly recommend this hotel!
