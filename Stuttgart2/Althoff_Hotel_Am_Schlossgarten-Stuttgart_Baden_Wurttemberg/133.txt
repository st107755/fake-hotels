I stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to Germany. Overall it was a very enjoyable stay. The room was small but well appointed. A significant positive of this hotel is it's great location. It's a short walk across the street from a main train station plus there's lots of shopping a short walk away along with a nice park. The staff was very helpful, friendly and multilingual. I would definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting Stuttgart in the future.
