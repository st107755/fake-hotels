This hotel was provided to me by Porsche as part of my car pick experience. It's a lovely hotel, they gave us a nice room with a balcony.  But I am American who runs hot. And it as July and warm and the AC was just not working. The front desk did send up maintenance to check it out for us, but the air was just not moving.    Breakfast and bar service was great, rooms are good size. Location to the train could not be bet!  I would stay again, but probably not in the summer!
