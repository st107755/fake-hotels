Facing a park but very close to the railway station, this is an excellent hotel with matching service. The decor in the rooms is classic with a modern twist. We stayed in a recently decorated room and it was an excellent room. Very quiet and of comfortable size.  Penhalions bathroom amenities add a special note to the bathing experience! The hotel has excellent dining facilities and a popular cafe with wonderful pastries and cakes. Have stayed here multiple times and could recommend this hotel fully.
