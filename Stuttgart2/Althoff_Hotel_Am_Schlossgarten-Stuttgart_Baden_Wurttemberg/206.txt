Warm and friendly welcome at the reception. Small welcome gift for our little baby.  Room was nicely done, clean and spacious.  Sensational view over the Schlossgarten. Daily newspaper. Most enjoyable 3 night stay for a long time. We had a lunch at the Cafe am Schlossgarten, regional food and wine were delicious, very friendly and welcoming staff.
