The hotel was perfect for a city break.  Very convenient for the main station and U-Bahn, the opera house and theatre.  The main shopping street is close by as is the park and pretty lake.  A very enjoyable stay with lovely breakfasts and a choice of restaurants within the hotel.  All members of staff were efficient and very friendly.
