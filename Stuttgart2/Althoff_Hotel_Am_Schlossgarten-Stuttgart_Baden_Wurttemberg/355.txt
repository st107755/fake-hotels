The quality of accommodations and service at this hotel is second to none. My family travels for leisure at least twice per year. New York, Western Europe, Caribbean, etc. we have never received the quality experience that we get at the Schlossgarten. From the room to food, everything could not be better. The staff are a prime example of what hotel service should be everywhere !!
