This is a Leading Hotel of the World affiliated structure. The location is really great, just at 5 minutes walk from the city center. The staff was really friendly and the room was nice with the bathroom quiet old. Negative aspect, the continental breakfast was average with really bad cappuccino, certainly not worthing the price.
