My family and I arrived late at night via train, and then were renting a car (the car rental place was inside the train station), so this was the perfect location for us.  Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby, including across the street in the train station.  There is an underground walkway from the train station to the Hotel side of the street, so even crossing the street wasn't an issue.  We were promptly checked in and assisted with our bags, and made our way to the room.  We had reserved a triple room, since we were traveling with our 14 year old daughter, and were pleased to find the room with the bed for her already made and ready to go, and 3 sets of towels, toiletries, and she even had her own set of slippers.  My wife and daughter liked the slipped so much we tookâ€¦
