We had a wonderful experience at Am Schlossgarten hotel.  Our two rooms were spacious and clean.  I would give it an excellent rating but our side of the hotel had a view of an office building. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had an issue with our hotel door not shutting completely. They were able to fix it in a timely manner.  This hotel is across the street from the train station and the city bus tour leaves from the front of their hotel.  Also, it is next to the Koenigstrasse that is a pedestrian street lined with shops, cafes, a museum, a theatre and a park.  We did not eat in the restaurant but had a few nights in the bar for nightcaps. The bedding was not what we were used to at a hotel.  We had a king bed but it was 2 twins together and there were 2 twinâ€¦
