I stayed at the Hotel Am Schlossgsarten for 2 nights - Sept. 13 and 14 - at the start of a 3 week, 8 city trip through Europe.  The Hotel Am Schlossgarten was one of the top 2 places I stayed.  It has the ideal combination of top class service in a smaller hotel. The location is perfect - at the end of a long pedestrian mall that runs from the public garden through shopping areas to the central square and train station.  I arrived in Germany with concerns about the level of dining and the Schlossgarten restaurant put my concerns to rest - it was truly first class.  I believe it may have one Michelin star but it ranked higher than similar one-star Michelins for creativity and execution.  Truly a first class experience at a relatively low cost. Very highly recommended!
