Having stayed at this hotel for over 7 years, I can state that there may be other "high end" hotels in Stuttgart but the Schlossgarten is the BEST place to stay.  The location is perfect. Settled in the lovely park and steps away from both the Hauptbahnhof (train/subway) and the world famous Konigstrasse.   Konigstrasse is approximately one mile long (pedestrian only) and is a boardwalk filled with stores and restaurants. The hotel is right off this street which makes it so desirable.   If you are interested in shopping, dining, fitness or sightseeing, there is not a better place to stay.  For longer trips, there is a laundromat conveniently located around the back of the hotel.  Upon arrival you are greeted by their 5 star staff. You won't find a warmer, more accommodatingâ€¦
