This is our second stay at this hotel with friends. All the staff - Reception, Bell Boy, Bar, Cleaners all make you feel very welcome and are extremely attentive.  We stayed in a Deluxe room this time which is very large, with big bed and lounge area. Bed very comfortable. Coffee machine in room.   Music entertainment in bar in evenings which is a nice touch. Drinks in bar reasonably priced.  We didnâ€™t have breakfast as believe this is very over priced but plenty of cafes around local area.  Location is perfect for Christmas Markets.  Will always stay here when returning.
