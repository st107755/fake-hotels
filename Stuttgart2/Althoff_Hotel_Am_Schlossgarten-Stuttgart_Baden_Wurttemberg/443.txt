This is truly one of the most distinguished typical German luxury class Hotels around! Solid style with perfect service, nice rooms and a great Breakfast-experience on the sunny garden side! Our firm also hosted a little 30 person event in the 1st floor conference location. Great venue and well serviced drinks and finger food! Hard to find such a witness of the 60s and 70s German Wirtschaftswunder years!
