We spent three nights here.  The Summerfest was going on for the week and the music kept us up the first night.  The hotel graciously moved us to a quieter room.  The breakfast is awesome and hostess and staff at restaurant were lovely and welcoming.  The hotel wasn't luxurious for a 5 star but it was comfortable and convenient.  I would stay again and definitely recommend it.  It is located in very easy walking distance to the train and centrally located for easy sightseeing and shopping.  A great place to stay.
