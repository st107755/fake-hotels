Doesn't look much from the outside....... But looks can be decieving the inside is beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful,five star service. From the doorman to the lovely housekeeping staff nothing is too much trouble. The queen rooms are quite small but ok. for a couple of nights. Would definitely stay again when visiting Stuttgart.
