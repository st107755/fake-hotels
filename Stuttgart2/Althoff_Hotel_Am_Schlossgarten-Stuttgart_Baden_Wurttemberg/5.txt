The hotel is a refreshing reflection of both yesterday and today.  Traditional in appearance and comfort.  Modern in convenience and efficiency.  Th restaurant is in an excellent location--across from train station and adjacent to pedestrian shopping street. The rooms are small by U.S. standards, but they are comfortably furnished and updated with contemporary amenities.
