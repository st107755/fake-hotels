We have visited Stuttgart many times but this was our first time staying at the Schlossgarten Hotel.  It felt like home.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful, friendly and warm.  Our room was lovely with a view of the park at the back of the hotel. Location is perfect...just across from the train station.  A highlight was breakfast!  Beautiful buffet - seating choices...outside on the patio or inside with a view.  Lovely. Highly recommend!
