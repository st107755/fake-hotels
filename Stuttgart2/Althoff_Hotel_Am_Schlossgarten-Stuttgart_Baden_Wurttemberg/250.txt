It is such a wonderful thing to find a soundproofed hotel room these days! If you read my other reviews you'll see that it is my biggest complaint about hotels and here you can rest easy. Welcoming staff and a lovely big suite with a mini-bar that for once isn't over-priced! And the bar is classy and surprisingly affordable - I'm looking forward to going back and exploring their rum list! We didn't have breakfast as it's a bit expensive at 25 euros and we didn't want very much. Good, free wifi. I'll be back
