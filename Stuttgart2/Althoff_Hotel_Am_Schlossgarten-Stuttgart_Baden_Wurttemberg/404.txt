This "Leading Hotels of the World" brand property was a wonderful experience for us. The staff were pleasant, helpful and discreet. The modern, well-appointed public spaces and rooms were comfortable, quiet and clean. The hotel is close to Konigstrasse which is great for shopping for both bargain and luxury items.
