Travelling for work can be tiring, on and off trains, planes and automobiles so when you arrive at your next hotel you just want things to go smoothly, be quick and easy.  Welcome to the Hotel Am Schlossgarten.  The location is fantastic, shopping, great eating and the train station all very close by.  The staff are brilliant, helpful and friendly.  In my rush to check out on my last day I stupidly (and for the first time ever) left a number of items behind - the staff could not have been more accomodating collecting my items and returning them to me overseas.  Truly commendable service.  Highly recommended.
