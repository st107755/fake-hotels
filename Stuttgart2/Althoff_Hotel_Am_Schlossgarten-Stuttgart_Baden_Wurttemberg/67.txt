A four-stars hotel with no restrooms in the Lobby -you either go two flights up or one down from the Lobby, and a less than average maintenance standard in rugs te all.  The staff as it is often the case, was very professional, very nice and attentive. The restaurant choices were poor and often with too much sauce or too dry fish -from the breaksfast buffet, or simply not tasty. It is ok in general but it is not rally worth it the four stars or its price. The waiting and recepti9n staff, again,second to none, they deserve better management and cooks
