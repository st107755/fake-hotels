We stayed at the hotel on a Saturday night and were very impressed. The rooms were well equipped and very cleaning. The staff were amazing - especially Marcus who worked in the bar. We were struggling to find a restaurant for dinner and Marcus managed to secure us a reservation at a fantastic place - Brenner restaurant. Never have I stayed at a hotel where the staff are so attentive.
