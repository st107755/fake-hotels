Loved the rooms of the hotel, but was disappointed with the lack of a GYM, pool and spa.  Breakfast was also limited.  However, The service was top notch and very friendly and helpful staff that made you feel at home from the moment you checked in.  The location is perfect for shopping cause everything is just behind you in terms of shopping while the main train station is just across the road.  The garden is just at the right of the front entrance of the hotel which gives you some space if you want to run or do some outdoor activities.  Will stay again there, but will would love to have a gym or a pool.
