The hotel is in walking distance of the Konigstraffe shopping zone and very close to the train station ad Christmas markets which was the focus of our visit. The standard rooms were large and clean and have all the technical standards you would expect from a modern luxury hotel. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The only disappointment  was their lack of service for their continental breakfast in the morning. It seemed tat they cold not keep pace with the food requirements. Otherwise I'd have no problem returning
