I checked in yesterday and I must say I am really impressed. The room is spacious and comfy.  It is quiet  and have i need. I guess some will miss  a possibility to make a cup of coffee, but I do not not like coffee, so it do not matter to me. There is a good wi-fi connection in the room, however you will have to pay to use it. Everything else is tip top. It is clean, you will have a newspaper in the morning, the beds are good, they make you room ready in the evening, they check in to the room just to see if you are ok, the employees  all greet you when you meet them. If you ask them something they do their best to help you.  I will saty here for 10 more days and be back in January. And I am looking forward to it.
