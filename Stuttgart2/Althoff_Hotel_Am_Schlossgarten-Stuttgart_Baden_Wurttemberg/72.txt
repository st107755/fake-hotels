After I read so many reviews, I decided to stay at this hotel. As the result, I am so happy with it. Located next to big Schloss garden park and the main shopping street. You can easily go shopping or relaxing by walk. In a very safe area not dangerous at all. Super clean and luxury hotel. View from my room. Super!!! Of course, friendly and helpful stuff as well. Will come back again soon.
