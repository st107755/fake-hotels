This hotel is located very conveniently across the Stuttgart Hbf and at the beginning of Koenig Strasse, the main shopping street in downtown Stuttgart. The rooms are clean, neat and functional and elegantly done. The staff are fairly friendly. The breakfast spread in teh restaurant is good. I'd recommend this for a trip to Stuttgart for its location, mostly business type travelers in teh hotel though.
