We had problems driving into the hotel because of massive roadworks nearby.  However, once you know it's not too difficult.  The hotel also offers guests parking in the garage below the hotel at 20 Euros a day.  This is a City Centre five star hotel.  Friendly reception staff and reasonable, if not large, rooms.  The air conditioning, because of the high outside heat, did not cope very well and the room temperature stayed at around 24 degrees.  We did ask housekeeping for harder pillows which we received.  We also asked for blankets but these were never delivered.  The hotel has a good breakfast service and offers a cafe for coffee/drinks. This works in conjunction with the hotel's bar.  There is a Michelin star restaurant but we couldn't get in as there was a waiting list. â€¦
