I stayed at the hotel for a brief two night stay over the 2012 bank holiday weekend.    It really is an excellent city hotel - the rooms are modern, bright and very large, the food is good and the hotel is very well situated in the city centre, and provides an excellent base for sightseeing (e.g. Mercedes Benz and Porsche museums, etc.)  What really stood out for me was the warmth of all the hotel staff (without exception) - they clearly take a lot of well-deserved pride in their job and it showed itself in their enthusiasm, efficiency and cheerfulness, as well as their willingness to go out of their way to be of assistance.    Very well done!
