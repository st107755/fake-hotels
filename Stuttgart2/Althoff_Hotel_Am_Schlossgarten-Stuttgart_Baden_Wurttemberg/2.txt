Stay here just for a saturday overnight . Even if staff , location and service/food are great ,  definitly not a 5* The room I had was too small for the price and for a LHW 5*. Too old bathroom also with WC in the same place, broken window so you hear the noisy park at night . Definitly never understand why this kind of thing already happens in a  5* !  Don't want to bother staff with this , they are so great and friendly . But please How could you allocate rooms with windows that cannot correctly be closed ? you stay at the hotel for SLEEPING so that's should be the FIRST thing to check. When  entering the room , you hear the loud noise coming from the park through the window !  Better enjoyed with my last stay at le Meriden or The graf Zepelin but choose Hotel am Schlossgarte because of works in progress in front of le Meridien and Graf Zepelin closed actually.  â€¦
