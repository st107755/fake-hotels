This is not the prettiest building but behind that exterior is a really good city centre hotel. The staff are very friendly. They are also knowledgeable about the local area and very helpful. The concierge dealt with our car quickly and efficiently. We booked a junior suite but I would not do so again as they have no view at all (or at least the one we were in didn’t). The room itself was very good – I think it must have been refurbished fairly recently. The Zirbelstube restaurant was excellent. We asked the sommelier for advice on local wine and she recommended something unusual which we would never have chosen – it was superb.
