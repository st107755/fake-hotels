We were staying in Stuttgart to see a ballet in the Staatstheater. The hotel is perfectly located 5 minutes walk through the park from the theater. Parking was directly underneath the hotel. Our "superior" room was large, comfortable, overlooking the park. Airconditioning didn't function and I couldn't get the WiFi to work. Service was excellent - very friendly and always ready to help. â‚¬24 per person for breakfast is too much, IMHO.
