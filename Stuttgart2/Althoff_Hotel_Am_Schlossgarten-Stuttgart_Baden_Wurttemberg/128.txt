The location is fabulous. The escalators exiting the  Stuttgart Hauptbahnof lead right onto the road with the hotel at the left. Once inside the premises, the hotel has a super lux feel. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the sprawling gardens, right next to the hotel. Loved the fact that we were right on the shopping street. Amazing restaurants, shops and ice cream parlours a cool 5 min walk away. The room was very comfortable. Loved the mattresses and the sheer size of the room. The coffee machine was such a delight too. Stayed there for 4 nights and each day we were so happy to return back to the hotel. The hospitality was also superb! The warmth of the hotel staff must be mentioned as each one of them that we encountered were excellent. Taxis and trains freely availableâ€¦
