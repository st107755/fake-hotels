The customer service at this hotel goes above and beyond! With an early morning train on a cold, dark, winter morning (the train station is conveniently located across the road from the hotel), a staff member from the hotel walked me (and my EXTREMELY heavy suitcase) all the way to MY SEAT on the train! Absolutely amazing! The entire hotel is in amazing condition. My room itself, had an extremely comfortable bed, large room, amazing window looking out to the palace gardens. The room service food was delicious and extremely generous. The products in the bathroom were amazing. And yet again the service was amazing when i had troubles with the heating. The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect, the staff are amazing and the rooms are exquisite! Couldn't recommend enough! Iâ€¦
