The staff were fantastic, the location is perfect for exploring Stuttgart and the surrounding Christmas Markets (it's right by the central station).  We had a Junior Suite. Great size, comfy bed. Definitely in need to redecorating - especially the bathroom fittings! The fan was also very noisy all through the night.  Overall, I think it was overpriced but we had a great time and the staff and location made up for a rather disappointing room.
