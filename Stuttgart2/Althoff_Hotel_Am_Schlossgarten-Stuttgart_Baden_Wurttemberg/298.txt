Great service and location!  The staff is wonderfully helpful at every turn.  The rooms are nicely sized with comfortable beds.  The showers are quite small, but the rest of the bathroom is well outfitted.  Close access to the main train station.  Great shopping abounds!   Would definitely return & recommend!  Their local dining suggestions were outstanding as well.
