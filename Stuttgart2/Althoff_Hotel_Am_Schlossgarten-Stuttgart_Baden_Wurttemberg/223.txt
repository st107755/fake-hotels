In front of the main train station and also easy to reach by car. Perfect location in the city center and also you can go for a walk or jogging in the park. You can only park your car in the hotel garage. It cost â‚¬19,- per night. Very friendly and helpful staff. Bed and pillows are comfortable. The Rooms have a good temperature. Bathroom is good and proper not so big. Could be better. There is no possibility to make your own thee or coffee. I will go back there.
