This hotel is in a great location in the middle of the city over looking the Schlossgarten and literally right beside the central train station. My deluxe room which was on the the gardens side was peaceful, well appointed and spacious. The breakfast buffet was excellent quality with lots of choices. Staff was very polite and professional. I had dinner at their Weinwirtschaft Franz Keller- a wine tavern with lots of lovely wines by the glass, and generous portions of Schwaben Cuisine. If you are there in the spring during white asparagus season, I highly recommend you try a dish with those luscious spears.
