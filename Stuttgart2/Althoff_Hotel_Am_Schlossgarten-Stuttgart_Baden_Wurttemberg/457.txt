This hotel is situated just a few hundred yards from the main Railway, S-Bahn U-Bahn station making it ideally situated for getting around the city  The reception is dimly lit - but the staff are very friendly and efficient  My double room was quite small and - having arrived in the middle of a September "heatwave" - was extremely hot and the air conditioning did a very poor job of cooling it down  The room had everything I needed (although the in room safe is too small for an iPad and there is no tea/coffee making facility) - English speakers please be aware that the Internet TV has a very limited number of English speaking channels ... you'd better like watching 24 hour news!  Please note that wi-fi is available in your room ... for an expensive €27 per day!  I'd arrived…
