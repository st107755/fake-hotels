This was truly one of the best hotels that we have stayed in. The staff were so helpful and professional, their service was exceptional. The room we had was lovely and spacious with a nice view over Stuttgart. The lady that serviced our room every morning was friendly and kept our room spotless with a fresh rose in our bathroom every morning which we thought was a nice touch. She clearly loved her job and we were very appreciative of her good service. This hotel is very centrally located to the train station and the main shopping area of Stuttgart and a beautiful park full of beautiful buildings perfect for a nice walk. The hotel offered exceptional service prior to our booking, Christian contacted us to arrange tours etc for our pending trip and they are such a professionalâ€¦
