What a wonderful time we had at this hotel.  Very highly recommended and was a very pleasant stay.  Michelin restaurant was totally amazing too.  Thank you to the Management and Staff.  Location is fantastic and so close to shops and DM store to buy milk and the basics.  You have to ask for a kettle, but they charge a pricy penny for tea bags.  Rather go to DM and get your coffee and teaðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— It was a little ridiculous that they wanted to charge me â‚¬16 for 2 tea bags and a little pot of honey.... Especially given the price you pay per room per night excluding breakfast.  If you wanted breakfast it was â‚¬27 per person, however if you walk just around the corner you can eat a full breakfast for â‚¬12.....
