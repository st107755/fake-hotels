Stayed at the Schlossgarten hotel for a week during the early part of November. This was my 4th stay here and in 2010 the hotel was being rennovated. The upgrade is finished and what you have now is a beautiful, stylish with quality rooms. Mine was facing the shopping area, and the room was large, comfortable and modern. The location is outstanding. You are opposite the railway station and just around the corner from the Koningstrasse, the main shopping street. Underneath the hotel is (free) parking for guests. The only 'negative' I had during my stay was that several times a day, someone from housekeeping would stop by to check my room. At one point, the person gave me no time to walk to the door, and entered before I could answer, plus another time they basically didn't botherâ€¦
