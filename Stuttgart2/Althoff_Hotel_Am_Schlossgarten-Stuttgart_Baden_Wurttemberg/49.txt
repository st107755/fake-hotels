We had an enjoyable time at this lovely hotel in Stuttgart. The service received was top notch - definitely 5 star! At the last minute I had to make a change in our reservation and Assunta was so kind to help us. From the front desk, housekeeping, to the bar and restaurant - everyone was very kind and helpful.  We traveled to Stuttgart to enjoy the Christmas Market and the Althoff Hotel was within walking distance. We were able to enjoy the market in the afternoon as well as at night. (The best Gluhwein!) The hotel was also very close to the train station that we used it to get to the airport, the Mercedes Museum and the Esslingen Christmas Market.
