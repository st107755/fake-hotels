The hotel itself is situated conveniently 5minutes walk from the main shopping centre. Good restaurants/bars are all accessible by foot (walking distance 5-10mins). The hotel itself is lovely, with good size rooms and modern amenities. The staff are welcoming and very helpful. We had a room with park view which was beautiful by day however, it should be noted that there are some homeless people in the city and many of them convened in the park directly next to the hotel at night. Staff moved them along quite quickly but two had begun camping outside the entrance doors when we arrived back from a meal out. Overall, for a shopping weekend away a great hotel choice.
