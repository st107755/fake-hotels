The hotel is located right across the central train station, accessible via the connecting underpass. It is also within walking distance to Schlossplatz.   The hotel staff were very warm and friendly. As I was checking in, another guest came by and asked the hotel staff to go across to the train station to buy him a newspaper, and they actually obliged!  The room I had was on the small side but very cozy and comfortable. The window in the room also opened slightly so I could enjoy the cool autumn breeze. Sounds from activities in the park, such as singing and laughter, does travel up when the window is open because the hotel is right next to it but it does not go on till late into the night.
