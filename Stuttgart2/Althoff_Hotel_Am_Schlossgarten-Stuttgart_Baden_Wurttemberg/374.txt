Super convenient - right at the train station - so perfect for quick a stop-over. Check-in was a breeze, my Leader's Club membership was noted, and I had a nice gift in my room. They needed a few minutes to ready the room, so I had a voucher for a drink, which I enjoyed in the bar adjacent to the lobby. Check-out, no problem, along with a little treat... at the train platform in no time. I will certainly return.
