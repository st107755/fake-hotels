Me and my partner both work in a 5 star hotel in food and beverage so we know how important good service is and it’s the small things that matter ...unfortunately not in this hotel ... After a long shopping day in Stuttgart we decided to enjoy a meal in the bar before heading home .. walking in we got a friendly greeting and were shown to a table next to a wonderful piano player .. we ordered 2 glasses of champagne. Which very strangely they arrived already poured in the glass and the waitress stood at our table and asked where she can put them down!? I would expect this service in a holiday inn airport hotel... so I ordered the ceaser salad with chicken ... the waitress came back twice to ask again what I had ordered !?! So eventually my salad came with no chicken .. I said it…
