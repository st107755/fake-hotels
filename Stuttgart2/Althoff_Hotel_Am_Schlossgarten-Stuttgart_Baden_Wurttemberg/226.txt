Super convenient to trains, shopping boulevard, main tourist office, parks, theatre (all within 1 minute). We took a bicycle rental from the station and rode through parks and streets and went exploring with ease.  Rooms very comfortable and large enough; breakfast is pleasing (if a little too popular:) Best of all is the friendly and helpful front desk and lobby staff. Can't fault this hotel.
