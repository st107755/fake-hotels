After taking 28 hours from Copenhagen to this hotel via Air Berlin, and without our luggage the staff welcomed and helped us with basics. Having missed the first nights prepaid stay due to the delay, they gave us a v nice room. Comfortable, quiet, very clean  hotel, with some old world charm. Do not be deceived busy the average exterior of the building. The location is great with sights, eateries and easy access to the trains makes for an excellent visit. Would stay again.
