After 27 hours of flights from Australia, we were not let down by the Hotel! from the doorman to Front desk everyone was only to keen help us. We were advised by this site to get a Garden View room and were lucky enough for our request to be accommodated..room 309 or 409 are the pick. Resturant was beautiful...easy access to the xmas markets, railway station and local shops.Look forward to staying there again! Great Location for a Porsche Museum visit only train  5 stops away (please note closed on Mondays)
