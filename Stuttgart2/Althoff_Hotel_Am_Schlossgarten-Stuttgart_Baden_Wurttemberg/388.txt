This hotel could be nearly perfect if not for a few things. The room I stayed in was quite small and although it was beautifully furnished I was disappointed by the lack of a bath and coffee and tea making facilities. The breakfast quality was excellent as were the staff. I ate dinner in the Vinothek restaurant and was very impressed. Checkin staff were very friendly and efficient. The location is perfect, especially if you a using trains..
