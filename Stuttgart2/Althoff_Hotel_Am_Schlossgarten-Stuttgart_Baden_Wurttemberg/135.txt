We stayed here whilst visiting the Christmas markets. A wonderful and convenient location, close to main street and railway station. Hotel staff very helpful and friendly.  Great lounge/bar area. We stayed in a Junior suite. It was a little basic in particular the bathroom, but to be honest we were never in the room for very long. Comfortable beds and great turn down service.
