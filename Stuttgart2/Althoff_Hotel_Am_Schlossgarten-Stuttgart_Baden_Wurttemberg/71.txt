This is a great hotel for discovering Stuttgart. It's positioned right next to the main shopping/restaurant area. The room was fine and the food also. Easy parking in the large underground garage. On the less positive aspect, we were not allowed to sit outside on the terrace of the bar in spite of the beautiful warm evening weather. No coherent reason was given. There is also no exercise room which is inexcusable for a hotel of this standing. Make sure you get a deal with breakfast included since they charge â‚¬28 per head for the buffet.
