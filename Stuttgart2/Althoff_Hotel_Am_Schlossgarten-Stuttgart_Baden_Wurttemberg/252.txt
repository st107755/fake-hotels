In the beginning of Sep I came in Germany with my husband to visit his family.Rooms looking good.over! Cleaned careless.Personal from breakfast and room service cheerful,what I cannot say about people who are cleaning.We had a very annoying tall woman Slavic appearance who was always talking bad on German when we said no and closed door or asked to clean our room in the last second. Advice : take care about your stuff.and check rooms after cleaning if your team isn't able to do this. Unfortunately made no pics,didn't think about that
