Firstly anyone visiting Stuttgart could do a lot worse than this hotel, it's five stars but four and a half of those stars are for the staff, room and breakfast. Great bed and nice bathroom and the staff are the best one could ask for as has been documented. But, lets face it, it wouldn't hurt to have free WIFI, these days if i am paying for a five star hotel it seems a bit penny pinching to pay 8 euros for half an hour when, if i could be bothered, i could walk to a cafe and get it for free. Secondly a five star hotel really should buy some new towels occasionally. I really couldn't tell if ours were big bathmats or not. I think they were just about ready to be folded and used for packaging food parcels to third world villages.  And why no gym? just convert a room - that oneâ€¦
