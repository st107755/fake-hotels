On a recent trip to Stuttgart I stayed again in this nice hotel in the very city centre on the corner of a large park. I had a nice, very quiet room overlooking the park.  The room was well decorated, with a little bit too much dark brown. A quite large working area with quick Wifi and sufficient connectors. The bathroom was well equipped. The personnel is very kind. The hotel restaurant is outstanding. The room rate was ok.
