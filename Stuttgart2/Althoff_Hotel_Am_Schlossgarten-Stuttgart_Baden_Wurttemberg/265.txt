The service was really fantastic. I arrived with my son after a 20 trip from Singapore. The room was not ready but the reception did all possible to speed this up and offered to call me once ready. I appreciated this especially as we where arriving at noon and it was clear that rooms where only booked from 3pm onwards.  Quality of the bed & bed linnen also very good (as may be expected in a 5* leading hotels of the world).  But to be critical, 5* stands for perfection; the double room was tiny. The bathroom contained a shower that I would expect in an Ibis hotel (small white/plastic wobly shower door). All was ok but not up to expectations. Further as I was pushing my son in a strawler I was surprised that there was no porter; many times I had to struggle to open the doorâ€¦
