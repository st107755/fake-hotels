This hotel has a fantastic location right outside is the shopping mall. The staff at reception were very helpful. The rooms were lovely and were very large. The only disappointing thing for me was the service at the restaurant at dinner. Seems there were a lot of waiters but they all just stood there we had to ask every time we needed anything.
