Hotel was beautiful and comfortable but the restaurant staff were downright horrible. For no reason they were not courteous and slow and simply made it very uncomfortable to eat breakfast!! Breakfast was expensive which was perfectly fine but we had to ask to get our order taken after 20 minutes wait in a near empty restaurant. Food came slow and server was very very unfriendly -
