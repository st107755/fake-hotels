Stayed in this hotel on a recent business trip to Stuttgart. Great location, just a few minutes walk from the Main Station and also has underground parking next door to the hotel. Large rooms, with flat screen TV and Nespresso type coffee maker. Excellent buffet breakfast with friendly staff. Bar area is good for business meetings. The only negative point, no fitness studio on the premises, hotel has a partnership with an external fitness centre, but we did not have time to check it out. Highly recommended.
