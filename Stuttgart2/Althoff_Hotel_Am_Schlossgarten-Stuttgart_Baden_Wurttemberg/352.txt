Upon arriving at the station across the road, this hotel is in a perfect location to access transport and other services. Staff are very attentive from the outset.  Food is excellent and room service very polite. Room was impeccable and a pleasure to stay in.  Well worth the stay and I will definitely stay again. Well done.
