This hotel was seriously incredible. First off, the staff were very helpful at check-in and a gentleman also held doors for me and helped me carry my bags to my room without my asking. Sounds standard, but I can assure you that you get some eye-rolling in Europe if you ask for help sometimes, even if it is at a higih-end hotel and should be a given!

Now I know from some of my colleagues who stayed there that their rooms were a bit smaller, but still really nice and spacious. And we all had these menus on the nightstand by the bed from which you could order some really cool stuff like a satin gel-filled eye mask /â€¦
