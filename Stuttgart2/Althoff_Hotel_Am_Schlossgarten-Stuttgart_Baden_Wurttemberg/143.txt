We spent Easter at the Althoff Hotel Am Schlossgarten and enjoyed our stay greatly.  It's fair to say that 1960's architecture has not dated well externally, but the interior is excellently maintained and finished to a very high standard.  The John Cranko Lounge was an excellent evening venue, with reasonable prices and a good atmosphere.  Our only negatives were the lack of storage in the room - just a very small wardrobe and no drawer space - and a shower screen that almost met in the middle!  A very pleasant stay, thank you!
