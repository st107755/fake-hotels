This was my third time in Stuttgart for business and I've stayed in three different hotels.  I would have to say that this was my favorite hotel of the three.  As most other posters have already stated, the location is great.  Close to the train station, subway and shopping.  I stayed in the Executive Room, which is the basic room I believe, and I found the size to be quite adequate for a European hotel.  Most importantly for me was the fact that the rooms were extremely clean at all times.  Room service does an excellent job with that.  My only complaint would be that they do pass by a couple of times in the evening to check on the mini bar and to do the turn down bed service.  If you don't want to be disturbed, make sure to put your "do not disturb" sign up.  I had no problemâ€¦
