We arrived in Stuttgart in very bad stormy weather.  The bellhop saw us coming but instead of helping us with our luggage when our cab pulled in, he went inside the hotel.  We didn't see him again until after we finished checking in.  Bad start.  Check-in was quick and efficient.  Our "deluxe" room was dated, the old TV had bad reception because of the rain (for a 5-star hotel, they really need to upgrade this), and it was HOT in the room even though A/C was on full blast.  But there are some positives such as the toiletries (L'Occitane), service from the front desk(they helped my husband set up the SIM card for his cell phone since instructions were in German and did so in a very patient and friendly manner), and the location as other reviewers have noted.  Would we stay hereâ€¦
