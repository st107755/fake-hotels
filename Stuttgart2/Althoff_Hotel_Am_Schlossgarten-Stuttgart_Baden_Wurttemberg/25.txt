Not a bad place, relatively clean (but not spotless), comfortable beds, nice shower, decent internet, hitting my Big 4 wants in a hotel, but some major deficiencies.  If you want a shirt ironed, no service provided, but they will provide you with an iron.  But my only real major complaint is the poor functioning Air Conditioning.  Simply, an expensive hotel should figure out something as basic as AC.  Yes it was a hot day, but still not an excuse!  And can there be some sort of exercise room?  Staff was nice and tried hard and the breakfast was well above average!   I would return, this hotel was not a good value proposition.
