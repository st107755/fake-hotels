From the very smooth check-in until the equally smooth check-out, the experience was brilliant. The hotel feels immaculate and certainly better than both The Savoy and Regents Park in London. My room was wonderful, with every detail covered, the bedding was luxurious. My biggest compliment must go to the breakfast, the service and quality was royal. The attention to detail was incredible.
