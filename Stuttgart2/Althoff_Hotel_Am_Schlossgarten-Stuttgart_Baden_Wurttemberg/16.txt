The hotel is located across from the train station making it very convenient especially if you plan on using the trains to do excursions outside of the city. It is also located directly next to their main shopping district with easy access to stores and restaurants and a short walk to historical sites and buildings. The room is well insulated from outside noise, we slept great and appreciated the attention to detail the hotel offered.  The hotel staff is multi-lingual, extremely friendly and helpful with any questions or concerns. There is a restaurant and bar onsite along with other facilities available. Everything about this hotel shows a high level of quality and care for the guests. Rooms are nicely sized and furnished and there is plenty of room for luggage and spreadingâ€¦
