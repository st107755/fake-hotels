We can all improve - so 10 should be an aspiration not a destination !  But this hotel sure gets close. Facilities and Service excellent - the latter achieves the challenging balance of professionalism, personalisation and friendliness. Very well done. Room a bit small - would recommend going for larger if available / affordable. Food excellent. Ideal location with secure parking if required.  I'm not easily impressed - but I was here.
