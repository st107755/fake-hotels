We stayed in this hotel back in March for a business trip, I choose this hotel due to its superb Central location and proximity to the Station which makes the trip from the Airport a cheap option. The hotel is quite luxurious and staff are very attentive we only had breakfast at the hotel which was a speedy affair which is just what we needed when rushing off to business!
