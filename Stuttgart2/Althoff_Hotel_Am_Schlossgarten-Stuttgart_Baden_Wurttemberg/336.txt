The location of this hotel is excellent, and I would recommend a room with a garden view, not just for the view but to avoid traffic noise.   The room was large except for the bathroom. However we did have a problem as the air conditioning was switched off. Although the weather was quite cool it was impossible to open the windows more than a few centimetres, presumably for health and safety reasons, and if there was any wind they immediately blew shut. Therefore the room was quite stuffy.  Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and found the reception staff most obliging.
