We stayed here when we took the European Delivery Plan for our new Mercedes-Benz. The hotel seems to have a lot of business people, many I suspect there for business with Mercedes. The reception staff was wonderful. The doorman service was quite sloppy as there was no one there when we arrived to help us with our luggage; several times when we left there was no one there to help up get stuff into a taxi. The breakfast buffet was fine, typical of a good German hotel. They missed a wake up call we had asked for. Room was beautiful. Overall, not as efficient as I expect from a German hotel aimed at the business traveler.
