We were very surprised at how well priced this hotel is.  The room was so spacious with a seperate room for luggage, clothing cupboard, fridge, large very modern bathroom.  Nice to have a lounge suite. Located at the bottom of a 2 mile long shopping mall and across from the station which you can't hear.  Short cab ride to dine at restaurants with the locals.
