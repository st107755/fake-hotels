I stayed here in November for the 4th time, and it is always a pleasure to see so many familiar faces at the Schlossgarten Hotel. Staff is always attentive, helpful and polite, the rooms are good and comfortable (shower is a tad small) and the location in perfect.   Try their cafe next door and enjoy it for breakfast and/or dinner. Staff is knowledgable and helpful. The bar is a good place to enjoy a nightcap. Housekeeping is fast and attentive, but I recommend that you put the "Do Not Disturb" sign on your door if you are staying in your room during the day, as they have a habbit of checking your room several times a day. It has happened on a few occasions that I was trying to nap, only to hear a quick knock on the door followed by someone walking in. Also, don't be surprisedâ€¦
