The Althoff Hotel Am Schlossgarten is you best bet in Stuttgart. The hotel staff is marvelous and go out of their way to make you feel at home. The facilityitself is a 1960's modern designed property that has been recently renovated and is what I would call "warm, modern elegance." I had a Junior Suite on the top floor of the hotel, where all of their suites are located. It was definitely worth the extra money. The lobby bar is intimate and a piano player entertains each evenining. The backdrop of the bar and restaurant, which is also excellent is the beautiful old Schlossgarten. The main street with shops, restaurants, etc. is just around the corner.   The front desk staff is top notch as was everyone I encountered in the hotel. Housekeeping was flawless and turndown serviceâ€¦
