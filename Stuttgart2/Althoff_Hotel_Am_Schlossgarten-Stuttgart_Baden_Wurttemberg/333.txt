The Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten is my hotel of choice whenever business brings me to Stuttgart, and is perhaps my favorite hotel anywhere. The atmosphere is charming; the amenities are first class; the location is perfect; the food and drink could hardly be better; and, perhaps most importantly, the people are absolutely wonderful. I love staying here -- it is truly a "home away from home."
