We had a suite with a balcony. The balcony was very small, needed renovations. There was no bellman at arrival, we had to take care of our luggage. Later in the evening there was nobody at the reception immediately available, we had to call a few times until a guy appeared tired and not helpful.  All in all just ok, very old fashioned style.
