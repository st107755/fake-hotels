This is a beautifully kept immaculate hotel right on the Schlossgarten near the train station. My father and I did a once-and-a-lifetime trip to the Springfest/VFB Stuttgart game and were not disappointed by the level of service we experienced.   The room was spacious and the cleaning staff thorough. Each night we had a turndown service comparable to most cruise ships with mints, robes, and slippers. The chrome in the bathroom sparkled. We took in live music in the hotel bar each night as we shared a nightcap. The location and the service was top-notch.   One of the complaints I had read about ahead of time was the confusing air conditioner. I still can't make sense of it, but I've included a picture with my review that kept it comfortable in the room when it was 29 C / 85 Fâ€¦
