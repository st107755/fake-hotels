So, where to start? Firstly, our room (a junior suite) was clean and comfortable. Amble parking is available (at a fee). Staff has been really friendly and professional. However, our room is facing the Sky Beach bar, so we have “enjoyed” loud music both nights here. The breakfast is so-so but the price isn’t. The hotel corner of the park is occupied by some unsavory types, so you don’t want to go that way at night. Not sure I will be coming here again.
