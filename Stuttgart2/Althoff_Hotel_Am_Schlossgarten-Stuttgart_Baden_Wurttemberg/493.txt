The reviewer from Hong Kong was spot-on on everything but I didn't find it dated.  It was clean, a definate 4 star hotel, with courteous, competent staff.  The location is fabulous, in the center of town, and backs on a charming park.  We spent most of our time in the hotel, parked on a cafe table overlooking the park.  Very nice.  We had a Jr. Suite at around 275 Euros....a little expensive but worth it.    This is a Leading Hotel of the World member, and we have generally good luck with these.
