Stayed here in December as we were visiting the Christmas Market. We arrived early Friday morning and to our pleasant surprise we were able to check in - a big tick already. The room was comfortable, well maintained and had everything we needed.  The location was ideal and it took no more than 10 minutes to walk to the market - we intend to return this year which in itself tells you how good this hotel is. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot review this but if its anything like the rest of the hotel, I am sure it will be fabulous.  Recommended
