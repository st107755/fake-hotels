This was a one night stay for us and there were no complaints.  Rooms were cozy, but very clean.  The hotel is very central for Stuttgart, as it is a 3 minute walk from the main train station.  The package we got did not have a b&b portion so we did not have any interaction with the restaurant.    The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  If we return to Stuttgart on business or leisure we would stay here again.
