We booked this hotel as a rest spot the night before our flight out of Germany and immediately wished we had booked more time. The location on the park and mall are wonderful for people watching AND shopping. The rooms were very big and spacious and lovely in decore. The management knew my husband was is in the middle of a battle with cancer and upgraded us to ensure space and quiet for him. The staff were very dear. The best idea was we drove in with a Hertz car and they volunteered and actually managed to have our car picked up by Hertz so we didnt have to manage luggage and car drop at the hotel the following morning. Really wonderful combination, include it on your itinerary and you wont be sorry.
