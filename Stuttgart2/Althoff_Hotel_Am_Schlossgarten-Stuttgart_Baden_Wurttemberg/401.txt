The location of the hotel is perfect (it was the reason, why we chose particularly this place). We stayed for 2 nights in a junior suite for 3 persons. We liked our room a lot, the staff was attentive and polite. Live music at the hotel's bar was very nice. We would like to have the Internet for more reasonable price or for free, though.
