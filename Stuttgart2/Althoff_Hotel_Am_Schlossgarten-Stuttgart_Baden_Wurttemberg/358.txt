Excellent location right out of the rail station unrpass and tourist info right there. Near city center and all shopping. There was no one there greeting at the door when I arrived or left. There's no separate concierge desk but staff was helpful with city tours etc. The elevator is extremely small. The junior suite we got was great, luxurious, beautifully appointed with a walk in closet. Got turn down service each night without asking. Lovely. Requested quiet room, away from elevator and got it. What I really hate is when I they a new hotel, and get a room with NO view. Is was it. I was facing some office windows. Also, ceiling has no buffer from upper level noise. I had to call front desk about loud steps, jumping I hear above me. For a leading hotel of the world, this hotelâ€¦
