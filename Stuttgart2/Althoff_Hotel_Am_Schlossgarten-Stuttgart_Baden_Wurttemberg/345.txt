We have just returned from visiting Stuttgart Christmas market & stopped at the Am Schlossgarten. The location is excellent, right next to a main walkway full of shops & only 5 minutes walk from the Christmas market. Also very close to the rail station. We stayed in a superior double room which was lovely. Huge bed, we reckoned about 7 ft wide, with a large TV, mini bar & seating area. No kettle, so I was glad I packed my own (being very British). Breakfast in the hotel was good, mainly fruits, breads & yoghurts with options of eggs however you liked. Found the staff more than helpful & everyone was very pleasant. For such a central location, this was a nice quiet hotel.
