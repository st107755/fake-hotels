We stayed for a night here a couple of weeks ago. The hotel was absolutely wonderful in every way. The service was wonderful. Our standard room was large and we were lucky enough to get a room with a lovely view of the garden. The room was tasteful and spotlessly cleaned. We had dinner at the hotels Michelin starred restaurant and had an amazing meal. Every member of the staff we encountered was very helpful. I would be very happy to stay here again the next time I visit Stuttgart.
