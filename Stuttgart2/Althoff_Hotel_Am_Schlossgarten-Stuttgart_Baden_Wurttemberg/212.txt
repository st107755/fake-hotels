Overall great hotel! The room I had was modern with fast wifi and very quiet considering you are central to everything. Now the best part. All the staff, from the bellman to the reception and the restaurant(both breakfast and dinner) are EXCELLENT. No request was too small and allowing me to speak my terrible German and English was very helpful. Would stay again!
