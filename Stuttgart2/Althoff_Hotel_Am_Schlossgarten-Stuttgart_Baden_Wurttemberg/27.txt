The hotel is located in an excellent location, close to the Stuttgart HB, close to historical sites and very good location for shopping. Service at this hotel is impeccable. Ms.Ute and all her colleagues at the front desk were extremely helpful. We have only good things to say about this hotel. Mr. Dusko (spelling?) was extremely helpful.
