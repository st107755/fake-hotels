This is a very fancy, elegant hotel. The rooms are very nicely decorated. The bed is very comfortable. Staff is friendly and ready to answer to any request. The breakfast is great. Includes a selection of french cheeses, german charcuterie and many other options. The only down is the bathrooms. For such fancy hotel, the shower should not wet the whole room.
