The Althof Hotel in Stuttgart is one of those hotels that you feel sad when you need to check out. The facilities are very good, very well located; in downtown a few meters from the Bahnhof. The service is excellent; everyone is willing to help you with a smile. The room I stayed was very nice, with ample bed, good resting area and excellently designed and furbished bathroom. The breakfast buffet is superb, again with a very fast and smiling service. At the second day the attendant already knew my name. I don't rember of a hotel where the bell boy offers to help you with my luggage until the train platform. Congratulations to the hotel management and staff.
