I always expect a hotel to be clean and the staff efficient.  This hotel meets and exceeds that expectation.  Their location is in a shopping area which is very close and walkable.  I enjoyed their breakfast buffet for 3 mornings.  The variety of food and efficient staff service made dining a pleasure.
