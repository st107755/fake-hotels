We stayed here for second time during the past six months and we were very happy with our stay. Below youll find the summary:  + fantastic location at Stuttgart city center just a few meters from pedestrian street, museums, theater etc.  + service attitude of all personnel really reflects the five star standard the hotel stands for + breakfast is awasome, right selection of buffet and ala carte, service attitude, capability to handle full hotel breakfast at rush hour was well done.

However hotel cant do…
