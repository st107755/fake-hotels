We stayed over the weekend in the Hotel. It is ok but for us not really a Leading Hotel. The rooms to us are seriously old-fashioned and small. Bathrooms ok. Breakfast ok but also rather on the standard side. Big minus - SPA is missing likewise the gym. This is  something would expect from a Leading Hotel and in this category.
