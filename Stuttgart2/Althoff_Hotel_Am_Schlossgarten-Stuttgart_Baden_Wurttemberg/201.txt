We stayed here at the end of December 2015 while visiting a relative in Stuttgart. The hotel's location in Stuttgart is excellent. You can just hop off the train and walk directly to the hotel. Very much appreciated after a long international journey. It's also right in the middle of town, and is surrounded by lots of shops and restaurants. Easy walk to the Opera House as well as other attractions. Our room was comfortable, but pretty small - the bathroom was VERY small (it's Europe after all), but my parents had a suite, and their room was very nice. It was clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I think it's a good choice in Stuttgart, and I'd stay there again.
