We spent a weekend in Stuttgart in Althoff, which proved to be a good choice. The junior suite we got was reasonably spaced, with walk in closet and large shower although no tube. The furniture is functional but a bit baroque, you rightly sink in the sofa. Good breakfast, good restaurants - one with Michelin Star. No fitness facility at the location - you need to go to their cooperation partner - which is not convenient for us.
