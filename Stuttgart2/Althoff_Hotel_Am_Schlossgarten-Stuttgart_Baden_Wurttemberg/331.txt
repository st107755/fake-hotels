Pros: Spacious clean rooms. Friendly front desk staff and doorman. Centrally located.  Cons: Room safe antiquated.  Difficulty to access wifi. Room not cleaned until after 4:30pm (had to request room be made up). Housekeeper had attitude,threw the room together and stayed 5 minutes. Didn't change the bed linen.  This shouldn't happen at a leading hotel of the world.  Parking was an adventure.
