I went to Stuttgart for seeing an old friend and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend. The hotel is definitely centrally and conveniently located, though it was a bit tricky to locate it at first as it was a bit hidden and there was no sign of hotel. Once you arrive Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, go to underground hall, get out of the exit of Königstraße, then you will see the hotel on the left hand side from the tourist centre corner.   The hotel is rather low-key, though you can definitely tell it's a proper 5-star hotel. I checked in a bit earlier than the check-in time, and the room was ready at once. The first room I had was classy and well-decorated, however, I changed to a smaller room as I wanted a queen bed instead of twin bed.   Overall, both rooms were clean and nicely…
