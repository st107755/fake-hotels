My company exhibited at R + T Stuttgart 2015 and we wanted somewhere far enough from the exhibition to get away from it but close enough to limit travel time - This hotel fitted the bill perfectly. the staff were very helpful and courteous, but i can help thinking that it could have been so much better. There was no pool or gym facilities in the hotel, the rooms were very dated, although very clean and comfy.   the Vinotek restaurant was very nice and reasonably priced too, i would recommend the steak specialist...Hmmmmm.  Probably wouldn't stay again, but thank you anyway.
