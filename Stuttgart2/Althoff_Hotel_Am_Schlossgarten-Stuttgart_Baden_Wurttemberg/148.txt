Staff very friendly and accommodating.  Rooms are nice,especially park view, but climate control difficult to maintain. Was very hot in the room and simply could not cool it down.  Several colleges in the hotel had same issue, especially when sleeping. Also more importantly Very Poor wireless internet signal in rooms, made it very difficult to work at nights. Non secure connection that didnt require a password as well.  That being said, location is as good as it gets.
