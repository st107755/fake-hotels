Stayed here end of August and it was everything that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Room was comfortable and had some nice touches, although you could see where the odd bit of works needs to be done. We had a Park Suite which like all suites is on the top floor. This was the only hotel of the 4 that we stayed at during our trip around the south west that offered full service. No restricted menu in the restaurant, breakfast was one of the best in a very long time. The staff were all ways there, the breakfast crew remembered our name and what we had the day before.  Location is central and ample parking below.
