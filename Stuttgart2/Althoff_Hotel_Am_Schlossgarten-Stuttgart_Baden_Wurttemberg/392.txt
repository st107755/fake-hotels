Stayed at the Althoff for three days in December 2012, for the Christmas markets. The hotel is in a very convienent location, both from the airport and the city center. The rooms are big, and there is a very good range of toiliteries in the bathroom. The robes and slippers are a nice touch too. Breakfast was not included, and I thought priced a little high, however there was an excepitional range of food on offer and all very good quailty. The staff at the reception were very good and knowledable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and if in Stuttgart again would want to stay here again.
