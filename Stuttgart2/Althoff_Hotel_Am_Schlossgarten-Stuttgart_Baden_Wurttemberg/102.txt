The location of this hotel, near to the underpass for the station, round the corner from a main shopping street, near the tourist information and the hop-on hop-off bust stop is excellent.  The public areas of the hotel were very smart, with a large lobby, cocktail lounge, cafe and restaurant.  We had breakfast one morning in the restaurant and it was very good with pleasant staff.  After that we had breakfast either at the nearby Bakery or the department store, as we did not wish to have such a full breakfast everyday.  The cafe, which did not open until 10.00 a.m. was very nice, with delicious gateaux, ice-creams and drinks.  We did not dine in the restaurant as we had arranged various evenings with friends.  We had a double room on the 6th floor which overlooked the park. â€¦
