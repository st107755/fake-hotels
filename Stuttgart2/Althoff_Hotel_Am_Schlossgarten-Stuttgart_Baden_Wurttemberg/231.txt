I spent a great night in the Althoff Hotel--and it met my expectations of a 4 to 5 star hotel.  The food options available were top notch, and the wine selection was extraordinary.  The room was clean, and had the typical robe and slipper-type amenities.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone willing to pay a typical 4 to 5 star hotel fare, but not for those on a budget.
