Never, ever, and no way- to call this hotel a 5-starred lol. We arrived almost at midnight, and cant say, that we were so welcomed, the guy at reception seemed to be wicked. They made us wait for almost an hour to arrange our booking(they couldnt find it). We booked a suite, but didnt look like that: country style bed, wardrobes with scratched broken doors, old bathroom with smell like in hospital...  next morning my amazing impression was full filled with a restaurant. My advice: dont take a table by the window, cause youll be amazed with view: double barber wire looks like ghetto... on top of that, if the weather is not sunny, u unconscionably start thinking about your actual nationality, roots and politic situations in the world😅😅😅🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
