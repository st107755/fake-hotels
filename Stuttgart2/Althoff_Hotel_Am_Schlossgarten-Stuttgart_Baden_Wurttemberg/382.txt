36 hours in Stuttgart the Althoff was a delightful oasis on a weeklong multi-city trip.  Service was excellent, breakfast buffet had more than one could ask for, (and launched a warm, soft pretzel binge. If you live them at the ball park or streets of NYC, German soft pretzels are the creme de le creme- crispy outside, soft inside.) the location is a short walk to quick lunch or neighborhood shopping if you have time.  Oh, and large bathrooms, always welcome.
