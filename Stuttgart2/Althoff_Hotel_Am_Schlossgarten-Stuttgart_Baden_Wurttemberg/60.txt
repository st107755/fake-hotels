Located right next to the Stuttgart train stations (both the S-Bahn and the DB).  The location is ideal if you are planning on taking the trains.  Booked through LHW I received a free upgrade and had a nice view.  Stuttgart was warm the week I stayed, but no issues with cooling in the room.  Amenities are a little limited as I don't believe they have a gym/pool, but the park is next door for a run/walk.  Staff was very welcoming and had dinner one night at the bar.  Food was very good, but the bartender's knowledge of craft cocktails was amazing.  He really took the time to make the cocktail perfect.  The bar alone is worth a visit
