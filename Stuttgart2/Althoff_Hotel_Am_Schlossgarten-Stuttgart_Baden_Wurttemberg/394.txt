Very nice hotel, smiling personnel, very good location, next to the garden but rooms are small and internet access expensive. Restaurant during summer time is located outdoor: calm and good food. Located 10min from Mercedes Benz and Porsche museums. The interior restaurant and reception should be refurbished
