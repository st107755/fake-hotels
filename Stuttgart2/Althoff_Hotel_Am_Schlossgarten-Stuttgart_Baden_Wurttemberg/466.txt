Our hotel, the Hotel am Schlossgarten was just outside the train station and a short walk.  Approaching it you wonder if it truly is a 5 star or was that an error?  Fear not for once you enter the lobby you can see for yourself that it is a wonderful choice for a hotel for those traveling by train.  Efficient and friendly check in, then off to our rooms.  Yay, washcloths!  Europeans do not seem to realize how much we adore these small pieces of terry and feel lost without them.  Here at least we had some.  Nice sized room with a good sized bed.    They also have had these duvets that act as both top sheet and comforter so if you are a hot person, you need to bring some jammies with you because that comforter will become hot then quickly you will realize that you are now coldâ€¦
