We booked a deluxe king room. Our car was valet parked when we arrived. We found the reception staff friendly & gave us good service, showing us everything in our room. The room was nice  but smallish, a good bathroom but again smallish but it had a separate shower unit. There was a small safe,  really only for things like passport, mini fridge, & free wifi for all devices. The wifi however was terrible it kept dropping out & needing to be reconnected, once connected it was very very slow. We chose to eat in our room one evening & the  room service was very good although not much room for things to be set up. Breakfast cost  â‚¬29pp. The hotel is situated within walking distance from the shopping centre & places like Schlossplatz. Overall we enjoyed our stay.
