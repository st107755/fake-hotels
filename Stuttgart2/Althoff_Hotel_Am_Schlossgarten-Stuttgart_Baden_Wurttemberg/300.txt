The hotel has the best possible location in Stuttgart. It is few meters from KÃ¶nigstrasse, the main shopping street, very close to the main railwaystation, close to opera and state theatre. In the middle of the city centre but at the same time in a park. Service is excellent, rooms are big. The whole hotel needs to be renovated. Breakfast buffet included everything you could wish. The hotel Cafe is excellent offering some special punch in metal cups.
