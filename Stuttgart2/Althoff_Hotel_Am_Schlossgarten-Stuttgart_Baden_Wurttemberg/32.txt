We stayed there for 3 nights and found the location to be just sensational It is right next to the main train station which has both  the local and inter city trains The hop on hop off bus operates from the front door and the main shopping area and restaurants are right there as well  It is right next door to a park and our room had  a view over this beautiful area  The rooms are not over spacious but well appointed and comfortable with an old world feeling The staff were most helpful and friendly making your stay there a pleasant experience  We could recommend this venue if you are in Stuttgart
