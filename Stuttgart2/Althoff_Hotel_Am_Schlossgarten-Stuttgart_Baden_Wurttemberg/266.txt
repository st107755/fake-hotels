One Word: Fruhstuck!  The best part of the hotel was definitely zie breakfast. I have never seen a spread like that before: cured meats, eggs, juice, salmon, you name it they had it. The terrace overlooking the schlossgarten is a great area to enjoy your food.   Rooms were mediocre, they are a little small but nonetheless clean. This is an extremely pricey hotel so I guess that's okay. Centrally located, close to the main train station and also close to the S-Bahn.
