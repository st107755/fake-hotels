We stayed a couple of nights in this hotel in mid April.  It seems a “traditional” hotel and quite comfortable.  The location is good, very near central train station and adjacent to a large park.  Many tourist attractions are within a short walk in the park which is active well into the evening.  Excellent hotel for travellers without cars, for that matter, they have hotel parking, so just mark it down as an excellent hotel.  One other thing, the breakfast, while not inexpensive is excellent, in addition to a well stocked buffet they offer a menu that has many Swabian delights that can be made to order.  Don’t be shy about ordering, you can have multiple items all included in the same price.
