Good but not as good as the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin a block away. We arrived a few hours before check in, so our room wasn't ready. We waited in the bar for hours. Finally, after checking three times and an hour PAST check in time, our room was ready. They gave us a free drink coupon for our wait, but it was only good for a non-cocktail. A caesar salad was so-so. A hard bed, but thatâ€™s a German thing. My wife says the hair dryer was of poor quality. Breakfast was nice, and it's really great that it starts at 6am for the many European Delivery visitors, but again, the Graf's is better.
