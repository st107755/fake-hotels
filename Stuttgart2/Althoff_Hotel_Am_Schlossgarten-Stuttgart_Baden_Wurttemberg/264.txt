this 5 *hotel combines things that you rarely find in a hotel.it is just 100 meter away from the train station and just few steps from Koenigsstrasse (King's Street)  the central shopping and business street in Stuttgart,and at the same time facing a beautiful garden "the wonderful Schlossgarten".we were fortunate to book a deluxe room that faced the garden,the scene was amazing, you feel as if you are staying in a resort not in the most crowded area. the breakfast also was so tasty concentrating on the quality more than the quantity.I highly recommend this hotel for those visiting stuttgart.
