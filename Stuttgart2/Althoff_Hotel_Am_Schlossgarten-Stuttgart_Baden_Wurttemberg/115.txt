My sister and I booked this hotel for two nights, including the fixed dinner at the Zwirbelstube. We arrived by train and the hotel is literally just a few steps from the Hauptbahnhof.   I upgraded us to a Deluxe room (Euro 30 extra) so I can't comment on the regular rooms; our room looked onto the park.  We got free water in the room every day, which was appreciated and had breakfast included, which was delicious.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful!  The bathroom was nice and clean with good products. My sister enjoyed the bath tub.  The room had air conditioning which we used as it was warm and very humid. On full setting (3), it was not cool enough for me, as I am used to American A/C. One night we had the windows open but ended up closing them as it's quiteâ€¦
