Another last minute decision to stay.  This time with no luggage.  The Receptionist was outstanding.  She found us toothbrushes, toothpaste, deoderant and shaving kit.  Nothing was too much trouble. The room was spotlessly clean and everything else we needed was available.  An exellent nights sleep in a comfortable and quiet room.  The location was perfect for shopping and sightseeing the next day.
