Stuttgart was our second stop on our four stop Germany road trip.  It's a great place for day trips.  The Am Schlossgarten was amazing.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful. Parking is next to the hotel in an underground garage, 19 Euros  a day.  The valet will get your car for you , same price ( self park/valet ).  Hotel is located across from the train station, for some people that may seem a little noisy.  We had a Junior Suite King Room.  It was rather large for a European hotel room.
