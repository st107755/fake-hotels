Family of three traveling with our 10 month old son and we are staying here one night only to do our European delivery on the purchase of our car.  Being extremely jet-lagged we popped up at the cafe at 925am at night and patiently waited to be seated.  No one came to us so we asked one of the waitresses if we could sit and she said sure, anywhere is fine.  We then saw her attend to three other parties before waived her down to ask for menus.  Now it’s 935pm and the waitress finally comes over to ask us if we were eating because the kitchen was already closed.  Extremely rude to watch her serve the other guests before us, not bother to bring us menus or acknowledge us at all.  Disappointed in the service and believe this hotel should be dinged stars because of it.  Overall…
