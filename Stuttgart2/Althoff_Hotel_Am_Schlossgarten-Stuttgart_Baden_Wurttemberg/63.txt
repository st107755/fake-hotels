This hotel is located centrally and across the street from the hauptbahnhof and next to the shopping street and main city park.   Service is gracious and accommodating where possible.   Breakfast is plentiful.   The only issue was wifi was dismal and my speed test showed less than 1 MB/sec download speeds.
