Location in perfect, just opposite Hbf, on the edge of the central shopping area.  Hotel is luxurious, as you'd expect for this cost.  However the hotel told us:  1.  There are no fitness/leisure facilities included 2.  Tea/coffee making facilities in the room are limited to a specific type of coffee.  If you want decaffeinated coffee or any sort of tea, you have to pay for room service.  A further issue we faced was that the room door didn't shut tightly.  This wasn't too unexpected due to the age of the building.  But it did annoy us that the door would keep banging during the night because of air movement in the corridor.  In hindsight I think I should have booked at the Park Inn
