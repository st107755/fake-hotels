Hotel staff, the restaurant, and the location across from the train station was perfect.We were able to obtain train info at the hotel as well as the train station operators.  People at the train station were very helpful.  We trained to Laupheim where we met a person named Sabine  who took us  where my ancestors are buried (1750-1909) to my great-grandfather and great-grand mother are buried.  A plaque on the wall as you entered  the cemetary gates indicated friends and family who died in the gas chambers.  The cemetary was right where lived.
