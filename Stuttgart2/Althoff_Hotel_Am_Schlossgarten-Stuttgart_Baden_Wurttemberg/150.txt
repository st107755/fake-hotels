The Althoff is a great hotel right next to the city center in Stuttgart. It's a bid hard to spot next to the central shopping street and looks a bit dull from the outside, but it's actually pretty nice: Clean, modern rooms with nice views across the Schlossgarten, the great location, a proper breakfast (though 27 Euros are quite a price tag), free newspaper in the morning, friendly staff, ... all good!
