We often visit Stuttgart to meet up with relations who live there. These days we usually travel by train and this hotel is very close to the station, one of our favourite buildings in the city, the modification of which is causing much local controversy! Don't be put off by the approach to the hotel through an unattractive shopping precinct, the main part of the hotel looks on to the park.We found our room comfortable and the staff were very good. There is a very pleasant outside restaurant/cafe/bar that ajoins the park.We will stay here again next year, we slightly prefer it to the Zeppelin and the Arcotel Camino which are also very good..
