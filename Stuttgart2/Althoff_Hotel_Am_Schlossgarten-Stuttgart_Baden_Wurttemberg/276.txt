For 10 years we have stayed at the Schlossgarten, after checking out the other two 5 star hotels in Stuttgart. The location alone will make you choose the Schlossgarten, but it is the rooms and the staff that will make you glad you did.  The friendly staff greets you on your arrival and offers some of the most spacious rooms in town. The entire staff (front desk, bell hops, dining, housekeeping) will always greet you with a smile or Halo. You don't find that warmth with most high end hotels.  The rooms have high ceilings and while updated, have that Bavarian charm.   Just steps away from the world famous Konigstrasse, the mile long outdoor mall and the local train station make this the idea place to stay when visiting.  Ask for a room overlooking the park, you wont beâ€¦
