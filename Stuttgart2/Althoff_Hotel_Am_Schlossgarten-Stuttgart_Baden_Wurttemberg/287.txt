We stayed here for one night when we did a factory pickup of our Porsche.  The hotel is on a short option list of hotels supplied & paid for by Porsche.  As you might imagine, they only recommend hotels that support the quality of their brand.  The hotel is across from the train station and a few minutes walk with luggage but if you are elderly or have lots to carry, you might consider a cab. We had a standard room that was clean, comfortable and well appointed.  Nothing spectacular but, by most European standards, it was spacious. The breakfast was excellent!  We had dinner in one of the hotel restaurants and I would just rate the meal as "ok".  There is an outdoor patio adjacent to a park with nice views where you could have a meal or drinks. Around the corner is a pedestrianâ€¦
