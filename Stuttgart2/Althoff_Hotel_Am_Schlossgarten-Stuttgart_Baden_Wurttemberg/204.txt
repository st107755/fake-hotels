Location was perfect - easy walk to main train station, main shopping strip and lots of parkland nearly to exercise or relax in.  Food at the restaurant was wonderful. Breakfast seemed slightly overpriced, like most hotels.  My room was on the park side which had lovely views.  The room was very comfortable, clean and good value.
