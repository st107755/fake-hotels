This a luxury hotel located near a nice shopping area and the main train station in Stuttgart.  We were greeted by absolutely wonderful staff at check-in. Our room was excellent.  On the morning after our arrival, I approached the front desk and was greeted by name, something I do not ever remember happening before.  Great place.
