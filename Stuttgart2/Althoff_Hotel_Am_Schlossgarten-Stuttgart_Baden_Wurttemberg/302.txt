Lovely place to stay right in the heart of the town. We had a great room on a high floor overlooking the park. When we booked, we mentioned that it was an anniversary stay and by the time we arrived, there were beautiful rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed. Staff were really very pleasant, room was exceptionally clean. Cakes from the coffee shop downstairs - delicious!
