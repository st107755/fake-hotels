As other reviews have said, the location is excellent, the staff professional and friendly and the rooms comfortable and clean.  The bar was also good and the café (which opens at 10am) was pleasant.    So why I have rated it average - this is mainly because of the breakfast which to me is pretty essential.  The only option for our family of four if you want to eat before 10am (which most families do) is to pay 25Euros per person for a buffet.  I have travelled very extensively and never before had such a limitation in a five star hotel.  In fact I have never had this in any hotel before. Most places offer some sort of continental breakfast option eg a coffee and croissant for a smaller price.  So we had to pay 100Euro for breakfast when one of my family really didn't want to…
