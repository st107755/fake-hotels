This was the first hotel we stayed at during our tour of Bavaria.  The staff were super friendly, and the room was quite nice.  I think the weather (which was close to 80 F) was unusual for September because they had already switched over to heat, so our room was very hot - even with the window open.  We asked for a fan for the second and third nights, and it helped, but not enough to allow us a good night's sleep.  Also, with the window open, there was a lot of noise from the park below.    The hotel is situated right next to the main train station and a popular shopping district so there are lots of food options nearby.  We enjoyed the ability to just leave the car in the garage and tour town on the metro.    The room was smallish, if you are thinking US-style 5-star hotel,â€¦
