We stayed here for one night upon arrival to Germany and were grateful to have such a large and comfortable room.  The service was good and we enjoyed our drinks in the lounge.  The location was very close (3 minute walk) to the train station which was perfect for hopping on the train to visit the nearby Porsche museum.  It is also walkable to shopping and multiple eating and drinking options.  A great first night of vacation.
