Spent one night at the AM Schlossgarten Stuttgart. We arrived by train and were able to walk underground to the hotel. Great not needing to negotiate busy roads with luggage. That evening there was a wine festival in town so that was just a real treat. The hotel location is just perfect for a short stay in the city as many sights were easily within walking distance. We ate lunch at the hotel and went elsewhere for breakfast and dinner.
