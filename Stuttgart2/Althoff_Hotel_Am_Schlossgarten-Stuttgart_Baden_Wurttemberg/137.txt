Hotel was nice enough. But the staff was AMAZING. The service was just top notch all around, room service, front desk, bell guys...all great. The food was also really good. We did have an issue with the AC one evening which was miserable but they fixed it once made aware of the issue. It's in the heart of all the action so it's a great location.
