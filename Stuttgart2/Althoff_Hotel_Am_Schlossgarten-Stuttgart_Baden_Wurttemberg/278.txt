The title says it all.  The staff was fantastic and the room very clean.  The rooms A/C was terrible.   I when to another room that was offered but I did not notice any difference with temperature.  Staff did bring us an oscillating fan which helped to a degree.  The hotel did have a slight excuse since it was during a major heat wave however since the hotel claims itself to be one of the finest in Stuttgart I expect A/C that would lower the room temperature lower than 27 degrees C.
