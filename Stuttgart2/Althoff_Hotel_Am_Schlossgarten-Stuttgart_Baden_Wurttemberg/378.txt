Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten is a great hotel and certainly that is why we booked it.  Our winter vacation was constantly on the go, so despite Althoff Hotel being entirely mismatched to our travel style, we committed to 3 nights stay so we could throw our things down, relax and know that we were getting top notch service and comfort.  Location:  We visited at Christmas time, so it was PERFECT for us.  It is at the north end of the maze of markets.  At other times, there is a flurry of activity and shopping in the area.  Very upscale.  It is also perfect for train travellers.  There is such an ease of mind when the main train station is steps from your hotel.  We also spent one day at Ludwigsburg and one day at Esslingen, which are both quick commutes from this hotel.  Rooms: â€¦
