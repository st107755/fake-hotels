We came at the start of Christmas Market, and it a quick 5 minute stroll to the rear of the hotel.  Thank you to the front desk for the great suggestions on dining and shopping. Our rooms were spacious and relaxing, perfect for our busy days of sightseeing. The breakfast was wonderful! Loved the honeycomb. We will definitely stay here again.
