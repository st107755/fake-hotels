Don't go there if you expect fresh and contemporary design. Decoration is very very classic, not particularly entertaining, but staff was nice and room was large and well-furnished (although I believe I was upgraded, so a normal room will be smaller). Bathroom a bit small, and again, not very modern and attractive. However, very good location and a decent price.
