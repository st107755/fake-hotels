We stayed here at the end of January to experience Stuttgart.  The hotel whilst not the most attractive from the outside is beautiful  inside. Staff are very attentive and even though we arrived early for check in our room was ready after about an hour.    Rooms are quiet, beds comfortable and bathrooms large.  A turn down service was also provided.   Although we didn't eat at the hotel we did have a few drinks in the bar where the service was excellent.  The hotels location is fantastic, basically opposite the train station and right on the main shopping street.  Highly recommended.
