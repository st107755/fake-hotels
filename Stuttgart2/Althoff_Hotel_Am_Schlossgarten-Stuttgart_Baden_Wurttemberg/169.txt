How can anyone say anything negative about the Schlossgarten?  Beautiful hotel, exceedingly gracious staff, wonderful rooms!  And the location is perfect!  My colleague and I fly into Frankfurt and take the train to Stuttgart.  The train station is right next to the Schlossgarten.   Also, the hotel is at the foot of Koenigstrasse which has incredible stores and leads you to the Schlossplatz.   The Schlossgarten adds so much to the pleasure of visiting Stuttgart.
