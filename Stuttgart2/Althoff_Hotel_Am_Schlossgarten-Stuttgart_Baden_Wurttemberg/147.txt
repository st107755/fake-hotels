 Centrally located within 5minute walk to Stuttgart Hbf main train station and next to Schlossplazt the plaza where you will find the main shopping and business area.Traditional architecture style but well maintained ,inside is clean and spacious.The old gentlemen showing us the room amenities was so polite and professional .When we left the bell captain taking my luggage all the way to the train station were exceptional.The 1 starMichelin Die Zirbelstube is a must go for connoisseurs.
