Excellent location, directly across from the main train station. Also located next to the main city park with peaceful walking trails and access to all the main city attractions in the central city. Close to good shopping, and many restaurants.  Delicious food, good breakfast, cakes, and excellent service.  To get to the best museum in the world, (Mercedes Benz Museum) you would need a taxi or take the train.
