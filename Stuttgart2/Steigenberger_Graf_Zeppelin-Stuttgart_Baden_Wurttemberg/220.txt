Excellent location across from the main train Hauptbahnhof.  Reception is prompt and informative. Be aware, the hotel will put a hold on your credit card of Euro 60 per day in case you use anything from the mini bar, buy a toweling robe etc.  The hold is removed on check out.  Just a warning in case you’re close to your credit limit.  There’s the more prevalent security feature that only allows room key holders to use the lifts.  Rooms are clean, but the ones facing an inner courtyard have no view but are quiet except in our case when a large Saturday night party went in to the wee hours. Closing the windows fully helped dampen the noise of the band and revellers.    There’s a turn down service if you need it. The hotel has a spa, pool etc but we didn’t have time to take…
