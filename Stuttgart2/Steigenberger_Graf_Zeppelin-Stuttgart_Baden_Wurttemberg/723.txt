The room was magnificent, just perfect, sound proof, perfect amenities. The newly renovated SPA is just what you need after a tiring journey. You can really swim in the swimming pool, enjoy the hammam and the sauna afterwards. Patrizia at the SPA provides excellent massage. The concierge is going to keep your bags after you check out. Only small dissapointment: The receptionist at early afternoon that checked me in and out was not very welcoming. The quality of the food and the drinks at breakfast was really exceptional, the variety not that much, but I would consider it overall a very nice breakfast in a restaurant with a nice setting and view.
