We stayed at the hotel for one night on 1 May 2015. Since it's May Day, most of the shops are close so we spent most of our time in the room sleeping. The room is spacious compared to other typical European hotel with separate bath and toilet. It comes with the basic amenities including bath robe and slippers. The location is very convenient, just the opposite street to the Stuttgart main station that only takes 5 minute walk. We, with 2 big luggages had no problem with the direction at all as the hotel is very easy to spot. The service deserved a 5-star quality. Try the hotel's fitness and pool as other hotels we stay do not generally have it, and it's well maintained.
