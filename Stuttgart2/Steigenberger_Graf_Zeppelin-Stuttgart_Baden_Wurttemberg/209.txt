the hotel is excellent, the staff highly profesional, nice check in and wellcoming, very dissapointing asigned room at the first floor, so dark although we stayed for two nights, excellent service to park our car and to take lugagge to the room, bad waterproofing of the shower that creates flooding of bathroom (unexpected in this hotel category)
