Stayed here in July for a quick trip to Stuttgart from Paris. The hotel itself was wonderful, and the location couldn't have been better either. It's located right across from Stuttgart HBF, where the Eurostar comes in. In the middle of the heat wave, the a/c in the room was very much appreciated. Overall, the room was un-naturally quiet with an American sized bathroom, bed and everything else. Very friendly English speaking staff who explained how to take the train to the Porsche museum to avoid a costly cab. Also, it's at a nice location to see the city and walk around the shopping area.
