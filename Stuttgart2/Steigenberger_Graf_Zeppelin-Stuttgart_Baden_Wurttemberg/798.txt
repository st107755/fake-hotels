Wow, unbelievable service, atmosphere and largest room we have had in Europe.  I guess we were fortunate enough to get a room recently refurbished and it was absolutely perfect.  Best bathroom I have seen in Europe yet.  Location across from the Hauptbahnhof and close to the Konigstrasse.  Would highly recommend it and when I checked the prices it was even less then the Schloss Garten Hotel where we have stayed before.
