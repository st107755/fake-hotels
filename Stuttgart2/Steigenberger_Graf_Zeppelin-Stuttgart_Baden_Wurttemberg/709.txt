We spent 3 lovely nights in this hotel. Despite the central location, the hotel was very quiet. The beds were a bit of a let down, very hard with tiny little duvets but having no experience of German hotels i'm not sure if this is the norm.  The rooms were very well maintained and spacious and the shower was excellent. I can't speak more highly of the breakfast, if you can think of it, they had it! On the other hand, all 3 of the restaurants were very pricey so we had evening meals elsewhere. The major negative i would mention is the cigar bar that stunk out the entire lobby area, not very pleasant.  All the staff spoke english and couldn't have been more helpful. The bar man even made off menu cocktails when asked.
