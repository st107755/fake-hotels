Good hotel, good facilities, decent (if incredibly expensive) restaurant.  Stay completely spoiled by screaming children running up and down outside bedrooms late at night and for long periods of time.  This isn't in itself the hotel's fault of course, but staff did nothing to try to stop the problem despite several calls to reception.
