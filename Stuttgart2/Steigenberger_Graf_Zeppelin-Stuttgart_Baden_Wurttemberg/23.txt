Everything about this hotel perfectly met my expectations (although nothing really exceeded it). The room was nice with a comfortable couch (the gummy bears for turn-down service was a lovely touch). Personnel was friendly, but not extremely proactive. The bar/seating area didn't look too inviting to me, a bit dark and classic (but this is personal taste). I didn't try the breakfast. Definitely a fine stay, but no wow-factor.
