Highly recommend this hotel having recently returned from a weekend visit with my son to take in the Mercedes and Porsche museums.  Firstly, the service is fantastic with friendly, welcoming staff who were very kind to my young son.  Secondly, the hotel is literally across the road from the main station which made getting around nice and easy for us.  It is a lovely hotel and befitting of its 5 star status.  The initial reason for choosing this hotel was because my son wanted one with a pool and this didn't disappoint. Having stayed in a number of city centre hotels with 'pools', I've become somewhat cynical however this one is great.  My only negative came when I took my son up for a swim one evening to find 2 naked men in the pool together. Would be good to supervise the poolâ€¦
