We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel courtesy of Porsche AG as part of its Euro Delivery Program. Everything Porsche does is first class and it's no wonder they are partnered with the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin. Our room was very comfortable with one of the best showers I've ever seen. The pool, sauna and steam room upstairs were great and well appreciated after a long flight. The breakfast was second to none with wonderful savoury options. The front desk was happy to store luggage for 16 days which was very helpful. The hotel is right across the street from the main train stations making it very handy from the airport--- just take the S-Bahn. It is very easy and costs less than EUR 4.  This is primarily a business hotel I believe--- highly recommended.
