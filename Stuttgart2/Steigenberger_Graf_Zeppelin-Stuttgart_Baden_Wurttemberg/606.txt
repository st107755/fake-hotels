Extremely clean, with all that you need in the room, catering for smokers and non smokers.   Swimming pool, sauna and steam room with nice bar to complement the ambiance, modern style.   Located in the heart of the city 2 mins walk to the main Stuttgart HBF central station.  The service level has exceeded my expectations, although had some issues connecting with the Wifi but seeked assistance with the reception, and front office manager (Christian Ge√ülein) i believe, he provided outstanding customer service with a smile and a witt. Never had any issues after and super fast Wifi.
