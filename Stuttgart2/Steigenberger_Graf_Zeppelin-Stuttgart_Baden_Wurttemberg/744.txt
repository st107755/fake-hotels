The hotel is very close to the Hauptbahnhof which made it very convenient to get to from the airport.  I took the S2/S3 from the airport and cost only â‚¬3.60 single trip!!  Saved a bucket on taxi fare.  The hotel is part of a reputable chain and therefore has very high standards.  The room rate included breakfast and was not unreasonable given the standard.  The bar area is in the lobby itself and lacks atmosphere or entertainment.  The room was good size and comfortable.  The only irksome and inconvenient part of this hotel was that you only get 30min free wifi.  If you are nice to the reception staff you may get two passes of 30min each!  Why? I don't know, given that most hotels now include free unlimited wifi.
