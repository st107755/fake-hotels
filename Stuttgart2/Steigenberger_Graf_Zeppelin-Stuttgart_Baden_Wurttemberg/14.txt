Am normally a bit sceptical to inner city upper class hotels as they tend to be a bit formal and unpersonal. So was Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin as well. But the proximity to the main station made the decision for me. The hotel provides what you expect and has a decent spa where one can unwind after a busy day - unfortunately the pool was closed during my stay though.
