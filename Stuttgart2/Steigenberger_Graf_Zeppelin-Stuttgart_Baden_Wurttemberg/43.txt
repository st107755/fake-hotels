Wow!  What a great place.  Mercedes Benz team actually offered this as one of our hotel choices and we were floored when we saw it and got to our room.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff, clean and functional rooms with exceptional amenities.  We had drinks in the lobby bar and people watched both nights while we walked three city blocks to the shopping district and found a wonderful Italian restaurant called Tialini.    The only slight issue was the hotel cooling was not very efficient and the room never really got cool.  If you open a window, the noise is fairly loud from the street below so be prepared to either be not very cool or have street noise.  Once the window is closed the place is absolutely silent for the most part.  You will be 4 minutes across the street fromâ€¦
