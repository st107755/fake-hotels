Perfectly located , bang opposite the Main railway station  Very friendly Staff at the front desk.   Check In : Score : 9/10   This young lady checked me in for 2 rooms , with a huge smile  I had some queries but i hesitated as i saw a queue of guests behind me .  The young lady called out her colleague from the back , and encouraged me to wait and asked me what i wanted to know . She very patiently told me what i needed to know .   Breakfast : Simple and nice  Had sufficient variety on the buffet , and friendly staff   Valet / Bellhop : Helpful , efficient and prompt  I rented a sports car for a couple of days and the valet service was impeccable   Loved my stay , will be back
