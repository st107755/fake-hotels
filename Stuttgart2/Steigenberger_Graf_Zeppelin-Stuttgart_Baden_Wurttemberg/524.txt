I had a pleasant stay here, just one night. Great location if you are coming in by train, as I was. Comfortable bed, good room service menu, and nice sized bedrooms. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Reception did smell of cigars in the evening, but that's the only criticism I have. Would stay again.
