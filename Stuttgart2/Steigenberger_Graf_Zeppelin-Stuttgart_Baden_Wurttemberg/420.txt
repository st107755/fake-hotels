We are in the south of Germany and this hotel reflects it. Slightly conservative, slightly old fasioned. But overall a very high quality, be it meals, room service, rooms themselves and staff. Staff is discreet, friendly and utterly serviceminded. This combined with the very central location and the reasonable price level (the quality considered) makes this hotel essential for business or high quality travel. I have been here before, and look forward to next time.
