Centrally located next to main train station & main shopping area. 5 minutes by foot to both. Rooms very clean & modern. BEST shower ever!!!!  Didn't eat at Hotel's restaurants, but the bar & cigar lounge were very very nice. Prices weren't horrible either - but not for the budget conscious, to be fair.  Staff friendly & helpful, all spoke English very well (although I speak pretty good German).  Small fitness center on 5th floor. Not much in the way of weights, but enough for me. 2 elliptical trainers, 1 treadmill, 1 spin bike. Sauna and steam room excellent.  Also a small lap pool, indoors. I'll know to bring my swim shorts next time.  Overall highly recommended!
