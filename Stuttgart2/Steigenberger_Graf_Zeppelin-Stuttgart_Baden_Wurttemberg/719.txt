I had a short 1 night stay with my family in 3 rooms. Even though we were almost obscenely early for check-in (having arrived on an early morning flight from London), the reception staff were most apologetic that our rooms weren't ready and completed the registration and luggage storage without fuss. When we returned to the hotel in the afternoon our luggage was waiting for us in our rooms. The hotel was superb with spacious rooms and well sized bath and shower. The location is excellent for the Central Station (for easy access to the MB museum and the airport) and the Christmas Market (just a short walk). No question where we'll be staying for our next visit!
