Stayed here yesterday for one night, booked based upon its trip advisor rating and price bracket (high enough to be good). My room was huge but dated and soul less. The TV was so far away from my bed even the bionic man with his bionic eye would struggle. My room (number 123) must have been directly under the hotel signage as however hard I tried with the curtains I couldn't  block out the light.  On a more positive note the girls on reception were polite and efficient and the breakfast had a very good selection.
