Fantastic hotel with very friendly and helpful staff, who gave us a map to find the Christmas markets and also recommended nearby restaurants.  The location is close to the train station and main shopping street. The whole hotel and especially our room was extremely clean and the beds were very comfortable. To our surprise and delight we were upgraded to a junior suite, and although we overlooked the train station and a construction site, the room is so well insulated that we didn't hear any of the outside news.  I used the pool and sauna and it was warm, clean and relaxing. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to recommend.
