We enjoyed our stay here- visiting with FastLane Travel group.  The bar was great, the staff was always helpful, and the breakfast was great! Their eggs Benedict was like nothing I've had before & delicious! The only issue we had was with the air conditioner. I could not get our room to cool down.  The best thing was the location. Close to so many restaurants, shopping and the train.
