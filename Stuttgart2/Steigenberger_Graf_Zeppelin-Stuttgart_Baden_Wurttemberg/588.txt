We stayed at this hotel arriving from Frankfurt, waiting to pick up a car the following morning for a European Delivery. The hotel is right across the street from the bustling but fabulous Stuttgart train station. The hotel is high-line, with a gorgeous (a honeycomb on display!) buffet breakfast, in-door pool with sauna, and nice air conditioning.  Lobby holds a nice bar and upscale jewelry store. Bedding was lovely and the concierge was wonderful...lending me his personal phone charger.  I walked outside in the evening alone and felt perfectly safe...walking distance to banks, malls, and food.
