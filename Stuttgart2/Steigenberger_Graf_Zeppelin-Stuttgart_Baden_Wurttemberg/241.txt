Rooms are too hot with no way to get fresh air - even with the air conditioning on. Showers flood the  bathroom - even with doors closed as tightly as possible. Bathroom soaps not stocked, even upon check-in. Had to ask housekeeping to fix empty liquid container. Towels now skimpy - no extras to soak up water from shower. Dust on furniture. Location is still the major PLUS for this hotel - right on the subway line.
