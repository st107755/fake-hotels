The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location.   Being next to the main train station and in the center of town is certainly convenient.  Aside from the location the hotel is a major ripoff.               Breakfasts cost 26 euro and aren't worth half this amount              The free internet is so slow it's worthless.   Add 8 euros for a real internet.              One local phone call cost me 38 euro - incredible              And, rooms are certainly on the pricey side for the area (and not spacious)  All this would be fine if there was good value here.   They clearly want our dollars but don't give anything back in return.                I found one English language newspaper in the lobby during my seven day stay.               I only received one bar of soapâ€¦
