We have stayed at the Steigenberger several times now, and each time the front of house staff have been very welcoming and helpful. Our room was extremely comfortable and spacious, with coffee making facilities included. The breakfast was excellent and very varied. Altogether we really enjoyed our stay and will definately go again.
