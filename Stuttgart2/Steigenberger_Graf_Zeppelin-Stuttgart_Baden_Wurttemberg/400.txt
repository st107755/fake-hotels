Returned to the Steigenberger after 15 years earlier; much the same with some updates in the hallways.  It was during a heatwave (93F/33C) and there was very very little air conditioning. The interiors were pretty much frozen since 2003 when I was last there.  Great staff and service and food - but she needs some updating on in-room decor and air conditioning.   The Motel One a block further from the train station is a good alternative and more youthful.
