Entrance to hotel was difficult due to a large demonstration - with modern communication hotel should have texted or email us how to get to hotel. Room wasn't ready till afternoon and no upgrades and not allowed check out late.  Room facing inner court is best as quiet I don't understand hotels with 5 stars then skimping on - toiletries low quality - a shower gel squeeze bottle attached to wall is expected in a Novotel or ibis!! Shampoo also not brand name. Although this chain taken over in 2009 it should improve not reduce standards. Rooms are similar to before takeover. Tv not very large and not many channels in English - no Fox News . And most annoying - no ice machine. When we phoned room service they wanted 4 euros for ice!! Obviously this not acceptable for a so called 5â€¦
