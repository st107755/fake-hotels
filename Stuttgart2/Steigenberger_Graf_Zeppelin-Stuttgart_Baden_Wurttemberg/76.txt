We arrived about 10:45 am on Sunday and was told that our room was not ready and to come back at 3:00 pm.  I asked if they could have the room ready earlier than that and again was told to come back at 3:00 pm.  The desk clerk then asked me if I wanted to add breakfast to my room charge in advance.  I thought that was strange so I said no.  We came back at 3:15 and after 2 minutes the clerk told me that computer was slow.  After another two minutes she told me that my room was not ready and then said that due to the Christmas Market many people were staying until 6:00 pm.  Really?????????  So you charge these people extra to stay in my room and basically told me to drop dead.  I did get another room 15 minutes later. I also tipped the bell captain in the morning since he told meâ€¦
