We wanted a central hotel in Stuttgart and were lucky to get a special deal on this one. Our room was not ready when we arrived in the morning, but our bags were taken for us and we were told a room would be ready at 15.00. We did however return at 14.00. The room allocated for us was still not ready, but another was found. And what a room !  Big enough to hold a party in !! A complimentary bottle of water was waiting, and twin beds actually meant twin beds and not the usual two together with separate duvets. The bathroom had a bath (oh bliss) and toiletries were replenished. The walk in wardrobe was to die for. On the negative side, there is quite a lot of noise from the road, even with the shutters down. Plus our deal did not include breakfast which was available at 26 Eurosâ€¦
