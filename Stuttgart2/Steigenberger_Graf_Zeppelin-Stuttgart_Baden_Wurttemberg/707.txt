SGZ had a great location, was clean, and had a very helpful staff.  Otherwise, I think everything else about the hotel was average for the price point.  One complaint which made me take off one star from 4 to 3 is the second rate internet.  There's no reason why high-speed wifi shouldn't be standard and complimentary at every hotel.  SGZ provided slow internet for free which made you so frustrated that you had to buy the faster verion ($7 or 8 Euro, I think).  And it wasn't really that fast.
