We recently stayed at the Steigenberger after staying at a hotel down the street.  Unfortunately, though we heard that the Steigenberger was recently remodeled, the rooms fall short of a 5-star hotel.  We haven't had much luck in this city with hotels, but there were some modern customs that were missing here, like using a king-size bed, rather than 2 side-by-side beds, each with their own blankets not big enough for a twin, much less a king-sized bed.  In addition, gone were the top sheets so there wasn't proper foot coverage the entire night--our feet were actually cold.  The carpeting feels old and somewhat dirty, and the showers don't have a full door, so the floor outside the shower gets dirty.  The hairdryers are not strong, either.  Otherwise, the hotel is satisfactoryâ€¦
