This hotel is by the far the best in Stuttgart. Ideal location right across the train station and walking distance to all the restaurants. Really friendly and professional staff. Really nice big rooms!  Love the automatic opening doors to the garage! I have stayed here over 6 times and never intend to to stay any other place when in town.
