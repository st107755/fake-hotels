A very nice business hotel with a very pleasant pool and sauna/steam room.  It is ideally located just by Stuttgart's main station with excellent transport links.  It lets itself down by pathetic internet speeds and overpriced food and drink.  The staff were all very professional and helpful and I enjoyed my stay there.
