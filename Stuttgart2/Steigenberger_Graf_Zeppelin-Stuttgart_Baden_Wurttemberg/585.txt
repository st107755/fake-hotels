Great location but lacking in some areas . The stairs looked like they hadn't been vacuumed recently and the beds are two single mattresses that are joined together by a sticky tape which when you look down between the gap In the mattresses I found lots of human hairs and dirt stuck to it from the past residents . Not a very hygienic way to link mattresses. The lifts are very slow and small and the breakfast was just okay , on the plus point the staff are very good especially in the restaurant
