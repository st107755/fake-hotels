We arrived early in the morning so the room was not ready. We asked to store our backpacks while we took the train to some of the neighboring Christmas markets. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Even when they realized the error of our reservation being for three instead of two. When we returned that evening,they had already set up a cot and delivered all our bags to the room. We evev had chocolates on our pillows. It was so conveniently located. I highly recommend this hotel.
