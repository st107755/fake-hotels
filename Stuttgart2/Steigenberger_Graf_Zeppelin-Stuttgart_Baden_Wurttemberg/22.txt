Located opposite the main station and just a few minutes’ walk to Königstrasse, the main shopping street. Friendly and helpful staff at reception. Spacious room with standard small bathroom. Overall the hotel looks like the 1980s. Breakfast buffet offered a good selection, service was prompt and friendly and the restaurant has a very large window front (very nice in the morning).
