The Graf Zeppelin is located in the heart of Stuttgart across from the train station. I found this to be very convenient since my wife and I arrived via the TGV. We stayed one night because we were doing the Mercedes European Delivery. The staff upgraded our room to a junior suite, which was a large modern room. It appeared to have been updated in the past year or two. As part of our stay, we got the complimentary breakfast, which was very good. The indoor pool wasn't huge, but it was nice. There is a small outdoor balcony in the pool area, but it is only big enough for two people. Unfortunately there was another couple out there, so we didn't get to use it at all. Given the location, a roof top deck would have been ideal. WiFi in the hotel is a bust. I paid 14 Euro to use itâ€¦
