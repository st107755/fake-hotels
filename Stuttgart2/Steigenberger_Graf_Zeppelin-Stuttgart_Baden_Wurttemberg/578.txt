The general service was not very friendly or helpful. Rooms smelled of smoke and had little or no air conditioning. We called housekeeping to root air not working.  They sent a maid up to check who said she was calling a technician.  We didn't hear back for awhile so called the front desk.  We were told then no technician coming but she would send up her "colleague" to look.  The colleague was the bellman who told us it was not really air conditioning but just a fan.   We asked on several occasions to speak with the concierge and even though there was a podium for one, there was never one there.  We were renting a car but no one could help answer questions or help us plan any driving trips.  What little brochures they gave us were only in German so we're of no use to us.  withâ€¦
