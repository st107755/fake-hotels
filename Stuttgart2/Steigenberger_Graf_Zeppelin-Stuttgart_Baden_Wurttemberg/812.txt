The hotel and rooms were fine, however, the front desk attitude spoiled the stay for me. Not only were they cold, they couldn't/wouldn't answer basic questions such as "where can I go buy water and snacks" "every place is closed". (It wasn't.) I wouldn't stay again even if the location is ideal. On a positive note, the Mercedes-Benz Museum is outstanding.
