We had been already to this hotel last year in February and thought it was a good hotel but needed some improvements for his level/price. In February we had a suite and this time a normal room. The room was quite, spacious and well furnished. When we entered the room there was a technician repairing the TV who has been working for quite a long time. In the evening we wanted to look at the news, but the TV was not working!!! As soon as we entered the room we had to ask for a cleaning lady  because the room was not proper; there were (coffee??) spots on the fridge, hair pins on the floor, and traces of the previous occupants; one set of bath slippers were missing. The room lady came very shortly after our call, but she only cleaned the spots on the fridge and brought the bathâ€¦
