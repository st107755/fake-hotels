“Weird layout in large bathroom.” Good comfortable kingsize bed. 2nd bed was a fold-out sofa bed. Opening hours to swimming pool early and late. Nespresso machine in room but only with small espresso cups...bad luck for tea drinkers.  Breakfast not included in our rate so I cannot comment on the food. We were 'forced' to upgrade to a more expensive Jr. Suite when our 12 yr. old nephew joined us because the other rooms didn't allow an additional bed. The bathroom was big but had a strange layout which meant only one person could use it at a time because the toilet was in a glass cage next to the glass shower and sink-no privacy when sharing the bathroom. The internet signal was weak and would only allow a total of 3 devices to be registered even tho we were 3 persons...each one…
