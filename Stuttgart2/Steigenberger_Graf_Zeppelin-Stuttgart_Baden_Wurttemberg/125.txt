We just came as walk in, on the way to Munich, price very dear, C/I ok, but not warm and welcoming at all. rooms average, bathroom  small and not up to 5 star, only a shower, huge problems with humidity, seems like the aircon not works very well, room it self large, internet absolutely   bad, complicated log in and slow with ongoing drop out.had drinks in the bar before dinner and after dinner at city, both times service pretty good, in particular a very young man, seem s to be in charge, excellent . However for a wine region , limited selection of open wines & nothing regional at all. Tried the  pool water way to cold, for sure not the displayed temperature. next morning breakfast, have to say very very good, service and buffet, old grand hotel style, highly recommended. C/Oâ€¦
