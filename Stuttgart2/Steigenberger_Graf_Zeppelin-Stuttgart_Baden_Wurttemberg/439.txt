The room was magnificent; the hotel personnel outstanding, the food exceptional, the only negative unfortunately a requested Non Smoking room had been smoked in and not  sanitized of smoke smell, i am allergic to smoke, the smell of smoke, and anything pertaining to smoking so it was causing me m=not to feel very well... Overall the experience was very positive and I would give the hotel another chance...
