Very nice hotel in the center, very clean, helpfull and nice stuff.  The interior of the hotel is a bit old fashion, they could easily do some improvements in terms of the smell, maybe bigger TVs taking in account that from the bed till TV there are at least 2 meters distance.  I would rate it 4 stars not more.   Regards,  NM
