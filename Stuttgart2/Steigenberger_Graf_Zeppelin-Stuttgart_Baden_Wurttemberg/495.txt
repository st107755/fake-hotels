I checked into this hotel as part of a large corporate group at a rate of Euro250-270++ with some of us taking suites. I stayed 3 nights. Day 1, called housekeeping to get some Euro 20 worth of laundry done, they said they didn't know what "Laundry" was and hung up on me.  Day 2,realised the walls between the rooms are quite thin. All night long the phone in the unoccupied room next door was ringing - I called reception begging them to stop the constant noise but instead they sent someone to knock on my door in the wee hours - 4am and the phone kept ringing!!.  Day 3, after receiving a bottle of complimentary sparkling water on the bedside each night (nice touch), I was told when I asked for some to pay for the water. Quite an inconsistency given my company had spent somethingâ€¦
