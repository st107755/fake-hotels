This hotel is quite expensive but it's very well done and conveniently located. I was visiting Mercedes and Porsche, both of which are easily reached by taking the metro a few stops from the station 25 metres away. Less relevant to me, the shopping district is two blocks away. It's popular with business travellers but as tourists we also found it comfortable. I shall stay there again on any future visit to Stuttgart.
