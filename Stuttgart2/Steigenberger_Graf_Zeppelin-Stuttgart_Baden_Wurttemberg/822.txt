Spent 2 nights here. Very efficient reception. Had booked standard room but was very pleased. Good size and great shower. My only negative is that there is no tea and coffee in the rooms. We were on 4th floor opposite the station, but had no problems with noise. i didnt find the bathroom location any more annoying than it is in most hotels. Excellent buffet breakfast (22 euros but includes Sekt etc). We didnt eat again all day, which actually makes is rather good value! I found reception really helpful with all of my questions and requests. We left our luggage with them on our last day as our flight was not until the evening. We would definitely stay again.
