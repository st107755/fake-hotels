Good location, very central. Hotel itself is ok but not superior. I would give 4, not 5 stars.  The rooms are big but the interior is average. The staff varies a lot. One of the receptionist ladies was kind of bored with customers, her faces and groaning were out of place. Other personnel very friendly especially the car service and breakfast room.
