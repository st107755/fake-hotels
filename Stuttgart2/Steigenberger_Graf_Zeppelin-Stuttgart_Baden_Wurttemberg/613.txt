I stayed three nights a the Graf Zeppelin. I would stay there again.   Pros: 1) The room was very nice and large with two flat screen televisions.  2) There are a lot of restaurants and stores nearby.  3) The main train station (Hauptbahnhof) is across the street so there is easy access to the U and S-Bahn as well as busses. You can buy a three day pass for 12 Euros at the hotel.  4) Comfortable bed. Flat German style pillows were a minus for me.   Cons: 1) Breakfast was very expensive with limited selection. Save your money and go to one of the nearby bakeries.  2) There were two classes of Wifi available. 256kbs for free (really???) and 5 Mbs for 8 Euro per day. The faster plan is limited to two devices though. IT worked pretty well though.
