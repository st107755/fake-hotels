I stayed here three nights as part of the Porsche Club tour of southern Germany. The Graf Zeppelin is part of a large German hotel chain so is different from the standardized American-style hotels everywhere else. Fantastic location directly across the street from the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, so if you fly into Frankfurt for example you can easily hop on the ICE at the airport and be at the hotel in 1hr 15mins. The rooms are contemporary, elegant and comfortable, with beautiful tile showers, no ghastly tub to step into. Bathrooms have towel warmers, a great feature not found in American hotels. There are several very nice restaurants in the hotel, plus a bar in the Zeppelin Stuble and a bar/lounge in the main lobby. The front desk staff were consistently helpful and courteous.
