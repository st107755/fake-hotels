We stayed here for a birthday weekend and were very impressed.  The hotel is conveniently located nextdoor to the central train station and within a very short walk of the central shopping area.  We stayed in a deluxe room, which was extremely spacious (with a separate sitting area) and had a large, modern bathroom. The room was very quiet and had a number of British TV channels.   The staff were friendly and helpful - we arrived at 11am and were given an early check-in, when they found out that it was my fiance's birthday they left us a birthday message and some complimentary cakes in the room, which was a very nice touch!   The only criticism is that internet access was not free, however this did not impact our stay.  We had a very enjoyable stay and would definitely stay hereâ€¦
