We wanted a quality hotel for a whole week with good transport links in Stuttgart and really pleased with our choice.  With quick access to S and U bahn services we were able to achieve many trips with ease. The view from the room wa not the best - but then it was mainly got sleeping.  Great breakfasts served by a good team of waitresses.
