This was our first visit to Stuttgart and it was to see the Christmas markets. Hotel was a great location, across the street from the train station. The staff was exceptional, friendly, helpful, provided great suggestions where to eat and directions to the market. Room was very nice and had plenty of room to store our luggage and not trip over them. Fantastic breakfast, the largest selection of food we found on our trip. There was even fresh honey dripping from honeycombs by the breads (we were told there was a bee hive on the roof that provided the honey). Centrally located and an easy walk to the Christmas markets.
