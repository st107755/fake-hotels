We recently returned to this hotel having been there on a number of occasions, but the standard has dropped since our last visit.  The rooms were uninspiring, small and no internet connection.  The towels and the robes were old, washed out and thin and my husband contracted athletes foot from the shower.  Definitely not 5 star.
