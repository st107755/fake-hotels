This is for sure a nice a nice hotel, and I chose to stay here because it is situated very near the railway station (Hauptbahnhof). It is only a few minutes away from the S/U-bahn. I was happy with the size of the room, and was also very pleased with the service of the personnell. The breakfast was great! The hotel has a gym, which I usually would appreciate. However, at this time of the year it it nicer to run outside, and the Schlossgarten is just a few minutes away and wonderful for a running trip. I brought the swimming suit, and was very disappointed that the pool was under renovation.  The hotel did not meet all of my expectations, and I have a few suggestions for improvements; I miss a tea boiler in the room. There is a coffeemaker and possibilities for making coffee -â€¦
