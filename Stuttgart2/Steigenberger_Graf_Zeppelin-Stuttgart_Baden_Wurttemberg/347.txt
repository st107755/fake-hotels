The overall service was fantastic, and the location is ideal for transport links by car or train to the Daimler facilities. The room was very clean and included everything you could need. I only have one negative thing, which was the pillows? Much too soft for me, which ended up with me having a stiff next the following two days. I did ask for some firmer pillows but just got more of the same. Could not get the aircon to work correctly .
