We wanted somewhere central and close to the train station and this hotel fit the bill. It is just across the road from the Hauptbahnhof and you can easily reach the hotel through the underground passages. Look for the Lautenschlagerstrasse exit. The facade looks a bit uninspiring, but once you enter the elegant reception your perception changes.  Stuttgart is not a cheap city even for Germany. Hence, it was nice to find the prices here were not exorbitant for what you get. The reception was friendly and professional. The room was spacious. Furniture and carpet were slightly dated but we didn't really mind. There were also nice little touches like slippers and bathrobes provided.  WiFi was more than adequate and was complimentary.   There is a Michelin-starred restaurant, Olivo,â€¦
