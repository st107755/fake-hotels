We stayed one night at this hotel. The check-in was very friendly and efficient and they offered a free upgrade to a deluxe room.  The room was very spacious. There was a sitting area and a walk in closet. The bathroom had two sinks and a comfortable shower. The housekeeping was very fast when we ordered an additional towel.  There is a nice spa on the top floor with an Asian inspired pool, a sauna, a steam bath and a fully equipped gym.  After a wonderful sleep, we enjoyed the breakfast buffet with some traditional german specialties and a nice selection of organic food.  The hotel is close to the shopping street, the palace and some of the museums.
