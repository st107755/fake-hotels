Great location.  Close to station and all the shopping areas and plaza.taxi always at front if needed.  Rooms large and comfy if a bit dated.. BUT  im mad that at checkin i was charged for my whole stay and an extra 80 eu per day for incidentals . This was not explained. After checkout my card was again charged for tge 3 day stay.  Ive contacted the hotel and they assured me it was only "blocked".  Well its never happened anywhere else.  When do i get 870 euros back???Just for that reason i ask anyone reading this to make clear that we don not want this ..   why should my card balance be deducted. I am happy to pay upfront...
