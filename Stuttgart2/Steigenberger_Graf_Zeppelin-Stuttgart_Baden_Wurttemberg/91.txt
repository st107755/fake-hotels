Spent 2 nights at the Steigenberger when picking up new car with European Delivery.  Hotel is centrally located and is steps from the pedestrian zone for shopping and restaurants.  Hotel is very nice however our room on this visit was a horrible design.  The bathroom door is made of glass and faces the bed so the light shines on anyone trying to sleep.  Also we told the front desk that the shower design allowed for the water to leak from the bathroom onto the carpet outside bathroom door.  This obviously is an ongoing issue yet rather than offer to change our room, they just vacuumed the water.   Having had a wonderful room on the last visit we would still return.  There is a parking garage on-site.
