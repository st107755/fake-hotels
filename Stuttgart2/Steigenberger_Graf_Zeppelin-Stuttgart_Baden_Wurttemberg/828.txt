This is a fine business hotel in a premium location which is completely let down by its rude, dismissive, and poorly trained reception staff  who are incapable of dealing politely (or at all) with the most basic request .   A complete contrast to the cheerful smiling cleaning ladies who could lead by example.    While we were happy with the rate for the two  rooms, one of the receptionists however made it very clear to us that our expectations should be moderated due to the fact we were on a booking.com  rate.- hardly professional. The rooms though small are clean and comfortable and while the hotel was busy during our stay, the lobby & bar area was rarely crowded with little noise from  the corridors. The cost of breakfast for all five of us exceeded the daily room rate,â€¦
