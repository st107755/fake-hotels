We have just returned home after a 2 night stay here. First thing I will say is that the staff are really lovely, helpful and very professional. From reception to bar staff and to housekeeping.   Check in was very easy and we were advised that if there was anything we needed then staff were available 24 hrs a day and we just had to ask. The ladies on the reception were really friendly efficient and professional.   We did have a good stay and was upgraded to a deluxe room but it was a bit too big and a bit too formal with a lounge area that felt like an office.   The bed was very comfortable and the room relatively quiet so we did get a good nights sleep.   The bathroom was a bit dated with a shower over the bath but it was a very powerful shower and it met our needs.  Excellentâ€¦
