Davidoff Lounge is a cigar smokers dream, starting with the cigars. Half the humidor was Davidoff (of course) the other half had a lot of Cuban. I chose the R & J wide, and was very happy with it, if not blown away. But the main draw here is the beauty and elegance this place exudes, excellent ventilation, and full bar menu. I had a hot chocolate a a cheesecake (and a beer later) to go with my cigar, and will remember this experience for quite some time! If you smoke cigars and are in the area, you'd be silly not to stop here.
