Rating: I give this hotel a 3 because of their spotty internet (which they also charge for! One of my main pet peeves), terrible A/C + very un-even service.  Hotel/Location: It´s very conveniently located right across from the main trainstation and just around the corner from the big pedestrian area. The building itself is not a thing of beauty. A medium sized hotel (on the smaller side).  Room:  We had 2 inter connecting rooms (221 + 222). I will describe them individually as they were quite different from eachother. 221 (kingbed) Pro´s:  A room on the larger side Bathroom with large shower Pretty good storage facilities Good view Newly renovated Ok minibar Clean and new  Con´s: Noisy (terribly busy street outside) Hot, hot, hot! As the pretty much non existent A/C just doesn´t…
