One of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in for the money.  Spectacular room and bath. Many high tech features available in the room.  Location could not be better. Close to train transportation with train directly to airport.  Very best in shopping and restaurants within walking distance.  Excellent food and service at Graf Zeppelin restaurant.   Would definitely stay here again.
