We came here for a Stagette and wanted to spoil ourselves both with the Spa and a nice room.  We were very happy with the room, with lots of space but were a bit disappointed with the Spa area, which offers an 'outdoor terrace'.  We thought great, then we can go out and lay in the sun.  When we got there, it wasn't even something that one should be advertising as the four of us couldn't even lay out there.  This was actually the reason we chose this hotel from another one, and in the end it wasn't even worth it.
