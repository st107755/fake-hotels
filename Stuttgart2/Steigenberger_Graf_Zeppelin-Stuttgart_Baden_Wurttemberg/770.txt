We visited Stuttgart for the Christmas Markets in December and really enjoyed our stay at the Graf Zeppelin.  It was what you expect of a 5 star hotel.  Good service, excellent rooms, spotlessly clean, good facilities, great breakfast.  Places like this remind me why it is just better to pay the extra sometimes and get what you pay for.  DonÂ´t risk staying anywhere else when you visit Stuttgart if you are not on a budget.
