Stayed here prior to our euro delivery of our Porsche 911.  Nice enough hotel.  Service was friendly and helpful, room (518) was spacious with a walk in closet and lounge area, and the breakfast was excellent.  Great location next to the central train station for easy access to the city and close to the shopping district and historic square for easy walking excursions.  Try DaVinci located on the historic square for excellent salads and pizza.
