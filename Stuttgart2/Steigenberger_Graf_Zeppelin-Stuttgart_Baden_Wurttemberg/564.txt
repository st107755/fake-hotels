Great location in Stuttgart, very good breakfast and smiley staffs but only one thing we are care: my wife took a staire case to downstairs but all door is look, she go up our floor but can not get out as well, she s been look there for 1 hour, finally someone pass by and hear her to release her. We are find out that it is a emergency staircase but has no notice to the guess.
