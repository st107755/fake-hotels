Very nice hotel next to the main train station and main shopping centre in Stuttgart. Great service, very nice modern room (standard room) with safe, TV (english channels), very comfy bed, small but nice bathroom. Turn down service is always a nice touch. Airport is about 30 mins by S Bahn that can be caught in the main train station.  Have stayed many time in the past and would recommend.
