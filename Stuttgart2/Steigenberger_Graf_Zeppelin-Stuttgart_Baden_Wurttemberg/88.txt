The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are quite spacious, it has a perfect unbeatable location, excellent dining options. I hope ai can always afford to come back to this hotel because this will always be my first (or only) choice. The breakfast people really are the nicest. My only suggestion is that their TVs are small, old and have no HDMI access for computer or AppleTv. Time to step up! / Before I arrived, I contacted their concierge for questions and queries but it seems they have no Concierge or they rarely check that email account. A German 5 star hotel with no Concierge Service? Nuts!
