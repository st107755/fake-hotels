We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The staff was very friendly, the standard room was large and bright, the service was good.   At check-in we were told breakfast would be cheaper when ordered right at the desk than ordered at the breakfastroom next morning. We did sou, but apparently this information was not given to the stuff in the breakfastroom, so we were charged the whole amount. But breakfast was rich and tasty.
