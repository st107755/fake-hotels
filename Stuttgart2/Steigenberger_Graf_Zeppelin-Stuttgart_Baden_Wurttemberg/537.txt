We stayed here over New Year and had a great time. Fast efficient check in and a great entrance. The rooms are quality as is the whole Hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. The cigar lounge is excellent, we shared a couple cigars in there and had a great time, waiters are helpful and knowledgeable about the cigars. My only gripe about the hotel is that we had no coffee making facilities in the room, I asked at reception and was told that only the rooms higher up had them, oh dear we were only on the second floor, not to worry it's only a 100 metre sprint to the train station to get a cup of coffee, very disappointing. Overall it's a great hotel just take a travel kettle with you !
