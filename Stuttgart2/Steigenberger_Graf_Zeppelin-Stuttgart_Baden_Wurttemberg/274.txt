Hotel is right opposite the main train and tube station so very handy.  Big reception area. Very clean and tidy. Room was large clean and easy to access.  The spa area on the fifth floor Was really nice great pool and basic gym kit with a lovely smell when you walked in.  Two things spoiled it for a hotel su h ad this. No kettle and coffee making facilities although a kettle could be requested.  The other was the room we had. It was on the first floor and facing the road. To noisy  to have the windows open and the air con at its lowest setting still made the room very hot. The external lights illuminating the sign shone straight into the room and even with the curtains shut it made for a very light night. They were turned off at some point during the night. I am a light sleeperâ€¦
