I stayed more than once in this hotel and Always had a pleasant experience. In the past I had better rooms. This time the single room was tiny and thus a bit overrated for the night rate. One thing to praise for this hotel is the superb noise insulation. All the rooms are very quiet. Breakfast is also outstanding. The hotel is very well located for the main train station and all local public tranport, and the city centre-pedestrian area is just round the corner.
