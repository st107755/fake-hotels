I'm not sure what else anyone would want in a hotel.  The staff was superb.  Checked our bags with the hotel at 10:00 am and walked to the entrance to the train station which was half a block away.  Took the train to the MB Museum and back to the hotel.  Rooms were ready and we found them to be clean and modern.  The space in all of our rooms was a little more than what I would call typical European.  The breakfast buffet was exceptional with lots of choices and everything was fresh.  The main shopping areas are close by with lots of space dedicated to pedestrians.  I don't know of any reason why I would consider any other hotel in Stuttgart.
