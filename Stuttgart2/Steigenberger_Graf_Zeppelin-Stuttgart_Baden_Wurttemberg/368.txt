I travel all around the world .. never seen a place so not focused on pleasin customers.. they only bring 1 time water to the room at the arrival. No turnover service. You eat , no one comes to pick it up until next day .. they see you w the luggage, no one jumps on you to help.. same star , other hotels around the world totally 180
