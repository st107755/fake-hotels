Great hotel in the center of Stuttgart. We enjoyed the great service during the two days stay in Stuttgart. There's a small, but well equiped Spa. Great after a day in museums or after a heavy shopping day. We had a very quiet room to the backside of the hotel. We enjoyed one of the best showers ever. Great breakfast, with everything you need for a great day.
