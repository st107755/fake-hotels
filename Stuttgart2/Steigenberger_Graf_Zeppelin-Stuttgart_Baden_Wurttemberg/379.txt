We stayed as a group of 4 couples here for the Cannstatter Volksfest in October. First the location is great - literally opposite the main rail station and round the corner from the main shopping areas. The hotel has a great pool/spa area - towels provided but take money for lockers. We had breakfast one day as a birthday treat (26 euros per head) that included cava of some kind and a very varied choice of food. The rooms were nice with air con not the best (we slept with the windows open), heated bath tiles, fantastic shower and very comfortable beds. Plenty of wardrobe space and coat hangers. Safe included. Extra pillows on demand as the included ones are big but too soft. We would definitely stay here again.
