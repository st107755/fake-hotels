Hotel is in the heart of Stuttgart right across from train station. Very convenient. Hopped high speed rail to London when we checked out. The porters will even cart your baggage to and from train platform track if you ask. Sauna facility was not working all of the time. First night we woke up to cold room. After three different staff tried fixing things, they gave us two very good space-heaters. Everyone was very nice and really concerned about problem, checking back daily. The problem was the corporate management philosophy. For a cold, stressful morning due to the hotel's HVAC problems, they were only willing to comp breakfast. On-site manager also has no "authority" to do better. I am in service industry too, and do a lot of travelling. I expect my clients to get what theyâ€¦
