Definitely one of the best value for money hotels that we have stayed at - we were upgraded to a junior suite at no extra cost. The room was lovely, very clean and the rainshower was amazing. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The gym was small but adequate and had a very nice view across the city. You cannot get a better location, it is across the road from the main station and next to the main shopping street (Konigstrasse). We would definitely stay here again.
