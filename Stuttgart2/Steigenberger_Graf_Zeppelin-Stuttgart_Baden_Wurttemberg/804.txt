Rooms are large and well appointed. Beds are comfortable with down pillows and blanket. Flat screen TV, minibar, and convenient outlet locations. Double sink in tha bathroom and there is a walk-in shower, (no tub). Staff is friendly and helpful. Right across from the train station, 3 blocks from the park, 2 blocks from the shopping district. I stay here often and always enjoy it.
