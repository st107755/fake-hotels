Upscale hotel (older exterior) modernized inside. Rooms/ showers are trendy and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was included with the room- good quality and selection. Room service food selection was okay. Go to the Zepellino's- the hotels restaurant MUCH better quality food. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great location- I walked 1 block to get to great selection of shopping and outdoor cafes. Overall a great stay!
