Your staff at the front desk was very helpful and friendly.  Our room was very well appointed and quiet.  The location is central to the airport and the Mercedes Benz plants at Singelfingen and Affalterbach.  Your garage was also easily accessed with large parking spaces which is important when getting a new car.
