I really want to like this hotel but it lacks so much. It does have a great location and the concierge and valet were friendly and spoke English very well. The bar is definitely not anything to rave about. Our room seemed clean but reeked of cigarette smoke. Everywhere. It permeated everything in our tiny room- furniture, bathroom and bed (the bed was comfortable) Almost all the rooms have the option to smoke.
