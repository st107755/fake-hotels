Came to Germany to visit Porsche Museum. The ambiance of this hotel and the striking architecture of the museum made for a wonderful match. The location so close to Stuttgart's transportation hub, the centrality of shops and restaurants made for immediate ease of transition. Hotel staff were extremely helpful in facilitating our mediating a small accident and need for first aid. The food at this hotel was five star in our book.
