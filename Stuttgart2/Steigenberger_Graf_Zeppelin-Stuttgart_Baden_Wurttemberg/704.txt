The hotel's location near the stuggart hbf and the shopping street, konigsstrasse was great for our stay. It's just in front of the hbf - very easy to find. A tourist information office at the konigsstrasse gives very good advice on travel/transportation and tourist attractions.  There were a lot of restaurants and food joints, caf√©s, supermarkets, pharmacy and activities along the konigsstrasse. We enjoyed a nice stroll along this street up to schlossplatz and back. It was also easy to travel to different attractions via the nearby bus stops and train station. The hotel staff was very nice and they speak good English! Our room was big, clean and comfortable except there was no tea/coffee making facilities although they provided us with a kettle as we needed some hot water.
