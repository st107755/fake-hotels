We spent three pleasant days in room 322. It was a large tween room, well equiped and kept, with a nice view towards the train station listed building. We were quite happy with our comfortable room and we haven't ask for more hotel amenities. We haven't tried the breakfast, but we enjoyed an excellent, though maybe a bit overpriced. dinner in one of the hotel's restaurants, the Zeppelin Stuble. When we needed something the hotel staff were very polite and helpful. The location is very central and very convenient for toutistic purposes. Overall a very good experience.
