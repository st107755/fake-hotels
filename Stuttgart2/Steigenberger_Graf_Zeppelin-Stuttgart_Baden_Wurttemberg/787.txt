We stayed at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin during Porsche WTA tournament with my wife and daughter for 1 night only. Starting with the checking in , the room and the concierge overall experience was excellent. Room was modern, hotel looked to be recently renovated. Concierge was very helpful and recommended us very good restaurants during our stay. Nxt year when we go to the Porsche tournament , we will definitely stay at this hotel.
