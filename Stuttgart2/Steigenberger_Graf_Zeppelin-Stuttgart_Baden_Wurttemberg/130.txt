We recently did a whirlwind trip starting in Paris, working our way to Stuttgart and back and of the 4 hotels we stayed at on our trip, the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin was far and away the best. From the easy evening check in through the morning check out everything was seamless. Unlike most of the rooms we had, the Steigenberger offered spacious, airy rooms that were bright with high ceilings. The closets were big enough to handle all our bags with room to spare and the showers were fantastic...amazing water pressure and plenty of hot water as compared to some of the anemic showers we experienced elsewhere. We reserved rooms with breakfast and I highly recommend you do the same. The choices and quality of the food were superb and the wait staff only too happy to help with anyâ€¦
