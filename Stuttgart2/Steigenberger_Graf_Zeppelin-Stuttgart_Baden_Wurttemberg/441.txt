This hotel was perfectly located just across from the Main Train station.  The Twin room with the extra bed was spacious and the bathroom was very well laid out.  The pool and sauna were appreciated as well. Just a short cab ride from both the Mercedes and Porsche museums which were the purpose of our visit.  We have had very good experiences with this chain of hotels in Germany.
