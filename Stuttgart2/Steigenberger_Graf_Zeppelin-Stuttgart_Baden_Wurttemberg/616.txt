Came up as close to the Porsche Arena - it wasn't really (the uBahn stop is a 20 min walk away but the starting station is right by the hotel). They have taxis outside which made life REALLY easy. The plusses were very comfortable bed, small gym. Their premium high speed internet was problematic twice, which was tough as I work late a lot, but they were happy to take the days where I had problems off my bill, which was good of them.
