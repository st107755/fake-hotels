Lovely hotel in the heart of the city.  Booked through booking.com and there was a miscommunication on my part regarding breakfast. Very expensive breakfast, but room was reasonable, modern and extremely clean.would definitely recommend especially if you are there for Christmas market. Staff very helpful and speak English. Nice restaurant and bar. Bad night time pizza however. Very good internet
