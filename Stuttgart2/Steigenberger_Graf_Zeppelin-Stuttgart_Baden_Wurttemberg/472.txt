Stuttgart main train station is nearby; no need to use a taxi or public transport to reach the hotel.  Most all central Stuttgart shopping is within walking distance.  The hotel is clean; bath rooms should have more soap.  Air conditioning is okay; you can open the windows. There is a small pool on the 5th floor with other fitness and spa facilities.  The breakfast buffet is very good. The hotel has no senior rates.
