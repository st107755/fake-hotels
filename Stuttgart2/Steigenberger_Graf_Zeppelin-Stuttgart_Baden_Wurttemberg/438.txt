The room was brilliant. We booked a deluxe room and it was huge, really clean with modern decor. The separate seating area made it so much easier to relax. The location was a big factor in our choosing this hotel: it is directly opposite the main railway station with easy access to the whole city via S-bahn and U-bahn lines. It is also within 5 minutes walk of the main, pedestrianised shopping street and dozens of bars and restaurants. But despite all this we were not once affected by noise. But by far the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone we dealt with was excellent: always friendly, helpful and enthusiastic; there seemed to be an institutional pride in their work. It was also a great help that the majority of the staff spoke very good English.
