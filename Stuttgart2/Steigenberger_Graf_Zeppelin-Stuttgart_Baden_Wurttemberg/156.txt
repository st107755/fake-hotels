Stopped here while visiting the Christmas Market. Great location for the Market and main train station.  Hotel was lovely, room was nice and spacious. English TV channels, free Wi-fi in room.  Mini bar that was stocked with basic drinks.  Breakfast was expensive as everyone does agree on here, but for a buffet, and how much we both had, I think balanced out (with not buying food for the rest of the day). The staff did make us feel very welcome, especially the guy who greeted us at breakfast every morning.  The swimming pool was small but warm, quiet and very relaxing. The steam room, sauna and Gym were also included in the price of the room. The Spa itself was nice and the massage was good.  The bar prices were hefty so we chose to drink out, but I guess you pay 5 star prices inâ€¦
