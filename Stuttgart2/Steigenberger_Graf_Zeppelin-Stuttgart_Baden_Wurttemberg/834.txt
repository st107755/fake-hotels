I stayed here for two nights on a business trip in early December 2010. The Graf Zeppelin is an excellent hotel in the centre of Stuttgart. My room was very large with a small private gym. I liked the full size desk which makes working on la aptop a pleasure. Internet was fast. The decoration is modern, I would say a bit Scandinavian style. I was especially pleased with the front desk staff, they were very professional, friendly and helpful in any way. To my opinion the breakfast is too expensive for what you get, the hot selection is very limited.  The hotel is located just opposite the railway station. It takes about 30 minutes to get there by taxi from the airport. The other possibility is to take the tube from the airport to the central railway station.
