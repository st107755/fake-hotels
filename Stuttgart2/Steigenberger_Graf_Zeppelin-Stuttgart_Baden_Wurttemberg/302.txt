I've been staying at Steigenberger Hotels in various places, and I have come to expect a lot of them. Which is only fair, given their pricing.  The Graf Zeppelin can't quite convince me. Staff is ok-ish but not particularly welcoming. Issues with my room (like, two separate beds) were simply ignored, although it wasn't that busy.  The room itself was a bit odd in terms of interior design. Tastefulness is somewhat different.  I stayed here twice, and that was it.
