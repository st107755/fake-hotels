1 Night with 2 roooms, 1 with a very unpleasant smell left from not circulating air from the previous guests... So we took initiative of opening the windows instead of complaining... But that in turn cut the heating off - we did not notice until it started freezing in the night...on the next morning I discovered the small print in one of the document that we should not open windows...  Breakfast great.   Personal not very friendly when asking for a late checkout. In general extreme differences in your staff, some super friendly and helpful, other exactly the opposite.
