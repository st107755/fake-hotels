Came on a Incentive trip with my wife and this is how I wanted to start my vacation. We were greeted with champagne, our luggage was already in our room, and were greeted with a nice message on the t.v. The staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was one to remember. We were never short of anything. Thank you again for a fantastic stay.  I will definitely recommend this hotel to traveling friends.
