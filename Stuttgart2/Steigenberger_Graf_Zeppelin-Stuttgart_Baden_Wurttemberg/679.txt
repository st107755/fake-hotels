We loved this property. I traveled here with my wife and 9 year old girl. Our room was big and perfect for us, including the very comfortable roll away. Because the room was basically oversized, our daughter was able to make her own little space for the bed. The rooms / bathroom were extremely nice for the price, better than a Marriott, for example.  Location is right across from the main train station, but not at all noise in our room. This also happens to be right in one of the best, most interesting areas to walk around in. There is a huge food market nearby.  From this property, we very easily visited one of the thermal baths (public and not expensive) a short subway ride from the property.  Sauna and pool are great. Not amazing for children because it is kind of meant to beâ€¦
