We chose the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin for its central location and pool...only to be told that the pool has been closed since over six months!  The spa featuring a sauna and hammam remains operational though.   The hotel staff are absolutely wonderful, friendly and helpful. The rooms are rather large and light but could use an overhaul...  An overall average hotel experience, with delightful staff!
