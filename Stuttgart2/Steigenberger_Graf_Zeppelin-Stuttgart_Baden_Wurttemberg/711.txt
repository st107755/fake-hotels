The spa is great and first reason we continue to book  at the Zeppelin Steigenberger. The main pity is about wifi, before you had to pay after 30 mn, now it is free but with so low speed. Considering the hotel profile it is a shame. Rooms ar ok, nice breakfast (crowded during week ens)! Fabulous spa and massage. Not impressed by the restaurant (brasserie). Bar with less complementary food than last year.
