Overall, I was very happy with my stay at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin again. I've stayed at this hotel before and once again, this hotel offered me great services. The room was great, good customer services, smooth check in and really enjoyed those daily candies on my pillow :-) I also enjoyed their breakfast too. I will definitely return again ! Keep it up, Steigenberger Stuttgart :-)
