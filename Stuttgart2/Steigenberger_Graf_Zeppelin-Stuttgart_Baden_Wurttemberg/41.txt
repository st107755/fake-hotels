An excellent location for you to start your vacation or stay in Stuggart.  It is right across the road from the main railway station, easy access to the city square and the information bureau is directly across from the train station as well. A very supermarket is also virtually just next door.  There is a hop on, hop off bus just near the information bureau.  Rooms were clean, well maintained and quiet.  Only one negative, the staff did appear to want to help or assist with luggage when we first arrived. (We do our own bags anyway)
