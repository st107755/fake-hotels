I was picking up a car in Stuttgart and as part of the package, I was provided a voucher for a free hotel night stay. The Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin was one of the hotel choices and I was delighted to have chosen it. Most of the guests I saw in the lobby area were dressed up and there on business. The front desk staff was friendly and spoke excellent English. The room I was given was very comfortable.  In the morning the bellman secured my luggage as I took a taxi to the Mercedes factory. Later I came back and they loaded the car my luggage and, since everything was in German, they were kind enough to set my car's GPS to direct me to my hotel in Munich. I could not be happier with my experience here and I will most definitely return for my next car.  Not to be missed isâ€¦
