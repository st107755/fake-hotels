This is opposite the train station.  You don't hear the trains.  Very convenient though. We stayed here overnight having arrived at 7:30 pm. Nice size room with a comfy bed and a comfortable sofa bed for our child. Room service cam punctually and well presented and tasty. Veal Escalope and fries. We also ate in the restaurant Olivo - Fantastic currently 1 Michelin star clear aiming for 2 yum
