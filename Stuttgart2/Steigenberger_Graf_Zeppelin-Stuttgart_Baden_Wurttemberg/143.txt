Great location next to main station and King Street. The rooms are very clean and modern. The air conditioning was not powerful enough to cool the room to a satisfactory temperature therefore it was hot in bed and kept waking up during the night. We did not choose to have breakfast because we thought the value for money was very poor. The customer service was very good.
