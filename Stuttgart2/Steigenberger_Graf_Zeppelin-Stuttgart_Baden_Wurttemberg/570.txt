Stayed at the hotel for a week for a conference at the Stuttgart Messe and it was great. Centrally located for shopping, food and transport with central station directly across the road. Breakfast in the hotel was good but a littl expensive. Great place for breakfast is down the road at Manufactum Brot and Butter.
