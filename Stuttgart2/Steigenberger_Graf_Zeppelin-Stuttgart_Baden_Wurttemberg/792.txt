Location, location, location!  Main railway station and shops are so close at hand that a stay here is a dream.  The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are very clean, neat and so well equipped.  During our stay we would have loved to have had coffee and tea making facilities in the room though. We avoided breakfast as the price quoted was totally prohibitive - I could not see how a buffet breakfast could be woth that much! We loved the small swimming pool and spa area.
