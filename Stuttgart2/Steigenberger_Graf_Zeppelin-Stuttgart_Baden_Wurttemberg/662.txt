Excellent location less than 100 meters from Stuttgart Central Railway Station. The hotel staff were nice and quick in response. Nice furniture with International and Arabic TV channels. The breakfast buffet was excellent with different options. However, you could not provide me with a smoking room, which i did specify in my hotel reservation through Booking.com. The Wi-Fi service was very poor and could not access my e-mail during my stay. Please do something to improve this service since it is very essential for business visits.
