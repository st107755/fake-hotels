Stayed at the hotel from the 22-24 of july. Every oerson we met at the hotel, from the girl at the reception to cleaning personnel to breakfast staff, were happy, confident and had s smile on their face! We had full breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. The room was very large and quiet. In all, we fullt recommend the hotel!
