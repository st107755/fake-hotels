I stayed at the hotel during my business trip for an exhibition in The Stuttgart Messe. The location is perfect,50 meter from the central train station and 100 m from the main Konigstrasse which is the main shopping area. The hotel is in a very good condition and very well taken care of,the room was big enough ,very clean and the rain shower was my favorite. Reception stough (especially Katrina) was very helpful and gives high quality service and very welcome So was the concierge Reid's. Breakfast is great .
