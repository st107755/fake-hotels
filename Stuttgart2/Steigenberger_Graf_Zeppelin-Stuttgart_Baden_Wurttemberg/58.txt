I was traveling in the area and wanted a hotel which was centrally located...and it is PERFECT. The hotel is located across the street from the main train station (Hauptbanhof) and 2 blocks from the main shopping area called Konigsstrasse. There are numerous restaurants and parks in the area so great location adults and kids. The hotel itself is top notch...very nice. The service was amazing, especially Katarina, as was the breakfast buffet. The rooms are very spacious with large showers as well. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and although it may be a little more expensive than others around I don't think any of them can match the location and level of service.
