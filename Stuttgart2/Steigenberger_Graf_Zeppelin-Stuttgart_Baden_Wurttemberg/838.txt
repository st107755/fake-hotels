Yes, the location is convenient to the Train Station, Shopping, Downtown BUT if you leave unhappy was it worth being close to the area you wanted to be in?  NOT for me. I had advanced reservations , checked in & spoke English with the Front Desk Respresentive and I confirmed with her that breakfast was included in my room rate which had been confirmed with me thru a Travel Agent in Germany. The Front Desk representive said YES, absolutely and gave me the hours & locations of the F&B outlets. The room was very nice and clean.  I went to the breakfast buffet area and was greeted by Hotel Dining Room Hostess,  I asked her AGAIN - is Breakfast included with my room rate?  she asked my room number and looked at a computer print-off anbd said YES.   The breakfast buffet was limitedâ€¦
