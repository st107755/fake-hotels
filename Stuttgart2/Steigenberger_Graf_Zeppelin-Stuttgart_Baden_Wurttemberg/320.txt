I spent several days in Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin with my Mom.  Our experience there was great.  The service was excellent, all staff were very friendly, and the room was great.  The reception staff specifically were extremely helpful and responsive to our needs (Thanks Julia :D).  One unpleasant incident occurred but, again thanks to the responsiveness of the staff, it was immediately addressed, with compliments.  We did not have enough time to use the gym, pool, and sauna but knowing we had free access to them was a relaxing thought.  Maybe next time :)  There is however one problem that I wish the hotel would address soon.  The room heating was not strong enough.  We had it set to the maximum and we asked for extra blankets but some nights were still colder than others andâ€¦
