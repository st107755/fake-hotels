In town to pick up a car in Zeffenhausen, stayed for two nights and really enjoyed everything about the property and location.  The rooms are really spacious and very nice.  Ate in Zeppelino's restaurant and enjoyed a delicious US steak and yummy salad of lamb's lettuce and the most delicious bacon!  Friendly service and courteous wait staff.  The hotel is very close to shopping and great local restaurants.  We stayed here in January and were so glad to visit again.
