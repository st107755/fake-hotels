This place is a bit of a home away from home now. I have stayed here on and off over the last 4 months.  It has everything I need. It's right in down town, it has great parking, and a indoor pool/sauna. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable, and the staff welcoming and accommodating (apart from the two barmen who look like the grumpiest guys on the planet).    When my wife has flown in to Germany (when I have need to work over the odd weekend), I stay here as I know she'll be happy and well looked after. The hotel is located directly across the street from the main Stuttgart train station so getting around the city is a breeze, and I have often taken the express train to Frankfurt from here as well.   I would not say this place is cheap, but then again I have stayed inâ€¦
