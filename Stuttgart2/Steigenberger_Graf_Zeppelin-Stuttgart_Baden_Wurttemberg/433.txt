I was spending a few days by myself in Stuttgart primarily to visit the Porsche and Mercedes-Benz museums. The staff, especially Ellen at reception, were welcoming, helpful and spoke excellent English. The room had a comfortable bed with modern ensuite facilities (great shower water pressure). The WiFi was intermittent and was irritatingly slow at times but was included in the room rate. The hotel is locate right next to Stuttgart Main Station which makes it easy to find and highly convenient. I am happy to recommend the hotel and would be pleased to return in the future.
