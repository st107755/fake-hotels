I stayed twice in the hotel, first time for a business trip and second time we went there for a short Saturday stay due to a music event that took place in Stuttgart. It is basically a 4*hotel (not up to 5* level). Was quite disappointed by the fact the the hotel is evidently saving on bathrooms cosmetics (1 shower gel,1 shampoo for 2 adults) and the feedback received from a guy at the reception on this issue. He looked at me like at an idiot asking for something absolutely not normal...and instead of talking to a room services he decided just to ignore my remark. Well, frankly speaking, just because of this unfriendliness I will choose a neighboring 5*hotel next time, either for a business trip or a leisure propose. But the breakfast was fine, quite nice service that timeâ€¦
