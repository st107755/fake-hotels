Very close to the main Stuttgart train station,this hotel has all that one would expect from a first-class establishment.  This being the third time we have stayed, we were pleased to see that the standards have been maintained.  Each time we have had an excellent meal in the on-site restaurant, this time the veal was superb !  The breakfast buffet is extensive but at â‚¬ 29 is perhaps a little expensive for people like us who  only want a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee or tea.
