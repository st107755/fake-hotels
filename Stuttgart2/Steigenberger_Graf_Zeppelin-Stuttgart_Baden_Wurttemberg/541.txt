Conveniently located across the street from the main station and near the beginning of a very long pedestrian shopping street (KÃ¶nigstrasse).  Staff is very friendly and professional.  Rooms are dated - furnishings from the 90's, old carpet, beds are motel quality; you can hear the springs and their very hard.  No free full speed Wi-Fi!  Definitely not would I would expect from a 5-Star hotel...
