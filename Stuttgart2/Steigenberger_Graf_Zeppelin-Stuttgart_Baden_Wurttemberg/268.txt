Only a 1 night stay, but check in process was simple (car valet parked) and staff were very friendly, helpful and relaxed. Room was spacious and well equipped. Slight noise from roadside was noticeable, but not an issue (especially considering we were facing the front of the hotel). Spa facilities were above expectation, with a pool you could actually swim in and a steam room that actually produces a good level of steam. Check out too was straight forward and staff could not have been more helpful.
