This hotel is a great location to be near the train station and also near the downtown area.  Easy walking distance to the old city with all it's charm and ambiance.  You can grab a bite to eat in the train station or easily walk to the many sidewalk cafes in the city center.    The staff is friendly and parking is available in the hotel.  Rooms are good and fair priced.  Clean and up to date.  Quiet rooms with well insulated windows to keep out the street noise.    Road construction nearby gave the GPS fits in the rental car but that just makes the trip more exciting.
