The Steigenberger hotel is a great property with a prefect location just across the street from the Hauptbanhof.  Stuttgart 21 it a massive construction project around the main train station that has negatively impacted the convenience of some of the local hotels.  For example it is now very difficult to walk from the ___ to the Konigsalle, and main shopping areas.  Many of the rooms have been upgraded to a small suite layout with a separate bedroom area.  We found the layout to be excellent.  They offer a good bar area and a nice exercise room.  Overall one of the top properties in Stuttgart.
