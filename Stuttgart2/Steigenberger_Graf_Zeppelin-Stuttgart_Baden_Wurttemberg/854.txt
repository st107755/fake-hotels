It doesn't look that nice from the outside but it's fabolous once you are in. This time, last week,  I travelled alone and normally the 1-person rooms are worse compared to the "regular" rooms. Not here; excellent located room which had a pleasant and warm athmosphere. Very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent restaurants. "Olivo" , a 1 Michelin star rated restaurant which I didn't visit.  " Zeppelino's"  is a Mediterean Brasserie where I ate quite a lot. Then there is "The Zeppeling Stuble"; a cosy small restaurant which serves regional food.  I have seen quite a lot of hotels but was impressed by the personal touch of the Graf Zeppelin. I will certainly return to have a diner at " Olivo"!
