we stayed here on business and were terribly disappointed by the staff. we were not allowed to use the empty tables near the bar  for work(the tables are supposedly only available to people having food, although i never saw anybody there! we were also not offered any alterantive except sitting at the bar. the waiters were always extremely slow and at one point we waited for 20minutes for the bill.
