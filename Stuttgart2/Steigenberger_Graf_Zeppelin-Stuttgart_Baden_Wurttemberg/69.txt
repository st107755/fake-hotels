This is a beautiful, stylish hotel in the middle of Stuttgart. Great location just across the main train station and at the start of the shopping street. Roomas are roomy,l and clean. Breakfast buffet was also really good. The spa is not so big but has the essentials bigger pool, sauna and steam sauna. There was no bubble pool and to compensate for that the water on the normal pool could have been warmer.
