This hotel I would definately recommend!  We booked our room for the wrong date and still everybody was so helpfull to organize a beautiful (!) room/suite for us. And in such a short time when we received some drinks, the room was prepared and some delicious snacks and fruits were in the room.   Also the staff of the restaurant was so friendly and helpfull. We really felt us welcome.   Thanking you again for this lovely stay in your beautiful hotel!  We definately will visut the hotel another time!
