Perhaps a little more than expensive than average but definitely justified. Nice staff which was helpful when my booking was incorrect (thanks Julia!!!). Clean and modern. Location perfect with shops and restaurants. In front of train station. Spa on 5th floor (best floor I guess). Would happily come back. No hesitation.
