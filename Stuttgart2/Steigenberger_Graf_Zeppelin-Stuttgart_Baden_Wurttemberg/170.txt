We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay.  We arrived around 1 pm and although we couldn't check into our room we were offered a quiet seat in the bar and a special internet login so that we could FaceTime for our granddaughter's birthday in Australia.  Then we went off for lunch and returned to find all our luggage safely installed in our room.  We had a small problem with our TV which was dealt with very promptly.  Our room was large by hotel standards and we especially appreciated the spacious bathroom with a double vanity. All the staff were friendly, professional and helpful.  Recommended.
