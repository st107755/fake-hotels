Well located for a weekend visit with easy access from airport and to station.  Good pool and spa facilities.  Hotel restaurants dated and average. Recommend Italian restaurants further up the street, and the Grand Cafe on Charlottenplatz for a good breakfast at less than half the price of the hotel's.
