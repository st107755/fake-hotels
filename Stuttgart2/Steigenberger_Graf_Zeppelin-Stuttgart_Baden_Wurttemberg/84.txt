Stayed at this hotel 3 nights one week 1 night the next.   Accommodations were superb.  I was on a tour with Porsche so I did not make the reservation so I do not know what class of room I had but it was excellent. Beautifully appointed and clean and polished .  Staff was superb with one exception, a bartender, I think he was an Italian, in the lobby lounge was inattentive and very slow to serve even the few guest in our group. Otherwise all of the staff, from the beautiful young ladies in reception, the Concierge, the breakfast and dinner staff in the restaurants were perfect. I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone planning a trip to Stuttgart.
