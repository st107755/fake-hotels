I left my wallet with the hotel and called them to check.  First they told me they could not find it.  Only after I told them I need to report this to police, they miraculously found it.  As there are some important IDs in it, I told them to send it back using the faster method available and I will pay for all expenses (even send them an authorization form for the charges).  Not sure if they do not understand me or what but they send using a method that will take 3 weeks to arrived when there are faster services that took 5 days.  There are also other issues that I will not highlight in this review but overall service is NON EXISTENCE!!!
