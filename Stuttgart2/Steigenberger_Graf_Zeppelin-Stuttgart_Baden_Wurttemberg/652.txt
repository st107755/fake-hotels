It' s a good h√¥tel but not 5 stars !!! Room size it's ok, but the service is very bad, I wait the delivery luggages 45 minutes after my arrival, One free bottle of water for 2  for 3 nights !!! change the sheet only every 3 nights !!!  no doorman !!! No bell captain   so sorry if it's these criteria if it is not there it was only a 4 stars due to the price room.
