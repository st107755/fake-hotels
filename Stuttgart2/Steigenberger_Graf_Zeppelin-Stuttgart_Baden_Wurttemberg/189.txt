I have already reviewed on another site and had a reply already from management. Firstly the location is very good.  Close to the shopping area and restaurants and right across from the station. The staff was very friendly and efficient.. Even if they didn't explain properly the procedure of charging your card an extra deposit which is on top of your room. Fee and later refunding it.. I never understood it and after 3months in Europe it's still the only hotel I've struck doing that.. The hotel is looking a bit dated. It's comfortable but definitely needs an upgrade. There is a a good restaurant attached which I recommend.. Overall a pleasant stay... But the extra deposit policy needs to go....
