My husband and I visited this hotel for a weekend break.  The hotel is in a fantastic position, opposite the train station and right in the heart of the city.  The hotel itself is very nice, our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. It has a lovely bar area and the staff were extremely helpful . The only negatives I have is that our shower leaked under the door and flooded the bathroom it was a fantastic powerful shower though. Also the maid knocked on the door and attempted to enter the room at 9 am
