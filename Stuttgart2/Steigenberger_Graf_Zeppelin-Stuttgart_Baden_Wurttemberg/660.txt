The hotel is, very contemporary/modern in style and furnishings.  Our room was a mini-suite and was beautifully furnished, clean, stylish, large, comfortable and in excellent condition. This made for a pleasant, first night, European-Delivery-of-a- new-car, driving vacation. We were just as impressed with the staff;  All were friendly, eager to please and their English was excellent. Our dinner was every bit as good as the balance of our experience there. Although we spent no time touring Stuttgart we would return to this hotel, "in a heart-beat. It is excellent!". Would go back here for sure...BEAUTIFUL AND TOP RATED
