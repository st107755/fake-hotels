The hotel is across the railway station. So the location is perfect for train travellers. Our room was facing the station but it was very quiet. At first glance the room looked a bit dated but everything was in an excellent condition and clean. The room was larger than the rooms we had in other city hotels in Europe. The only drawback was the free wireless internet. The speed was so slow that surfing was a pain.
