Wonderful hotel located right across from the main train station. Has an indoor pool,  and several restaurants specializing in the local and international cuisine.  In addition, there are several cafes, bakeries, and a steak house within walking distance. Felt safe, walked around Stuttgart and through a park.  Taxi's readily available too.
