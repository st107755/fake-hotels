This hotel is located directly across from the Hauptbahnhof, with many shops and restaurants in the area.  Check-in process was very quick, and the mini-suite I had been upgraded to was absolutely spotless.  The bathroom and shower were, in particular in immaculately clean condition, and the rainfall style shower was welcome after a long train trip on a windy, rainy day. Dinner at Zeppelinos was excellent, and I took advantage of it being Spargel season - all very good, fairly priced, with extremely pleasant staff members. The second night, I did take advantage of room service, to be told it was going to be 30 minutes.  As the time approached, a call to my room informed me that it would be 5 more minutes than they anticipated.  That is called keeping your customer informed.  â€¦
