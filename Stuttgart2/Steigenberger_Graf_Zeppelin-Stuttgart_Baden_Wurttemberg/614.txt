The Steigenberger is located just opposite the main train station in Stuttgart making it easily accessible and in the downtown.  I had a very nice room, large with a walk in closet, a small sitting area and a double bed.  The bed was much like others I've experienced in European hotels. A "double" is simple two single mattresses pushed together, not the most comfortable.  My room was quiet, the hotel was immaculate and the staff were all extremely pleasant and considerate.  I strongly recommend the Steigenberger to anyone interested in Stuttgart.
