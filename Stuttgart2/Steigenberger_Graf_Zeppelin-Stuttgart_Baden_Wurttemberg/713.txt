We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate my wife's birthday. Great location close to main shopping street, restaurants and opposite train station. Good sized, clean & modern rooms. Well equipped mini bar at reasonable prices (for a mini bar). The staff were very polite and helpful. The pool and spa are a great place to relax (note: the steam room and sauna are a textile free area - I only found this out after I left the spa area, but a very pleasant & relaxing experience). The whole hotel was clean and beautifully maintained. Only 1 downside was the cost of breakfast, around €30 each. Compared to UK hotels this is expensive however there is a hotel behind the Zepplin called Motel One where you can get a continental buffet for around €8 each. Overall a great please to stay though.
