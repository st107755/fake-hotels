Stayed for two nights for picking up our car at Porsche, Zuffenhausen - European delivery program. Great location and excellent property. Close to top shopping arcade, Konigstrasse and main train station. Despite being close to busy section of the town and train station, it is kind of quite.  We had a jr suite so large and comfy. Nice view but lot of construction activities going on and it was kind of eyesore.  Great breakfast buffet with lot of items and you can order your favorite omelettes too. Not sure how much it costs but included in the room tariff. Service folks are very nice and they taught me the different between guten tag and gruss gott ;-)  Nice and friendly staff and they are very helpful.
