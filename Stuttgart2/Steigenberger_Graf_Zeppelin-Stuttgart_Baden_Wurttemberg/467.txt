Excellent hotel in perfect location.  This hotel was everything we expected from a 5 star establishment, and we were very pleased with the room, hotel amenities, location and excellent service. Staff were very helpful and made our stay memorable. Thanks very much for giving us an upgrade to make my husband's birthday so special. We hope to return as we loved Stuttgart and this great hotel.
