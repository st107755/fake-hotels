Stained there for 2 night with family. The hotel is very well located. Very nice rooms and service. Breakfast was also great. The BIG mismatch is the WiFi in the rooms. Though during booking they say free internet, the one provided for free does not work at all, and the one which they charg for is also very slow. Really a outing and does not fit such a hotel, and the fact that we are in 2016......
