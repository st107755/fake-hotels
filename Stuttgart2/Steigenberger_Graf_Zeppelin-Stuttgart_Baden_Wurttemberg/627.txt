We  visited Stuttgart for the Christmas markets -and the Steignenberger was a great location & value.  It was just a few minutes to walk to the markets. The staff was great & very helpful.  The restaurants in the hotel were great.  The breakfast buffet was a bit expensive - but pretty on par with European breakfasts!
