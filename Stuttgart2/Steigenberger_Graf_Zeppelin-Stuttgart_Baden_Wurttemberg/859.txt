We arrived to the Graf Zeppelin with no reservation - just a prayer that a room was available. My husband and I had cycled through parts of the Black Forest and wanted to spend our last night in Germany in a nice modern hotel. What a fabulous surprise! As a veteran of the hotel industry of 14 years, I can honestly say the service in all departments was incomparable to anything I have ever experienced in the States. And the room! WOW - beyond spacious, great view, every concievable amenity (except a robe, but how minor of a grievance is that?)The cigar bar was great - and the waiter was so gracious to have the chef make a special request meal for me that was not on the menu. In a city preserving the history and embracing the future, the Graf Zeppelin is a great blend of old worldâ€¦
