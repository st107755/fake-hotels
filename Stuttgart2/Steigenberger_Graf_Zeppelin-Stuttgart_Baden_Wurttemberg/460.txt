Very central location, friendly and impeccably polite staff. Rooms spacious and comfortable, super clean and well maintained. The decor and ambient every 90s but not unpleasant. The spa is a delight and very relaxing, 24-hour gym a bonus. My only gripes are that the road outside super noisy so you can't really open windows and wifi very slow indeed.
