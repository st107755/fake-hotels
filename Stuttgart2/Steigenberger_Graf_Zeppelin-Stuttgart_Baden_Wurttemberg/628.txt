Beautiful hotel and great location. Comfortable and spacious. Good restaurant with polite waiters. Breakfast with beautiful scenery and good food. BUT Staff is polite but offers very limited help. Provide incomplete / incorrect information is not acceptable in a hotel like this. And it happened more than once. One example: my aunt called five times and were informed that we were not registered. She cancelled her trip to Stuttgart. Go inside the shower to use the toilet is ridiculous. And the shower has no door and water splashes everywhere. Very bad WiFi (can not use Skype, for instance). If you want a little better connection you must pay 8 Euros (US$ 10) a day. If I would come back? Most likely not, except if I need nothing else than a very expensive place to sleep at night,â€¦
