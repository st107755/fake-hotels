Had a one night stay at the Graf Zeppelin in Stuttgart in a Deluxe room. The room was nice and clean and the bathroom was also clean. The details were just not what you expect from a 5* hotel. The amenities folder was old and not updated, the soap in the bathroom was in a bottle at the wall (cheaper and same as in 2 or 3* hotels) The milk at breakfast was still in the carton from the supermarket. The bar and restaurant was hardly frequented. The gym was small and basic and although the staff was very professional and friendly I left with the impression that the hotel has seen better times. Maybe they should use the time the new station is under construction to renovate the hotel. But maybe the location for a high end hotel is not ideal either and it should become a 3* hotel.
