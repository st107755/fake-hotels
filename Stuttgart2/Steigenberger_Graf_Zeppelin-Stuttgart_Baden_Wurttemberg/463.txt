We chose the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin for a recent trip to Stuttgart based on it's central location and good Tripadviser reviews and it has lived up to all expections. The location is excellent, opposite the main station making travel from the airport by train easy or only a 20 minutes drive if travelling by car. The centre of Stuttart is within 5 mins walk with a good choice of places to visit or eat. The hotel accommodation and service I could not fault; efficient friendly staff, spacious, well appointed rooms and the pool was a great addition. This is a hotel I would have no hesitation in recommending and returning for another visit.
