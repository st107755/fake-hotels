Great hotel across from the train station. Do not even have to enter station for train to airport. Escalator next to hotel takes directly to platform 101 or 102. Stayed in junior suite, lovely. all the amenities you want. Plenty of room. Quite. No problems with lifts.May cost a little more to stay here, but worth it. Staff very helpful. only two blocks from main pedestrian street for a lovely stroll.. Enjoyed our stay, nice, convenient,pleasant.
