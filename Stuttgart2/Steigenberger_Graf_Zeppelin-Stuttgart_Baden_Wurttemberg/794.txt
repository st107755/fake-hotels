I stayed there this Monday for a conference. For a business traveller the location is great as it is across the main railway station. Internet is paid which is a no brainer to me in the 21 century, especially when the reduced rate is EUR 170 B&B. In every renowned business hotel like Le Meridien or Radisson Blu Internet Wi-FI Ð°ccess is free of charge and therefore I stay there or in a similar quality hotel with broadband connection.   The staff is coldly polite and helpful but will not go an extra-mile to please you.  Breakfast is excellent but again the staff needs improvement. I had to pile several used plates on the table and nobody cared to take them away...for the course of the breakfast.
