As it was snowing heavily we took advantage of the Winterspecial of the Zeppelinhotel to avoid having to drive back in the middle of the night. It was a very good deal at 123 Euro room only (+20 Euro for car parking) for a a very large room to the quiet back. Certainly a very good price for Stuttgart and the location close to train station, opera and the shopping mile. The staff was very friendly and valet parking worked excellently. On another occasion we had eaten at the hotel restaurant, the Olivo, which is very good indeed. Surely, a very recommendable hotel.
