Great property and location, all the staff we super friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast buffet is excellent but is expensive. Free "wifi" is a misnomer, as it didn't work on any device of the 3 devices we had as it is way too slow for modern technology. Pay wifi worked fine but at a cost of $8 euro per day. In summary we enjoyed our stay and would recommend highly recommend this property, just don't expect free "wifi"
