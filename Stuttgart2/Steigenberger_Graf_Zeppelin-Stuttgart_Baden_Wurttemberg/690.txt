We chose this hotel due to it's location and upon arriving, we were pretty impressed by the service provided and the front desk staffs are always very friendly and will ask for feedback to assure that you have a pleasant stay. It is right by the train station and just off the main shopping street, Konigstrasse. If most of the shops are already closed by 8pm, you might still be able to get some groceries/food at the train station, which is an added bonus. We stayed in the Junior Suite and the bed is really soft and comfy. There are only two things which I find not up to par. Firstly, the towels looked old and had a slight grey tint to it instead of being pristine white. It also had a faint smell of bleach. The other is the room service. We had the currywurst and minestrone soupâ€¦
