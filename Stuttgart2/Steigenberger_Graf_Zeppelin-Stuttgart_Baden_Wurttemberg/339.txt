Recently stayed here for 4 nights and the hotel really exceeded our expectations. Our room was SO good that we thought we must have been upgraded, but apparently this was a normal twin room. It was huge, with a glass top executive desk, a drinks cabinet and a table and two lounge chairs. There was a walk in wardrobe/dressing room, with enough space to put our two suitcases. The bathroom had a lovely bath, twin sinks and a separate toilet and bidet. There was no kettle, but you could ask for one, which we did, so could enjoy our morning and evening tea/coffee. It was conveniently located across the road from the station, but the area was not at all seedy, which we have found to be the case in other station locations. Because we were arriving and departing by train, we chose itâ€¦
