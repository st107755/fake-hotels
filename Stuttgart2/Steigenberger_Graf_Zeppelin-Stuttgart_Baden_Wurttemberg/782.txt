We spent one Saturday night at this hotel with some friends and as it was our last weekend before getting married we decided to choose somewhere special. We were not disappointed with this great modern hotel.  The hotel is located next to the train station. You have wallet parking or for 15 euros/day there is a garage very close.  The room is very beautiful, very ample, big bed, desk, big bathroom and a separate area with wardrobe. There is wifi in the room(free 30 minutes).  The spa is not big, but quite complete, with sauna, swimming pool, ...  we could relax there in the afternoon and Sunday morning.  The breakfast is very high standard, with many options of cold and warm food, many sorts of cakes, fresh juices and even champagne.
