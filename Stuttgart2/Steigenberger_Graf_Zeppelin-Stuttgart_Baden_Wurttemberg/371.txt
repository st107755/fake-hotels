Eight of us stayed for two nights at the beginning of a road trip.  Concierge welcome was efficient, front of house staff helpfully directed us all to secure underground car park, valet parking was available.  Rooms were excellent, modern, clean, really good facilities.  Felt contemporary.  Bathrooms were spacious, warm, clean, seemed new.    We used the hotels bars and restaurant for dinner and breakfast.  Breakfast buffet was excellent, Zeppelin restaurant was made quite special by the waiting staff - friendly and accommodating.  Surrounded by a few art galleries, Hugo's Bar just across the road also worth a visit.
