The room we were first allocated was dull, tired-looking, stale smelling and the carpet was filthy - at least 3 large stains which were the first thing you noticed on entry. No tea-making facilities/ iron/ ironing board - some furniture looked shabby. Only saving grace was that after complaining we were later offered a free upgrade but this ‘tainted’ our whole stay. I waited 30 years to come back here and was so looking forward to the visit. Staff were courteous but not friendly, no nibbles offered with drinks in the lounge, carpets thread-bare on the stairs. Spa had no drinks available other than water, lockers required a payment and there was no Spin Dryer/ plastic bags for wet swimsuits. Nothing luxurious about this! Such a shame!
