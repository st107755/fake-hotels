This hotel is good in some ways but I honestly don't feel its worthy of 5 stars. The location is great very central opposite the station. The valet parking is good at only €20 but I don't like valet parking for many reasons and no option to self park is annoying. We parked across the street for the second night and it cost €12 euro.  There is a lounge downstairs where smoking is legal, that is fine but there is a distinctive smell of smoke throughout the hotel which just isn't nice. I think that the rooms are very dated and the TV is confusing to use.  The hotel restaurants have bad reviews and are expensive but there are hundreds of restaurants nearby, just go out the hotel turn right and walk down there several blocks and you will pass hundreds of restaurants.  I've stayed at…
