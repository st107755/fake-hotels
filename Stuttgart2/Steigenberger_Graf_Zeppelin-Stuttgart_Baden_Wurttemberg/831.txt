We stayed here for three days to visit Mercedez Benz Museum and as a base to visit Europa Park and Legoland Gunsburg.  The hotel is just across the street from the station which is SO CONVENIENT.  We get most of our food in the station - there are a lot of shops selling take-away/fast food in the station including a chinese noodle shop, McDonald, Kebab shop (this one is located in the Main Market whose kebab is SO DELICIOUS!!!), just shop, pastry shop and many more.   There is also a convenient store in the Main Market where you can get drinks, chips, chocolates etc.  Basically, you can everything you need from the station where shops open from 7:00am till 9:00pm.   The room is spacious and the hotel kindly provide us with an extra bed in a twin room so that we have three bedsâ€¦
