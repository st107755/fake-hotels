Easy access to town. Staff was friendly and spoke excellent English. The cigar lounge was very nice and allowed us access to greatly appreciated local dining advice. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. This was all part of our European Mercedes delivery and was a great start to our tour of Germany.
