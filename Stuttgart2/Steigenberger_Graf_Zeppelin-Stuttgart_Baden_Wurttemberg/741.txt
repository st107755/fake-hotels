We visited the hotel this past weekend and we given an "upgraded" room,  the hotel is hot, the temps were 90+ degrees, the room air conditioner was told it was working, but nothing nothing cold came out. -  we contacted the front desk many times but were told they could do nothing.  Finally we asked for them to open the windows, the windows had no handles, which they did, but then were told the a/c would stop working!!  What a joke!  But we had to call them up again to close the windows because of all the street noise!  The room stunk of cigarette smoke and when we called down to get some spray - we were told it was a smoke free hotel - what a joke!  In addition we stayed 2 nights and they tried to charge an additional $5 euros for 2 nights of Internet access - which was freeâ€¦
