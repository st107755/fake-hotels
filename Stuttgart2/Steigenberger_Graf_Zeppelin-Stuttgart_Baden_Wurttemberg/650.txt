While the exterior seems old the interiors of the hotel have been modernised and are fashionable and comfortable. I had a nice spacious room, very comfortable bed and breakfast was reasonably rich. English breakfast is far from what you get in London (bacon was over cooked), but cold food, bread and cereals were good. Service is excellent, everybody tried hard to serve and solve issues and make your stay enjoyable. I was surprised I could not see the main italian channel for the italian football game !!!
