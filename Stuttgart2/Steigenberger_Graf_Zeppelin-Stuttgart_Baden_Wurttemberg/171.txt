After having had the chance to experience many hotels I knew the moment we checked in this hotel was not the real thing.  There is not anything terribly wrong with it, it does the job of having a quiet and comfortable place to spend the night and the room and shower have a decent size, and the location is excellent near  Königstrasse which is the main tourist area in Stuttgart.  The thing is it’s just overpriced, things like the towels that have seen better days, the slow internet, the outdated decor, the pushy bell door that you do not even really need, the overpriced parking, the air conditioner that makes noise but can’t cool down the room.  So staying at this hotel does cover what you need, god location, quiet, comfortable and safe, it is just that for what it costs you wold…
