I had the pleasure of staying at the two nicest hotels in Stuttgart and I have to say that the Graf Zeppelin is the nicest of the two. Lovely spacious room, center of town, helpful staff. It isn't cheap, but I felt it was a good value at the high end. I would stay here again and recommend the hotel to anyone who asked.
