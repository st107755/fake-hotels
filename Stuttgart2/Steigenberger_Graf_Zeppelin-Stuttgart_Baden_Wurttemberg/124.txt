Having stayed in many places and dont need to talk about room conditions or cleanness of the hotel (Zero reason to complain/criticism about anything). The warm welcome and truely heartwarming through the entire Hotel Staff. Am just full of compliments and positive impressions. It is for me definitively fix point and wont stay in different Hotel when am back in Stuttgart. A jewel you dont find every day! Thanks to the entire crew at the Steigenberger!
