Because my husband and I were traveling by train to Stuttgart and primarily wanted to visit the Porsche and Mercedes Museums, we wanted a hotel convenient to the train station and S bahn. The Steigenberger was both. We were very satisfied with our choice of hotel. It was very deluxe, the rooms were quiet and comfortable, and the front desk staff very helpful. We could not have asked for more.
