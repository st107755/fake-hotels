Requested junior suite with additional bed; all done to perfection. Perfect location as well; quiet even for being on a main street, and close to all the restaurants and nightlife your stay needs. Began recommending it to colleagues before the weekend was done. Ultimate bonus; desk staff (gender unimportant) that took a personal interest in making sure my vehicle and myself were well-prepped for the next journey. It's always the little things that are most impressive - right?
