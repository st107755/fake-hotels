This place is in the center of Stuttgart. It is walking distance to the main shopping street (Lots of restaurants nearby) across the street from main train station. Stuttgart is an OK city but this is a great hotel for the price and location. The rooms are big, bright, modern, and the customer service is great.  Ron at the front desk was awesome and helpful in every way. The windows are very good quality and block out all noise from the outside.
