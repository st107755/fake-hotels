One room seemed to be newer but less big, the 2nd room is much older but have a walk in closet.  Hotel is nice, lobby nice, service alright. Location across the central station very convenient. 1 block away is central shopping area.  The crowd around the hotel is however not the greatest. Although no sign of crime but the atmosphere is rather "unsafe". At night the streets in front is full of racing exhaust noise and emergency response, which somewhat confirmed my feel.  Nice to be overnighter.
