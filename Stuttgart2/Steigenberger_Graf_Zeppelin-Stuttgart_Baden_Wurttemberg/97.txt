The hotel is ok with good location   But with the hot weather hitting Stuttgart the AC on the entire hotel was extremely bad. We were given a room that was even worse and when I talked to the lady at the front desk she was extremely rude and went out of her way to ensure that she didnâ€™t care. She was telling us the hotel was full and rooms are available. But she managed to find us a room when I threatened to leave the hotel.  As for the rest of the stay it was ok although the complementary water was never refilled.  Never again.
