I can recommend this hotel.  Location perfect, close to the railway station and the city centre.  We arrived early but were told our room was ready for us and they had upgraded our room which was a great surprise and wonderful start to our break.  The staff were all friendly and helpful especially Kerstin on Reception.  My only criticism would be the towels in the bathroom they were certainly not of a 5 star quality and looked very old and discoloured.
