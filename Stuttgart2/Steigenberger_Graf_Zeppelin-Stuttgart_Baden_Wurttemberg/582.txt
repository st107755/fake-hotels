We had a one night stay here - we were given a complimentary upgrade which was nice. The room is very corporate and comfortable. 2 minute walk to the main train station made it very convenient also. The young lady who checked us in was a delight - I am sorry that I can't recall her name but she was friendly, courteous and very professional.
