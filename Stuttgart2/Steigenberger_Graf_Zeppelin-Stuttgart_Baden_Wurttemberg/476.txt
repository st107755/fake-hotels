We stayed here four nights as part of at trip to explore Porsche (factory, museum, drive, etc).  Staff were fluent in several languages and were very pleasant and helpful.  We didn't try any of the restaurants but loved the area surrounding the hotel.  The rooms were comfortable and nice and the location to the train station was great.  We weren't really bothered by any noise at all.  The only downside was the room amenities.  The rainfall shower was AMAZING but unless you book a suite, standard rooms do not come with basic amenities such as ice bucket, coffee maker, iron or ironing board.  Even to just press a scarf, you have to pay to send it out in laundry to be pressed - that part I didn't care for at all but the rest was wonderful.
