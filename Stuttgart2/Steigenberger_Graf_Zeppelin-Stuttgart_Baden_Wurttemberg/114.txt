The overall service met the expectation of this top hotel in Stuttgart.  However, Pia the front desk receptionist should receive some cultural sensitivity training.  She completely ignored me and acting busy when It was my turn to check -in and waited for another colleague to assist me.  No explanation or eye contact or even acknowledgement I existed.   She was certainly biased against Chinese, and I personally felt unwelcomed and  discriminated against.  This is suppose to be the top international hotel with world travelers; and this type of anti-Asian sentiments should not be tolerated anywhere.  I hope management would counselled against this type of behavior and bad reflection of the entire hotel chain. .
