The location of the hotel is excellent and the decor quite striking. We had a suite for three nites which was very pricey - far too expensive for the quality of the service and the overall level of housekeeping (some nites there wasn't even turn-down service). The air conditioning was almost non existent and because the weather was warm, it was therefore necessary to leave the windows open. The noise was terrible and went on all night resulting in no sleep. The hotel staff was very defensive when we complained and stated "air conditioning in Europe isn't the same as in the United States." - How appauling and how inaccurate! We couldn't stay there again if there was any chance of needing a cool room.
