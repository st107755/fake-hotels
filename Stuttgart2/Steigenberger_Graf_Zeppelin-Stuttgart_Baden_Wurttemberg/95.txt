Amidst one of the hottest summers in Germany, we absolutely relished our 3-night stay at the Steigenberger...they have great aircon! But besides that, the hotel has a lot of positives. It's central location is excellent for restaurants, sightseeing, shopping and access to trains to get to outlying areas (e.g., Mercedes-Benz  and Porsche Museums). The hotel has friendly and effective service and the Cigar lounge is spacious and comfortable. The rooms are modern and nicely appointed.
