The hotel is great! Love the room and very clean and location is great!  I read other trip advisors' review and can understand why they said the service is not good.  The staff are somewhat not too friendly.  I've forgotten to print out the hotel voucher eveb though I had it on my iPhone.  The staff pretty much 'force' me to go to the business center to print it out. After our drive from Franfurt and a long day tour at the Porche museum, I just wanted a little break washing up and get that done after.  But the reception staff was very insistent and called my room and asked me to give them the voucher.    Anyway, other than that, the hotel stay was good!
