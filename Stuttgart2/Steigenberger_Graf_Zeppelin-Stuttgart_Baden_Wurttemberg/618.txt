This month I've visited the Steigenberger with my girlfriends to have a nice day in Stuttgart. We went to the spa for manicure and a masssage. I have never seen so unfriendly and inkompetent staff. Service was completely missing! Not what we expected for that price! The manicure of my friend was very poor and my massage was not better at all. I am clearly not recomending this Spa! Beside of that, the Hotel is nice but definately not worth that price!
