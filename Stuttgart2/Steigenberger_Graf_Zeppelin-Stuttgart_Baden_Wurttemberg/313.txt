 Superb staff on the front desk especially Katharina Bastian and Christiane Welt could not be helpful enough and really did treat us well ! they gave us an upgrade for a special occasion and were really professional at all time  Lovely pool upgrade and close to all  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEY are the ONLY place to stay in Stuttgart!  â€¢	Stayed December 2016
