Hotelroom (junior suite)  was clean, but has some wear and tear. The minibar was not restocked when we arrived, and when we notified the receptionist he asked us to breathe on him. A very unpleasent experience, especially in front of other guests standing around the reception. We were informed upon arrival that we could enjoy the spa included with our room, and was planning on going there while waiting to go to the airport on our last day. When we went to the spa after breakfast, we were told we had to pay a fee of 50â‚¬ to use the spa, since it was after checkout time. Hotel was probaby nice once upon a time, but I would recomend looking elsewere if staying in Stuttgart.
