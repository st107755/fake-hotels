Very clean, well-appointed hotel that with traditional, high standard customer service.  Front desk staff was helpful and accommodating.  The breakfast, if not in the room price, is pricey---but worth every euro.  The restaurant staff was also top notch.  The hotel restaurant is also worth a visit for dinner.
