The Steigenberger is located next to the main station, so it's an excellent choice if you’re visiting Stuttgart by train. It’s right in the city centre and therefore a perfect place from which to explore the city, do some shopping or eat at one of the close by restaurants. Nevertheless I have to say that there are better hotels in Stuttgart. It’s quite old fashioned and the dusty carpets make it almost impossible to sleep without opening the window at night. Service is ok but not overwhelmingly friendly, the room had a decent size and a nice view and the breakfast buffet was amazing. But all in all it didn’t live up to my expectations, its 5 star rating and its famous name. As I said, it could use refurbishment und the service at the reception desk wasn’t too good if not to say…
