Don’t get me wrong, the hotel isn’t bad...  It just doesn’t look like a 5-star hotel  Rooms are big and clean, but nothing special   Staff is nice  Location is very good  Breakfast is average. I have had much better breakfasts in other places I visited in Germany and Austria...  Again, not bad, but nothing more than enough!
