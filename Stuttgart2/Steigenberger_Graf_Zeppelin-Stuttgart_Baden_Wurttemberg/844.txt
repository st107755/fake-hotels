My husband and I stayed here last weekend during our first trip to Stuttgart. We were looking for a good hotel in a central location and we found the Graf Zeppelin ideal. We had no problem checking in early (we arrived about midday) and the staff were very helpful despite my limited German.   We'd booked an Avantgarde room, which was huge. As well as a big bedroom/living room and bathroom there was a separate vanity area and walk in wardrobe. We had requested a quiet room and were given a room on the top floor overlooking an office buliding - we heard no noise whatsoever throughout our stay.   Breakfast was included in our rate and it was good - there was plenty of choice from hot food to various breads and fruit.  The location was perfect - right across from the railway stationâ€¦
