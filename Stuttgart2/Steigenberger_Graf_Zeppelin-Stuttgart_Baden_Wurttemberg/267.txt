First time in Stuttgart so I did some internet research for an upscale hotel in a convenient location.  The Graf Zeppelin seemed to be the logical choice. I was very pleased with all aspects of the hotel - friendly service, excellent breakfast, spacious comfortable bedroom, and close walking distance to shops, restaurants and the central train station.  I recommend this hotel and am happy I selected it for my 4-day visit.
