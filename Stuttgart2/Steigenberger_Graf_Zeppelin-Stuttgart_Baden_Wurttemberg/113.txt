We only stayed one night between two days of train travel so the experience was fleeting and we got upgraded, which always biases one in favour of a hotel.  Not withstanding, everything was excellent from registering through checkout. The room was large with lots of wardrobe and shelf space, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room quiet.  The breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide choice and good quality.  Would definitely return if staying in Stuttgart in the future
