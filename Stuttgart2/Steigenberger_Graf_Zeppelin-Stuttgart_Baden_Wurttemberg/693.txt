Wow, were we ever impressed with this hotel.  You cannot find a better location in all of Stuttgart, as far as I'm concerned.  RIGHT by the Bahns (trains), just around the corner from shopping and convenience stores.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful.  Even the taxi drivers were nice.  there is a TON of construction going on in the area, but you can avoid that by going underground and taking the trains.  Go to Ludwigsburg and see the summer residence.  3.70EU each way per person. Totally worth it, and there are English tours a couple times per day.  The gardens are wonderful as well.    Back to the hotel.  The delicious buffet breakfast is only 9Eu each, which, by California standards for something similar is about half the price.  EVERYONE in the service industry speaksâ€¦
