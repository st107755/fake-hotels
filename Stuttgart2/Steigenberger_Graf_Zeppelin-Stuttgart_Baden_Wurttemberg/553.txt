this hotel is very centrally located just opposite the main station or stuttgart hauptbahnhof.. u can go anywhere from there..   the ambience is very clean contemporer and modern..   what i really like is they implanted the heater in the floor so it feels nice when u step into the bathroom your feet doesnt feel cold    downside is the bathroom is small and no bathtub  not many varieties in breakfast buffet.. continental one.. but the restaurant has a beautiful view overlooking the bahnhof
