An elegant, stylish and upmarket hotel ideally located close to the central railway station, ( across the road ) and Koenig Strasse the main shopping area in Stuttgart. The rooms are comfortable. I was in 519 and it was nice and quiet although it didn't have any in-room tea / coffee making facilities.
