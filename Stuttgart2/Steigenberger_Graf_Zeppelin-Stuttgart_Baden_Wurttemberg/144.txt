First room (Superior 130) was very disappointing. Tired decor, stained carpets, curtains & chair. Thin mattress, poor quality bed linen. Housekeeping requests very slow, took 3 calls to get second pillows. Luggage took 1hr 15mins to arrive after getting in our room. The wonderful Peggy in reception did rectify the following day and upgraded us to a far better room with an apology card & sweets. Just a shame we had to experience this initially but it did improve. Wonderful Breakfast though!
