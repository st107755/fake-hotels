It was a five star hotel located right beside the train station, which made travel a lot more convenient. The room was really spacious and I do love it. The breakfast was great and there are lots of choices at dinner as there are 2 or 3 restaurants inside the hotel. It was a short stay yet I felt comfortable in Steigenberger Stuttgart. However, it was really a little bit overpriced compared to other top hotels around Germany.
