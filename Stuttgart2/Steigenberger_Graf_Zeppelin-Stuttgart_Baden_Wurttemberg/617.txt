Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights. We visited Stuttgart due to family gathering. Very nice and friendly staff. Good breakfast. Please be sure to book with breakfast included in the room rate. Large rooms. Free low speed wifi. High speed wifi at cost, which is ridicoulus these days. Large double bed with space between mattresses was not romantic. Towels and bathrobes should be replaced in order to match the general high quality of the hotel. They are washed out and there is hardly any soft terry left.
