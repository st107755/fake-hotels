We stayed here with our three children in 2 rooms which were well designed providing plenty of room , fresh coffee maker, full bath and stand alone shower, big walk in robe, tv and lounge area and desk. Staff were incredibly helpful and great with the kids too.  The spa and pool area was gorgeous but be aware it is a "quiet space" , so was a little difficult for us to keep the kids from there usual noise level when swimming! The location is a short (2 min) walk to the train station and the same to local tourist office and main shopping precinct. Taxis directly outside hotel and local tour bus a 5 min walk. It was perfect!
