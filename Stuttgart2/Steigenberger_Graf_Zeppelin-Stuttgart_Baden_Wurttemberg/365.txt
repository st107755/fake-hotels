A stay of contrasts: Positive - spacious and clean room, excellent breakfast. Negative - appalling customer service (I had to wait 25 minutes to check in while all your staff fussed over a family of Americans; check out took 20 minutes; left waiting in the bar area before ordering a drink while your staff ignored us and chatted; terrible road noise - I couldnt sleep at all)
