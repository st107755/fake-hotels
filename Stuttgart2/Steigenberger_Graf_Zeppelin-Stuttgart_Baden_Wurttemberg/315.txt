We loved the stay at the Steigenberger Hotel. Comfy beds, which my daughter 8 years old loved too. We stayed nearly the whole time in the room with the bathrobe and slippers on. We used the swimming pool too, which was very relaxing. (a little to quiet for her) I would have stayed longer in the spa. We went to the bar  for 1 drink and listened to the live band, but again, this was more for adults. I wish I would have the same bed at home ........
