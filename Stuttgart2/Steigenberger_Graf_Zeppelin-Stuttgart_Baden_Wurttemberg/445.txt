arrived by train, short walk from train station, easy check-in.  departed to the Porsche factory/museum back in time for the most amazing meal at the Olivo gourmet restaurant.  An absolutely amazing meal, the plates served were so beautiful it was almost a same to devour them.  We took photos of every plate.  A wonderful finish to a full day.
