We stayed a couple of nights in June. We needed to catch a very early train to Frankfurt airport, the the location was ideal since the hotel is right by the station. Our room was very large and well equipped.  I don't think the hotel was very busy when we were there - the lobby area felt very empty and lacking a bit in atmosphere. Overall a nice hotel, nothing really stood out to make it particularly memorable or exciting.
