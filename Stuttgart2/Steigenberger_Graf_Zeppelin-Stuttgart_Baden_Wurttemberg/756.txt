My husband and I stayed in the hotel for 3 days. It was a good price-value investment, since the hotel is just 5 min walk from main train station and, therefore, in city center. Hotel's staff was friendly and helpful. The only minus point that the hotel does not have ergonomic pillows in "pillow menu", but that's a matter of personal preferences (if you are used to such, bring your own!). Hotel pool allows one to relax after a busy day. Spa treatments can also be booked, there is a sauna and gym.
