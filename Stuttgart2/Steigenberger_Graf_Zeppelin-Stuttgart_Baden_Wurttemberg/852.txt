We spent one night at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin and were quite disappointed.  The rooms are expensive for what you get.  Everything in the room looked worn and used.  The finish on the furniture was scuffed and faded.  The carpet was worn, and like a previous reviewer mentioned, the curtains had many holes.  The staff was not out-and-out rude, but they did act like we bothered them just by being there.  If you don't have breakfast included with your room it is 21 euro/person.  Considering what is offered for breakfast, the price is outrageous.  There are many places to grab a quick pastry within easy walking distance.  Good things:  The hotel is right across from the main train station which makes it convenient.  The room was very clean, and they did let us check-in early.â€¦
