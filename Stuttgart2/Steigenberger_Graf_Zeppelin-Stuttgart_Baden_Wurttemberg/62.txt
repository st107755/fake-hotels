Stayed in this hotel opposite the main railway station during a recent business trip to Stuttgart. Location is ideal, 2 mins from main station and the main shopping street. Bars and restaurants nearby. Also close to the State Park, ideal for jogging and cycling. Hotel staff efficient and friendly. Only thing missing is a kettle or coffee machine in the guest rooms, otherwise highly recommended!
