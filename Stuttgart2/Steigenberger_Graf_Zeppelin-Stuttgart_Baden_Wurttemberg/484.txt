For several years, I wanted to stay at the Graf Zeppelin, having lived in the area for four years. I was finally able to do so, and the wait was definitely worth it.  The hotel's location is excellent. t is literally right across the street from the Hauptbahnhof, and at the beginning of the Koenigstrasse, a pedestrian walkway, which goes past restaurants, shopping centers, and main historical sites. The hotel itself, was very reasonably priced for a five star hotel, and the staff was excellent. Many languages are spoken in the lobbies, and the staff are well-versed in them, especially English. I speak German, so it wasn't a problem for me, but the staff handled all languages with ease. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the shower and bathroom have to be seen toâ€¦
