Stayed one night.  It was a nice room and hotel.  Convenient to train station.  However, the A/C didn't get cold enough in the room.  I called to be sure I was working the thermostat right.  However, I was not going to call a technician at 11 PM (when we were in the room ready for bed), and the hotel was disinterested in offering anything to me.  It would be nice if they were proactive.
