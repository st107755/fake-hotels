This hotel is located right opposite the Stuttgart main train station. Just walk out the train station, look across the road to the right and there it is.  The rooms in the hotel are very spacious and clean and modern looking.  Have no complaints at all about the hotel. Would definitely stay there again if returning to Stuttgart.
