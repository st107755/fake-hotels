I stay at 5-star hotels 200 nights a year and I cannot recall the last time I have had such a poor experience: tiny smoker room on the first floor with towels and linen smelling badly, no basic amenities such as a coffee machine — and all for 399€. When I complained to reception, the manager on duty was at home and denied to take the call.  Clear recommendation: Go to Le Meridien or Schlossgarten if in Stuttgart!!!
