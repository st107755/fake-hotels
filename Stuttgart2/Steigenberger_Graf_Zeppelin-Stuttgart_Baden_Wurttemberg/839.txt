This is in a convenient position for arrival at the main railway station and underground from the airport. The room was comfortable and relatively quiet given the volume of traffic. The leisure suite was attractively laid out but the pool was too cold for comfort and seemed little used. The breakfast seemed expensive at â‚¬22 pp but there are plenty of alternatives nearby. The staff were friendly and efficient.
