Every comfort you could require in a hotel, and I stayed in the smallest room you could get, which still had plenty of space, was warm with great shower and not too pricey mini-bar.  The lobby is great for drinks, the breakfast plentiful and Olivios looked terrific although more for a romantic evening.  Take a swim if you get the chance, the pool is great.  Justa shame Stuttgart itself is so dull.
