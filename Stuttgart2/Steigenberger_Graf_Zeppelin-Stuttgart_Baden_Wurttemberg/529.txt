Nice hotel that I visite for the second time! very good location, nice athmospere, friendly staff. But poor quality of the food ordered through room service (3 times) although breakfast was just fine but at an unreasonnable price (26€). In the end, It was not really a very good value for money deal (150€ breakfast not included)
