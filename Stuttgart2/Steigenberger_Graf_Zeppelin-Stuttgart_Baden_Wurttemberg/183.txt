Being right across from the main train station and so close to Konigstrasse makes for easy access to anything you may want.  Shopping, dining, sight seeing, etc..  We enjoyed the pool and sauna.  The bar is small but is right inside the front doors so a good place to meet up before heading out.  Rooms were clean.  Beds not very comfortable and the pillows were very European (which to me means, FLAT).  We enjoyed our stay.
