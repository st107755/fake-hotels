Centrally located, well appointed hotel. Very handy to main railway station and shopping area. Good sized room with all amenities. Prompt efficient service by any staff we met. There is a Spa/Swimming pool but did not have a chance to use it. Pool looked quite small. Front entrance/reception looked quite dated and a little grubby but it is a city centre hotel.
