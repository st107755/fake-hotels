I arrived at the hotel at 2.15pm Staff didn't give me a room until after 4pm. I was travelling from Canada in a different time zone and all I wanted was a bed but I had to wait in the lobby for almost 2 hours. It was quite inconvenient. I had to keep checking with staff when would the room be available. They promised me a room first at 3pm then 30 minutes later and every time I had to go up and ask. I felt that the staff lacked the understanding and care. Rooms are great, location is great just have the same issue every time I arrive. This was my third time staying at the hotel.
