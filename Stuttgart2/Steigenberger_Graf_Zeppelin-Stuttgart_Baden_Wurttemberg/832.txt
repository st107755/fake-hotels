Had to spend one night here due to flight being rerouted from frankfurt.  So we were not in the best mood.  We told the taxi driver to take us to the best hotel in Stuttgart he made a wise choice.  The decor was quirky and modern, a bit scandinavian in feel, it was a big comfy bed and had good lighting.  The view was at the front of the hotel and we could see right up the hill of villas and vines.  We were just across the road from the station which was handy for the trip back to Frankfurt.  Room service breakfast was quite expensive, but of excellent quality.  We were a bit too tired for the bar, but it looked lively.
