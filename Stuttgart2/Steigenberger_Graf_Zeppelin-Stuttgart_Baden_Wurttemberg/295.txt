Lets start with the cost, it is pricey but it was a nice high standard hotel, with a lot of amenities. The hotel did have a somewhat business feel to it but if you have been to Germany before thats kind of standard. Housekeeping team need to calm down, they barged in on my daughter twice at 08.30!! So put your tag on the door if you sleep in past 09.00?  Drinks and food again were of a very high standard but again unfortunately it was on the dear side, Zeppalinos was particularly good food and worth a visit. Its well situated for shopping and the station. We got a taxi from the airport (circa 35 euros). All in all very good hotel with excellent amenities although i cant comment on the leisure center as i spent my time in the town or in the bar.
