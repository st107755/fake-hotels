Just spent 2 nights here whilst visiting the Porsche museum/factory and Mercedes museum.  Brilliant location right by the underground. Excellent staff nothing's to much trouble, fabulous breakfast and quiet room as sound proofing is very good even though the hotel is on a main road. Would definitely stay there again
