This is a beautiful hotel and in the perfect location., just steps from the train station and the largest/longest pedestrian mall. The hotel looks "old" on the outside, but it is gorgeous inside. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We had the buffet breakfast each morning and it was better than most buffets. Being so close to the pedestrian mall made it easy to stroll, stop for a meal or drink and enjoy the atmosphere.  Especially nice was that there was a laundromat on that mall and it was great to be able to wash a few things. We would most definitely go back there.
