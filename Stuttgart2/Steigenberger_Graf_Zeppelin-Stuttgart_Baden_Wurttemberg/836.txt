Really nice hotel. I have been staying here on and off for years, whenever I'm in Stuttgart and I would recommend it. Location is fantastic for the main station and shopping. A bit of trivia- If VfB Stuttgart are playing at home, the away team often stay here so if you time it right you might run into a footballer in the bar. The staff in general are very friendly and always greet you enthusiastically. There was one grumpy chap in the bar who didn't seem happy about having to make the effort to serve drinks, but you pretty much have to accept that in Germany- the land that customer service forgot. The atmosphere is quite quiet. It's a massive hotel but it never feels full. You don't see a lot of other guests at breakfast or in the bars, etc. Rooms are modern style rather thanâ€¦
