Location is good, breaffast is good and staff is professionnal and friendly! But I have to say that there was a problem with my shower the whole stay, first the rainy shower never worked and one day even the regular shower did not work too and I couldn't take my shower and when they fixed it, pressure was unacceptable for this standard of hotel.
