We stayed here for one night in July 2017. We took a train from Paris directly to Stuttgart and Steigenberger had an amazing location just across the street from the train station. It was close to the local shops, restaurants and square. We arrived very early before regular check in time but I had contacted them previously so they knew. A room was ready and they upgraded us for our anniversary which was very nice. The front desk staff were amazing! So helpful and nice. The room was perfect. It took me a second to realize the lights didn't go on without the card in the slot next to the door but that was just my ignorance ha. Bed was very comfortable and room was quiet. They held our bags in the morning until our afternoon train and it was a great place to relax with a drinkâ€¦
