This was our third stay in as many years at this hotel. We again booked the junior suite and it again was a wonderful spacious, clean room with an excellent well equipped bathroom. The staff were friendly and attentive as we have always found them to be. The gym and pool are well maintained. The location of this hotel cannot be better, just metres away from the centre of the city. It was nice to see the addition of free internet access since our last stay, but unfortunately it was very slow. This is the only aspect of this hotel that does not meet the standard across Germany. But this is a minor point and it will in no way stop us staying here again for years to come.
