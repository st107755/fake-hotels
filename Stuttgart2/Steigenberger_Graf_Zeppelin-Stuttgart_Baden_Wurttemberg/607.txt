Located near the train station and pedestrian walk, this is a fantastic hotel. A modern, clean and quiet hotel that has provided us with the best beds so far in Europe. Spacious and comfortable rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. This hotel has become the standard by which we've judged all others on our trip.
