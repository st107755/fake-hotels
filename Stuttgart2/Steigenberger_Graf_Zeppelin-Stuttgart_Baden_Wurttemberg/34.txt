This was as expected of a 5Star hotel. Staff were great, location is perfect, it’s very clean, good bar, etc But For a 5star, you don’t even have tea or coffee facilites in your room ( we were in a suite too)!  Secondly you can open the windows or control to aircond, so it was stinking hot in our room at night.  We got NO sleep. I expected a bit more.......oh well
