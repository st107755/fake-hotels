The hotel was luxurious, the staff went above and beyond. Their mastery of English as a second language was evident. They offered all the details that American travelers look for such as washcloths, which are missing from many European accommodations.  Beautiful lounges, very nice bar, and delightful onsite restaurant experience. In short, a wonderful way to finish up our European trip, and a 20 minute cab ride from the airport. Highly recommend!
