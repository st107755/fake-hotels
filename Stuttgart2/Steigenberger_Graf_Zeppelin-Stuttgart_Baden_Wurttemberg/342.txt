Great place to stay. Good food and bar (didn't eat in restaurant though), good quality room. They were not too busy so I received a free jr suite upgrade. Spacious, modern, only the aircon didn't do the job for heating the room so well. Building is quite ugly on the outside, but this is Stuttgart, so I didn't mind. Much uglier places around. Good efficient service. Next time I will be back.
