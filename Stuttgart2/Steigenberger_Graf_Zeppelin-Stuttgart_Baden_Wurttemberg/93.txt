The hotel itself is like a faded 5 star hotel in the town centre.  The room was nice and spacious but the facilities a little worn.  The food was horrible - very average bufffet and we saw a mouse in the dining room.  When we told the waitress she laughed and said ‘what you scared of a little mouse!’  Average hotel, average service - I’d stay at their meridian round the corner.
