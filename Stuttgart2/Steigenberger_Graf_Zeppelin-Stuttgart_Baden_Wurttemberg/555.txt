This is said to be the leading hotel of Stuttgart however I would rate it less good than LE Meridien but the location is really good.   Rooms a nice and large but the rooms are a bit older. In a good condition but but more the style of 20 years ago. The beds where really not what I expect from a 5* Steigenberger hotel. Just small single beds, low. In such hotel I expect good quality queen or king size beds with proper coil matras. Also the rooms can be a bit noisy despite good soundproof windows. Opposit of the train station there are always police cars and construction noise.   Breakfast was really very good and worthwhile with a nice view on the trainstation and hills behind.
