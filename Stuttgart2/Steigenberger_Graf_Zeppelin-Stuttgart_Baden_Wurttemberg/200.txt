We were only in Stuttgart for three nights but we are so pleased that we chose to stay here.  It is so very convenient for the station (we arrived and left by train) and is ideally situated for exploring the Old Town as well as for getting taxis to visit some of the more 'out of town' attractions.  Our room was spotless and wonderfully quiet and the separate walk-in shower was a real bonus.  All the staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel so welcome.  If anyone is interested, there is also a Cigar Bar just off the lobby.  We only ate once at the hotel, in Zeppelino's, and had a most enjoyable meal.  One Steigen"burger" which was delicious and one fillet steak.  The steak was ordered "blue" and arrived "blue" which was very much appreciated - so often " blue" isâ€¦
