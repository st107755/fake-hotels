I onyl stayed at Graf Zeppelin so can't really judge the service but the cleanliness and spaciosuness of the room, and variety at breakfast were good. Above all , the hotel is right across the street from the train station and right next to the main shopping street . So whether in Stuttgart to stay or looking to travel around the area, this hotel is a perfect fit.
