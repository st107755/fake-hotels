I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the S bahn as I needed to travel to the Messe for a trade show. Its also well located for city restaurants, shops etc. The room was comfortable and well fitted out although the bathroom was too small. Breakfast is served in an attractive room with plenty of light and a good view and the choice is wide although an omelette I ordered was horribly overcooked, really no excuse in a hotel of this supposed class.  The pool/spa area is great - very relaxing, good sized warm pool with attractive lighting and sauna fine too.  Service was generally pretty good so recommended although pillows were very soft.
