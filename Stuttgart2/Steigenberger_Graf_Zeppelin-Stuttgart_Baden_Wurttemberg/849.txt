Stayed for 2 nights for a Take That concert and got a rate of €125 room only (breakfast would've been a further €21 per person but we didn't partake). Room was fine and had all you need. Bed was comfy, bathroom was nice and the TV had English channels. Bar in the lobby was inviting and the barman multilingual and friendly. Location is great -- just opposite the main station and 5 minutes from the main shopping drag on Königstrasse. The hotel may look like a concrete box from the outside but it is fine inside.
