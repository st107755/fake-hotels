First time staying in hotel in downtown Stuttgart.  By looking outside of the hotel, you wouldn't know how nice it is inside.  The reception and the concierge staffs were very friendly.  We were travelling with a 9 year old child on 12.07 (one day before the world cup final).   Actually we booked the deluxe room but we got the upgrade to "Junior suites" because they told that we would have more space for our kid.  First of all, this hotel doesn't charge extra for the 9 year old kid with extra bed and also giving us the upgrade.  How nice!!  Room is so spacious and very nice decorated.     Very short walk to the shopping area and restaurant.  Great facilities!!  Really nice pool area!!   This is going to be only the hotel we will stay if we're going back to Stuttgart again and weâ€¦
