We were in Stuttgart for a Mercedes European delivery.  We were offered a free night at this hotel as part of the program. We toured the Mercedes factory and took delivery.  The Graf Zeppelin is located in town across from the train station. There is a major pedestrian, shopping area a block from the hotel. The rooms were modern and large. Service was excellent and all front desk employees seemed to speak very good English.  They offer a garage parking facility and the breakfast buffet was very lavish. I cannot rate the value for the money since Mercedes paid for everything except the parking - so, I have not one complaint.
