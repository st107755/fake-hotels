We had a wonderful stay over the bank holiday weekend, the room was very spacious, with large bathroom, seperate closet area, with a large desk/work area.  The breakfast was wonderful, and the service and front desk staff were exceptional in their friendly welcoming nature.  The hotel is in a great position, has its own pool and a 12 o'clock checkout.  I am disapointed I could not get booked back in to this hotel when I return in September.
