We were travelling through Europe for the Christmas Markets and we stopped in Stuttgart.  This hotel is super convenient to the train station being right across the street.   The lobby and public areas of the hotel are quite lovely.  The superior room we had was really small and has seen better days.   I believe however that they are renovating rooms and we happened to get one of the old ones.   The bed was not the most confortable but I believe that the newer rooms would be better.  We would return to this hotel but would make sure to get a renovated room.  The staff is terrific...most helpful and inviting.   Stuttgart in general is a great city and we would visit again if the chance arose.  The Christmas Markets in Stuttgart were outstanding....great food, fantasticâ€¦
