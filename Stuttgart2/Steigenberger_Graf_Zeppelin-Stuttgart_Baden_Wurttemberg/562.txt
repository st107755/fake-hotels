Visited the hotel this week whilst away on a business trip with work. The hotel was very nice! Staff very friendly, room very clean and laid out very well.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! I would also highly recommend the city of Stuttgart to anyone thinking of travelling there , particularly if you are going in October. Go to the beer festival!  What an experience
