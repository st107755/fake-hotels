We stayed at Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin for 2 nights to enjoy the Christmas markets.  The location is fairly central and ideal for discovering the town.  We chose this hotel for its location and parking facilities, but as we didn't use the spa or pool it was probably not our best choice in terms of price. The rooms are well equipped and well maintained. Staff were very friendly and willing to help. On site parking is available at a charge in the hotels underground car park,  which for us was ideal.   Worth noting the Wifi was good.  We didn't try the breakfast, we generally prefer a local caf√©.  On our departure the hotel supplied bottled water free of charge for our journey home.
