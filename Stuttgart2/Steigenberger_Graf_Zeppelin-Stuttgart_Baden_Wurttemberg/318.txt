As I did not know what to expect I was positively surprised in all aspects. It started with a ver friendly and warm welcome, lovely room that was very large, cosy, and warm. A nice welcome treat was already set up. The bed was ver very comfortable with a great selection of pillows in various sizes. Amazing how sound proof the windows are. You realise that when you open one... Breakfast was fabulous so was the dinner (steak).  Will be back.
