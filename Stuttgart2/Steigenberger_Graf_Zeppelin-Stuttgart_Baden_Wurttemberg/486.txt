The Steinberger Graf Zeppelin is an extremely comfortable and friendly hotel conveniently located near to Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) Check in was painless and the staff were both friendly and informative. We shared a couple of jokes which settled us giving us the impression it was a friendly and professional hotel. The rooms are both spacious and very well furnished. The rates are very reasonable for a 5 star hotel. The pool, situated on the 5th floor, was extremely clean but unfortunately the sauna was not operational in the morning. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would return.
