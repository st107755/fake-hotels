Everything was perfect but one thing! Wifi  It is unacceptable in 2018 for a hotel like this one to have such a problematic internet connection  You have to connect almost every time you come back to the hotel which also requires a certain process that takes time The worst part though is the actual speed . . it literally takes for ever to just open a page !
