I had a superior room, which was spacious, nicely decorated and everything felt brand new (I think it was as it has recently been refurbished). Lovely bathroom (could have been a little bigger but was ok) with a nice shower with a big showerhead. Location is great, opposite the main train station, very close to all the shops
