It turns out the Graf Zeppelin was a real guy who built airships. And there's also this hotel named after him, adjacent to the main train station in Stuttgart. It's a comfortable and convenient spot in the middle of town, with a great bathroom and shower! Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's quite nice inside.
