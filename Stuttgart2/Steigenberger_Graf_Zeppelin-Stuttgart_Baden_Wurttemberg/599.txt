This is one of the two hotels offered by Porsche when taking european delivery. The delivery is highly recommended. Here's a few things about the hotel.  The hotel is neither at Porsche HQ nor is it close to the airport. It's right next to the train station which was handy for us as we arrived by train from Paris. It's convenient to the old downtown which starts right at the train station.  Service and breakfast were excellent. We stayed for two nights. One was paid by Porsche, the other was on us. We had a free upgrade to a very large room with a very large modern bathroom. Cannot say what the room we paid for would be like.  We took a look at the pool, the sauna, and the gym. Didn't use any of that, but these things looked well done and very clean.  The only real negative inâ€¦
