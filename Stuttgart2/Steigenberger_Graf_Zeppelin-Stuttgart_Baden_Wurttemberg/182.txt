A gathering of friends from around the world for a 'Special' Birthday. Treatment by the friendly and polite staff was brilliant. Our suite was just perfect - great views, comfortable, spacious and well stocked mini bar. Easy access to the train station, especially for the Bier Festival. Easy access to shops and delightful restaurants. Lovely City - Will definitely stay again next year.
