Staff was nice, but room hadn't been cleaned good. A toothpick and three plastic clothing tags on the floor when we arrived in our room.  Instead of giving us a different room, housekeeping was dispatched to vacuum. Their vacuum had an automatic air freshener release.  Not easy to breath if you have allergies to artificial fresheners.  Partially drank beverages from previous guest(s) in the minibar refrigerator. One beverage had what appeared to be mold forming in it.   The shower door didn't close tight which resulted in a wet bathroom floor.
