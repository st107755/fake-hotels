This hotel was perfect in absolutely every way.  Perfect staff interactions.  They were very helpful.  Easy checkin.  Wonderful proximity to the Weihnachtsmarkt.   The spa was absolutely amazing.  The sauna was a bit small but the gorgeous pool area easily made up for it.   I highly recommend the breakfast.  It was more than worth the price!
