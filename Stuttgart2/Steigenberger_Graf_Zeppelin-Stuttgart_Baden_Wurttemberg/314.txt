The room was tiny, but the worst bit was the bathroom. The sink was cracked and the shower flooded the whole bathroom floor no matter how careful we were. The evening 'tuck down' was around 5pm - before we showered for the evening. We needed the towels to mop up the bathroom floor, so no dry towels on our return or for the next morning! Housekeeping were totally unconcerned when we complained and asked for more towels. The 'bar' space was next to the front door and was usually full of people (and their luggage) waiting to take the train to the airport and making use of the free wi-fi. No residents only space. We complained and were told that the manager would be in touch - still waiting. We chose this hotel as we have stayed in Steinberger hotels in other places in Germany,â€¦
