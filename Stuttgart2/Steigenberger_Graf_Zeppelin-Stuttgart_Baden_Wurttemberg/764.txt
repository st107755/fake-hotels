I was travelling on business and with all hotels near the Messe fully booked my next choice was close to the main railway station. I wasn't disappointed as it was right opposite. The building has a presence to it and looks a bit stark for the outside but don't let that put you off as inside its just class. A warm welcome from the staff and very efficient check in, the lobby was instantly welcoming, resisting the temptation of the lobby bar , the standard room was huge and immaculate. Very well laid out and with everything you would want and more. The hotel is right next to the main shopping street and the large city park , the theatre is only 5 mins walk away. If I was travelling for fun I would certainly pick this again. The three hotel restaurants , one with a Michelin starâ€¦
