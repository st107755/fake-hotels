Stayed at the Graf Zeppelin from 28 July 2013 - 6 August 2013.  I found this hotel to be in a prime location in downtown across the street from the main train station (Hauptbahnhoff).  It's also very close and convenient to the main shopping street (KÃ¶nigstrasse) as well.  The staff were very friendly and very helpful.  The is definitely a 5* hotel with 5* service.  I would not hesitate to stay here again if given the opportunity.
