I stayed at the hotel in April this year and only got to compliment it now. It's a hotel that deserves all praise, amazing staff, a real assett. Every single person in this hotel is so attentive and seems to be there only for you.  Nice and clean design and amazing in room/welcome amenities. Amazing breakfast buffet, wide choice of everything. Me being a 'healthy' eater, I could not wish for more.
