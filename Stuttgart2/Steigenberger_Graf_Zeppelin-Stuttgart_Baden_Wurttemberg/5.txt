This hotel is slightly higher priced, but it is directly across the street from the train station, making connecting to any direction very easy.  It is close to restaurants and the hotel bartenders are delightful.  All the hotel staff was friendly and helpful to answer any and all questions we had, not being able to deal in the native language.
