I often stay at this hotel. The staff is extremely professional and the facilities clean, the hotel fully equipped, and the pool a perfect place for a morning swim. The best part of the stay is the wonderful breakfast buffet. Can not beat that. Continue the great hosting of local and foreign guests!
