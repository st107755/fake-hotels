Stayed here as I had an early train the next day. Great location opposite the train station. Hotel is what you would expect of  4-5 stay hotel, room was large and very comfortable. I used the gym which is very basic but still ok for a work out.  I was shocked at the prices for dinner and breakfast so decided to eat outside the hotel, highly recommend Restaurant called FIVE, only 5 min walk from hotel.  If you are looking for nice hotel next to the train station then you cant go past this hotel.
