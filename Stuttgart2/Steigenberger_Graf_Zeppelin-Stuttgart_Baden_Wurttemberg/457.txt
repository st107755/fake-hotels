Classically Smart German and a bit dated - rooms have an 80's decor feel but all very clean and no complaints. Onsite parking is easy to access and use. Bistro serves outstanding quality steaks. Wifi works very well in rooms and other areas. Actually all very good and staff very friendly. The hotel is right in the city centre but only 15 minutes from the airport and Messe. Sound insulation against road noise and traffic is excellent. Highly recommendable. Only the slightly dated rooms leave it a tad down on a full 5 star rating.
