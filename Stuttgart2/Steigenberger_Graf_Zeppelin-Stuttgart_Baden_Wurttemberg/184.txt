Having made and paid for a booking in May 2017 I was most disappointed to be contacted by my Travel company 8 hours before driving to the airport to be informed that the hotel was overbooked and that my room was no longer available!  We had previously stayed at this hotel and left a glowing review and as my travel companion is an amputee it was picked to avoid having to walk to far to the station.  We were left with the option of a lesser quality hotel with a longer walk to the station with 2 different trains to get to our destination, or cancel our trip for a refund and face the loss of our associated costs.  Whilst I have no other information than the hotel overbooked the rooms, I find it hard to believe that this was only realised the night before, either that or there isâ€¦
