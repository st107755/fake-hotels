Rooms are old . Minibar was not working . Even there was no Champagne , classic White / Red wines in the minibar . The safe was located in a very high position in the room , i am 1.78 meteres but i need to be 1.90 m minimum to see what i left in the safe box . The sauna was absolutely cold at 09.00 in the morning .  The romote of the TV was not working properly in the room . Overall , when you compare with the same 5 star hotels ... sorry but Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin lost ...
