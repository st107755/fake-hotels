Ordered online and by mistake instead of Stuttgart booked the hotel in Munich with full payment . When I realized this, I was very upset. However the hotel Manager kindly agreed to book me a hotel in Stuttgart and it can be free to cancel my mistaken reservation in Munich, which allowed to save about 1000 euros.
