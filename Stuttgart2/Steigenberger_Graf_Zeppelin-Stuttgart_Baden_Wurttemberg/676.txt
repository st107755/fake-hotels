I did not like the hotel overall . I stayed one night .The hotel is close to the main train station and shopping street(konigstrasse). Room was big enough but from the entrance of it there was an unpleasant odor , perhaps originating from the bath. (pipes?,bathtube?,?...)   and  could never use the internet.it was very very very very...slow.
