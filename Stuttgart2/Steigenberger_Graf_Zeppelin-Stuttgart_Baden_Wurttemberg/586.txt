Excellently located opposite the Hbf. 2 minutes to the main shopping street.   The streets around the hotel are a little dirty and make you feel a little intimidated.  Didn't eat or drink at the hotel but it looked very nice if that's what you choose.  Room was spotlessly clean and very spacious.  Air con didn't really work very well (it was between 25 to 34 degrees outside).  Pillows were a challenge as many continental ones are buit extras were brought immediately on request.  Free Internet was desperately slow but 4G signal on phone was fine.  Happy to stay again.
