The hotel is located in front of Stuttgartâ€™s main train station und easy to access by public transport. The room is very comfortable and although the hotel is in a rather noisy area, it is really quiet at night. Moreover staff were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay at Steigenberger Graf von Zeppelin very much.
