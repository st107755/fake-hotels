On my recent visit to Germany I stayed Overnight at this hotel.It is luxurious,located very near to the main train station and the main shopping area. Rooms are modern and comfortable with nice furniture.Clean and hygenic. Help desk staff,very very helpful. Food was good. Will recommend it strongly.
