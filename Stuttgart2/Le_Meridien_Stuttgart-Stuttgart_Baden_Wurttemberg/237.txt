The hotel itself was very nice. I have stayed here multiple times and the rooms are updated and clean. Staff is very friendly.   However, to get into the center of Stuttgart you must walk across an overpass over the highway. On the other side of the overpass it is very dark and as a female alone at night this can be a bit scary and there can be people just hanging out up and it can feel unsafe. With that being said, it is a short walk to the city center which makes the hotel ideally located.   The breakfast buffet is expensive but delicious.   The spa itself was a bit lacking in amenities but I received a good massage.
