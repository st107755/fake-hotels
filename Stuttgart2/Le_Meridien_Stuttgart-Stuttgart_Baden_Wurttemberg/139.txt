The hotel is what you expect from that level: nothing bad, mostly great and some little flaws, nothing great. That is a good place to stay if you come for work. The spa is wonderful, large, with a great pool and a good service. The massage was good and well priced. Food and beverage were flawless. The underground carpark is very convenient.
