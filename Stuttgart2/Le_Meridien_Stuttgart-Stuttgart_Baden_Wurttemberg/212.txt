I stayed at this hotel during a Sunday and the place and location is perfect. The rooms are beautifully decorated, the service is excellent,  the fitness center and spa in excellent conditions.  Overall,  is a great hotel.  You can walk to the Schlossplatz square and enjoy the site seeing for a couple of hours.  The Mercedes museum is within 15 min drive.  There is a good French restaurant just outside the hotel.  Breakfast options are very good. I strongly recommend this hotel.
