We stayed in the Hotel for 1 night. It took me by surprise. Stuttgart is in general very industrial town and I was expecting hotel located very closely by train station (about 10 minutes walking distance) to match the same type of scenery as general surroundings - in our case - loads of brick buildings, road works, etc. It was a little bit hard to find an access to the hotel from the Station as there's a construction works in park which separates it, but easy enough we managed - also there's a metro stop just 2 minutes outside the place to travel to the centre (0-5 minutes total journey) or other.  As mentioned - hotel surprised me with it's overall posh atmosphere -  we arrived in the evening witnessing some other guests dressed in some stunning dresses passing buy as well nextâ€¦
