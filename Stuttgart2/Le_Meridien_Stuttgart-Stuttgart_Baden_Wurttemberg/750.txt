We got a nice rate here from Expedia - requested an extra bed for our 5 year old - no problem (and no add'l charge).  This hotel is like a Westin in the USA - modern, great bed, hi-tech.  Flat screen TVs in rooms, great a/c, very nice bathrooms.  Location is fantastic.  Highly recommended.   Also, there's a great bakery behind the hotel - easy walk for breakfast.  Go up the stairs, then take a soft right on Urban Strasse.  A few doors down on the right.
