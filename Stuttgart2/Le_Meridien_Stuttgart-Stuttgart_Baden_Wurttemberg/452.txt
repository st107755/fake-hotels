I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this delightful hotel. The front desk staff were very helpful indeed assisting all of my needs whilst staying in Stuttgart. My only gripe... is that that the bed could be a little longer, being 6ft I didn't expect my feet to hang out the end & the pillows also offered little support. Otherwise, all in all a very pleasant experience & should I return to Stuttgart I will defiantly consider staying here again.
