This was a welcoming place and the staff very friendly. The rooms seem to have been recently upgraded with attention to detail for the tourist. Positives, friendly staff, quiet rooms,easy walk from the main Stuttgart station, nice food in the  bar and a nice ambience. There was a sauna which we didn't use. My only criticism is the area. You have to walk through a construction wasteland to get there and at night I felt uncomfortable as many youths loitering. I was glad I was with my big,burly husband. I don't think I'd like it if I was a single woman travelling alone. The only other criticism is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but the staff quickly addressed this on request and provided a kettle and real milk which was nice. I would stay here gain but in a fewâ€¦
