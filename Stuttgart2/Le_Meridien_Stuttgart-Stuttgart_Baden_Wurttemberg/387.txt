Hotel is very central a few minutes from the central station, the front rooms are facing the building site of Stuttgart 21 for the political interested, but are also fairly quite, the room to the back are very quite and facing the houses in the back.  room are large and well equipped, there are no tea and coffee making facilities, but I called the hotel in advance since I had to be able to make myself some tea and they placed a water cooker in my room. But there is is also no free internet which is a bit on the downside and Meridien hotels should change this. The spa is quite nice, but the water temperature in the pool is quite cold.  However, I cannot praise enough the politeness and helpfulness of the reception staff. Room service is excellent and food quite outstanding. â€¦
