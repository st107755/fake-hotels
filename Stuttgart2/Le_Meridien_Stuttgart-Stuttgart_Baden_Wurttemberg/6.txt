We stayed at the hotel Le Meridien for one night and had to write this review about the professionalism of the staff. From the bell hop, to the check-in, to the waitress at lunch, in the bar, to the wonderful concierge who helped us with local dinner reservations, Gotz Riedel, we couldnâ€™t been more satisfied. We also had an issue with our room safe and a technician was available in 5 minutes. The room was clean and housekeeping was delightful and obviously works hard.  Many thanks for a comfortable stay.
