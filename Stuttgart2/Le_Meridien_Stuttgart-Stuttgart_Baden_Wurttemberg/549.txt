After a trip to Germany and France where I stayed in several 4 and 5 star hotels, this was by far the worst among them all. The location of the hotel is good, close to the downtown shopping area, but the hotel itself is old and a bit beaten up. The rooms are small. And everything you need over the regular bed and linen is for money and is way over priced. Luckily I only had to stay there for only two nights. I must say though that the staff was very friendly and professional. Maybe if I was just visiting this hotel by itself I would have given it 4 stars, but compared to the hotels I stayed at in Mainz, Cologne, and Strasbourg, the best I could rate it is 3 stars. I will definitely be looking for another hotel next time I am in Stuttgart.
