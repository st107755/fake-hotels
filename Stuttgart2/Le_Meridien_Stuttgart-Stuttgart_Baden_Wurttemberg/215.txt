We stayed at this hotel just before Xmas.  We got on a train to another city and left our passports in the room safe at Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart.  When we contacted the staff at the hotel they could not have been more helpful. They completely understood our predicament and quickly couriered our passports to us.This enabled us to fly home in time for Christmas.  We cannot thank you enough.  Hotel was very nice and central to everything. Main station is 5-10 mins walk.
