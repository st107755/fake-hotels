It's a nice hotel. The lobby is very dark. Location is great in relation to the pedestrian shopping zone and the Christmas market as well as the main train station. Room is nice but the temperature controller seems its for show only as it doesn't regulate the temperature in the room, so it was difficult to get a good night sleep as it was way too hot and with the window open it became a hot /cold duvet on /off kinda night. Their restaurant and room service menu on all three cases are dismal. Asian choices and international fare but no German options at all. Very disappointing.
