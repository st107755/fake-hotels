It has been three years since my last stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart and as expected I had another wonderful visit (4 nights).  While there have been quite a few cosmetic changes in color and decor, one thing remains constant.  From check in to check out, every staff person I encountered (front desk, concierge, restaurant, spa) was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and courteous. The rooms are wonderful: very clean and well-appointed with new pillow selection and luxurious bedding, comforters/duvets.  The free Wi-Fi and computer usage in the Business Center came in handy and I highly recommend the buffet breakfast (fresh fruit, juices, wide assortment of bread and pastries, bacon, eggs, and fresh honey from the hotel’s own beehive!) – a great way to start the day!
