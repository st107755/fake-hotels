Stayed here for two nights on a journey in mainland Europe.  Staff were very friendly on reception and service areas, they could not do enough for you.  Room was lovely clean and modern, pity about the building site outside, that was not their fault though!  The bar food and drinks were excellent, if a little expensive but you must expect that in a hotel of this calibrate in a major city centre.  The only reason that I have not given top marks is that my wife and daughter wanted some treatments in the spa, only manicure but was told that they were fully booked for the next 4 days? The guy was quite rude about it, as if to say well you should expect this but when you get into a hotel like this you would hope that they can accommodate guests at some point as we were extremelyâ€¦
