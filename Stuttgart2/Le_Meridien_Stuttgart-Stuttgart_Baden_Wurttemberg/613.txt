Top quality hotel - but expensive.  Good location close to the Altstadt with pay parking.  The hotel appears to be opposite a pleasant park - however be aware that there is a six-lane boulevard (motorway) between the hotel and it. If you can get a reasonable deal (including breakfast) this is a great place to stay in Stuttgart. Le Cassoulet restaurant - see separate review - is not great value - better walk into Altstadt which is only 10-15 minutes.
