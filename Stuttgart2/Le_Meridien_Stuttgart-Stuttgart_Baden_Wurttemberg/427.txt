This is a nice hotel. The rooms and interior design is basic - compared to other Le Meridien hotels. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The front desk is very helpful - walked me thru the train system and places to see with appropriate suggestions. The attached restaurants on the terrace are friendly and good food. Breakfast and internet were not included in the price - so after including them, I felt the hotel was pricey. Location - its a 10 min walk to the train station and well connected.  There are several bistros and eating places. Most dont take credit card, including the ones in the train station.
