I frequent the SPG brands, and Le Meridien is one of the better ones. However, this property in Stuttgart routinely does not provide exec rooms or upgrades to SPG-Platinum members. I'm 0 for 3 now, and even when there is space showing on the website, they say they are full. I am not one to press, if they don't provide the upgrade that is fine. I booked a king and was given twins....just not impressed after this stay.   The room service was very fast and quite good. The bar/restaurants were also quite good for hotel food. Nothing special, but certainly good if you don't feel like walking.   Try to get a room that does not face the street. It can be quite noisy.
