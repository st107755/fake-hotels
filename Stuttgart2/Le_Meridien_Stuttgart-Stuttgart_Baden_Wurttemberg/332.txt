Spacious, good facilities, the rooms were a little tired, net curtains were a little dirty, cheap pillows etc but the overall Service was very good along with the food.   Location ok but very noisy traffic and lots of construction going on outside/all day.   Overall a decent hotel but could be better for a 5* with some updated rooms...
