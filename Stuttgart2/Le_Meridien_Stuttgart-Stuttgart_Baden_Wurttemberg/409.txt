Enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien.  The hotel is easy to get to from the train station - about 10 to 15 minute walk.  The rooms were modern and clean.  We also had nightcaps in the bar area.  Service was good there.  The only drawback is that the WIFI was not included in the price of the room and was also not complimentarily available in the lobby.
