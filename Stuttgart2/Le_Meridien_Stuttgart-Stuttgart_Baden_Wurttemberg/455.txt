We've been to this hotel several times now and service has been very high consistently. The only disappointment so far was a dusty wash table in the bath room.  We could not decide yet about the best part: the spa and pool area or the breakfast. For me the location was ideal. I could imagine that people who mainly are right in the center of town find it a bit too far off.  I've been here on business trips as well as on family vacation.
