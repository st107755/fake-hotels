We chose the Meridien over the town's leading Hotel am Schlossgarten and think on balance it offered good value. It's easy to get to from the main station, the lobby area is elegant and the room was modern, clean and bright. We had access to the lounge which was a major disappointment as it was small with space for no more than eight couples; hot soup is offered at 6pm which is good but the absence of any other snacks felt odd. The free minibar was a godsend however. Excellent if rather busy (but then it was Easter) breakfast. Not keen on the look of the property - rather like a Holiday Inn from the outside and the location means walking across the park at night after dinner which is not ideal.
