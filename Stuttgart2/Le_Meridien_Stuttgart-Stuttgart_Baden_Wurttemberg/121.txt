It is a great staff in that hotel very friendly. That is a big plus. The rooms are great but a little old like all hotel. I got some suite and was huge , with great space and smell :))) the shower ok and the bed very big and good comfort. I like that hotel. The gym open 24h and there are 4 treadmills so it is good
