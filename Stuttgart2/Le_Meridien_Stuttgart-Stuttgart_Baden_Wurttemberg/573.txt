Nice hotel although a little tired at the edges. Rooms could do with a freshen up. The most unfortunate thing about this hotel is the location: right on a 6 lane highway, the walk to the city centre is either through some wasteland which apparently used to be a park, or along the highway. (When did Germany stop tending their public parks?)  The view from the rooms on the road side is over the highway and said wasteland, great if you are a car spotter! On a plus us side, the windows are very effectively sound-proofed so noise was not a problem, but don't even think about opening a window.  The staff were, without exception, very helpful and friendly, and only too keen to see some guests as the hotel seemed almost empty. The hotel restaurant wasn't offering a restaurant serviceâ€¦
