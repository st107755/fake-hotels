Delicious brunch - well worth the three week wait.    We called on a Friday, to get reservations for that Sunday.  They were booked that Sunday already, and the next one. We made a reservation for the third Sunday.    There were freshly a chucked oysters, perfectly prepared asparagus with Hollandaise, everything I tried was good.  I left fulfilled but not stuffed & happy from the Sekt.
