Location, staff, room, service excellent. One reason for choosing the hotel was the gym facilities, but disappointingly we were told that the gym had no A/C due to the Spa below??? Equipment is of good quality but being so warm (even during the cold weather) it made my run even harder! It may not be an important issue for most but I need to work out regularly and I expected the Gym (in a 5 star hotel) to be above the standard of less prominent chains. I wouldn't return due to this single issue.....
