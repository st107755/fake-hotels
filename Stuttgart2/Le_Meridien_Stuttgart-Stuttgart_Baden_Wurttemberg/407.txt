Had a recent two night stay on a business trip as part of a group. Very professional staff, always attentive without being intrusive. Superb breakfast buffet. Room was in good order. Very quite and not the usual "hotel Hum" I hate. It is on a busy road but I didn't find it a problem. Would recommend to professionals.
