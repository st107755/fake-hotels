We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff was very professional. The room was a nice size and very comfortable. Neat picture on the wall that lit up from inside. Great soundproofing in windows, which overlooked a busy street but nothing could be heard. Location was a long walk to the central area. I wouldn't want to walk it in cold weather! Internet charges and parking charges were very high.
