We were in need of a get away from Switzerland, and we chose Stuttgart as our destination. We also had made reservations Le Méridien Hotel Stuttgart , for in looking at the map, it was just a short walk from the train station even with the large scale construction going on, and is very close to the downtown area.      Upon arrival, we were kindly greeted by the manager, and even better, he upgraded us to a top floor room with a very large single bed (so much fun), and we enjoyed the rest.       The staff was just outstanding, friendly, and very helpful. The restaurant has a short but tasty menu, but there are plenty of restaurant choices a short distance away.       The spa was quite enjoyable and relaxing, even with having fun finding it. Lol.       Overall my wife and I…
