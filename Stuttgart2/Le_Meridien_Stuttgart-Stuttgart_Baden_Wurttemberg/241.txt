Location: Great location, despite construction. From this hotel you can take a pedestrian bridge and pathway to the Schlossplatz and main shopping areas without really having to deal with getting hit by a car.  Parking is available under the hotel but at 22 Euro a day.  Rooms: Our party had the minibar and breakfast included in our price. Those two things might have swayed my opinion of this hotel alone…The bed was comfortable (spring) and the room was a good size, though I’d expect bigger for the price. The room has plenty of lighting which is rare in hotels I think. The bathroom was nice with a large tub/shower combo. The room was very clean at the staff did a fantastic job making the room feel very customized and cozy. I had a welcome gift with my name on if waiting for me on…
