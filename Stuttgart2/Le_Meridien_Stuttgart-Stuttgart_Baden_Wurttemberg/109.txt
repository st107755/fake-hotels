Had a brief weekend stay here and can't fault the hotel. Excellent premises, really well proportioned rooms and great sleep quality. Thsi hotel lives up to its 5 star billing. Its claen, smart with friendly and helpfull staff. Rooms are well laid out and equipped with extremely comfortable beds. If it has onesmall challenge its location. Its really close to the staionbut the current development in the area means its a longer, diverted walk than you think but once all that's done I'm sure it will be much simpler. Not really much else to say, excellent all round with free coffee in the foyer in the morning a nice touch. Would not hesitate staying there again.
