We stayed only 1 night at this hotel - and we really enjoyed it. Firstly, the staff were super helpful and service minded, we also got upgraded on arrival. Secondly, the room was big, very clean and fresh, and quiet.   The breakfast was also really good - huge with a lot of choices. The spa was also great, with a choice of saunas, showers etc. Not very big, but we were the only ones there at the time.   All in all, central great hotel. Not with a great view or anything - but still definitely worth a visit!
