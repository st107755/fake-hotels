   Quick business trip made all the better at this property. Elegant restaurant, good fitness center, really nice spa.     Ten minute walk to city center. Across from what is usually a nice park. Construction work has temporarily changed that. Still a nice park, you just have to move away from all the work.     Room was really nice. Renovated since my last stay seven years ago. Can't believe it's been that long.     Always comes down to the staff. Great staff. Lisa at the front desk and the ladies and gentlemen like her, make you want to get back soon. Very professional and courteous, and all welcome you with a BIG smile.
