One of the best I ever had, thanks from my whole family + free room upgrade  + breakfast outstanding, with "natural" juices and several gourmet choices  + pool and spa very very good, and open till 11pm, wow  + art collection in the lobby  + staff courtesy was amazing, from booking to reception and support for any issue one of the best I ever had, thanks from my whole family + garage was big and directly connected to the hotel    negative aspects were not so many, and actually most were not really on behalf of the hotel:  - moquette was a bit old, but actually it was ok: no smell, no dirt  - position was on high traffic street BUT no noise inside the room  - the park was under re-structurization
