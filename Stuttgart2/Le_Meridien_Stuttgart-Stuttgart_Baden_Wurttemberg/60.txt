I like sleep in the morning. So I never go to breakfast in the hotel to save my time. I buy a little food for breakfast and I left it in the in fridge. It is first hotel in in which food was stealed from the fridge. It is terrible. Unfortunately I should live in the this hotel still two days. I am afraid to leave things in this hotels.
