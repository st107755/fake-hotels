Hotel located within 10 minutes walk to the city center. Room was great and the hotel offered a free access to the spa (sauna,steam room, jacuzzi and indoor pool) it was overall a great experience. Don't get breakfast unless it is already included in the room price. Breakfast was 25 euros per person which was way too much for what I got!
