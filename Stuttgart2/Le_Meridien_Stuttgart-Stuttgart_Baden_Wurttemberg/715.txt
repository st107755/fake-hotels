I booked this hotel in Stuttgart because it was the only hotel name I could recognize among all of the other Stuttgart hotels.. And I DO NOT Regret that decision at all !  The staff was very corteuous and cooperative. They make sure that you feel special.  The room was CLEAN and well maintained (exactky like the  pictures posted in the website)  Food was excellant and served within exceptionally short period of time.  I loved my stay there and I will definately stay again.
