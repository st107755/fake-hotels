There was construction work around the planetarium and train station to make it a bit harder to get to the hotel from the train station. Our room was just above a major road and facing the construction site, so again, it might be nice after the construction work is done, but my son enjoyed the diggers and bulldozers.  The spa facilities were nice.  Otherwise, a place that meets expectations, but doesn't blow you away.
