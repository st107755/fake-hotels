We came for the wine festival at the end of a French, Germany, Zurich, Liechtenstein, Austria loop. This bathroom is quite large. There is plenty of granite counter area. The shower head is quite full and nice. The bed was a true king. The room is air conditioned. It was quiet all night. They had a very nice bellman and front desk staff. We asked for an extra towel and we learned in seconds our room had a doorbell. They provide washcloths and a complementary bottle of water. The city center is 10 minutes walk through the park. There is construction out front but it did not disrupt our stay.
