We had a surprisingly great experience at this Le Meridian.   The interior design was basic though well done, room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.   Service was spectacular. The staffs had been very friendly, helpful, welcoming, personal and provided much more than expected.   We also tried the room service which was pretty good compared with all the other meals we've had.
