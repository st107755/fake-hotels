We just spent a weekend at the Meridien and liked the hotel. The room was of decent size, newly renovated and the bed was super comfy. Staff was generally very friendly, except for our effort to get lunch at the bar - one lonely lady was trying to serve a filled bar, seemed to provide room service and was simply overwhelmed. We left after being ignored for ten minutes.  At the current time it is very difficult to get to the hotel from central station due to the construction of the new station (out of the hotels hands of course) and using taxis seems to be the best way around.  The pool and spa are beautiful, though packed on the weekend and the gym is well equipped.  I would be back when in Stuttgart again.
