I stayed at the Hotel Le Meridien in Stuttgart several times and each stay was just wonderful. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a modern style and are very well equipped with comfortable beds and spaceous bathrooms.   During my last stay in December we dined at the hotels restaurant "Le Cassoulet", which is just delicious - I highly recommend the Veal Carpacio. The hotel and restaurant staff are very attentive, friendly and helpful and truly make yourself  feel welcomed and comfortable right from the arrival through to the departure. A wonderful hotel in a great city.
