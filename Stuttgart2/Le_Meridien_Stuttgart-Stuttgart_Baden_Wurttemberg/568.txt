There are reviews that talk negatively about the location and the park across the street that's under construction.  My personal experience was fantastic.  I found the entire staff to be bend-over-backwards helpful; the restaurant is amazing, especially the breakfasts!  The room was perfect - quiet, well kept, extremely comfortable.  The hotel had a mix of business and leisure travelers, probably a bit more business though.  The Concierge was helpful from arrival to departure.  The location is central and only 5 minutes walking to KoenigStrasse.  I would return to, and stay at LeMeridien in Stuttgart on every trip in the future!!
