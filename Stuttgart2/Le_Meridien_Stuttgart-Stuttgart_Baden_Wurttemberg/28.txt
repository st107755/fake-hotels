Le Méridien Stuttgart is as most other Méridiens a quite pleasant experience with confy roomy rooms and decent breakfast buffet. In Stuttgart that is topped up by a great spa area - not to be missed after a busy day, and a 24hr gym. Unfortunately the entire neighborhood is undergoing an enormous transformation that will take years to complete so even though it is (still) a short walk from the, under reconstruction (ofc), train station it is through (literally) a construction site.  Fortunately no work is going on night time - at least I didn't notice.
