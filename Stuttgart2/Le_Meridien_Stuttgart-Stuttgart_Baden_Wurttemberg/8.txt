I’m the ambassador member with Marriot Bonvey membership. So far this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  First of all, such a dry weather in euro, there is only one bottle of water provided per day, I tried to request one more bottle, they told me it’s chargeable, that ridiculous and not acceptable for being treated like that being a Marriot member.   Secondly, during my check in, the checkin staff read out my room number loudly, this is a basic privacy issue that a hotel is not suppose to expose someone’s room number. The staffs need to be re-trained seriously!!!   The doors were changing into keyless in the middle of my stay. I was not informed before I left the hotel, i had to walk back to the counter to re-activate the key after I was blocked by the door.  all in…
