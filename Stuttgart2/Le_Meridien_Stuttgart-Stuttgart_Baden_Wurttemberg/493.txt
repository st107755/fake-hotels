I visited this hotel a few times and all I can say is "Love, Love, Love". They service, location and food are the perks but my favorite thing about this hotel is the elegance of the room, all the rooms.   You can see the Merceded Factory from outside the window which also overlooks the park. Normally when I travel through Europe I don't spend much time in the room, but when I visit Stuttgart I find myself spending a lot of time just relaxing in my robe.
