really comfortable hotel. extremely comfortable beds and swimming pool lovely and relaxing area in a city hotel . only downside was cost of wifi which is typically included in most hotels . leeks and pea soup amazing . bar tender very welcoming great selection of drinks . only 5 min walk through park to main shopping area
