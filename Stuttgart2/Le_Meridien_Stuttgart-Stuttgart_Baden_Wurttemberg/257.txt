Hard to fault this hotel which is in a great and quite location only a seven minute walk to centre of town and shopping.From the moment you check in you realise how friendly and helpful the staff are especially when only speaking English.Rooms are big,bright and spotless with fast internet.Breakfast and salads at the bar restaurant excellant. Free minibar a nice touch and the spa/pool great. Make sure you visit Mercedes museum nearby as fantastic Would definitely return when back in Stuttgart
