I've been there for a weekendtrip to Stuttgart. The spa is very clean, modern and has a great relaxing atmosphere. To mention is that the way to the spa is getting to the first floor and walking by various rooms to get to another lift that gets you down to the spa.  The rooms are as well nice and clean. Breakfast had a great variety and service was friendly though I find it strange they serve in chef-jackets, but a question of taste.  The only thing I didn"t like was the view onto a huge site, but there was no noice... so it was ok. Sites in a city might be inevitable.  I definitely recommend the hotel.
