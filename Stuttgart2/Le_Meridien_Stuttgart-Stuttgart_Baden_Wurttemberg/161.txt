The hotel is in the middle of a building site at the moment so it is not going to look its best.   When we left about 6 police cars surrounded the building... The check in was polite, and the doorman courteous opening the door and greeting.  50 euro deposit put on credit card on arrival, and was not cancelled on check out.   Still pending over a week later. The room was ok  -  housekeeping could have been done much better Breakfast choice was good -  although the coffee machine was broken,  another guest was disruptive holding a loud phone conversation and the staff didn't seem to care that it was annoying other guests Check out was polite - we were given some chocolates and an apology for the state of the room.
