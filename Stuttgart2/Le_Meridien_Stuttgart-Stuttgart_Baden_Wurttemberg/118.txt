So the room itself was nice and the staff pleasant.  It is a 10 minute walk to a castle and shopping area which is not bad.  However, the breakfast deal stinks.  With Marriott Gold status we did not get free breakfast.  Thats fine, just wanted to mention it since we didnt know Starwood has different rules.  When we cheked in, dude asks if we want to pre pay for breakfast which is a request I have never heard before.  It was 19 euros, typical for a hotel breakfast.  Due to the aforementioned wslk, we changed our mind and were going to eat at the hotel but it had gone up to 27 euros.  Ridiculous.    The room was very quiet despite being on a busy street and near LOTS of construction.  The housekeeping service was poor.  They did not have our room done until 1630.
