When you arrive in front of Le Meridian, you are greeted by a massive construction site for the new train station.  Do not let that bother you.  Inside, the hotel staff is welcoming, professional and very knowledgeable about the city.  The hotel room was quiet, large and very nice.  The staff, especially the concierge, whose name I do not recall, could not have been nicer.  They had all of the efficiency of a deluxe grand hotel and all of the warmth of the proprietors of a bed and breakfast.
