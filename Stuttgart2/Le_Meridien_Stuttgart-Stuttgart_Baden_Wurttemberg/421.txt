Convenient location to the main train station with a walk through a park in order to get to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and a good size. Wi-fi in the lobby and business centre is free, however wi -fi in the rooms needs to be paid for. For us breakfast wasn't included so i can't review that, but overall it was an enjoyable stay.
