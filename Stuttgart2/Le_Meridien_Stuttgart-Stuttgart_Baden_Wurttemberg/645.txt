This was one of our best European hotel experiences...and we have been travelling throughout Europe for the past 2 years.  The hotel staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  We were travelling with our 2 year old daughter and the hotel was very child-friendly.  The staff was very nice to her and offered her a treat and bubbles.  Those small gestures make all the difference, especially after she spent 2.5 hours in the car.  When we arrived in our room, there was a nice baby bed with cute sheets and a children's toiletries bag - very nice touch.  We loved the hotel pool (especially our daughter) and room service was perfect.  The concierge helped us plan our time in and around Stuttgart and when we checked out, the hotel did not charge us for parking.  The room was very cleanâ€¦
