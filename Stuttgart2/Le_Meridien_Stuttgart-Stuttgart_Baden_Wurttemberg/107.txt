I stayed at Le Meridien Stuttgart in August 2018. I frequently stay at Starwood properties, but this was my first stay at a Le Meridien and I am glad I chose it.   The room was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed and a large bathroom. There was a decent sized desk with plenty of workspace.  The staff was very friendly and helpful at check in. I had no issues, but I'm confident if I did they would be taken care of quickly. The bartenders were great and served well made cocktails.  I did have breakfast each morning of my stay and it was a very good buffet. It had a nice selection of the expected items for a hotel of this class.  Overall I enjoyed my stay and would return if I am in Stuttgart again. I would also seriously consider a Le Meridien next time I am in a city withâ€¦
