Currently staying at this supposedly 5* hotel and although the common areas are impressive and bedrooms are ok, the service and dining facilities are really spoiling our stay. The bistro restaurant at the hotel is only open 12-2.30pm and the main restaurant only opens from 6, so there is quite a gap when all you can order are bar snacks. We have now been waiting over 50 minutes for our burger and pizza! Really not good enough for a hotel of this quality. We dined in the restaurant last night, the buffet food was excellent but again the service was poor with plates not cleared between service and lots of waiting for food to be served. We have one more night at this hotel and so far I'm not impressed....
