Great hotel, very friendly and helpfull personel with great rooms. 2 downsides: Not able to use the HDMI port (no-one cares about the tv program anymore it's 2018). And the surrounding is being renovated. Unfortunately also a bit of a walk to the metro heading south but there's taxi parked in front of the door.  Fix these problems and it's a 5/5 for a 4 start hotel!
