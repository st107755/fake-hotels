I think this is one of the best hotels in the Stuttgart area.  Hotel is a short walk from the main train station and the city center.  Great welcoming staff at the reception, very polite and professional.   Great room and especially the bed was really really great.   Breakfast was pretty close to perfect.   Stayed for a week, travelling for business, impressed. I will for sure return and change some of my bookings to the Le Meridien franchise.
