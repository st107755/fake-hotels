This is quite nice for a business hotel, with helpful staff, attractive common areas, and nicely appointed rooms.  The breakfast buffet is quite impressive and delicious.  The nearest shopping/restaurant area is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel (across the park), where there are plenty of options.  I recommend this property if you're a business traveler.
