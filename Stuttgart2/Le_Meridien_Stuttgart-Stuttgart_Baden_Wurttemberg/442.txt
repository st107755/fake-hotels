2 nights in March for a business trip. Pleasant welcome and engaging staff- clear focus on quality.  Lobby has some weird proportions- but the layout of the entire hotel is a bit 'odd' - not sure about the architect's thinking- perhaps this was something other than a hotel originally. No big deal...just what I felt as I walked in and around the space. They wont be winning any design awards.  I liked: General state of cleanliness and freshness of the hotel- extremely well kept. Comfortably sized rooms and nice size TV. Bathroom was also pleasant, well lit and had both space and all the amenities- a strong point. The gym/pool/spa was good for getting some excercise/relaxing- also everything very well maintained. Room was facing the back of the hotel rather than the road - no viewâ€¦
