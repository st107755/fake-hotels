This was a superb hotel even for a lesiure guest like myself.  It seems most of the guests here are business travelers.  The hotel is a 7 minute walk to the main station and the main city center with all shopping needs.  Across the street is the main city park which is absoutley beautiful for walking, running, or to simply relax.  About a 5 minute walk is the ballet and main museum.  Location location!  If you're arriving by train you need to exit from the left side of the station in to the park to get to the hotel.  Take the footbridge near the planetarium in the park over the road which has direct access to the hotel.  If you have heavy luggage, this might be a challenge.  If you think so, take a cab for aboout 6 Euro to the hotel.  The hotel itself is modern and very clean. â€¦
