Nice hotel but way over priced. This hotel is for the German elite and business elite. They offer very little for a high price. Gym was nice and breakfast offered a good spread. The gym was free and that was about the only thing provided free of charge at a almost insulting charge for a room. Internet was crazy slow and in half the hotel your phone won't work. Spa is really nice again very high price for both Germany and Stuttgart. I travel a lot to Stuttgart there is better hotels at a better price available.
