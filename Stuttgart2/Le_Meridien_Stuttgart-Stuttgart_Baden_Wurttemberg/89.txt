We recently stated at the Meridien Stuttgart for a short trip to Germany. The hotel was a short taxi ride from the airport. Check in was smooth and fast. Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The u-bahn was right down the street, a short walk away. The location was pretty central to the things we wanted to see, mainly Canstatter Volkfest. The street outside was clean and quiet despite a massive construction project going on. WiFi was great.
