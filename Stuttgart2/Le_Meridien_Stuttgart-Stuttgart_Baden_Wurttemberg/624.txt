We love the Le Meridien chain of hotels and have stayed in many of them. We always look for a Le Meridien when we travel. The hotel in Stuttgart is our new favorite. Le Spa is awesome and it was at no extra charge - as some of the spas are. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was extraordinary. The restaurant was better than most hotel restaurants even for a Le Meridien. We will stay there again!
