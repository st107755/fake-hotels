The Meridien offers a wonderful location, easy access to public transportation, and a really exceptional experience. The full-service spa downstairs is also a bonus! The best part of the stay is walking out into the Konig's Park and enjoying the trails for running or the beer garden, not a quarter mile away! Staff was friendly and actually funny! Go, stay, and enjoy.
