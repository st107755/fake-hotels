This was not our first choice of hotel but it was available and close to the train station so we decided to stay here.  It was a good decision.  The hotel staff was very welcoming and we enjoyed our top floor room.  It is a short walk to the station through what is supposed to be a park but it was really a large construction site.  Still, it was an easy walk on paved paths so dragging along rolling luggage was no problem.  There are a few restaurants nearby and the cafe-style one in the hotel is great.  The more formal restaurant in the hotel was very expensive and we did not get a chance to see if the food lived up to the cost. All in all I would stay here again without hesitation.
