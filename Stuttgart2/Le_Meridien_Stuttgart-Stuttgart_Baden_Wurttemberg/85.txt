Nice classy hotel, the rooms are like adverted on their site, clean and nice rooms, nice personnel, good food in the restaurant (which is just outside the hotel, would be better when reachable from inside the hotel when wheater is bad), very nice wellnesscomplex with swimming pool, all included in the roomrate ! Whe where very satisfied !
