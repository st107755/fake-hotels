This hotel made me leave with a smile after an exhausting travel week - staff was very friendly and even provided a running map for the morning run :-). Facilities and Bar were very good - the fruit juice blender at the breakfast buffet certainly a nice add on for a good start to the day. Running track through the Schlosspark right in front of the hotel - trainstation just a stonethrow away.
