We stayed at Le Meridien Stuttgart for one night. The hotel was almost flawless with nice and clean rooms, good location and welcoming staff at the reception. The breakfast was almost a surprise, we have lived in many different hotels around the globe and I would confidently say the breakfast here was one of the best.  However, I have to say that the entrance of the underground car park was too narrow and steep. I am an experienced driver but I still felt nervous when I drove down the entrance. Maybe because my was quite big, but it can still be challenging. The next morning, I had to ask a valet to drive my car out.  Anyway, a wonderful stay and I will be staying here next time when I visit Stuttgart.
