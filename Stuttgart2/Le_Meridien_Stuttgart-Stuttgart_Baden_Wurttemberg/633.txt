Front desk staff very friendly, welcoming  and helpful. Concierge a little perfunctory, especially with  walking directions to train station and downtown restaurants. Bed hard and AC not able to be controlled especially at night.. The toilet has a most peculiar arrangement for flushing.  Bar food very good and a good alternative to the restaurant which looked good but only fine dining available and therefore had  accompanying high prices.  Walking access to downtown shopping and restaurants not easy:  especially at night....... one must traverse a park filled with camping protesters who i understand have been there for more than a year. Once  one understands that a taxi is advisable for going to Stuttgart restaurants, then just do it. Overall, hotel is good however.
