The Meridien in Stuttgart would have a perfect location across from the Schloss Garten and the railway station if it was not for the usual politicians who always spoil most things and love to destroy nice environments. For a long time now protestyers have been camping in the garden tostop the politicians from tearing everything down. The hotelitself have excellent rooms and the service is impeccable. The food in the restaurant is not big portions but enough and made with love. You can eat there anytime and enjoy it. The breakfast can satisfy most palates and the inddor pool and spa is excellent. The only drawback is the garage that if you have a big car it is precision driving to be able to get in. Apart from that it is a hotel that I would recommend anytime.
