Due to a bit of a flight chaos in Heathrow a few nights ago, I had to rebook via Stanstead and ended in Stuttgart instead of Munich. So I needed a hotel on points and the LM was available.  We arrived and I was told we had received an upgrade, and I had booked a king bed non smoking. we were given room 404, which was a smoking room, and certainly did not look like an upgrade. So back downstairs to say the room was smoking and didn't look like an upgrade. They apologized and said unfortunately they had no more king bed rooms. I said that was not acceptable. so then they gave us room 577. This time they even added the "you've been upgraded" sleeve to the key. To be honest I think the girl at the FD was new to Starwood, as she was surprised to note that I was a platinum member.â€¦
