I sspent the weekend here as a small holiday between jobs.  The hotel is very nice, clean and Super nice staff.  The morning breakfast buffet is one of the best I have seen.  E 22.00 but they fried 2 eggs for me.  Something I have not seen here in Germany yet for breakfast.  They have 4 of 70 TV channels that is English.  They also have French, Italian, Russian and a few others I did not understand..ha ha.  It is a nice 15 walk to a great shopping area.  My view out the window is lousy, but I got a good deal on the price.  Was able to open the window and get some fresh air.  AC has a therostat had a comfortable King-Size bed....Huge bath tub that I took advantage of.  I would come here again.    :-)
