In spite of the massive Stuttgart 21 new train station construction and major highway directly in front of this hotel, we had an excellent stay here.  The hotel does a great job of making sure their oasis is shielded as much as possible from the noise.  The check-in was excellent with some free admissions to local attractions, nice chocolates & a voucher for 2 free welcome drinks.  The room was very clean and stylish as most Le Meridiens are.  We tested out the spa and it was really excellent.  It had hammam as well as multiple temperature saunas to enjoy not to menttion to pool and hot tub.  The chairs in the spa were so inviting we just HAD to take a nap!  We tried two restaurants in the hotel and both were very good.  The location is spectacular as you can walk to the mainâ€¦
