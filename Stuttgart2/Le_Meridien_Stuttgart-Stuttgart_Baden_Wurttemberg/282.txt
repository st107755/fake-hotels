The hotel is very nice inside; the outside is plain and on a busy road that is full of construction. We walked over from the main Stuttgart train station and while not far in distance, to cross the main road, you go up a large flight of stairs; if you don't have much luggage, no problem! If you do, just be prepared. Everyone at the hotel was nice and I wish I had thought to book a spa appointment ahead of time as there were no openings when I arrived. It's in a great location, by the park, about a 10 minute walk to the city center and tons of shops and restaurants. About a 35 Euro cab ride to the airport (approx. 30 minutes).
