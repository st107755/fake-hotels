I stayed in this hotel in January.  The staff are excellent and very friendly indeed.  The rooms are well laid out and spacious.  They have a great restaurant and the bar was always busy with plenty of atmosphere.  I stayed for 3 nights and not a single negative to report on the place.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a hassle free pleasent stay.
