I am very surprised by the positive reviews written about this hotel.  The room was nice, but certainly not worth the price. We could not open the window because the traffic was so loud. The hotel was not in a convenient location, the food was extremely expensive (25 Euros per person for breakfast)!!!  They have some nerve charging for internet (14 Euros per day). Room service messed up our order every day, the staff was inconsistent, and our meal in the restaurant was deplorable.  My steak was too tough to cut with a steak knife, I wouldn't  couldn't  eat it and "they" were annoyed, can you imagine!!  Don't bother staying here unless you have an expense account and don't mind being ripped off. There are many other places to stay.
