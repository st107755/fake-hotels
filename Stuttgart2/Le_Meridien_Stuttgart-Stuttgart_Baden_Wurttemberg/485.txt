Le Meridien is a good hotel, not far from town center of Stuttgart ; the employees are nice and willing to help in case you need, the rooms are big and the cleaning is quite good (the only thing that i can comment is the room design witch makes the room to dark, the color of the walls is grey , my personal issue with grey rooms :-) ) As overall comment good hotel, great breakfast.
