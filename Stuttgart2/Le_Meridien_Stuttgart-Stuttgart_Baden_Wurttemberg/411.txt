We stayed here for 2 nights and found the hotel very pleasant. Checkin was delayed by almost an hour as they had a huge number of guests arriving but we were given an upgrade to compensate. The location is excellent, 10 min stroll from the central train station and easy access to the main shopping area. The subway was close by and staff were friendly and helpful. The only thing that would have improved our stay would have been the addition of a kettle in the room, but I am aware this is not standard for European hotels.
