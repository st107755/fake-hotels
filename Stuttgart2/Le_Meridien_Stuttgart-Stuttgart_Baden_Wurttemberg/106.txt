Flew into Frankston and then drove to Stuttgart , on arrival the Concierge was one of the best I have ever met. He assisted in taking our bags to the room (which they had upgraded us to a better room) he took the time to show us around and then assisted me in finding the parking garage, explaining the ticketing system and showing me the access elevators. Afterwards he  provided me a may and explained the layout of the area and where the Cafe's and Restaurants were in relation to the Hotel. The rest of the staff are very friendly , courteous and extremely helpful and all speak perfect english. The inhouse restaurants have a good selection on the menus and the breakfast is varied and plentiful with endless cups of good filtered coffee. I would be happy to stay here again ifâ€¦
