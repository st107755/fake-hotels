Stayed in this hotel prior to picking up new Mercedes from the factory on outskirts of Stuttgart.  Beautiful hotel with welcoming staff.  Would agree with everything in previous reviews except that when we went to the spa for a swim the jacuzzi was stone cold and the pool not much warmer.  This was extremely disappointing and, although the staff assured us it would be rectified, it would not be in time for us to enjoy the facilites before dinner.  I would have thought that this should have been noticed during regtular water quality checks. The Christmas market in December is a must - and only 10 minutes pleasant walk from the hotel.
