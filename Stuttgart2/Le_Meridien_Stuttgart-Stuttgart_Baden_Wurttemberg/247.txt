Everybody in the hotel was very friendly and trying very hard. However the location is "sub-optimal". We had the room towards the construction site of Stuttgart 21 and a main street. The room is OK but not spacious.   The minibar is quite difficult to open and difficult to find. You also have an ironing board in the room. Well in a five-star hotel I usually take advantage of the laundry service.  Disappointing were extremely loud and drunken Chinese in the bar. Also disappointing that restrooms there are equipped with urimat plastic pissoirs. OK for a parking lot on the highway but a no-go in such a hotel.  Overall, you get better in other hotels in this category but absolutely acceptable to stay for one or two nights.
