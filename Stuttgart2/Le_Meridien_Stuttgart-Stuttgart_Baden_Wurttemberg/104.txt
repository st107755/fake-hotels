I have to divide this review into two parts. First, the hotel itself. It is clean, comfortable and the staff is extremely nice. The breakfast is very extensive and delicious. So I can recommend it based upon their own merit.   Part two, in front of the hotel is an ongoing construction project for the city of Stuttgart. This will be on going for the next 3 years, at least. The hotel is quiet and well insulated from the noise, but the walk to and from the train station is very complicated. What should be a 3 minute walk took 15 minutes and zigzagged us thru various areas. We ended up hiring a taxi to drive us to the station when we left. The short cut involved too many stairs to navigate with large luggage.  So keep in mind if you are staying here, be prepared to navigate the areaâ€¦
