We spent two nights at this elegant hotel with its excellent restaurant.  It was easily the best accommodation we experienced in our two weeks in Germany.  The room was large, well furnished with modern furniture and featured a roomy bathroom.  We also enjoyed the superb restaurant which, on our first night featured a French buffet which was excellent and good value.  It is within easy walking distance of the railway station.  Highly recommended.
