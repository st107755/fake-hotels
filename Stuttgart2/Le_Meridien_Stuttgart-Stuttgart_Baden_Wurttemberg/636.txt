The check-in process was quick, very professional and friendly.   As a platinum member we got upgraded to a suite which was very much appreciated and nice touch to recognise frequent travellers.  The hotel itself looks very clean, carpets look clean and new in the corridors and the room.  the room was nicely appointed and clean, we called once to get some toothpaste as we had forgotten and the guy showed up with the kit on a platter and wearing gloves which I was pleasantly surprised thinking it was the Ritz :-)  the executive lounge also very nice, comfortable and well stocked.  Spa and sauna also very good.  Keep up with the great job and great staff.
