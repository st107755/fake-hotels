We landed in Stuttgart and went right to the Le Meridien hotel.  A great place to stay-wonderful staff and fantastic location.  We walked through a beautiful park to the Koenigstrasse and enjoyed the sights of Stuttgart!  We found the hotel to be quiet and a great place to relax after a long journey.  We will stay here next time in Stuttgart!
