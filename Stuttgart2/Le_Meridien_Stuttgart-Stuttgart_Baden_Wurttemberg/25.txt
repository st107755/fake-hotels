Due to the railwork going on it took longer to find / walk to than we expected. In fact in the 3 days here it was only on our last night that we found the quickest route to the main shopping  street - across the bridge, down the stairs, slight left then straight ahead (don’t follow Hbhf signs or go over the bridge to the park area) and you end up at the s bhan level of the station. Anyway hotel room and amenities very good, spa was the best and cleanest of all hotel spas I’ve been in but did get a shock in the sauna area to see a naked man! The sauna requests no clothes but we were unaware of that till we got there. Breakfast excellent, didn’t eat there otherwise, had a coffee in the bar - it’s abit dark but pleasant anyway. I’d  come back but beware these lots of walking…
