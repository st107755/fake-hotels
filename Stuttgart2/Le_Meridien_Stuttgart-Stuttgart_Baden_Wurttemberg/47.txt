We were greeted with smiles that were genuine. No phonies here. The room was comfortable, clean and quiet. The hotel is a short walk to the train station which is very convenient for travelers. It also close to a fun walking street Koningstrase with many restaurants and other shopping. Easy access to transportation to the Porsche and Mercedes museums. Don't miss Stuttgart and be sure to stay at the Le Meridien.
