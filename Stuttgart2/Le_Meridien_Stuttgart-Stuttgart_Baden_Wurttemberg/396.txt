Business stop over 2 nights stay travelling into Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof. Reasonable walking distance across a park and a very busy road (There is a handy bridge leading directly from the hotel over the road to the park area so no difficult road crossing is necessary).   The Hotel is nothing special to look at from the outside but inside is relatively spacious and of good quality and state of decoration; it had a comfortable feel about it and Reception staff were very helpful and friendly.  My room was front facing but the quality of the double glazing did mitigate the noise from a busy dual carriageway artery that runs in front of the hotel. I was never really bothered by the noise, the position did offer some nice views over the Station Area, park and the Benz rotating signâ€¦
