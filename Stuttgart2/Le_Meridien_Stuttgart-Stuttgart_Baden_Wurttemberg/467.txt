Arrived at hotel around 1000 - so room not being ready was fine. Afternoon returned & check in desk very busy. Finally got our room - disappointed when I opened the door, I think it was a corner room. It was overlooking the main road and sound proofing was inadequate, carpet had crumbs all over. Went down to front desk staff. Was told ALL superior rms are overlooking main road so will be noisy.As Hotel running full they cannot upgrade me unless I pay 25Euros - which I did. Newly assigned room MUCH better there is no view, so it's quiet.  Needed the concierge, but was told that he was on his break, but then another staff came over to assist. Evening, there's a protest going on outside the hotel, receptionist tells us to walk up to the roundabout to get a taxi. We failed = noâ€¦
