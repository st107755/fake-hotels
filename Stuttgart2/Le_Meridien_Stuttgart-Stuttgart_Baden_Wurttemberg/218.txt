Everything was so perfect, efficient, friendly and the quickest room service I've ever experienced. They've gone out of their way to make us feel special. People keep commenting on how great the hotel is for business trips, but I couldn't recommend it enough for families too. They had a cot bed and delivered warm milk to our room mornings and evenings (free of charge I may add). All in all, very very satisfied and we won't choose any other hotel in Stuttgart again!
