We staid with the family twice this year, and I came for business once. The location is superb with most things in the city in wlking distance. For the Zoo,you take the tram. The breakfast is a smash, really great, but be early, as everyone staying there taes it, and even outsiders try to get there! All rooms were great, except for once,when we got cigarette smell through the bathroom ventilation, although we were in the non-smoking wing... some never learn. All staff were very friendly, extremely helpful! Come for the weekend when rooms are reasonably priced. During the week, it gets expensive due to the nearby government offices!
