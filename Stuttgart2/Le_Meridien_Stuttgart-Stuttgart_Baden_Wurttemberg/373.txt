We stayed here for 2 nights during May 2015 and couldn't have asked for more.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything particularly luxurious, simply because the price was definitely lower than many other hotels around Stuttgart. As it turns out, we'd simply scored an amazing deal because Le Meridien Stuttgart was absolutely wonderful.   The room was absolutely enormous and had a proper king size bed (very comfortable) and the bathroom was small, but modern and well-equipped.   We dined at the hotel restaurant where they were hosting a buffet and it was delicious! I'm still dreaming about the melt-in-your-mouth roast pork and gravy. It wasn't exactly cheap, but considering the food quality, the restaurant's classic, stylish decor, and the hotel itself, this was to be expected.â€¦
