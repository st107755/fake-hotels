Just spent 3 nights at this hotel for business travel, and stayed in the renovated tower.  The room was nicely done and spacious, but the bathroom was a bit small (consistent with most hotels in Germany though).  It is about a 10 minute walk from the main train station, and about the same to the town center and main shopping street, so very convenient.  I also recommend the daily breakfast buffet.  Nice, friendly staff too. I forgot my US adapter, but there were 2 USB ports in the room, so that was helpful.
