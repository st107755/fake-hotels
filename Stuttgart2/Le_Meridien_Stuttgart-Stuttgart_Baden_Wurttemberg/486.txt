Le Meridien Stuttgart is a good hotel, right in town, but it has lost some of its winning edge over the area competition.  In 2007, ! spent several weeks at the hotel then returned in July 2013 for a week stay.  Since 2007, the hotel has eliminated its club/executive room--though it was small--it was a welcome part of the hotel, now gone.  The breakfast is overpriced from 2007, though it is very good.  The hotel is also showing its age.  I stayed in the exact same type of room in 2007 and 2013, and the hotel is showing its age, with worn carpets and furniture--needs and update.  Anyway, still a good choice for Stuttgart.  The spa and pool are still excellent.  The service is first rate and the location is convenient to the train station and downtown.
