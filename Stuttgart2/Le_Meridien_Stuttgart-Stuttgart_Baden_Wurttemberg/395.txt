Utterly disappointed with this hotel. I stayed here for a night during a business trip and paid a huge amount of tariff to stay in a place which is more like a 2 start hotel. They charge for breakfast, wifi, and everything you would expect to be the basics which comes complimentary with room tariff. They don't even have a coffee maker in the room. The rooms are of average quality and the lobby disappointing. I would suggest consider this hotel only if you have no other choice in the city.
