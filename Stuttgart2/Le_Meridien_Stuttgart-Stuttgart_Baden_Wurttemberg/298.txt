I got the opportunity to go on TDY in 2009 to Stuttgart, first time back in Germany in 26 years-- I was in Eastern Europe for a month during the college years.  What a classy hotel this is. What I enjoyed most was its proximity to all the train lines. However to get to the town and the museums as well as the shops and restaurants one just to has to take a 20-minute stroll. And there must be thousands of shops and restaurants in the area. There are many street artists as well as kiosks and what a vibrant town. Breakfast was an awesome daily feast. I was in Hawaii the month before (Oahu) and  at another awesome hotel in Waikiki Beach but I tell you, the food here was world class. Room was spectacular and services the best I have seen in Europe.
