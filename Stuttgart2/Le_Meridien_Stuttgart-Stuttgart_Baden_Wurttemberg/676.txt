Stayed in a deluxe room for one night in June.  The Good - service from the front desk and room service, toiletries, big plasma TV, comfortable bed  The Bad - dusty room, size of deluxe room,  room service food (breakfast eggs arrived cold), carpet in room was a little dated  I have to add, though, that when I noted down the negative things on the online survey, someone from the management team got back to me immediately via email, said he will forward the comments about the dusty room and quality of food to the appropriate staff members, and credited me with 1500 SPG points for the trouble.  Very much appreciated and in line with 5-star hotel service.
