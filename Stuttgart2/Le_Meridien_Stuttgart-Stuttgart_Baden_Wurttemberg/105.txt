We stayed for 6 nights, the rooms were very spacious and the beds were comfortable,  breakfast was amazing with every imaginable taste catered for. The spa/ pool area was lovely for some relaxation and quiet time and a really great sauna area. Location was good, just a short stroll to the city area.
