Le Meridien in Stuttgart  is mroe a conference hotel, it has that large sterile feel about it. having said that the rooms are good, well equipped, the staff a re very good, helpful and friendly.  it is opposite the park, which is pretty but currentlt ( December 2011) has a large proest camp there against enlarging the train station. As you walk through the park for a few minutes to get to the town centre, it is soemhting to be aware of. I walked through with my wife several times and although there a lot of them it is not at all threatening, although it may feel different after dark.  So the location is good in summer I imagine it must be very pretty opposite the park with its trees and lake.
