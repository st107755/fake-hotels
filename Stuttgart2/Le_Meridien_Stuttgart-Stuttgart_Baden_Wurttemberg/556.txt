Hats off to the Le MERIDIEN Stuttgart team for looking after my family and I in fantastic fashion last week. We stopped over on our way down to Davos and had just spent +5 hours in the car (with three kids under 7). Our nerves were frayed but the level of service and attention to detail was outstanding. The front office team were incredibly friendly providing small gifts for the children and the breakfast in particular is superb. We left the next day feeling re-energized so thanks to Le MERIDIEN Stuttgart team.
