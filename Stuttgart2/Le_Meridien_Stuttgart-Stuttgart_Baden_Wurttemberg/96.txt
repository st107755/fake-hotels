Stayed two night as part of a business offsite with colleagues. On the first night at exactly 2am, I am woken up by a blasting TV in my room. I was so lost I could not even locate the remote control tucked away in the wall unit. The night duty manager eventually put an end to my misery and about an hour later I managed to fall asleep. Before going to bed on the second night, I checked with reception who assured me that technician had checked and that everything was fine. You can imagine my horror when again at exactly 2am the the TV blasts on again. This time I managed to fall asleep again relatively fast, but was exhausted when I woke up. When I asked at checkout to be credited one night, I got a blank gaze back from the check out staff. The Duty Manager offer my minibarâ€¦
