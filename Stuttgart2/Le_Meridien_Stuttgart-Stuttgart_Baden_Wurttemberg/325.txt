The LeMeridien Stuttgart is in a nice building With a nice interior architecture. Reception staff was ok. Service at the breakfast room was not very good. On Sunday most of the tables were occupied and there just was not anyone to seat us. I had to ask for help to seat us, as I am handicapped and no one offered to help. Surprisingly, also the service was unfriendly and slow.
