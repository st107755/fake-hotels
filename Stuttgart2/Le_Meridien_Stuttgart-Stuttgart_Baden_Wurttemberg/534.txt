We picked this hotel based off TripAdvisor ratings. We were not disappointed.   The rooms were nice and spacious for European standards. We had 2 rooms. One for the teenagers (two twin beds) and one for us (1 queen bed). The hotel even came with a little bathrobe and slippers.   It was within a short walk to the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) and downtown was nearby and there was a Schlosspark across the street. Had there not been construction going on, the view would have been wonderful.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurant was quite nice (and quite expensive).
