The hotel is located on a busy street a short walk from the centre of Stuttgart. The foyer and rooms are comfortable and I would describe them as 'reliable'. Breakfast was good with a big selection of hot and cold foods.  The staff behind the counter were excellent on checkin and we got a brilliant recommendation for dinner from the concierge to a local Schwabian restaurant.
