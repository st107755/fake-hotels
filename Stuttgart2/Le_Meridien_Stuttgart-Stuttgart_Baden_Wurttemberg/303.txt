Real delight of a hotel right in the heart of the action in Stuttgart. Amongst the best check ins I have ever experienced, professional, courteous, above and beyond with help. Really impressed. Rooms in the new section spacious, tastefully decorated and clean. Don't be put off by the construction of the new underground train station across the road, the rooms are whisper quiet. Didn't have time for the spa but that looked wonderful as well. And take advantage of the free gallery pass, saves you around 15â‚¬ and one of the finest collections in Europe is just a few minutes away
