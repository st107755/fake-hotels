Hotel was conveniently located. Bottled water provided  and was replaced daily. Minifridge had room for personal items. Font desk personnel very helpful, friendly and accomodating. As a platinum, did not feel room was upgraded, but not sure. Mattress was firm but sleep was good. Very Quiet.  A/c did not seem to work efficiently, room remained warm so we just opened the window and the outside air cooled the room. Breakfast buffet was provided as a benefit with many items provided, breakfast staff could be friendlier, lacked a welcoming attitude. Overall, a good restful stay when in Stuttgart.
