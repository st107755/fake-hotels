This business and tourist hotel is on a convenient location even the big train restructuring project makes it not that easy to reach the center of Stuttgart and the rail main station.  It's a typical German business hotel, a little "old fashion" in case of room equipment and furniture but functional and good organized, perfect for a short stay. It's a medium size hotel with a good gym and a nice spa. The rooms (standard) are on the smaller size side but ok, I didn't like the twin beds to much, small and not very comfortable. I would go for a king size room. The breakfast is normally not included and to expensive for what you get. I would rate the hotel 3 star but the excellent customer service, especially on the reception, let me give the hotel 4 stars! Overall a good hotel withâ€¦
