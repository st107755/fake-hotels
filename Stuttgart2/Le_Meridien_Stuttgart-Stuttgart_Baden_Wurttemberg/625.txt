Hotel was very nice although I would say the room was slightly on the small side. Room cleaning was lacking as empty water bottles were not removed and the desk area remained dusty throughout our stay. The bar was not a very sociable area although the bar staff were very friendly and helpful. The spa and gym facilities were very nice and relatively quiet except for one afternoon when two young children were playing noisily in the pool. The main issue was the hotel location which was situated on a busy road and not as close to the centre/amenities as was suggested. The walk from the hotel to the centre was through quite a scruffy park area which was occupied by a camp of protesters and crossing the park in the evening/night time was not a comfortable experience.
