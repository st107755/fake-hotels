We stayed for one night at the Le Meridien while in town to visit the Mercedes museum.  The hotel was located near the museum, the center of town with shops and restaurants and the train station.  We had a nice appointed room with a glass wall that was lighted and was a art piece by the desk.  Beds were comfortable and the European style breakfast was fantastic.  The offerings included juices, breads, omelets, fruit - was very extensive - all freshly prepared.  Recommend staying in this hotel if you visit Stuttgart.
