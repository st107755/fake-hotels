The problem is the location.  The hotel is at the edge of a large area of urban reconstruction which looks likely to last several more years.  Until then, it's a nightmare to get to:  walking alongside a busy road (almost an urban motorway).  It may be well situated when all this is done but it's an unattractive location right now.  Check-in (and departure) staff very welcoming and helpful.  Room service on day 1 was late and not what was ordered.  Room (a "chic") room was very nicely decorated but small and, in my view, overpriced.  Internet slow.  I might try the place again but not until the construction is over.
