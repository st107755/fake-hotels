It was my first trip to Germany and stayed in 3 hotel during my visit in different city . As of my experience I found this hotel is the best ! The slim girl ( canâ€™t remember the name ) she was so professional & friendly and helpful ! Concierge is helpful ! Room is beautiful ! Food was great I had a Asian fried dumpling! Bar tender was so friendly and help full . I really enjoyed my stay at le meridian Stuttgart !! Thank you Hanna Gorig for making my trip memorable .
