I give the hotel 5 stars and my experience as a whole 6 stars.  This is a little gem reminiscent of days gone by....20th century customer service (when people actually knew what customer service was all about).  Comfort in the rooms with a good amount of space.  Well trained and efficient check in staff.  Excellent food and breakfast .  It has been awhile since I have noticed an actual honey comb for your breakfast honey.  The concierge was outstanding in arranging a trip to a small village.  The bar was excellent with a vast selection.  I also had a wonderful conversation with a fellow guest and his wife in the bar.  There are many places to stay and many places to visit but this is a place I would return to...the inside of the hotel is  such a pleasant surprise and notâ€¦
