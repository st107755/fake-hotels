Stayed here for work for four nights.  It is a quality hotel, with nice quiet rooms, comfortable beds and a great Spa/Pool/Gym area.  It is well located close to the main train station. The breakfast is good by European standards.  Would happily stay here again.    One thing it could do with is a clock in the room.
