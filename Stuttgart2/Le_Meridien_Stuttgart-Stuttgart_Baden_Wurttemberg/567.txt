probably the worst internet connection we had ever used in all-over Germany... the Manager-on-duty was a very unresponsible guy, who was answering our questions like a school-kid would...to answer our question regarding the poor connection, the only thing he said was "Gentlemen, you have the internet connection, be it super or poor". funny thing is that he was asking whether we would like him to connect us with the internet provider... I was wondering did I ever sign a contract with an internet provideron behalf of a hotel... funny, it was!  I have no doubt that guests would highly appreciate if the administration of the hotel consider this issue.
