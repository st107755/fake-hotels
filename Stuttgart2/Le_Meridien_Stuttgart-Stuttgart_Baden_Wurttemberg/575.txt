Wow, a 5 star feels like a 2 star from a service perspective. Awful from booking to check out and post leaving.  We are a family and asked for connecting room but it took forever to be sure it was possible, at least 4 phone calls. Once there the rooms were not set up with baby beds and it took another 30 min to get everything sorted. And then the noise of the big road surpringly loud in the kiddies room.   The next surprise came the morning after when we got our brand new car from valet with a scratch on the side and after immediate reassurance that it would be taken care we ended with having to deal with it our selves.  In summary truly awfull in term of service, dealing with liens and organization.  Positive note, the breakfast is very well organized and presented.
