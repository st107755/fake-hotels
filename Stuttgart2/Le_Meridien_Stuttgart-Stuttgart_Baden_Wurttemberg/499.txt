There aren't many spas in Stuttgart - or at least offer services that you are more acustomed to (like spa services in the U.S.).  The spa services were good - the Balinese massage is worth it.  I would skip the pedicure...pedicures in Europe so far are not what American's are used to - not bad, not good.  Just different.  However, I didn't care for the pedicure here because the lady cut my toe nails and then filed them round when they were square before (I had a french manicure) - so this was unexpected and nail technicians should know that you're not really supposed to do that because it can cause ingrown toe nails (hence why mine were square in order to prevent that).   So now I have to grow them out again and start over since my toenails dig in the corners of my toes. â€¦
