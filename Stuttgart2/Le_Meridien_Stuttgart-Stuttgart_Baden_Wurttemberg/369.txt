Recently stayed in Le Meridien, Stuttgart on a business trip and am extremely pleased with the Hotel - friendly staff and clean rooms. The breakfast is extra ordinary and has all the varieties including honey in the honey comb. Nowadays, no business hotel is charging extra for the internet / wifi but Le Meridien Stuttgart is charging Euro 6 per 24 hours and the speed is not great.
