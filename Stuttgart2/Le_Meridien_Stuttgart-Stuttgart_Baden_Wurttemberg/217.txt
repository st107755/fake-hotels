This hotel is close to the main station and its new Stuttgart 21 development.As that has been far delayed the hotel views and access is affected by digging and cranes.So no real view on offer even from the street facing rooms. The junior suite to which I was upgraded is just a large room with an odd toilet.the amenities are standard and coffee and tea service is good The separate closet through far from the toilet is well organised and spacious.
