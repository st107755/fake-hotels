The hotel stands on a hill above the park just a short walk from the town and main station, we have stayed there many times over the years and it never fails to satisfy.  The staff are superb and work hard to ensure your stay is comfortable and trouble free.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious and the hotels other facilities spa, bar and resturant are well appointed.  Definately the best hotel in town. Car parking is also available at the hotel.
