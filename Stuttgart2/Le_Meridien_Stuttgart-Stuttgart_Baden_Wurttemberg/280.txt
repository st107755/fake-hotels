This Hotel is on the expensive side, so I am glad my company was paying for the room.  It's what I would class as your classic American styling. Large grand and king sized beds.  The restaurant and bar are very nice and don't disappoint. The hotel is in a great location not too far (a 7 minute walk) from the main Stuttgart train station. Although when I was there construction in the area meant taking a taxi was easier.  If you are into large expensive American styled hotels, then this place is for you, if you are a man on a budget, or want to be closer to the Stuttgart restaurant and nightlife scene, this place will disappoint.
