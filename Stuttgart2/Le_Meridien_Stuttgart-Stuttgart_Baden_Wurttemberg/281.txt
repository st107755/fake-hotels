Entering the elegant lobby of Le Meridien Stuttgart transported us to a place of serenity and luxury amid the immense rail construction project in the middle of Stuttgart.The staff was charming, as well as professional. We chose this property because I am a long time Starwood member. I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the United States, but none outrank the Diplomatic Suite of this property. I regret that we only had time to stay one night before leaving Stuttgart. The hotel also provides free passes to the excellent Stuttgart Art Gallery, where i was impressed and surprised with the eclectic art collection. Stuttgart will improve when construction is completed. Meanwhile, bask in the pleasures of the excellent Le Meridien Stuttgart.
