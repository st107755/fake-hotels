We spent 7 nights here as guests of Mercedes during a golfing tournament. Not sure whether it was due to our hosts or the hotel, but we did experience excellent service the entire time we were there. Breakfast was excellent catering to any tastes. The spa facilities which included a jacuzzi, indoor swimming pool, 3 saunas & a steam were most enjoyable and no charge for guests of the hotel. Right across the street from a huge park with access to the train station & city shopping centre. Although the hotel is on a main street the glass of the windows was toughened & consequently very quiet. The only criticism would be that the temperature in the room was too hot at night. Otherwise, all good.
