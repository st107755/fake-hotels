The hotel is located close to the city, yet has immediate access to beautiful park areas.  The most special aspect of my multiple stays has been the outstanding customer service provided by Lucie Bach in the Le Cassoulet Restaurant.  You won't find a better breakfast, or professional service as provided by Lucie anywhere in town.
