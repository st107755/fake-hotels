I stayed at the Le Meridien for 4 nights on a recent trip to Stuttgart. The hotel itself was excellent - large, comfortable rooms and excellent service. Unfortunately the hotel is located right across from a massive metro construction zone that really looks like it may take years to complete. Thankfully the soundproofing and black out curtains mean't that once in your room the construction wasn't really noticed.
