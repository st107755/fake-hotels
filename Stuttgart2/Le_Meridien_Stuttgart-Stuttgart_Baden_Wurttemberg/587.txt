I had my wedding ring stolen by a member of staff. They did not even report it to the police. I was there on a business trip and had to go searching for a police station myself to report it. Guy at the front desk told me "they trust their staff" and I did not even receive an apology or offer of compensation.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone but if you happen to be staying there do not leave any valuables in the room.
