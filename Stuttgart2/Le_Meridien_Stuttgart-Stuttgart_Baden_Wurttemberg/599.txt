The Meridien is a very well located hotel close to the centre of Stuttgart and our room was extremely comfortable and spacious. However neither of these things mark the hotel out as special - what does are the staff. Every one from those at check-in to the barman were incredibly helpful and made our short stay so memorable. Mischa Antemann should be singled out for especial praise but he was one of many great staff memners at the hotel.
