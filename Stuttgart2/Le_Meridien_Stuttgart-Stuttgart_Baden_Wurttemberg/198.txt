Stayed at Le Meridien for 2 nights.  We arrived in a rental car which needed to be returned by 1pm. Upon realising that the drop off location closed at 12pm, Gotz was very helpful and advised us to drive to Central Station and return it to the office there. He contacted the office so when we arrived they were aware of our situation and made the return seamless.  Gotz also provided us with with information on Stuttgart, places to visit and transport options for visiting Porsche Museum. It's always nice to be greeted by a concierge wearing the golden keys.  We were checked in by Marco (Front Office Manager), who was very professional and friendly. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and had complimentary breakfast included for the duration of our stay.  Great service provided fromâ€¦
