The location was good with the main shopping and station a short walk throughthe park. There is a bus stop around the corner from the hotel which gives you links to the town and station if you did not want to walk through park. Lovely room with plenty of room for extra bed. The spa was superb and treated ourselves to a massage which was wonderful.  Thank you for a lovely weekend.  The staff were extremely helpful with a special mention to the spa team.
