I spent 1 night and day at the hotel and was totally convinced of its dedication to customer service.  Arriving late, the staff did everything necessary to make me feel welcome and insure that I was settled.  Dinner at La Casoulet was superb with personal service and attention that was welcomed.  A central location close to the train station made this a perfect choice for me.
