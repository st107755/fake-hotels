I stopped in this hotel and my first impressions was good.  The receptionist can speak good English and are very polite. We did get put in a room with a double bed apose to 2 singles. The rooms are clean and very modern. The bar is very nice with a wide range of options but what we did see was a lot of young women with elderly men keep coming and going and a lot of young women around the bar area so i would recommend to be wary. Apart from that i enjoyed my stay and would recommend.
