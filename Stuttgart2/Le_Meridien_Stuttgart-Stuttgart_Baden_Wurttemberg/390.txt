This hotel was very centrally located, close to the train station and would ordinarily have gotten 5 stars from me. But, the road construction right in front of the hotel was off-putting. But the service was phenomenal. Particularly Marcel, one of the bartenders in the bar. He gave us great suggestions for Christmas markets to visit and a fabulous recommendation for dinner - made us a reservation and got us a taxi. We wanted to eat real Swabian food, not tourist food, and Marcel certainly delivered. Made for a very enjoyable stay.
