We stayed here with Starwood Points, so I can't comment On value. But Location is 5 minutes from Train Station. Staff very. Nice room, clean wih jacuzzi tub. Conceirge Marcus very helpful, he  Set our Navigation system On Rental car before we Left Stuttgart. Didn't eat at hotel, read that Breakfast "pricey", but we didn't try it.
