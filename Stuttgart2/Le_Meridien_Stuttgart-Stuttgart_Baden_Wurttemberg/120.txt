The plate inside the elevator indicates 1987 as construction year. A great part of the hotel dates back to the late 80s. The conference room level on -1 seems pretty original. In other words: the hotel is dated.  My room was renovated, the windows were ok as well. Do ask for a renovated room. My room faced the Stuttgart21 construction site which was noisy during day time. Also, lots of traffic, too. The receptionists were effective and polite.   The hotel is 15min walking from main station, yet a lot of stairs.
