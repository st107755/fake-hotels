So to put the good up front - the hot tub here is excellent.  And the garage is nice and spacious.  But aside from that I'd stay somewhere else.  Basically this hotel looks like it was new and fresh in the mid-90's but that nothing's been done to it since except the standard addition of a flat screen TV.  Everything else is quite dated.  Internet access - a disaster - wired only, no wireless!  I haven't seen that in a hotel in 4-5 years.  At least they provided the cable in the room.  19 Euros for 24 hours.  Location - worse than I expected.  It's next to a park yes, but a four lane road separates you from the park (traffic) and frankly it's not really walking distance to anything unless you're a powerwalker.  It's just not a good location.  No convenient access to any of the Uâ€¦
