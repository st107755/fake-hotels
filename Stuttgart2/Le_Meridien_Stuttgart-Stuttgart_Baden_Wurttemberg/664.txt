We stayed at this hotel primarily for one reason, the pool/spa. We tried to use the pool and Jaccuzi but the former was far too cold for anything other than competitive swimming (but a small pool so even that was not an option) and the latter was broken down.  The hotel claimed that 27 degrees celsius was normal for Germany. Having stayed in the Arabella Grand hotel Munich just over a year earlier, I KNOW this not to be the case. Indeed in my review of that hotel , I complimented the great pool scene.  As the weather was so cold, we had really been looking forward to using the pool each evening after a day out in the cold. A BIG let down. Saving money on heating the pool is a real false economy. We ate at the hotel one evening and it was a superb meal, we had the set 5 courseâ€¦
