Le Meridien Stuttgart is a large business hotel, at which we got a great rate for a weekend in August (€125, inc late check out at 8pm).  The staff, the service, the rooms, bar and restaurant are all 5 star standard and the pool is lovely.  The saunas and steam room are modern and of a great standard (no clothes in the sauna area, which you soon get used to in Germany!).    We travelled straight from Germany to Italy, which made the difference between the hotels in both countries even more stark.  This hotel is large, modern, clean, efficient, welcoming and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  We arrived in Stuttgart by train.  From the station it is 5-10 minutes walk across the park but then your choice is to climb 40 or so steps to a footbridge, go across and come down…
