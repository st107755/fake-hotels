Well located hotel near town centre and train station. Our room was modern, bright and complete will all the features expected of a Le Meridien. All the staff we met were very friendly, helpful and English speaking! Outstanding were reception and the breakfast hostess who were both friendly and efficient. Overall an excellent choice if you are visiting Stuttgart.
