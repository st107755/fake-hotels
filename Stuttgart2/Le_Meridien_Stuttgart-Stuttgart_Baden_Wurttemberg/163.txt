Greeted by professional and personable staff at the check-in. The room was as advertised, very clean and modern. Great bed. The fitness facilities were exceptional. One of the best equipped and spaced hotel gyms I have ever experienced. There is also hot tubs, sauna, steam and a pool. Great facility. The only negative is that there is a lot of construction in the area. I did not hear it nor did effect me other than an inconvenience for driving and walking. Great location, very central to transit, shopping and access to the highways.
