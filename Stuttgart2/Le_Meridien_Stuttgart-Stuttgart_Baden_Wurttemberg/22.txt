Lived up to the Le Meridien brand that we've come to expect from staying at several Le Meridiens all over the world.  Staff: last minute a day before, I decide I wanted to see a performance of the Stuttgart Ballet while in town and the hotel's concierge came through and had the tickets ready for us when we checked in. That helped make the Stuttgart portion of our trip a memorable one and I really appreciate that. Also, friendly and helpful front desk staff.  Location & Transportation: no noise or road blockage issues from the construction across the street at all. Convenient parking garage below the hotel. Conveniently located close to several subway stops. Easy 10-15 minute walk to the Mitte area. We attended the Cannstatter Volksfest during our stay and it was an easy tramâ€¦
