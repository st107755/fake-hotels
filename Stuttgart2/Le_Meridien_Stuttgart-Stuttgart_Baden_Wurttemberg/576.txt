We spent a fantastic time at this hotel. From the moment we arrived until check out we enjoyed it. The staff is professional, the rooms are modern, the bed is great and everything is very clean. Very nice pool (approx 11m)  and small fitness . Breakfast was of outstanding quality and service.   The parking on the other side of the street offers a night for 4,80.  Fortunately I can mention that gay couples are very welcome, I believe the experience of another traveler who mentioned issues about it on this website was an exception.    Thanks to the Meridien team for this stay!
