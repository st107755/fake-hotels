I've stayed at the Le Meridien for several weeks and the experience is truly wonderful. Stefan Hummel has assembled a world-class team (Lisa, Marcus and Nadine). Thank you. You all are the reason the Le Meridien is 5 stars.  When you travel as much as I do, having a home away from home feeling is comforting. Every morning the staff greets me, knows my name and is always accommodating.   The hotel accommodations are excellent. Large rooms, good gym and Spa. Breakfast buffet is very good. The restaurants are very good Le Medoc is a nice on property French dining experience. The location is excellent and walking distance to the main station.    If you like to exercise the Rosenstein Park , directly in front of the Hotel, provides several km of beautiful running trails. See pic ofâ€¦
