Would not stay here again.  The rate of $200 per night excluded breakfast, wifi, parking.  Room nice but not worth the price especially facing Wily Brandt Str. which is very noisy.  Additionally, we received the most incredibly rude response from an employee in reception to our request for a king size bed.  "We're not accustomed to having two men share a bed."  Though receptive to our complaint, management simply provided a bottle of wine as an apology.    Upon check out also got a bill of $130 for parking, wifi, coffee & tea room service for 2 days.
