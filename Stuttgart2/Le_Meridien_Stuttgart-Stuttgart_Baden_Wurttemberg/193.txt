We traveled in a family of 4 and booked two connecting rooms. Rooms were spacious. Bathrooms, however, are different. One has a bathtub, while another does not have. Breakfast were very good with plenty of choices. We especially love the fresh honey and fresh orange juices which you could squeeze the juice by yourself. Check in and out were a breeze.   The only downside may be is the location is not very close to public transportation. The hotel is close to the park though and there is a beer garden very close by. You can walk to the main train station, but with the construction going on it is going to take around 10-15 minutes.
