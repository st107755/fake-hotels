We (family of four, two adults, two children) stayed for two nights at Le Meridien Stuttgart last week.  As other reviewers have noted, the whole of Stuttgart is under construction which makes walking into the town from the hotel tricky.  Our suite was well appointed, but we were very disappointed by the air conditioning (or rather lack of it). The room would not cool down and were told by maintenance there was nothing they could do.  Given the hotel is located in front of a busy highway, we couldn't open the windows at night to cool down.    There is (what was and could be) a delightful garden area in the middle of the hotel.  It was closed to guests and we were unsure if it currently being renovated.  It would have been a lovely place to sit outside on a warm summer's evening.â€¦
