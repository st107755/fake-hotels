This is the first time we have done a Xmas Market break and it won't be the last. We stayed at the Meridien which was a great choice. We had a good deal through BA after booking our flights, 2 Double rooms which were excellently appointed.  The Hotel had everything you could want from food to drink all different choices Staff were brilliant and we could not fault anything.  We had a French Buffet one night which was excellent value at 39 euros eat as much as you want and the food was brilliant.  I could rave on all night about this hotel, but instead if anyone wants info please feel free to ask.
