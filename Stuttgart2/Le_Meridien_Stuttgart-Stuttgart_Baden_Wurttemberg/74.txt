Overall a very nice hotel but awful internet 😖!!! When we complained they told us to log back again and then gave us a code that did not work ... and that a technician was coming the following day.. same story was told the following day... Such a basic service now a days !!! We also mentioned when we did our check out and they didn’t attempt to say anything 😏 Parking is 24 € (inside the hotel) and breakfast is around 25 € ... you can get a great breakfast nearby for a third of that ... if you just want a coffee in the morning they don’t sell it either. There is kettle in the room for coffee.
