I have stayed in this hotel several times now and it is certainly the best hotel in Stuttgart. The location is great, the rooms are spacious and beautifully finished and the staff are exceptional ! It would take a lot to beat the experience of a stay here.  I look forward to my next visit and thank you for looking after me again 👍
