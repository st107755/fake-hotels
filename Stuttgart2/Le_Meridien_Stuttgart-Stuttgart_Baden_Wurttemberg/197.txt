My Family of six stayed here for one night and the service was amazing! Everyone was helpful right from the start. The Guest relations manager "Verena Kirchenbauer" came out and greeted us and made sure we had everything we needed! We stayed in a Jr. Suite and the room was extremely clean. Thanks for a wonderful experience!
