We spent 1 night (2 rooms) at the Stuttgart Le Meridian March 2019.   Very walkable from the train station but through a major construction site which was a little confusing at first but absolutely doable.  Rooms were comfortable and clean.  The pool and fitness area was spotless and very well equiped.  The breakfast was amazing.  From the chef that prepared generous made-to-order omlettes to the beautiful dripping fresh honeycomb and everything imaginable in between.  When the fron desk agent asks at check-on if you'd like to prepay for breakfast say yes.
