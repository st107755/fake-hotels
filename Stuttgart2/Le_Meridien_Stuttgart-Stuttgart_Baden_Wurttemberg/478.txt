Having endured a poor hotel in Belgium we hoped to find our stay in Stuttgart would be met with the usual German efficiency.We arrived in very heavy traffic to find the hotel was situated on a very busy ring road with some building work apparently taking place outside.We were in a motoring group of circa 50 cars but were checked in quickly thanks to our efficient tor operator who had arrived early.Room was at the front but was quiet thanks to double glazing traffic noise was minimal.As hotel is some distance from centre we decided to book a table for 6 people at 8pm.We arrived promptly and were dealt with a young and very friendly waitress who took our order.The first course eventually arrived at 9-45 !!! We were told the kitchen was very busy !  Had our waitress not been soâ€¦
