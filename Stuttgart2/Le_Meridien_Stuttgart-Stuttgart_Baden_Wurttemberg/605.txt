Le Meridien hotel is within a walking distance from main shopping street, very close to main railway station and next to nice large park.  Hotel reception is impressive and service excellent. Hotel has spa facilities and restaurant / bar. Breakfast is marvellous - choice is large and tasty.  Hotel rooms are large and equipped with all amenities. Hotel is facing very busy street, but windows are really soundproof, I slept like a baby. Additional services - when I arrived by taxi and taxidriver didn't accept cards, receptionist paid by cash instead of me and I was able to pay the bill by card while checking out.
