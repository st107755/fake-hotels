No Working WiFi (hello people, its the 21st century... and you promise your high end BonVoy elites FREE WiFi). Another Marriott promise broken.  The restaurant is gross and mismanaged.  No A/C.  Paper thin walls, couldn't get a decent night's rest with all the noise.  We weren't comfortable here, you probably won't be either.
