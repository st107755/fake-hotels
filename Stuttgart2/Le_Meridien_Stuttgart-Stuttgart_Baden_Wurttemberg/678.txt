First and major comment : the quality of the staff. From the doorman to all other employees met during our sta^y, everybody has been kind, helpful, and willing to make us feel welcome. Broce Le Meridien. The location is fine : 10 min walk from the city center's main attractions. The room was spacefull, tastely decorated and impecable. Definitely a good place to stay in Stuttgart.
