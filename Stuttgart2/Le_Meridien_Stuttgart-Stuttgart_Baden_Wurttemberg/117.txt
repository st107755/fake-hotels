It's a beautiful and well maintained hotel in the centre of Stuttgart. Because of my SPG status nice upgrade to a renovated junior suite. I really like the new design, specially the wooden floors. Cozy hotel bar with great staff. In the morning they serve a delicious breakfast with lots of fresh fruits and juices. 'll definitely come back if I have to be in Stuttgart
