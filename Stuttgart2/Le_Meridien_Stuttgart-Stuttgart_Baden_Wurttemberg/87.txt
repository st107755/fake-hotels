The hotel is a short walk from the train station, through a park. The staff throughout my stay was super friendly and helpful. Hilariously, right after I checked in, they all changed into dirndl and lederhosen for the Cannstatter Volksfest. Very cute.  My room was quiet (note: I was in back, not the busy street), modern and comfortable. Because we were close to the main train station, it was easy to get everywhere.
