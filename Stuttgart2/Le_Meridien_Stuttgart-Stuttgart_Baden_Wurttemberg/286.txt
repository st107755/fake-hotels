End of business trip, flight out of Stuttgart was not until Saturday afternoon. Got favourable rate, and got 4 PM checkout without paying anything extra! Huge plus! Very good breakfast buffet, with very friendly servers. Had nice, quiet room facing the courtyard. In general, would say that all staff I ran into, bar, breakfast, concierge, check in/out, all were very friendly and attentive. Will definitively look for room here on my next stay in Stuttgart.
