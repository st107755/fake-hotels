The Meridien in Stuttgart really leaves very little wishes open. It's in the middle of town, has a quiet but luxurious atmosphere, some art, comfortable rooms (which just get renovated), a reasonably well-equipped gym and very friendly staff. The absolute highlight of the place is the breakfast, which doesn't leave any wish open, you definitely have to try it!  On the downside is the ongoing construction work outside, the little view from the rear-facing rooms and the missing club room, but here we're talking very high standards. For me this is the best hotel in town!
