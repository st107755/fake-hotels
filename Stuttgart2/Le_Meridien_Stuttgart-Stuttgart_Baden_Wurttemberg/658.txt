We stayed at this hotel for almost a week and we really had a very nice stay. The hotel staff and housekeepers are very good. Breakfast is rich but rather expensive. It is located near the center and the central station although you have to walk about 10-15 minutes through a park and the stairs to reach the hotel are a little tiring if you have suitcases. Jacuzzi was excellent but the swimming pool was too cold. Also the lights in the room were very weak. Generally a good, modern,clean,central enough hotel in Stuttgart
