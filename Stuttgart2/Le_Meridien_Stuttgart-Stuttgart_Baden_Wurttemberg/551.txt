I am very familiar with Stuttgart, having lived in the city for a few years and having traveled there occasionally on business over the past couple of years. I've always heard great things about Le Meridien and wasn't disappointed. Very modern rooms and extremely friendly staff, and everything was very clean. I never got breakfast, as I couldn't stomach the thought of paying 25 euros for it, but as the hotel is about a 3 minute walk from the Staatsgalerie U-bahn stop, it was easy to access other cafes and get into the heart of the city.
