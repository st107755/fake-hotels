Le Meridien was fantastic hotel. The service is the best you will get and quality of hotel rooms great. We had a basic room and it still had a garden view with all the trimmings.  There are some serious road works going on due to a complete rebuild of the main train station, other than causing some issues with access to the park directly opposite it wasn't that big a deal. The hotel has a pool with all the sauna/steam room facilities you could ask for.  Staff were always helpful and nice.  Parking is available under the hotel but it's not cheap at â‚¬25.
