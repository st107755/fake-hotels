I enjoyed my recent short stay at Le Meridien.  My room was well thought out and instantly comfortable. I had a great night's sleep.  Staff were thoughtful and highly professional.  We wished we had more time to enjoy all this hotel had to offer.  All in all world class property and a sure bet in Stuttgart.
