The hotel is 8 minutes from the Stuttgart central train station and 20 minutes from the airport by cab 35 minutes by train direct.  The hotel services, bar and breakfast were as good as one can expect.  Newly renovated hotel rooms  were spacious and well appointed.  Pool open 24 hours and SPA was wonderful.  Would stay here again when in the area.  Only drawback for walkers is the local area construction has closed a lot of sidewalks.  no idea how long till its finished.
