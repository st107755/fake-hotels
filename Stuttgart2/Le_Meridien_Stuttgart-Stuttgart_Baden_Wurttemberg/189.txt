Very nice experience.  Hotel wise the rooms are just luxurious and great. 10 minutes walk from the railway station.  The Spa needs to be used! Restaurant: German specialities. Try "Maultaschen" German ravioli.  The cocktails are to be used and abused.  Bartenders Mousa and Chriss... just ask for them! Very kind and professional!
