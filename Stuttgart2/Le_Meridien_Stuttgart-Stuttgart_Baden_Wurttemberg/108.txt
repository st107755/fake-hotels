We thoroughly enjoyed or stay at Le Meridian over New Year. The room was clean and spacious with a large comfortable bed.  Staff were friendly and helpful at check in.  Bar staff were friendly and cocktails were superb.  Location was good for us as it was relatively quiet, close to the main train station and a comfortable walk to the main areas.
