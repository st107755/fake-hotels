This hotel is top of the line in every way. The service was OUTSTANDING. We were treated well from the moment we arrived; no matter who we dealt with, they were friendly and courteous in a way we had not experienced in 10 days! The room was huge, spacious and clean. The hotel bar serves delicious drinks as well as coffees. If you are a Starwood member they treat you even better (we were not, but we got a glimpse of the perks). This is the kind of hotel that remembers who you are, that offers to charge your iPhone if you forgot your charger, and that asks you sincerely if you enjoyed your stay. Bravo.  The hotel is very well located. A bridge takes you directly to the park, which is huge and lovely to walk through. Or take the steps and come out near downtown, where you can shopâ€¦
