This hotel is centrally located near shopping, restaurants, and train station.   The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We needed assistance in shipping our souvenirs back home and the concierge was incredibly helpful and accommodating. The spa and pool are top-notch, the rooms very spacious. The hotel bar and restaurant were terrific. On our last evening we toasted to a wonderful vacation, enjoying a scrumptious French buffet at the hotel. Would definitely enjoy this hotel again.
