Have just stayed at the Meridian for 4 nights with a trip to Heidelberg midway staying over night, this was no problem for The Concierge who kept the bulk of our luggage safely and ensured it was deposited in our new rooms on our return. Hotel facilties excellent, indoor pool mostly empty, fabulous breakfasts , obliging staff, no complaints whatsoever. Welldone !
