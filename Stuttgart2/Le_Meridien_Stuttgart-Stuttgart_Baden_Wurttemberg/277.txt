Nine friends and I enjoyed 3 days in Stuttgart. We stayed in this hotel. It was really nice. Very polite staff, a quality run establishment. The only thing that let it down was the serving and counting of the drinks bought from the bar. As lovely as the bar maid was, she made the same mistake on both the nights we frequented the bar. She took the order but forgot that she hadn't poured a drink, and when asked for that drink she poured another. Then came time to pay the bill. And each night an extra drink was on there.  We were too polite to tell her. I understand a big order has a lot to remember. Maybe taking the order in two's or three's may be better for her.  Otherwise really nice place.
