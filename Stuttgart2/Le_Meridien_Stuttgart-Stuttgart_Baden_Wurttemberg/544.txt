The food is very very good in the hotel.  Room is clean.  the Location is just down the street from an Art Museum in which the hotel provides tickets.  On the down side there is no free internet service.  In today's world that's like saying you have to pay extra for a phone in your room.  Internet service is a reality that most hotel chains understand is a must.   Check in staff was helpful.  If your not a gold member of the Starwood program and just a preferred member it does not get you anything.  Club Carlson has free internet for hotel guests.  I travel a lot for my work and I can choose where I stay.
