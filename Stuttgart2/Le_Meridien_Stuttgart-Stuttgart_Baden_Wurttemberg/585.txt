Had another great stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.  The most friendly and knowledgeable front desk staff; great food (I love breakfast!) and relaxing spa.  The only downside (if you can call it that) is that the Internet is a bit pricey.  I think it would be great if the hotel had at least free Wi Fi in the lobby.  I will most definitely be back for another visit!
