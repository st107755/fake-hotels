The rooms are really spacious, chic design, and amazingly comfortable beds. Food really nice, great facilities, and lovely staff.  The location is 5 mins walk from the hauptbahnhof, and about 20 mins drive from the airport.   I believe this is the best hotel in the city! It has a classy traditional, but chic hotel feel inside. Recommended. :)
