Le Meridien is about a mile from the centre of Stuttgart.  It is an easy walk into the town.  The Christmas market was amazing - one of the best we have visited.  The hotel was comfortable and the swimming  pool and spa area is lovely.  Our room was clean and very comfortable. Wonderful, big bed.  We did not book the hotel breakfasts (expensive) but instead chose to visit one of the many cafes in the town.  We visited the Porsche and Mercedes museums which are just short train/bus rides from the centre.  They are both excellent.
