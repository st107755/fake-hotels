A weekend getaway.  The hotel was lovely, although it over looked a busy road there was no traffic noise. Across the road was a park at the end of the park there were the high street shops.  We had a lovely big room with a desk and chair. The bathroom was great too.  Breakfast was served downstairs in the restaurant it was really busy. The food was lovely. We ate in the hotel one evening it was expensive and there was no vegetarian options. Still an enjoyable meal.    The swimming pool and jacuzzi was super. There was also a small gym.
