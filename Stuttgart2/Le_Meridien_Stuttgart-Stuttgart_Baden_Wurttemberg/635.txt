This is a smart and comfortable hotel and was just as I had expected from reviews on trip advisor.  I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the complete lack of effort by the bar staff to move on a persistent and blatant prostitute repeatedly trying to get my attention and invading my privacy whilst having an 8.00pm supper at the hotel's bar.   Maybe late at night some guests want these services, but i didn't and I would have expected the hotel management to take a firmer line.
