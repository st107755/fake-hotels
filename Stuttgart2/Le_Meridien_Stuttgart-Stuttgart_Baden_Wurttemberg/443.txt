It says it all above. I will add the guts at the bar were fantastic and accommodated my unusual drinks request. Breakfast was great and a fantastic selection was offered. You do have to walk over a bridge to get to the centre which is fine in the day but I wouldn't recommend it at night. We took taxis due to the scary looking characters hanging around the other side of the bridge!
