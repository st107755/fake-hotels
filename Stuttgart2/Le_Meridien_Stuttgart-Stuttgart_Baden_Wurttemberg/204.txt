We chose the Le Meridien Stuttgart for its great location by Schlossgarten etc. That's functional and we liked the ease of accessing the inner city. The rooms were rather too functional for our liking. Breakfast was rather disappointing: okay choice but overcrowded (no free tables, guests scrambling for food and space) and early finish (10:30, on a weekend!). The spa was outright disappointing: again overcrowded, not enough seating space, everything soaked, and no staff to be seen. I was lying next to empty glasses and a half-eaten apple for an hour, when I decided I had had enough.
