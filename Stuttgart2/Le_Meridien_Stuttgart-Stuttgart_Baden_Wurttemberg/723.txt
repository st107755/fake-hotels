I had reserved this hotel for my husband's birthday celebration while we were visiting Stuttgart.  This hotel was not exactly easy to get to.  There were 2 options: taking a taxi or meandering through the big garden with luggages.  I did the latter.  It was a good 20 minute walk from Stuttgart's main train station.  Good thing my luggage had wheels.  I checked into a room with a queen bed.  It came with a flat screen TV.  The funny thing was the guest before us left his stuff in the room to be delivered to the next Le Meridien hotel.  When I checked in, his stuff was still in supposedly my room at the moment.  Housekeeping failed to restock the bottle water in the room.  I had to order room service for water.  The charges were waived upon checkout.  We were "comped" with buffetâ€¦
