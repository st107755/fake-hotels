I just stayed in this hotel for 1 day. The rooms are really nice, modern and comfort. The breakfast is great as well, they have everything you need. The hotel looks luxury from outside and from inside. The only negative part was that the checkin took a bit long. We were with a group of seven and it looked like they were not prepared for us to checkin while the reservation was made before.
