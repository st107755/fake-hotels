I spent 2 nights here while visiting the Christmas markets. We arrived by train and it's only a few minutes walk from the station. We checked in and asked the staff some information about some shopping we wanted to do, they were very helpful. Walking out of the hotel we could smell the mulled wine and candied nuts from the hotel, it's a short walk to the main squares.   The room was really spacious and the beds we're really comfortable, we were looking out onto the main road but there was no noise from the road.   The breakfast buffet is â‚¬25 but there is great choice and plentiful. The hotel bar is nice and relaxing. The lobby feels like you are in a lovely old building despite the exterior appearing more like a modern building.
