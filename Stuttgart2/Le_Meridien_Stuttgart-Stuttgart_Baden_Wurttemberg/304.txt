We stayed in the hotel for two nights and had a wonderful experience.  The staff is very friendly, helpful and highly skilled. We had one wonderful dinner at the Restaurant and enjoyed very good cocktails in the bar.  The wellness area is als very nice.  The location of the hotel is ideal for walking into the city center of Stuttgart.
