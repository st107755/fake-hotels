This hotel has a great location right across the street (with an overhead walking bridge) from a beautiful park and an easy stroll to the main train station, lots of restaurants, cafes, and shopping. A block from the "U" that makes getting almost anywhere in the city a breeze. The room was nice and clean. Only complaint is that the air conditioning didn't really cool the room at night.
