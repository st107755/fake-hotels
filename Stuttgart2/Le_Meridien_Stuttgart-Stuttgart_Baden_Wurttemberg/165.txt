We had a fantastic two night stay here. The level of service and quality you've come to expect from Me Meridien!   Rooms are clean, comfortable and modern. Breakfast was phenomenal and staff are always ready to assist.  Location is central and my only comment would be to make the overnight parking more cost effective for hotel guests.
