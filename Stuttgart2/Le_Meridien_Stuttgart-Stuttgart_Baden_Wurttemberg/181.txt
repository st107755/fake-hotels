We researched this hotel online and it looked very good, had good reviews and was in the right location (easy walking distance to the very interesting town of Stuttgart. Upon arrival you are very aware of the massive construction works happening out the front and across the road from the hotel, which from an accessibility and visual point of view diminishes the features of this hotel! The hotel itself was very good, with excellent staff, a great lobby with a great collection of sculptures and other art. The rooms were impressive, good internet, free parking and a brilliant pool, spa and sauna! Breakfast was very good with a good selection and good service. The small restaurant Medoc was quite good but not brilliant. Unfortunately a good hotel was spoilt by the construction site.
