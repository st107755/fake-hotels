Genuinely friendly staff throughout the hotel from the front desk to the breakfast buffet to the housekeepers. Nicely finished and very comfortable rooms. Well-located within walking distance to museums, restaurants, shopping, and interesting parts of town. It's true that there is a huge construction area across from the hotel, but I never heard any noise and it is ready enough to walk past when headed into town. We had a very nice stay.
