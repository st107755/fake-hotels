Short trip to Germany for one night, decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel in Stuttgart. Booked over the phone, got 2 rooms next to eachother and parking at half price. Dog 25.- Euro extra. Very friendly staff. Located on a major street with lot's of traffic, but just across the "Schlossgarten" (large park) and walking distance to city center with main shopping street. Small but nice Spa (with pool). Breakfast buffet one of the best I have recently seen. Our rooms were facing the small garden, the ones on the street side would probably be very loud, if you like to sleep with the window open. The rooms are rather small but very clean and upper class quality. Very comfortable beds. No free Wifi in the rooms (in the lobby yes).
