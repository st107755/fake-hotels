I spent a few nights at Le Meridien as a solo traveler. The hotel room was extremely clean and comfortable (great beds!), and the service was great. I also tried the bar/restaurant area, and enjoyed the food and service there as well. The gym has good equipment and was better than most hotel gyms. The location was okay. I walked through the park area even late at night and felt safe. I was a little wary at first, but it turned out to be fine. The wi-fi service was not cheap and even after paying the signal was extremely spotty and basically useless in the room. The 'business center' was not worth the expense. Besides the poor connectivity amenities, I would say the stay was overall pleasant and comfortable due to cleanliness and service.
