Not a bad hotel and definetly one of the picks for Stuttgart.  Nice and clean and well done up.  The breakfast is good (despite it's steep price).  We were on the road side but did not notice the traffic noise at all.  It is in a good location, just a short walk from the city centre.  The beds were a tad hard for my liking, but still OK.  Just wish there was a clock in the room.  The pool and spa area were fantastic and nice and quiet.  Not too many restaurants close by, but after a little walk you can find a couple of OK ones.  I would stay here again if I came back to Stuttgart.
