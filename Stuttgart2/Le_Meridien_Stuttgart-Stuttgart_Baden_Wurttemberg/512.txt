Occasionally you stay at a hotel that has a high opinion of itself despite the evident problems. This supposedly luxurious hotel has plastic service, bland rooms and a prison block style layout. Low floors internally have reduced natural light and externally face a busy road. The breakfast resturant has no natural light and a bizarre layout that sits everybody in a corridor. There is no evident service and breakfast required assertiveness in the queues. When I pointed out the issues in the hotel's own quality survey I received an aggressive email from the assistant manager asking for more evidence. Hmmm.
