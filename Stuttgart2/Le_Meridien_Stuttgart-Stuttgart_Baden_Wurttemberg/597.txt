This was our third stay at the Le Meridien Stuttgart. We again enjoyed our stay. The rooms are modern and quiet (ours was facing the back). The staff was extremly helpful and friendly. One of the highlights is the daily breakfast buffet - the amount of choices is breathtaking, and the service absolutely outstanding!  We barely had cleaned a plate, and it was already removed. Superb choices of freshly baked bread. The spa is first class, the massage we had booked was one of the best we ever had. Two minor flaws this time: Room service brought the wrong dish and forgot a drink order, but corrected it within reasonable time.  Upon checkout, we were charged a daily parking fee despite the fact that we had arrived by train . . . but this was also immediately fixed. I assume this feeâ€¦
