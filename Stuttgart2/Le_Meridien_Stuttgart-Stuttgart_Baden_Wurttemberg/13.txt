I’m currently staying at this hotel and there are many great benefits. First, I will say that the staff and in particular the bar restaurant staff is extremely attentive, friendly, and really goes out of their way to make their long term individuals feel at home.   The parking garage has been ideal and is always very easy to get in and out of which I appreciate very much.  The morning breakfast is probably the best that I have experienced in a very long Time. Even if i am in a rush they will provide me a box to go and it has plenty of room to get all of the amazing meats cheeses and breakfast items I could want. It is very impressive  One of the only disappointing things has been the cleaning service. There have been times when I have requested service towards the end of the day…
