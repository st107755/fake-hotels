Nice hotel, across street from tram stop or a short walk to the main train station.   It is on a busy street, but we had a room on the street and with the windows closed has no noise.    Nice spa and pool.   One of the nicest buffet breakfasts in European hotels.   My only knock on this hotel is that it does charge 6 euros for internet in your hotel room, but it's free in the lobby.   Most people for just a short time on the internet just go down to the lobby to use the internet for free.    This was the only hotel we stayed in during our Europe trip that charged us for internet in the hotel room. but otherwise a very nice hotel.
