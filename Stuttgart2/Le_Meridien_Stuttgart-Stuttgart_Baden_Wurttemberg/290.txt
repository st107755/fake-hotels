I stayed for 3 nights at the Le Meridien Stuttgart with a group of friends.  We enjoyed the hotel, especially the accommodating staff and spa area.  As of May 2016 some guest rooms are renovated and modern, some are a bit dated.  Mine was one of the unrenovated rooms, but it was still clean and did not appear worn.  My room faced the train station and busy Willy-Brandt-Straße, but the windows provided adequate sound insulation.  The Stuttgart Central Station is in the early phases of a ten-year reconstruction project, so construction is unavoidable in this part of the city.  This meant frequent walks through the construction site paths to reach the city center, a minor inconvenience but  worth it for the superior Le Meridien experience.    We appreciated the expansive spa area…
