This hotel is a good choice in Stuttgart if you want a clean, modern hotel with relatively easy access in and out of Stuttgart.  The hotel is on a main, busy road though we did not experience any noise problems and it is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Koenigstrasse, the main shopping area, and restaurants.  Beware it is not easy to wander downtown and find restaurants open on Sunday evenings.  The rooms are very clean and spacious, while the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  We were able to get adjoining rooms for our family of four.  We pre-paid for wi-fi access in the room, which was much cheaper than the hourly use rate.  Though it bothers me that mid-to-high priced hotels still charge for wi-fi, where most small hotels and inns provide it free
