We stayed here for one night to visit the Christmas Market. It's a bit tricky to get to the hotel from the train station as there is tons of construction going on in the area so many paths are closed. Once we arrived at the hotel they told us about the bridges to walk over so once we found that out it was pretty easy to get in and out of town. Though the walk is around 15 minutes to the Christmas Market so not super close or crazy far. The distance did deter us from coming back in the afternoon for a rest though. Once we were out in the town we just stayed out for the day.  The hotel is very nice with a large lobby. We arrived at 2:30pm and they said our room wasn't ready for checkin yet so we decided to have a drink and snack at the bar. The bar is cozy and service friendly andâ€¦
