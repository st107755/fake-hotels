Excellent hotel from the minute walking in to leaving. Front desk was superb.  Don't be fooled by the age of the building. Inside is all modern. Love the lighting and toiletries. The peppermint shampoo is a winner. I am a Gold Elite member so I get extras including upgrade and complimentary extras.  But I am sure the quality of the service and food extends to all guests.  Note. If you are coming to Stuttgart from the train, there is a new station being built which makes the walk from HBF to the hotel a maze. I suggest get a cab.
