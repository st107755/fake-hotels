We arrived at the Le Meridien around 10:00 a.m. after a long flight from the United States.   The front desk personnel were warm and accomodating and allowed us to check into our rooms immediately.    We were also able to delay our checkout until 4:00 p.m. the next day.  The rooms were spacious, clean, and decorated nicely.  The concierge and bellhops were  very helpful  and very friendly.  The hotel is located close to the center of town.    If I return to Stuttgart I would DEFINITELY stay at the Le Meridien.
