Le Meridien is a beautiful hotel in Stuttgart. From the outside, you wouldn't think that it would be a luxurious hotel, but when you step inside, you quickly realize you are surrounded by beauty. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Stefan, the front desk manager, was so welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. We arrived before check in and our room wasn't ready so we relaxed in the beautiful spa. When we arrived to our room, we had a plate of fresh fruit and chocolates with a lovely note welcoming us to the hotel. The rooms are very clean, beds are super comfy, and the decor is quite modern. The pool and spa are beautiful and relaxing. The dining was wonderful as well. The breakfast buffet had so much variety and you could tell the food was very good qualityâ€¦
