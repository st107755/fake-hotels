Le Meridien Hotel is located beside a busy main road about 10 minutes walk from the main railway station in Stuttgart. ( turn left and walk through the park). It is a luxurious and peaceful hotel with courteous and professional staff. Our bedroom was a triple and it was spotlessly clean with white bedlinens , comfortable beds , mod cons and safe. The bathroom was beautiful and well stocked with toiletries. The breakfast was delicious and very varied. We used the pool at the spa several times and it was very relaxing. This hotel is about 2 minutes walk( go left) to the nearest underground line (statsgallerie ). Overall I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel. It is about 10 minutes walk to Stuttgart with all its many shops, museums etc
