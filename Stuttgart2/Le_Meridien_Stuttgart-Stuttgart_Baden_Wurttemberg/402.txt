I'm used to having a hotel mini bar be expensive but most amenities were one which you had to pay for (internet). The bar was just as overpriced as I expected and unfortunately good restaurants are a fair walking distance away. The park across the street is also under major construction so there aren't any great views from the hotel. All that being said the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were extremely clean. The staff was mostly nice and courteous, with the exception of when some Fotbal players showed up and the staff attended them rather than me, which was somewhat understandable.
