Staid here multiple times over the last few years, and am quite happy.  Rooms: Decently sized, furnished in an contemporary style. Junior suites are roughly double the size of a standard room, but also the standard rooms are sufficiently spacious if traveling alone/as a couple. Starting to show a bit of wear, but still fine. Most rooms don't have a tub, so if you need that, be aware.  Food: As other reviewers have remarked, the breakfast is great. Nice choice of cheeses, fruit juices, hot items etc. The restaurant Cassoulet is also fine, and the bar serves good drinks and bar food.  Location: Location is so-so. The hotel directly faces a major road. The windows are soundproofed very well, so even if you stay in a room facing the road, you will hardly notice the noise. In orderâ€¦
