We stayed one Saturday night and were quite disappointed with the stay. The hotel is a grim looking building on a busy road. Despite requesting a quiet room we were first offered a road overlooking the road next to the lift that pinged every time it reached the floor. Given that we have been platinum members for 8 years this is really pretty appalling service. The second room we were offered was much quieter. The bed was very comfortable and the room had good light from the large window/door. The shower took over 4 minutes to even get to a temperature that was comfortable to get into in. (I know this because my electric toothbrush has a timer and I had plenty of time to brush my teeth whilst waiting)  Annoyingly on the Sunday morning we were woken by the hotel emergency alarmâ€¦
