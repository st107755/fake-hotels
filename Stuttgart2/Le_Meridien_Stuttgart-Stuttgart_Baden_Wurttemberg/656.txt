We stayed five nights at Le Meridien in Stuttgart in Apr/May 2010.  Though we've stayed at other hotels in Stuttgart solely for convenience, this is supposed to be one of the best - we decided to try it.  During our stay there was a construction site in the park across B14 (the major road in front of hotel).  I assume it was related to major construction beginning "Stuttgart 21" that will disrupt the downtown area for quite some time.  Not much a a view now.  Anyway, with the windows closed, the traffic, light and construction noise is minimal.  We like to sleep cool and the air conditioning isn't strong, so we did open the window for some fresh air-only did that once.  Lots of positives:   - hotel has quality appearance and style - spa (swimming pool and hot tub) are veryâ€¦
