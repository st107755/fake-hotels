I was in Germany for 2 weeks for a press trip/and pleasure and this was my favorite hotel! Ok - we are platinum SPG - but still, we don't always get upgraded even though we have 'suite upgrades.' this hotel graciously upgraded us - without asking for an upgrade coupon. And the room was fabulous! A small open plan suite - with a living room area, a desk and even a 'makeup table.' the room faced the garden, the windows opened and it was quiet! the bathroom/closet situation was great. But i think my favorite part was the uber elegant breakfast - a spacious , quiet room with a wide selection of fruits, meats, cheeses, and eggs and breads and desserts! Walked to the park, the Stuttgart ballet/opera and the "Hamburger Fischmrkt" a really fun outdoor evening festival of fish.
