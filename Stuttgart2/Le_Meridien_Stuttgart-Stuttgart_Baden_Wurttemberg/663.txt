The Le Meridien Stuttgart is a very nice hotel with a friendly staff.  We arrived after driving from Frankfurt and that was also after flying in from Los Angeles. So, we were quite tired but we also had to make an appointment within a couple of hours after getting to Stuttgart in the afternoon.  The bell staff was very friendly and helped us get organized so that we could be on our way.  Later, we enjoyed the hotel's modern style and the cleanliess, as well as the helpfulness of the staff with directions for driving the next day as we headed on our way south toward Ulm.  I would highly recommend the hotel: it's quiet and the beds are the sweet sleeper style beds that I'm so used to in the US-based Westin hotels.  I look forward to returning to Le Meridien Stuttgart.
