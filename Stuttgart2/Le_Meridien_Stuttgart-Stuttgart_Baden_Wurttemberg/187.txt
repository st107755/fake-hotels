I've been staying at this hotel for almost 9 years now with over 700 nights, and i can only say that it's a 2nd home for me. They definitely know what the meaning of pampering a frequent guest is and the staff are very friendly and extremely professional. I always look forward to get back to it time after time. If there is one thing i would note to the staff was the consistency of the room service but this was understood since they always have these staff rotations and have trainees over short periods, and this definitely adds up to the hotel strategy and development.
