I was here for a one day conference and only stayed one night so the review may not be totally fair.  What I did experience was a very nicely decorated room, a comfortable bed, a good breakfast and good conference facilities. What I missed was a selection of different pillows which most better hotels normally can offer as alternatives to the terrible German soft standard pillow. But the biggest drawback was the price. 350 EUR for a single room is just more than the value you get when staying here.
