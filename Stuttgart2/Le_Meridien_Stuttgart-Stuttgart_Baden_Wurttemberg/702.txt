Hotel is everything you would expect from a top of the line chain, luxurious and immaculate with marble baths and fluffy white robes.  Only slight hitch was in locating the hotel from the train station.  On the map it appears that the hotel is right around the corner but in fact those are not walkable pedestrian streets, you must cut through the park and then up and over and pedestrian footbridge to get to the hotel.  It can be a bit of a hual (and there are a lot of stairs!) if you have luggage.
