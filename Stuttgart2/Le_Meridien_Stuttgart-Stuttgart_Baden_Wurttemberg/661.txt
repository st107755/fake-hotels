I have stayed 3 times at this property and have generally enjoyed the staff, service and food. The gym is ok, spacious, but not a lot of machines. It definitely has a large pool which I will use next time. The hotel offers the typical service of a Le Meridien brand, and the rooms are not much different than in the remodeled Le Meridien properties.  The location is excellent, just 5 min walk through a park to the Train Station, Starbucks and the main walking/shopping areas. The restaurant has very good, diverse breakfast buffet and the dinner choices are very tasty.
