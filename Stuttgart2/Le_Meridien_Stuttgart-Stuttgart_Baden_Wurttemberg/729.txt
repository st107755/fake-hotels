I booked 2 nights, a Sunday and Monday. If you go through the Starwood website they will quote the higher weekday rate for both nights. So I booked Sunday night (cheaper weekend rate) separately and saved nearly 100 euros! But on arrival, reception downgraded me (a Platinum member) to a 'superior' room for Sunday and said I could have an 'executive' room on Monday night (for which I was paying almost twice the price). The room was OK, but they only supply one tiny bar of soap (none extra for the bath/shower) and this was not even replaced for my second night, so by departure it was miniscule. On Monday morning I was told my only perk would be delivery of a key to the fourth floor 'executive lounge', but no one showed up after half an hour, so I had to go to reception to requestâ€¦
