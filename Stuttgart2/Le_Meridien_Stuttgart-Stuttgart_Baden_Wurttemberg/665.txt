My husband & I have just returned from 4 nights at the Le Meridien in Stuttgart. We had an absolutely excellent stay and will definately return on future visits to the City.   We arrived on a transatlantic flight before the stated check-in time of 3:00 PM but the hotel still had a room for us and allowed us to begin our stay early. We had a room with a king-sized bed which was extremely comfortable and surprisingly didn't adopt the German tradition of separate bedding. The bathroom was one of the best we've experienced in recent years with great lighting, seating (in addition to the toilet), and even a bathroom scale. The TV has a wonderful choice of free channels including English/UK (BBC, ITV, CNN, Eurosport), Italian and French.  Little touches such as complimentary mineralâ€¦
