We stayed at the Le Meridien Stuttgart for one night in September as we concluded our trip to Germany and Austria.  The wonderfully helpful front desk clerk upgraded us to one of their newly renovated, modern suites.  It was a spectacular, large modern suite.    We also enjoyed room service, which was prompt, delicious and reasonably priced for room service at a hotel of this quality.  Will definitely stay here the next time we're in Stuttgart.
