Whenever I am in Stuttgart I stay at Le Meridien. It is an outstanding hotel. Most recently I stayed for seven wonderful nights in September. The hotel faces the Schlossgarten (park - unfortunately now a construction site). The rooms are very modern and comfortable and soundproof, while the service is friendly and impeccable. There is a small indoor pool and a well-equipped fitness room. The sauna is excellent (note: the sauna is coed and in Germany bathing suits are not allowed "for health reasons"). The breakfast is first class, and in the evening the restaurant is a gourmet delight. My only disappointment was the elimination of the Executive Lounge, which used to be a good place to meet visitors and enjoy a glass of wine or cup of coffee.
