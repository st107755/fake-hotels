We were staying here on our way back home after a week of skiing in Austria. The hotel was just fine. A real city hotel, nothing special but it served its purpose well. The room are of a good size. We had a suite with two connecting rooms ideal for our family. The shower wasnâ€™t that great but apart from that no big complaints.
