Awesome room, the decoration was fantastic, all the blankets white with a big and nice LCD TV, spacious sofa and closet... The bathroom has a tinny problem, the bath-window-doors where too small so everytime you take a shower the water splits all around  the room, that might be a bit uncomfortable specially when the shower sandals you get are not made of plastic (grrrr...) The price for the room was average for Europe, 150Euro per night, but this fee doesnt include breakfast and/or internet. The internet maximum cost per day is 21Euro, 20 or 50cents per min. Better to pay 21 a day and forget about the boring calculations per minute... If they  included the breakfast this Hotel should be a heaven for a vacation.(the girls at the front were cute too hehe)
