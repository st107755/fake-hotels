Hotel services were very good, with fast and courteous check-in, concierge services and check-out.  SPA is fantastic and open most of the day, the restaurants were fine too.  Housekeeping and cleaning was good and the room was spacious and well decorated.  The only drawback was the bed. First of all it was short, I don't know if it was 1.90m, but from a five star hotel, in Germany nonetheless, I expect a minimum of 2.00m of length. Linens also weren't so nice, they were almost abrasive!  On the positive side the mattress was OK and addictional pillows were available on request.  Maybe these problems were limited to our room (225), but I can't speak too well of a hotel were I slept bad.
