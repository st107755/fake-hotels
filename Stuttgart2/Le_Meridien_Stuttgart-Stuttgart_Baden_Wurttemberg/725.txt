Le Meridien Stuttgart is a lovely hotel with comfortable rooms, in a great central location.  Stayed only one night in a double room - room was a good size, clean and modern, with a flat screen TV, minibar, safe, comfortable king bed, good office desk, and a lovely view of Schlossgarten Park. The bathroom was comfortable, with a shower/tub combination with tub jets and a large rain shower head.  The location is great.  While it is next a major road, the room was not noisy.  A pedestrian bridge puts you into the Schlossgarten Park.  The main train station is just across the park, as is the main part of downtown Stuttgart, with historic buildings, museums, stores and restaurants.  Staff was friendly and helpful, with excellent English skills.  Common areas were clean and lovely. â€¦
