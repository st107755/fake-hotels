The Le Meridien Stuttgart was the perfect stay for our visit to Stuttgart during a 5th anniversary vacation. The hotel is first class with beautiful and spacious rooms and a nice bar for an evening drink. The front desk staff is very warm, welcoming and helpful and seeing as how it was our 5th anniversary, they upgraded us to an executive suite which was very roomy with nice views of the main city. The concierge was extremely helpful with directions to all the sites and local restaurants, which made our visit even better. The included breakfasts were very nice with a good variety to suit everyone's needs. The Le Meridien is perfectly situated a short 5-10 minute walk from the central subway station, which makes it extremely easy for a visit to Porsche or Mercedes Benz museums.â€¦
