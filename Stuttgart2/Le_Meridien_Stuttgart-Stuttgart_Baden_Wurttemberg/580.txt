The hotel has it all...spa, buffet breakfast, parking, and most of all great location.  Across the street from the park (with beer garden) and 5 minute walk to the Main train station.  Clean rooms and very helpful staff.  It was a nice getaway for my husband and I when we went to Springfest.    It is not much to look at from the outside and nothing is "immediately" in the area but everything is super close.
