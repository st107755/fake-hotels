Our recent stay had all the makings of a 5 star review.  Until the unfortunate incident.  Sometimes, all it takes is one little thing to ruin the whole stay.  I will start with the negative and then move to the positive.   I drink iced tea.  I mean, when I say I drink iced tea, I mean, that is all that I drink.  Confusing, I know.   The problem with iced tea that it is not super available outside of the US.  Even in the US, if you aren't in the key spots, your luck at finding good, fresh brewed iced tea, is a crapshoot.   Luckily for me, I have the secret recipe.  Not patented, so stick with me.  Tea bag (PG Tips is best), hot water, ice.  Cat's out of the bag! One of the biggest upsides of traveling in Europe is that nearly every nice hotel room has a hot water maker in itâ€¦
