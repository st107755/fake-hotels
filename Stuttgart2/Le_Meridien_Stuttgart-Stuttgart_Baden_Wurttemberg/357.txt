Stayed in Le Meridien in August 2015. Booked two rooms. Have included both positive and negative comments about the hotel to at least try and be fair to them!   Arrived at 11 am and was told that the rooms would be ready by 1 pm...they could not check if the room was ready as it was being cleaned and the system was down (so couldnt check if any other room was available).   Was surprised to find that they couldnt even give us one room to freshen up given that we were coming from Munich and we had left Munich @ 7.30 am.  While I understand that the hotel policy is to give rooms as and when available, what ticked me off was the lack of effort on the part of the hotel staff "sorry...no room available...our system is down". Wasn't there any other way to check?  Wanted to prepay forâ€¦
