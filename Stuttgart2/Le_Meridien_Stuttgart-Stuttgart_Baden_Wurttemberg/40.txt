Did a one night here after flight cancellation. Did not know it was so far from airport but the hotel stay was great. Stuttgart is like one big building site at moment due to train construction but hotel and room is oasis from this. Mercedes building is not far and planetarium over the road. Bed and room amenities good and bar restaurant great fish and chips
