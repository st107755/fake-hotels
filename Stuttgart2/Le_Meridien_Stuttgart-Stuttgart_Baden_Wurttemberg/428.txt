Our first night in Stuttgart was spent here. We caught the SBahn from the airport to Hauptbahnhof  and walked across a park for 10 mins- no taxi required -The hotel had professional polite staff and all the facilities. It was clean , modern and very comfortable. The shower was divine ! I would recommend this hotel if you like a bit of luxury.
