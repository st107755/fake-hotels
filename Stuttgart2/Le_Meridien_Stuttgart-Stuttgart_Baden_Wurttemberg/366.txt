The check in experience is that of being treated as a VIP and the staff of the Hotel are consistent in their care of guests. 2e had a large room on fifth floor with a large king size bed. The pillows and bed cover were very soft, the bed however was very hard. The bathroom was large with plenty of shelf space. The shower shared the bathtub and had very small bath towels. The was a well appointed office desk and very efficient WiFi service. The location was within 10 minutes walk to the central shopping area and very handy to maintain railway station.

Consequently did not try restaurant for Dinner or breakfast. Check out wasâ€¦
