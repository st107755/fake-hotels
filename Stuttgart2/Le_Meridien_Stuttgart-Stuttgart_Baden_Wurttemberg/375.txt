Once we got issues at the desk worked out we had a nice stay.  I shouldn't have to argue about my SPG privileges upon check-in.  All the benefits are in writing and every SPG property I have stayed in knows the details.   The room was designed a bit minimal, but the bathroom and toiletries were more elegant. The spa and exercise facility was very nice.  I had the place to myself because no one else was using it.   Expect to pay for Wifi- a joke in 2014 Europe. This is such an easy way to communicate you value your guests.  Just make Wifi free. Even though I am an SPG Gold member I still had to argue with the desk to get it included.  Be prepared to also pay a large amount for parking.  I will confirm that it is an extremely tight squeeze to navigate the entrance.  It is not wellâ€¦
