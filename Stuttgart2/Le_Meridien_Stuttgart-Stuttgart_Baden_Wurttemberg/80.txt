We stayed for 3 nights and found our stay to be flawless. The customer service was excellent, the staff were always attentive & asked if everything was ok or if there was anything they could do for us. It was my husband’s birthday and the hotel had provided a birthday card signed by the staff & a bottle of wine in our room on arrival - a nice little touch. I’m a very light sleeper and commented to my husband that it was the most quiet hotel we had ever stayed in. Personally we didn’t find the construction around the hotel an issue, in actual fact found it very easy to navigate around and the staff were very helpful with directions. Would highly recommend & would definately return
