This hotel is awesome!  From the time we checked in until the time we left, everything was excellent.  Everyone on staff was very nice and accommodating.  I was traveling with my five-year-old son and they made him feel so special.  Easy access to shopping and transportation.  Tip:  If you plan to take the train to and from the hotel, I recommend you take a cab as it is not easy to carry your luggage through the park.
