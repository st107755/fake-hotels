My overall experience was great.. staff are friendly and helpful.. their service is fast.. the food is delicious.. lots of options.. the WiFi is fast too but not for free in the rooms.. the hotel location is a bit far from the center.. through the park to the centre and train station like 10 minutes walk.. with strollers was a bit hard.. to cross the street steps all the way to the bridge and down again to the park.. otherwise everything was perfect
