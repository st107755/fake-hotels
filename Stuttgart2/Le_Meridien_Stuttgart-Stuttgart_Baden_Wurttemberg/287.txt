This is my third visit to this hotel and I upgraded my room to the fourth floor, nice rooms, very spacious, although I did only stay one night thankfully.   I am also glad it wasn't the height of summer, I had very little sleep due to the fact that the room was absolutely red hot, despite having the air-con on full blast all night, it really was an uncomfortable stay.   I was unable to open the window due to my room being at the front of a very loud main road with building works.   When I checked out I was told that the air con only worked when the outside temp was 18c which I found very odd indeed.  I was of course offered the obligatory bottle of 'local wine', TBH I would have rather had the deserved discount applied for having a room that was only suitable for Amazonianâ€¦
