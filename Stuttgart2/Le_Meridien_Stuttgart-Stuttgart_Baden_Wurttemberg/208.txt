This hotel, located a couple of metro stops away from the main station, offers quality features which will probably appeal more to business travellers.  I had occasion to stay twice here here recently.  The rooms are clean and well designed, the bed very comfortable and large (even though a single bed) and both times I stayed there was a walk-in shower.  The rooms included a dressing gown and slippers, which I very much appreciated after a long day.  There is a tea/coffee maker, and I was very pleased that I could get UK television!  For business the best feature was that – for once! - I had a hotel that provides really high-speed WIFI with simple log-in, and enough electric sockets, in this case built right into the desk.  So I did not find myself having to crawl around under…
