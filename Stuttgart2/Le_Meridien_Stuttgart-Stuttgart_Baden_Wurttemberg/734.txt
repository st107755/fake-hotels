stayed in Le Meridian 1st weekend in dec, me, husband and 12 year old.  It's in an ideal situation, central to the city centre and railway station, but other side of a park.  Had an interconnecting room for daughter.  Great size. large lcd tv, marble bathrooms with large rain shower heads.  Very luxurious.  Only prob was the smokers gathered in reception.  We visited the christmas market, well recommend that.  Went on the tourist office coach tour, DON'T DO IT.  She bored for Germany, and in german.
