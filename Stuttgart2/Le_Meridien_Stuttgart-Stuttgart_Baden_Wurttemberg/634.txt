I was disappointed about executive lounge and some room amenities. It was worst lounge I have ever seen. It was turned from a guest room, lack of service. Ordinary coffee machine no coffee cups etc.There was a computer in lounge and there is no privacy, everybody can see you while on computer.  Nowadays, even low budget hotels offering tea/coffee machine in the room. but you can't find it here. Generally staff, ambiance, room condition is satisfactory which has to be.  You don't have more choice 5 star hotel in Stuttgart.Don't expect a privilege or  spacious rooms if you booked executive room.
