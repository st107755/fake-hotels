This hotel meets all Le Meridian standard. Nice in room coffee as usual. Room is new and nice. The light is the mirror is shower room is super bright. I do like it. But the robe is dirty which surprises me. They should not place this kind of stained robe as shown in photo. That’s the reason I reduce half star ;) Fitness is open 24 hours. Big room, lots is equipment. The way to go to fitness is a bit confusing, but it’s located together with spa. The light in fitness is too dim. The music is super soft. I feel like in spa room rather then in fitness which,on the other way, you should feel enthusiastic not sleepy here.
