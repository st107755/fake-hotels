Nice hotel , business orientated with all the usual business amenities .... check in was easy and efficient . Make time to use the spa and pool a definite must when trying to rid yourself of jet lag. The train station is a 10 min walk away thru a huge construction site. I had a room facing the main street and the entrance and the 2 in windows did the trip. No sound ! Breakfast was included and a standard European style buffet. Staff was friendly hotel is clean and well kept . Would definitely stay again if in Stuttgart. Most of the city's attractions and shopping are 10-20 min walk away so that's the only downside I would mention. There is a nice beer garden close by over the bridge , not sure if that's a seasonal operation. The only problem I encountered is the usual weirdâ€¦
