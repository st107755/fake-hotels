The location is good, close to main train station and main shopping street (about 10 minutes walk, not very very close). There is no good view, just a street and construction machines. Staff is really helpful and great, this is the only 5 star rating for this hotel for me. They do not have available room at 13:00 and I have to wait 2 hours at the lobby for a room. Rooms are big, bathroom is big, nothing special at the room. only the basic needs. Carpets are very very dirty, in the rooms, in the corridors every where. must be renovated. Bed mattresses are very bad, the worst thing at this hotel. breakfast is adequate, not a huge selection of cheeses or cold cuts, it can be better. Overall a 3+ hotel for me. Can stay there for a business trip i can find a room below 100 euros.â€¦
