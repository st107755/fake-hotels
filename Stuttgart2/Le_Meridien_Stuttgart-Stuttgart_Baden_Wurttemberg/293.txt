Great Breakfast: this hotel offer an execellent breakfast compared to other hotels in Europe. it has a wide variety that suits all ppl.  the hotel in general is good, it is only 10 min walking to the famous most crowded street in stuttgart. the stuff are helpful and very friendly. the one thing that i disnt like in this hotel is the air conditional, the weather was a bit hot and the air conditional seems to not be disgned for such weather.
