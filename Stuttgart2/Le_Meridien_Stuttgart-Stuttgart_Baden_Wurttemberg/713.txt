My husband and I stayed here when we wanted to go to the Christmas markets in 2005.  The room was decorated with modern furnishings with plasma screens and the bathroom was contemporary with a large bath and power shower over.  There was a complimentary bath robe and slippers which were great to chill out in after a hot bath, especially when you've been out shopping in the freezing cold all day.  It was great to kick back and open a beer from the mini bar aswell.  The room overlooked the busy main road, but you couldn't hear any noise at all.  Beyond the road was a park which we walked through to get to the town centre.  The markets were busy but there was plenty going on.  The was an ice rink and a train for small children.  For the adults there were plenty of stalls sellingâ€¦
