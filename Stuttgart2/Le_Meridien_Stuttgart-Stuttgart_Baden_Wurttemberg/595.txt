Stayed for 2 nights in an executive room. The hotel had everything I could wish for. Good location, spacious rooms, wonderful breakfast (in a beautifully designed restaurant), good gym, beautiful SPA, wifi (not free..), and last but not the least - the service is absolutely fantastic. I travel 11 months a year, staying in many hotels. The service in Le Meridien Stuttgart exceeded all my possible expectations. Do come there, you won't regret. It ain't cheap but totally worth it.
