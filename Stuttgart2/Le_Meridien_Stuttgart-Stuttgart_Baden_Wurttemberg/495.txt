When we entered the room, the rose petals are all over the bed. There were a greeting card and a bottle of champagne on the table. My wife and I felt warm and happy. They are certainly thoughtful. And this little thing means a lot for travelers.  The location of hotel is one stop to the HBF, central station and 3 to 5 minutes walking from the station. So it is convenient but not too busy. The hotel entrance is not very fancy. But we don't feel pressure under high ceiling. It takes few minutes to check in and hotel reception is very kind.  Elevators are situated on both sides of the lobby. So it is faster to get in the room however, the instruction is not clear enough to know before you take correct one.  The superior room is clear and comfortable. Air conditioner works fine.â€¦
