The rooms were very large by European standards.  They are quiet, comfortable and clean.  Shower was powerful, generous bath amenities.  The staff were very helpful and professional.  Very easy walk over the bridge over the busy street to the park across the street.  Biergarten in the park, very convenient to the hotel.  Main train station just a little further of a walk through the park. Would have been a perfect 5 except that the rugs in the room were a bit worn, there was no coffee/tea in the room, and the underground parking was tight and overpriced.
