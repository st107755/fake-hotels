Service AAA+++ Rooms AAAA+++ Decor in lobby dining was stark and modern. Food : Great breakfast. Poor "elegant" French buffet Service is their forte. They took care of my every need, and I had some challenging requests. What a great staff. I stayed for 8 nights and I felt at home....a real elegant home.  The spa was wonderful. too. The location was close to park but I little removed from direct transportaion. I walked through the park nightly. Walk OK but not great for a single woman, which I am not. Weird charactors at train station entrance on that side. Almost seems that the police has designated that entrance to be OK for bad punkers. Use the cab or walk fast. I survived for the week
