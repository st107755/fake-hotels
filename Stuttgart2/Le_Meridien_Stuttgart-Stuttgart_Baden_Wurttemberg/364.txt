The hotel is located a single underground stop or a short walk from the main station. We stayed a few nights and were well looked after. The standard of service was high, there if you needed it but never intrusive.  The room was generously sized and had a desk at which one could reasonably have worked.  The breakfast buffet is comprehensive and of a very high standard, though not cheap at 25Eur.   There are several dining options. We had a meal in the bar which was of a good standard and reasonably priced.  Would stay here again if we revisit Stuttgart.
