Having tried many hotels in and around Stuttgart in the past 3 months, we finally decided on choosing Le Meridien hotel as our contract hotel as it has most of the qualities a business traveller would expect. Excellent check in service with polite and friendly staff and a very high level of English spoken. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Buffet breakfast is also excellent. Tip: the hotel has just completely renovated the Spa area and it is well.worth a visit. All in all highly recommended and one of the all round best hotels.in Stuttgart.
