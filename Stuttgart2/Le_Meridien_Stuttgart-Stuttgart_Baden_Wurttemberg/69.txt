Stuttgart doesnâ€™t have a great Hotel offer. There are no nice characteristic Boutique Hotels. From the chain offer this is definetly the best. Spacious rooms recently  refurbished to meet nowadays Standard with an ultimate Spa and Gym makes this Hotel definetly the best place to stay in Stuttgart. Very friendly and helpful staff.
