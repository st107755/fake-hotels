A very nice hotel within easy walking distance from the main shopping area and restaurants. The room was massive with an excellent  bathroom and comfortable bed. Good internet connection which we had to pay for. Good secure undercover parking.   We made the mistake of walking on street level to the old town the first time which is quite a long way to go. There is actually a pedestrian flyover on the 1st level that take you towards the old town and takes half the amount of time to get there. There is also as very nice beer garden on the other side of the pedestrian flyover where they serve traditional german food and beer at a very reasonable price. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. Our room was on a high floor and although facing the street we did not get any trafficâ€¦
