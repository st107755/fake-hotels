 Marriott buying Starwood opens up a whole world of interesting properties especially in the middle of cities for loyalists who like all the goodies that elite status conveys.  This was an good example.   Excellent location. Quiet despite construction project.  Very good breakfast (free for Platinum elites) Nice people. The BUT is terrible internet service in room.   Sometimes it was ok sometimes nothing. Impossible to work. Lobby area was fine. Front desk, when told breezily confirmed that this is an issue in some rooms. That would have been nice to know upon checkin... Lesson learned is that first step after getting into room is send a test email
