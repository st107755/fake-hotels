The hotel has a great location to visit the centre of the city. A short walk across the park takes you in to the historic area. The hotel staff were very helpful with travel / information and the room I had was excellent. Lots of space to relax and work with a desk / wifi etc.. Breakfast had an excellent selection of food. It's also a short walk to the train station that takes you to most places and route back to the airport. The only disappointment at the time of my visit there was a lot of construction going on across the road from the hotel.
