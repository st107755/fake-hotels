Great location, near the train station and the main shopping- tourist area.  The rooms were very clean and their services were great.  They offer great breakfast and their French restaurant was fantastic. The staffs spoke English very well and they were very courteous, and friendly.  We will definitely stay here when we comeback to visit in December!
