Bottom line: There wasn't much to dislike about this hotel.  Pros:  - Location: From the airport take the S-bahn to the Hauptbanhof.  Hotel is an easy 10 minute walk to/from the Hauptbanhof.  If you are going for the Christmas markets, it is a pleasant 15 minute walk to the old town where the markets are held.  Taxis are always out front if you need one.  - Food: We only ate at the bar, but try the Curried Bratwurst, it was delicious.  The french fries could have been hand-cut for such a fine establishment, but they were good nonetheless.  - Spa: Great facilities include 70 and 90 degree sauna, an infrared room, and a steam room.  Know before you go that it's mixed gender, and clothing is not allowed in the sauna/spa room.  But that's how just about all German spas are.  Robesâ€¦
