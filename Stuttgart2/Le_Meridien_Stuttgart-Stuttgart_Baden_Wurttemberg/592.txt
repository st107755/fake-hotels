Stayed one night while intown on business. First meeting not until late in the day so slept in to over come jet lag. Went to the restaurant at 10:30 for breakfast. Hostess seated Ys and never said a word that they were closing. Got a piece of bread and cheese and my wife had some fruit and cheese. We were then informed that they were closed and the food from the buffet was removed. When I checked out a little later, I was informed that the charge for breakfast was 25 euros each. I argued thar 25 euros for a piece of bread and cheese was ridiculous and that the charge should be reduced. The front desk staff refused to do so and refused to call the manager, saying that he was too busy to deal with such a trivial item. I am a SPG Gold member and I try to stay at Starwood hotelsâ€¦
