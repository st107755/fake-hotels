The hotel was fantastic, with incredible service.  We spent time walking around the Schlossgarten, and took a Hop on Hop off tour.  It was raining during our stay, and we were not able to fully enjoy the city.  Went up to the radio tower, but was fogged in.  This hotel does have an incredible "Spa" area.  Three sauna's of various degrees, cool down room, great Jacuzzi, and neat pool.  I took advantage of this and was completely refreshed. Stuttgart is a nice modern German city, so if you are looking for a unique "alstadt" or old town experience, then use Stuttgart as a base to visit the outlying area, especially Heidelberg, the black forest, Garmisch, Triberg, and Tubingen.
