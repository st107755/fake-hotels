I must join with others commending Le Meridien. We stayed there in July 2006 and returned this year. The rooms are extremely comfortable and quiet. The breakfast is the best we have had in all our European hotels, which are many. The staff are friendly and speak English. There is a difficulty in finding the Hotel, the first time we walked up the busy road from the Station and were horrified in crossing this road. BUT once we found the foobridge to the park we were able to walk in the peacefull surroundings of the park with the many mole holes and hares!! No problems, but do not have heavy luggage as there are quite a few steps to the bridge when approaching from the Station, lots of luggage take a taxi! This hotel is convenient to the city centre and the many restaurants...greatâ€¦
