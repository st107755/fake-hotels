This  hotel is in excellent location from the town centre , the down side  is that  there is a construction going on ,the hotel self is very modern clean beautiful interior the room it' self  was good size especially the bed is massive just u let u know we did ask for bath but was not availed on the plus side was that we did get a upgrade which was really nice of them to give us on arrival the welcome was warm and the lady which gave us upgrade gave us complimentary  wine due to our special occasion which was brilliant, the Christmas markert was fantastic and massive plenty to do from shopping to eating to sightseeing overall it was great stay didn't eat in the hotel found it expensive again the only problem was the language barrier and reading menus ect it was not in English  â€¦
