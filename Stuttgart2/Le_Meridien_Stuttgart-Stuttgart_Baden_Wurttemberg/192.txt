There is a construction site outside the window of the front Neckar rooms. It is noisy and persistent -  work started at 7 am.   Add to that four lanes of traffic that face the hotel. Pedestrian access through a building site.  I asked on check out how they felt they could justify selling the rooms without any concession or discount. Polite shrug and no action.  If you can live with that, well it's an OK if not faceless business hotel. But on no account book a room that faces the building works if you want to rest up and catch some sleep during the day. Sure, it's not the hotel's fault that the inner city is being rent asunder by the rail works, but, please, some concession to your customers would be appreciated.
