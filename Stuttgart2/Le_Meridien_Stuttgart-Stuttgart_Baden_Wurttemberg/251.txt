Despite being a vintage style hotel (and a huge one), it is lacking in some small details. For a hotel of such a standing, one would expect an iron and ironing board to be provided - especially for business clients. But what you get is a small 'doll house' style contraption that comes out of the cupboard. A big let down! (see photo) Overall, did not have the chance to fully appreciate the place as was just for a short overnight conference.
