We've been there for a short stay. The Hotel rooms looked just renovated and modern, and despite the major work happening on the road outside it has been very quiet and with great sound isolation. Plus:  - a very good breakfast choice, with amazing pancakes with maple syrup.  - rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable Minus: - very small garage entrance - roadworks outside. As soon as finished, the location will be a plus! I would recommend it.
