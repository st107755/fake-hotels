Since many years I visit the Le Meridien. The flair of the stuff is 5 star, the interior is 5 star and the food is 5 star. For sure it is not top-modern, but I enjoy the stay. It is like coming home. Always a friendly front desk, the face of the hotel! Only parking is always bit expensive. Internet is also not my happiness. Location next to park is maybe in the night not safety!
