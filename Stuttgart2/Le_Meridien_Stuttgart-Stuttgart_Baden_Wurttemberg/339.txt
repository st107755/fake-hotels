I spent 5 nights in early October at the Meridien hotel .  The rooms are spacious and clean . The bathroom is also spacious and clean . The staff are very friendly and cooperative . Breakfast was included and was really good , with fresh juices and a huge fresh variety of food . The downtown pedestrian shopping area is about 15 minutes walk from the hotel.There you will find many shops and cafes to enjoy . Overall the Hotel is really very good and I would recommend it for the business or family traveller .
