We enjoyed our room and large bathroom and several closets....one with ironing board!  Dinner was 60 Euros for one salad entree and one steak entree.  Salad bar was best I have ever seen in any country!  Service was great!  Breakfast a buffet for 25 euros for one person.  Nice choice of Traditional German or traditional American!  Nice fresh fruit bar!  Location seemed to be in Industrial area!  No shopping nearby!
