Bright, clean, friendly and welcoming. we had a free upgrade and we had use of the spa. The room was immaculate, the bed was so comfy, everything you could want from a hotel. The breakfast was not short of amazing, so much choice and so many fresh products, you could not wish for more. The free spa was beautiful, with 2 saunas, steam room, showers, pool and jacuzzi. Valet parking, close to the center and very well presented throughout.
