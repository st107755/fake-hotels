I stayed here for 3 days on a business trip 2 weeks ago.  This hotel is lovely in every way. A large selection of food for breakfast, and evening meal and the staff were very helpful. The hotel is very clean, tidy, and spacious. The rooms are very well presented, with a shower in the bath.  I cant fault it and will return.
