Stayed here with a friend. It's a €45 taxi from the airport - take the train!  10 minute walk to the central station and city centre. 15 minutes to Christmas market.   Nice modern, comfortable hotel. Brilliant bar - see below.  Check in effortless. Staff friendly.   Rooms are modern, nicely decorated, large and nice modern bathrooms. All the good quality amenities you'd expect from an international brand.   In the room you also get a dressing gown, slippers and a nice touch - a voucher for free coffee in the hotel bar.   The bar is amazing - so many cocktails and other drinks on offer. Very high quality cocktails at a reasonable price. I watched the bar man make cocktails for nearly 3 hours and he didn't need to check the menu once. Very impressive! The also has a pianist…
