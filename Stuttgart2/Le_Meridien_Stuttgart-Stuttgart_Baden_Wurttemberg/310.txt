The location was actually very convenient, very close to the main train station except due to the construction at the main train station, we had to climb up so many stairs with our big and heavy suitcases. When we checked out we decided to catch a taxi instead.  The room itself was clean but needed to update soon. We really enjoyed the spa and sauna. Our daughter got a small welcome lego gift from the hotel. We also ordered pizza and soup from the room service and they were delicious. The breakfast was also great and lots of option.
