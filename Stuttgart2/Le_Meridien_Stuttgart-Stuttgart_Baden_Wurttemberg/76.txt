Will be an excellent location when all the construction is done.. modern chic hotel w pool and indoor sauna /steam.. we stayed only 1 night to mainly see Porsche and the town.. nice breakfast ..we are Marriott members..we liked other Marriott stays on this trip better..we expected more from This brand which is supposed to be a little higher end ..it was nice but nothing over the top for rooms or dining
