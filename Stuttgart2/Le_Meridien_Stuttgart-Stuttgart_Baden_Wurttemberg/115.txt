We traveled to Stuttgart to visit a trade show.  I have stayed at Le Meridien hotels before, but this hotel is really special.  Our check-in was a quick and easy and the hotel staff were exceptionally friendly.  The hotel is absolutely spectacular.  Itâ€™s very elegant and every part of the hotel is of the finest furnishings and best quality.  The lounge is excellent - a good place to relax with your favorite libation or to have a bite to eat.  The breakfast buffet is fabulous with plenty of fresh fruit, breads and eggs to order.  The hotel staff go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  The wellness area of the hotel (pool, sauna, fitness room) is outstanding.  I will definitely come back to this hotel just to get away for awhile.  A very special hotel.
