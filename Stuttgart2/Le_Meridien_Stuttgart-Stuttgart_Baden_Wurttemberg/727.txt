I was forced to stay 1 night in Stuttgart, because flight change was not possible on the same day, so i booked the #1 hotel on Tripadvisor.  The hotel is located along a main road, so watch out to get a room to the quiet backyard.  Its 10-15 minutes walk to the city center (which isn't very interesting anyway).  The rooms are newly refurbished and stylish but lack a bathtub. Hotel service is ok.
