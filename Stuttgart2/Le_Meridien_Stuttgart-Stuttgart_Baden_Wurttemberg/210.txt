This is one of best hotels in the area of Stuttgart , first the rooms seems to be renovated so it is very nice and luxury , and by the way very clean . One of very important thing I noticed was that the crew were very nice , polite and professional , very helpful and most importantly that I loved was that always smiling , in short a very good choice , so when you are there pls stay will them ..
