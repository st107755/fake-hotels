+Good location; convenient access (on foot) to main city center and starting point (by car) to other destinations in and around Stuttgart +Friendly staff and good service  -Construction works on road outside hotel and park across street from hotel caused some inconvenience -Rooms looked like they were fitted out in the 1970s with only minor recent upgrades  Overall, worked well for us given it was a driving trip. For those not driving and without need for the hotel's secure underground carpark, there may be better options closer to the city center / across the street from the main railway station.
