Pros:  Good location, walking distance to city center and railway station. Deluxe room was good but simple for this value of money, facing courtyard. Bathrobe & slippers, ironing facilities, free still water. Quite conditioning. Safebox. Perfect breakfast. Indoor swimming pool & sauna.  Cons:  Its really too strange not to have free WiFi for the value of money paid for room... Problem with water runoff in the sink. Though our room faced calm courtyard there was an arc where people from nearest office went to smoke, laughing & talking till late night (for 2 days was same problem).
