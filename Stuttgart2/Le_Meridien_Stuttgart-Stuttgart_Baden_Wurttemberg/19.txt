Our first experience staying at Le Meridien and we felt like royalty staying at this most beautiful hotel.  From the moment we walked into this hotel, I knew I chose the perfect place to stay.  And so happy this hotel is now a Marriott hotel.   The staff is so very helpful, kind, and made perfect recommendations..  Our room was beautiful, the beds very comfortable, and everything was sparkling clean.   The gym was amazing and was open 24/7.  I did not take advantage of the many other spa services offered.  One final note:  the breakfast is BOUNTIFUL.  No matter how picky an eater you may be, you will find many foods you will enjoy.  The eggs are prepared to perfection.  You cannot ask for better service.
