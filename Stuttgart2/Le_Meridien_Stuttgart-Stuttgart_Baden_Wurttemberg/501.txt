My husband and I visited Stuttgart for the first time and Le Méridien was a good choice. Very well situated in front of the Schlossgarten Park Stuttgart, 7 minutes walking to the main train station and 10 minutes to Koenigstrasse, the main shopping street.    The staff  was extremely friendly and very well prepared. The lobby is pretty nice. Our large,  stylish and well-appointed room was very comfortable. Everything spotlessly clean and tidy. Pillows and bed were very good for our taste. Our room was facing the Planetarium, and it was very silent. EXCELLENT breakfast. Rich in variety and replenished constantly. I regret not having had time to enjoy the spa/gym area, since everything looked so amazing. But the downside was a very expensive Wi-Fi. It's really a pity that a  hotel…
