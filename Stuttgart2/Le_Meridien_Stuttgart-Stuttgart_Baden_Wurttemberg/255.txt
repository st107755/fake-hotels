For a hotel of this standard, there are some very good deals to be had online. This may be reflective of the huge amount of construction work that is taking place directly outside the hotel; on the highway and also opposite in the Schlossgarten, which was the only downside to our stay.   The hotel room was large, quiet and clean. The spa area and gym was luxurious and not at all busy. All the staff we met were helpful and friendly.   Just watch the parking charge for the hotel car park as it is overpriced for hotel guests: it worked out another 25% of our room cost to park the car for one night!
