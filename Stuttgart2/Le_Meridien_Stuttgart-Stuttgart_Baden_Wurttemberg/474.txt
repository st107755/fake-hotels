The hotel is a short walk from the train station. The rooms are ok, and the restaurant is ok...nothing special though. The Sauna/Pool are good, and the staff is very friendly....even if enforcing the hotel's bad rules, or providing inaccurate information.  Be aware that the hotel has a rule that they will only convert a maximum of $100 US Dollars into Euros within a 24 hr period (that gives you enough Euros for a half a meal and a few drinks), and they'll do it at a VERY bad rate of exchange. The woman at the desk was apologetic and said we should walk the kilometer or so back to the train station and change our money there. She also warned us about the bad exchange rate the hotel gives. Next, we asked the Concierge to make a reservation for us at a popular restaurant in town.â€¦
