We stayed here for three nights during the Christmas market season.  I have stayed here several times over the past 15 years, but this is my first stay under the "le meridien" management.  The hotel is fabulous - service, cleanliness, moderness, real King size beds.  It is a short walk to the Koenigstrasse for shopping.  The train station is a little far to walk with lots of luggage, but not too bad if you have packed light.  Pick a room faing the courtyard so you can avoid the police sirens from the b14.
