This is a fairly old hotel that is trying to maintain a standard but not really succeeding. Access by foot is really difficult whilst the train station is undergoing a massive rebuild.  Three sets of stairs and ramps. The path is not well lit at night if you are a woman on her own. The recognition of club members was minimal. We did get before noon check in which was great.  Breakfast was fine.
