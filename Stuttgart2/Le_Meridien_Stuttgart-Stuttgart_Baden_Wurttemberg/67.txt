My sister and I stayed at the Meridien for two nights in February 2019, and I could not have been happier or more satisfied with our selection. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone - friends, family or colleagues.   The location of the hotel is a five minute walk through a lovely park from the central train station. A quick walk over a bridge at the end of the park, and you are standing at the beautiful entrance to the hotel. Although there was some construction work going on outside the Meridien, upon entry, it is like the noise of the outside world fades away and you are left in a quiet, classy and relaxing bubble of enjoyment. Prepare to be pampered by the Meridien.   I am a light sleeper, but the Meridien happily accommodated me by reserving me a room in advanceâ€¦
