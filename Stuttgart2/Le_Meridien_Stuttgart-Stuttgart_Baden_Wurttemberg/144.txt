Was in Stuttgart for 2 days to visit the Christmas markets.  Excellent location to the train station and markets.  Service and staff were excellent and willing to help no matter what the request.  The breakfast buffet was free as a platinum member, but well worth the money.  Purchase at a discount when you check in.  The new wine bar is quaint and provides a nice selection.  The rooms are well appointed and kept.  Looking forward to my next return trip.
