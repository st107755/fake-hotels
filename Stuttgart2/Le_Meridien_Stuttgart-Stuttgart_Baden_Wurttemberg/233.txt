We stayed there for a night because it was one of the only hotel left in Stuttgart. It was a bit expensive but acceptable as a business expense. Staying there was a great decision! The service is fantastic. The rooms are huge, very well equipped and beautifully designed. The breakfast was pretty standard, but of great quality nonetheless.  This is definitely one of the best places to stay at in Stuttgart if you (or your business) can afford it.
