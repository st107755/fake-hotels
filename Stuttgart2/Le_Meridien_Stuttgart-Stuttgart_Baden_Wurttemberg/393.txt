We loved to spa that included 3 saunas and other attractions. Gym is big with new machines. The bar had the biggest choice of alcohol drinks I ever saw in my life. Rooms are good size but have nothing special. No tee or coffee machine but we received free coffee vauchers as spg gold members. Staff was nice by German standards. Location is noisy on a highway. On the map it looks just on the main station but if you really need to go and catch a train it will take you more then 10 min. Would stay there again.
