We had a 2 night stay at this hotel. The staff were very very helpful. We were having trouble with our hire car and they went to great lengths to assist us. The location is good, close to transport, the shops and a large park. The park was beautiful once you got away from the building works that don't create a very good first impression. The breakfast and breakfast staff were great. We also had an outstanding dessert in the bar area late at night. Our room was on the road side and unfortunately was noisy. The rooms are also a bit tired and could do with an update.
