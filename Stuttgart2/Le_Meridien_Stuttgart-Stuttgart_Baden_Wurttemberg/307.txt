This is a good business hotel. Clean. Very friendly staff. Nice Wellness area. The pool was a bit chilly for my taste and the jacuzi not working, but the sauna area with different  saunas and steam room was well designed. Workout is open 24 hours. Did not try the restaurant or breakfast. I found the price of 26 Euro for breakfast too high. They did give a voucher for a coffee at the bar which I did instead and was pleased with that. They also gave a voucher for the adjacent Staats gallery which I visited and enjoyed. I had asked for separate beds but we got a kingsize....not a big deal, but still not what I had asked for travelling with my brother. The room was an upgrade and nice. Modern and functional. Great bed sheets.
