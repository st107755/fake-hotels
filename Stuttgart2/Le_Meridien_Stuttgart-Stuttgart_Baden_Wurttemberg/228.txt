This is a very good hotel satisfied me very much even from the arrival, check in & luggage deliver. This is a well designed hotel with quality in small details. Breakfast is also very good in comparison with German hotels. It has another advantage which is good location. Small defects do not lower my recommendation to this hotel. I will be back! 從抵達、入住登記到送行李的服務開始就很棒了，這是個有設計感和質感的酒店，地點也很棒，雖然是連鎖的，可是又很有個性，早餐在德國的飯店來說也是非常的不錯，多元、多樣，小問題瑕不掩瑜，外面的隔音、幾個破損的餐具和不夠強的淋浴。。。一定會回來再入住的！
