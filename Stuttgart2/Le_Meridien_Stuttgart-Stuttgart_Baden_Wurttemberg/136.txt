We booked due to easy walking proximity to both train station and local Christmas markets, not realizing that the surrounding construction would make the walk from the train station a bit less than appealing. Sound-proofing in the rooms was incredible, blocking out the sounds from the busy street below and the construction across the street. It's a bit of a walk from the heart of the Christmas markets, but nothing too bad and it was nice to have a relaxing place to come back to after a day on your feet checking out the markets.   Lovely hotel, good enough location, view of huge construction site.
