Overall the place is very nice. The check-in process was simple and the staff was quite pleasant. I was visiting my significant other and his group of 40+ who stayed here for 3 nights while working on a touring concert. I arrived the night prior on a Wednesday and visited the bar, had dinner there with a friend. The service was quite slow. I actually ate at the bar 3 nights in a row after exploring Stuttgart all day. Serrano panini was good, mushroom pizza was a bit burnt, duck was superb - so a wide range of reviews for food offerings there. It was convenient that the main train station is near as this is how we arrived from Frankfurt. We had to walk through the Schlossgarten park to get to Le Meridien. Coming from New Orleans, I was not worried about the locals who were setupâ€¦
