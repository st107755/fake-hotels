Very dissappointed, we arrived at the hotel at 5 pm coming from another European country by flight. At the front desk we were told that we couldnt get a room because we were so late!! We booked the hotel by phone and email 2 months in advance, we were never asked for a creditcard but got a very nice email that the manager were looking so much to see us in september. Upon arrival we were told you should have given us your creditcard numer!  After lot of discussion we got a room for 1 night but we had booked 2. The manager and the clerk were very unprofessional and at the hotelbar we found out that they had, had a problem with the booking so we were not they only couple in trouble. The girl at the front desk even told us "we have never had so many people at the hotel before"     â€¦
