To begin, my husband and I stayed here for 2 months so my review might be a little off as anyone would get crazy if being in a hotel that long. Everything was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was very nice with a great shower. The staff was nice for the most part except a couple of door men I thought were kind-of rude. The room was very small. I know most european hotel rooms are small especially compared to US standards. And again this might not be an issue for someone staying a short time. However we also stayed here in December '09 and the room we were in during that stay was larger. We also had our dog with us and the hotel seemed to be okay with it. I am not sure if when we asked if we could bring our dog they were expecting a Labrador retriever.â€¦
