What a lovely Hotel and such a wonderful staff. From the moment we arrived we were treated like family.  We had our room upgraded upon arrival. Very clean,airy and comfortable room.  We had room service for dinner both nights and the food was excellent.  The staff is so friendly and accomodating. Can't wait to return..
