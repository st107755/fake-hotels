Nice hotel but I have doubts that this is the best hotel in Stuttgart! It is well located near the center(about 10 minutes walk)opposite the city park.Right in front of the hotel there is a big road with 4 or 6 lines,so if you get room on this part is excluse to open the window.There are no problems with the noise because the windows are german made. The rooms are ok,not to large ,not to small,but a little out of date.They keep the ro0ms and the entire hotel clean.The restaurant is not very big and the food is very complicated but good,and prices are also very complicated.Not many choices in the menu.The breakfast is good,a lot of choices.The wellnes is great.The entire personal work hard to make you feel home.
