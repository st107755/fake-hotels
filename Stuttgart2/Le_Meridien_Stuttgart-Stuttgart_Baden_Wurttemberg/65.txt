Perfect for business trips to Stuttgart. Not only are the facilities first class, the hospitality is top notch. Julia in reservations was especially helpful when a large group needed to extend our reservations. Not only did she expertly find rooms for the entire group her follow up was unexpectedly timely and courteous.
