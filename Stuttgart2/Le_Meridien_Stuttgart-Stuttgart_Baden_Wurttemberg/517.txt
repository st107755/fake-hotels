It is a weak hotel services for this level (5 stars) I have called from my room on Sunday morning around 11 am for questioning the desk about  "Brunch" offer. Yes, we have, it is from 11.30 to 2 pm. So, I chech out at 11.30 an,d I have asked to add two brunch menus on my bill. : "We are sorry it is fully booked today by a group"...Why they did not tell me when I have called the first time 30 minutes before. As hotel guest we had zero possibility to access fro teh brunch (breakfast time was closed at 10.30)... So weak for this level of hotel !
