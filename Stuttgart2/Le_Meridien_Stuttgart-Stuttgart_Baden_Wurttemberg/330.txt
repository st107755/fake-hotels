I was travelling alone and stayed at this hotel as it is central to the locations I was required to visit. The rooms and bathrooms and very clean and well serviced. There was just no view due to location.  The are situated close to the train station and shopping district which you can walk to.  The food has a very limited vegetarian selection however whatever was catered was good. Their breads were outstanding.  Wifi was great however only free in the lobby area, you will have to pay  â‚¬ 6.00  per 24 hours in your room
