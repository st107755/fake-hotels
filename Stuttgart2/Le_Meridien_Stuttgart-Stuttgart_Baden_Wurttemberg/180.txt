We enjoyed a one night stay at this hotel and found it very pleasant and convenient to the city centre and station.  Our only complaint would be the construction work outside which is not a pretty sight and extensive. No noise over the weekend however during the week it is likely to be a frustration.  The service was excellent and so was the breakfast. I would return again once the construction work is complete which we believe is 5 years away!
