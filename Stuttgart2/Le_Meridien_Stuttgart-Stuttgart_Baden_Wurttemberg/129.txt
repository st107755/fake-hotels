Only stayed one night but the lovely receptionist granted us a late check out on the 15.02.18, so it felt like we stayed longer.  Thank-you.  He also had a great sense of humour as we checked in on the 14.02.18, when explaining we could use the mini bar free of charge.  When we got to the room and saw how much was actually in there, we rang down and he jokingly reassured us it was definitely for us and free.  We booked an Executive Room.  Not sure if this is the norm, or was a special Winter offer.  All the other extras you would expect in this price range were there, although no shower gel/bubbles and had to ask three times for a bath plug.   The room has been refurbished tastefully and in relaxing shades.  Lots of lighting options, including big windows for natural sunlight. â€¦
