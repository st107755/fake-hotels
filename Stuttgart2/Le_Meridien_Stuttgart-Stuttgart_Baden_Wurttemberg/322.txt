We had 2 nights in this hotel. Surprisingly the location is bad although it is not that far,but we had to carry luggage and climbed up and down so many stairs and passed by a big park. It spoiled our honeymoon mood. In front of the hotel,there is a project under construction. It is dark and dangerous while we were walking back to our hotel and passed by the park at night.Anyway,the breakfast and service were good. But I think this hotel is more suitable for business travellers as they can access here by taxi or cars. For those who have no transport,there are many other choices over there.
