The Le Meridien Stuttgart definitely lived up to the positive reviews on Tripadvisor.  The location is convenient whether you are driving or taking the train.  The room was nicely decorated and very quiet (even though there is a relatively busy street outside).  There is a walkover bridge for a ~15 minute walk to the hauptbahnhof.  Parking (20euro) is convenient and secure.  The real standout was the service and staff, which were exceptional.  A special thank goes to Selim for making this a memorable stay!
