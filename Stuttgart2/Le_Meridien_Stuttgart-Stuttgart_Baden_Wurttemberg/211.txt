We stayed at Le Meridien for our anniversary. I cannot say enough about the hospitality staff at this hotel. They were attentive, friendly and helpful. They even gave us an anniversary card that they had all signed! The room was exactly what I had asked for and well appointed. Clean, modern and the spa was AMAZING. The only drawback were the screaming children in the spa pool. For an area of tranquility in the hotel, it was unnerving.
