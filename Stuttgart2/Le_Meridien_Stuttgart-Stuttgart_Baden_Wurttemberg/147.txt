We chose the Le Meridien as it was close to the city without being right in the city centre, and also based on price and previous reviews. We also had a car, so needed parking. The room we had was Superior room which included WiFi (No hotel should not offer WiFi or charge for it these days). It was a good size room and faced the street and on level 3 (5 max levels), but we did not have any noise from the street at all. It was about a 5 minute walk to the shopping area mall of the city. The mall and shopping area was quite long as were the Christmas markets. The markets were quite long and the Le Meridien is at the end of the city area that had lesser parts of these markets, but as on stroll end to end, it didn’t really matter. By the way, the markets were good to eat at and well…
