We have stayed at this Hotel before. It appears that rooms have been refurbished since our last visit. The room we had had a excellent shower with twin shower heads as opposed to a bath. This suited us as my wife has trouble climbing into a bath. As normal the reception staff were business like and very helpful and had time for guests. The buffet breakfast was again excellent with a great selection of different foods. Also not long after arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who knocked on our door and provided us with a plate of fruit.
