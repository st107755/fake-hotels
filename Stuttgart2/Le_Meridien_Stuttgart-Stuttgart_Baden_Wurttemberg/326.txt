Very shabby and sad, depressing experience. Badly needs renovating. Staff were mostly lovely and helpful apart from one doofus. Breakfast was good.  Room was dark and depressing. Amenities lacking - no kettle, tissue box. Room service food was awful and the tray was not cleared for over a day even after I asked for it to be cleared. Restaurant only had a very expensive buffet option and there was nowhere else nearby to eat. Wifi connection very slow.
