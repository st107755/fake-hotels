The hotel was great, price friendly, I have booked room with good discount. Service is very good, nice people, helpful. good location through park. Park is so nice 5 steps from hotel nice beergarden and also some bar. Not dangerous at all. a lot of walking people. Very relaxible atmosphere.  10 minutes till main railway and also center.  The hotel is bueeful and also nice pull and finnish souna 90 degrees very nice. So great was relax after walking day in the city , museum... I would be defenatly recomended this hotel to everyone. single, couples, families, old people... Just breakfast too expensive, but we havn't there breakfast. If you go to the city center 10 minutes so many caffees where youy can order great breakfast 3 time less.
