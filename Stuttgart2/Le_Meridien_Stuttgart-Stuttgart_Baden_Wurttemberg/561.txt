Although my stay was brief for this visit (3 nights) being at the Le Meridien Stuttgart was a wonderful way to start and end my European holiday.  Upon arrival I was greeted by Selim Mokni, Guest Services Manager.  He was so polite, charming and professional (typical behavior for all the Front Desk staff).  I had also arranged for a visit to the Spa on my first day and Prio really pampered me there.  I could feel the stress from the flight just melt away!  I also appreciated Marco (concierge) helping me decide on something really fun to do since my time was so short.  My rooms were just great – I faced the street and had no problems with noise whatsoever.  I loved the big “fluffy” bed and could just live in the bathroom/shower.  I was also happy to see that since my last visit…
