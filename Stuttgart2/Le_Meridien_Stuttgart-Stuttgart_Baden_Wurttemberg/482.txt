Great hotel.  I try to stay here whenever I can get a rate within my business travel budget.  The rooms are modern, clean and efficient.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet is the best I had in Europe.  The selection is amazing.  Itâ€™s a short walk through the park to the bahnhof and downtown.
