We stayed one night over a weekend in Stuttgart.  Checkin was super friendly (thank you David). The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  Breakfast was very good. There was so much choice.  The pool, sauna and gym are also very good.   There is major construction going on in Stuttgart around the main station but if you follow the path and over the foot bridge you can easily get to the hotel within several minutes.  We were able to visit the city centre and the public library by walk. The Mercedes Benz museum is easy to get to from the main train station.  Overall a great weekend at the Le Meridien.
