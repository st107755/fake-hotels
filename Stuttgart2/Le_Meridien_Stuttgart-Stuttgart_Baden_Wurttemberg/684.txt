I had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Le Meridien in Stuttgart. I was somewhat disappointed that my room did not have a bathtub, but the spa facilities more than made up for that.  A great pool, hot tub, and a sauna in a very relaxing environment.   The rooms were very well appointed, thoughtfully designed with light switches in all the right places, good lighting, comfortable chairs and a great bed.  There were also nice little touches, such as a complimentary bottle of water upon arrival, and a voucher for 2 complimentary espressos in the bar, that was a nice change from the usual feeling of being nickled and dimed at every turn at luxury hotels.  Internet was extortionate, but there are cheap internet cafes nearby for quick surfing.  Very fast elevators.  I've been noticingâ€¦
