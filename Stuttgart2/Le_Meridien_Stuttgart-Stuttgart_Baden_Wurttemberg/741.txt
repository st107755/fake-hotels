After a long flight from Colorado Springs, Colorado what a pleasure it was to have our first hotel stay at the Le Meridian! Excellence everywhere from the accomodations to the staff! The spa area is not to be missed but hard to find - there is a special elevator to get to it (Make sure you find it!)
