Look up Stuttgart 21. That is a new train station being built across this hotel. You cannot walk to the hotel because the street corners by the traffic light are blocked and there is no sidewalk. You have to cross through a park, go up several stairs and cross a bridge, go down stairs and then you're in front of the hotel. To go back, do the same then go up several floors of steep ramps that take you through a tunneal to the train station. You then need to get out of the station. Imagine doing this with luggage.  One day there was a demonstration in the park with a lot of people shouting. Not a good place to be at, but there was no other way. We tried several times to take a taxi and the drivers refused because they said we could walk there. We had to insist, even with luggage.â€¦
