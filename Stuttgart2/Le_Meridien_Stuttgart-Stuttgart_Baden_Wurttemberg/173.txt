Just returned from a fabulous 5 night stay at this property from 29th July. Fast and efficient check in and a lovely room to stay with our 2 boys who are 3 and 8 years old. All staff were so welcoming to us all. The Champagne Sunday Brunch was really lovely with excellent piped jazz music in the background. Breakfast was a daily treat for us all with everything you could wish for from a demanding Family. Great location and easy to find. Would most definitely stay here again. Keep up the fantastic standards.
