I'll keep this short.  Great, normal, clean, friendly hotel.  Stay here, but do yourself a favor and don't stay in the front. The street noise is insane. I was on the first floor above the awning in the front. The window opened, so there was a nice breeze, but I had to close it at night to buffer the noise.
