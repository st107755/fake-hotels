Pricey, but you get what you pay for. Service is excellent, amenities are excellent, food was excellent, location perfect! The only problems I saw were facility related: the shower/bath set up made all the water splash out of the tub and flood the floor.  The placement of the ironing board made it inconvenient to iron unless you're left handed. Other small details like that made this hotel just barely under perfect.
