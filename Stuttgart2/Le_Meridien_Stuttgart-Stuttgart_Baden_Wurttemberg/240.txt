The common areas of this hotel were very nice and parking was conveniently located in the basement. Staff were friendly and professional and the breakfast was top notch. The location of this hotel will probably be great once the construction across the street is complete.   But for me the real minus was our room, which, though in theory located one floor above the ground floor, was still directly at street level due to the way the street inclined up on that side of the hotel. This means that we had to keep the curtains drawn tight or feel like shop mannequins on display for all wandering or driving by to see. My suggestion would be to request a room on a higher floor if you are going to stay here.
