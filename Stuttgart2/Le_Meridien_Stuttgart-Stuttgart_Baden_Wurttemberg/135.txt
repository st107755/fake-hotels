Good rooms, good breakfast, good lunch. Excellent service. 2 people in our group had their luggage lost by the airline, the hotel was went above expectations to help them (helped them get to the stores to buy some new clothes, contacted the airline regularly for updates). They were still helping us when our trip took us out of Stuttgart to Bonn.  I had a small issue checking in. They checked me into my room, I went upstairs and the room was locked from the inside. They were puzzled and apologetic. Fixed the situation right away.  We made use of their business centre regularly.
