I would stay here again as all in all is a better value for money and overall experience that the two other five -or four plus, stars hotels in Stuttgart. Not surprisingly, the available dishes for lunch and dinner are few and mostly uninspiring. There is a restaurant that belongs to the Hotel but you need to walk and go upstairs one flight up which at this time of the year is inconvenient. There, the steak is not bad. The daily burger is OK and the risotto really needs to be less cooked. Anyway, a great place to stay in Stuttgart. Also, great, even and always available wifi connectivity for free.
