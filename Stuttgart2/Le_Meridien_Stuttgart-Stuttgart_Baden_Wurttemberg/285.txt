Very nice hotel, very near to the city centre. The room was very comfortable, clean and with very good furniture. I suggest the morning breakfast, it's amazing with very good quality food and a big variety. The car park,also if you need to pay for it, is very secure and it's the perfect choice for leaving the car there and visit the city.
