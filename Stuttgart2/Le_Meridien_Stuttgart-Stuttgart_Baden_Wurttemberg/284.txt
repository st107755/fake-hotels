First time visiting the hotel and I was not disappointed. Very nice hotel, clean and spacious with good service and rooms. I did not try their breakfast and it was very expensive â€“ there are good possibilities in the surroundings. Fast check-in and check-out and parking space just in the basement was very convenient.
