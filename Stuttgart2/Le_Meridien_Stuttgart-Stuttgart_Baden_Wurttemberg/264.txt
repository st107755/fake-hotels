The entire front of the house staff is wonderful. I am always impressed with the attention to detail and friendliness of everyone from either of the concierges who can answer every question I have ever had and help me see some of the hidden gems (Johannes and Marcus) to the welcoming crew that help me get settled in. The managers (Stefan and Marco) are some of the best I have the pleasure to do business with. They all make it feel like I am coming home regardless of the amount of time I am staying. The breakfast is one of the best I have found and I  am not a morning person so I am always impressed with how helpful they are. The rooms have always been great and relaxing. I love the bathtubs and all the toiletries are great products.I also love the closet space and modern decor.â€¦
