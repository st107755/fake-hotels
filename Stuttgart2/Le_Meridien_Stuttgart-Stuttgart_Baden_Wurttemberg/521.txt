The staff very friendly..the service is good and fast, my room is super big n clean..the room very bright...the breakfast also very nice and various of choice..if you arrive by train and carry suitcase .better you take taxi, its only cost you â‚¬5.00...if you decide to walk you have to cross the park and climb stairs to the hotel...Hotel location is very good also, Main train station is 10 min walk..and  U bahn station is  5 min walk on the left side..
