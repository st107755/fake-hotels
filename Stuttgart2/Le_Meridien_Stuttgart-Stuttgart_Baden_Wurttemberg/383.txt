Stayed here for one night and was very impressed. Typical German hospitality was present from the moment we arrived; reception staff very pleasant, helpful and smiling.  Location is 5-10 minutes walk from Hauptbahnhof station and a similar time on foot to the city centre.  Our room was lovely; a great size, good amenities and a large, well equipped bathroom.  Beds extremely comfortable and a choice of pillow.  The bar area is beautiful and has a lovely ambience in the evening; drinks weren't too expensive.  Wifi is chargeable unless in the lobby which I think could be looked at.  Would recommend this hotel and would happily stay again.
