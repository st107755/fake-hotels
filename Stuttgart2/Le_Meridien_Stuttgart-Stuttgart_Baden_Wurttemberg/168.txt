I stayed overnight during a business trip and I frankly wish I could have stayed more. Really comfortable room, amazing breakfast buffet, and the lounge is pleasantly reminiscent of an Art Deco theater. I’d like to try the wellness area next time. Added plus: the Malin + Goetz toiletries are quite a treat. Only downside: there’s quite some construction happening right in front so I wouldn’t expect an inspiring view at this point in time. Overall, highly recommended!!
