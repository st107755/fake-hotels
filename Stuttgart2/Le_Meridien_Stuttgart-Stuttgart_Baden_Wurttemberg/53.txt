I have been a Marriott loyalist for years ... so now i find myself staying in former SPG premises  This hotel was very good  Breakfast excellent and good value  room nice  location very good  Spa - excellent - nice swimming pool and really good sauna area Only negative - not Hotels fault was that certain guests felt they were so "important" they could ignore the European protocol of the sauna area being "textile free" for hygiene reasons - it made us feel a little uncomfortable
