This hotel's problem is their office Manager  M. Jokusch  If you are willing to risk your reservation then it is more likely to happen in this hotel regardless if you have confirmation email from them or not. The office Manager is not even willing to look at the email in my mobile, because he already gave the rooms to others. We are family with children and travelling a long distance we arrived to this hotel to find out that our reservation is cancelled.!
