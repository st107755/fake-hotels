Le Meridien is in a convenient central location and delivers superior service in all areas. From the check-in process with Nadine to the always helpful Concierges to the Restaurant and Bar staff (especially Julian); everyone was so attentive and took genuine interest to ensure my needs were met and expectations exceeded. Excellent menu variety and cuisine served impeccably in La Cassoulet. A great hotel experience in all aspects! The only thing that could have possibly made this stay better would have been the use of the beautiful black Mercedes SEL 350 parked out front! Sounds ridiculous I know, but it would have been the only detail that would have improved my overall experience at Le Meridien!
