I travelled to Stuttgart area in early December for a week-long business trip and stayed at Le Meridien. The hotel is centrally located and convenient to many downtown sights and restaurants. The Christmas Market was in full swing and just a short walk from the hotel. The facilities have been recently (past year or so) updated and were all well maintained and clean. The staff, from check in, to health club/spa, restaurant and housekeeping were all professional, helpful and friendly. I will definitely stay here on next trip to the area.
