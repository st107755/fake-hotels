I visited this hotel with my family for 2 nights using Hotel points. I booked two connected rooms. Hotel staff were very nice and friendly. Hotel rooms were well appointed and clean. Breakfast was very good. It is more a business than a family hotel, but still we were well received. There is a construction just in front of the hotel that makes the view from the rooms fairly ugly but no noise was heard.
