I am staying here at the moment, while writing this review. It's my 2nd visit to this hotel and I'd like to share my opinion about Service - most professional I've ever experienced before, you feel like home here, it's a clean and perfectly located hotel with a nice touch in many small things. I had only problem with delay in room service but it was solved and the dish was free of charge. It is now my preffered hotel in Stuttgart. Thanks to Daniel on reception and Verena K. and all staff !   Regards   Viktor V
