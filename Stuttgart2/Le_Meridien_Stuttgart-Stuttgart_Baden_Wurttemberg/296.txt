I was for two nights in this hotel and found 100% fabulous on all points, food excellent, service of very high grade, location just close Hbf Stuttgart .you call for anything and whole staff will be after arranging. Good,Good,Good, .hotel seems to be little expensive but you can get good deals on booking.com if you plan in advance.
