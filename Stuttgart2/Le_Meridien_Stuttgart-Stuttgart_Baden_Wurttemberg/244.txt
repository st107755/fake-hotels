I recently stayed at this hotel for the second time (the first being several years ago). It's about a 15 mins walk from the main shopping area (and about 10 mins to the station).  Directly opposite the main entrance is part of the HUGE development around the station that is due to continue for several years. Mine room faced the back of the building and I experienced no problems with noise... whether that is true of rooms overlooking the main road I do not know.  Everything is of a very high quality; rooms, staff, breakfast, etc.  ROOM The rooms I have stayed in are very comfortable; a desk to work at, a comfortable chair to relax in and a lovely bathroom.  STAFF Every member of staff I interacted with was courteous, friendly and very helpful. They do the hotel proud!  BREAKFASTâ€¦
