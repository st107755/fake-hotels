The Le Meridien Stuttgart is an excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff and great amenities. The rooms are a little small but well-appointed. I think the hotel was recently renovated. They did a great job with the rooms - even the bathrooms seemed upscale.  The staff shoudl be commended for being so friendly and helpful.  I needed to do some laundry after visiting a couple of other cities before Stuttgart and the hotel clerk gave me easy to follow directions and marked exactly where on the map I could find the laundromat. My rate included a buffet breakfast which was really good in terms of variety and food quality. For example, there were at least 8 different muesli to choose from.  I skipped lunch because I was so full from breakfast.  The hotel is also very close to 2â€¦
