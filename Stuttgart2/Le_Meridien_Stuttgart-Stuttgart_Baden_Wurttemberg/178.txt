Stayed here for Karcher's world meeting together with 300 other dealers from around the world. The staff were pleasant, food faultless and rooms well appointed.  Never can seem to get a decent cup of tea in the morning on continent but that was only criticism!!   Invoice was collected by KÃ¤rcher so no idea on cost.
