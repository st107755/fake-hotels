I stayed one Night on behalf of Business. Hotel doesnt look too fancy from the outside but it is actually pretty good. Rooms of decent size - very good selection of TV channels. Bathroom ok. Minibar rather expensive. A clear minus: WLAN not free of charge. Breakfast pretty good. Seems to have a good SPA but havent had Time to go there.
