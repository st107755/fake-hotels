Trying to navigate through a building site from the main train station to the hotel wasn't the best introduction to Stuttgart, but the welcome at reception was fantastic.  My room was spacious and comfortable.  Although the room was on the first floor facing the street, the wasn't much traffic noise and I didn't get disturbed. I visited the pool area on the first evening and enjoyed a swim and the whirlpool. The gym is small but well equipped, I was delighted to find hand weights, mats, wobble boards and medicine balls in addition to the ubiquitous running machines. I ate it in the hotel restaurant on one evening, the food was delicious and the service was good.   This is not a cheap hotel but it was a very enjoyable stay.
