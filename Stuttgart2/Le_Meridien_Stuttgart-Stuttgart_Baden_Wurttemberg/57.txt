Unfortantely the bar is not flexibel to receive any orders after midnight. Even orders to the room cant be received at the bar. Manager Mr. Wahlen explained us it is not possible. As a frequent traveler in 5* and (4*) hotels I can't believe.. A delivery to the room is possible but not to the bar (even the kitchen is still open).  I am ised to different service and offering at Meridian.  Best regards, Sarah
