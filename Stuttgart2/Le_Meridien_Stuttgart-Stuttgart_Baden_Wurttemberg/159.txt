It's quite a large hotel in a nice location. When I was there, there were lot of works in the area: nevertheless the hotel was clean and everything was organized around to walk to the center using a convenint bridge to reach the city center. Check in and check out fast by well trained people. Rooms are large with view over the city, very clean; very well insultated from external noise. There is an undergroung large parking. Breakfast is high quality
