this is a really nice hotel, good location, 5 mins walking distance from the main train station (currently there are construction works between the station and the hotel! so follow the temp walkway to the park and then to the over road bridge, if you don't want to use the stairs follow the cycle track then there is an underpass with a ramp and then 2 mins walk to the hotel main entrance). The check-in staff were all really friendly and helpful. Nice comfy room with pleasant decor, i had an executive room on the 5th (top floor) with great views and very quiet. The Spa is great, nice pool and several different temp saunas. Breakfast was excellent, varied selection and good cooked to order omelettes and eggs. Would recommend this hotel in Stuttgart.
