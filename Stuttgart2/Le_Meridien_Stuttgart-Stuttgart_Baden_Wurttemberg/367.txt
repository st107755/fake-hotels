Despite its bland external appearance this hotel is beautiful inside and offers a great service.The location is excellent too. Our rooms were lovely, the beds super comfortable and the staff (particularly Stephen at front desk) were superb. The train station is a couple of minutes walk -  as are the main areas. I highly recommend this hotel for leisure or business.
