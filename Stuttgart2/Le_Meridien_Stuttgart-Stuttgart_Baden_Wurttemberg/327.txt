Great location and very nice property in Stuttgart.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Platinums get full breakfast, which was very nice.  I'd like to really thank Lisa at the front desk for being very helpful and making it an enjoyable stay.  We greeted by first name from Lisa each morning with a smile and really appreciate that.
