We absolutely loved our time at Le Meridien, all the facilities were perfectly clean, tidy and well presented. The staff were wonderful - friendly and outgoing, they all spoke English (many perfectly, all of them to a level that allowed us to communicate). Even though we knew it was a 5 star hotel, we were still amazed at the quality and presentation of the place.  We will be going back if we have the chance! Read moreDate of stay: May 2006HelpfulShare
