We recently stayed over NYE and it was a fantastic base for the various activities we did (black forest, heidelberg, porsche/mercedes museum, outlet city).  Rooms were modern and generous sized for European standards (we were in an Executive Chic room).  All the front desk staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming and helpful, particularly Sarina.  Would return and stay again.
