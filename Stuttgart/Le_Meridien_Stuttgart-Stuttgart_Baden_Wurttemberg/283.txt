the room was clean and nice, but the service was not good at all. I ordered a room service and the table was too big to fit the door, so I wasn't able to get the table out of the room after dinner. next day, I returned to the hotel at about 13:00. the table from last night was still in the room and no one have made the room.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 25, 2016Dear "incanus1",  thank you very much for your review about your stay with us. I am glad that you enjoyed your room, however I am sorry to hear that we were not completely satisfied with the Service you experienced. Housekeeping hours are daily between 8am and 6pm, with 293 rooms it can happen that not all rooms have received service by 1pm. In case you prefer an early service you may just inform our staff. Also, Room Service is happy to remove the table after you have finished your dinner, just give us a call once you are done. We would be happy to welcome you back whenever your travel plans lead you back to Stuttgart! All the best, Stefan Hummel Front Office ManagerRead more
