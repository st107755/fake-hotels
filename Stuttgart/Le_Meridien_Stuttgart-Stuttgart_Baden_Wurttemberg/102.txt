Stayed here a couple of times and both pleasant experiences.  Rooms are spacious, room service is good and a nice little gym/pool.  Iâ€™d recommend an early morning stroll round the lovely park opposite !  Only watch out - breakfast here can get a little busy for some reason.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
