There was construction work around the planetarium and train station to make it a bit harder to get to the hotel from the train station. Our room was just above a major road and facing the construction site, so again, it might be nice after the construction work is done, but my son enjoyed the diggers and bulldozers.  The spa facilities were nice.  Otherwise, a place that meets expectations, but doesn't blow you away.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear Foolander,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us.  Unfortunately we cannot do anything about the construction work at the “Schlossgarten”. The Parkview at the moment is truly not the best but we also have rooms locating the quiet garden side. I am happy that at least your son enjoyed the action outside! :-)  We wish you a nice Christmas time and hope to welcome you back next year.
