Had another great stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.  The most friendly and knowledgeable front desk staff; great food (I love breakfast!) and relaxing spa.  The only downside (if you can call it that) is that the Internet is a bit pricey.  I think it would be great if the hotel had at least free Wi Fi in the lobby.  I will most definitely be back for another visit!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 26, 2012Dear “AuntieVern“,  We would like to thank you that you have stayed once again at Le Meridien Stuttgart and for sharing your feedback on TripadVisor.
