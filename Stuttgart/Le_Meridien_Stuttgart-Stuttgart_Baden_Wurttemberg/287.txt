This is my third visit to this hotel and I upgraded my room to the fourth floor, nice rooms, very spacious, although I did only stay one night thankfully.   I am also glad it wasn't the height of summer, I had very little sleep due to the fact that the room was absolutely red hot, despite having the air-con on full blast all night, it really was an uncomfortable stay.   I was unable to open the window due to my room being at the front of a very loud main road with building works.   When I checked out I was told that the air con only worked when the outside temp was 18c which I found very odd indeed.  I was of course offered the obligatory bottle of 'local wine', TBH I would have rather had the deserved discount applied for having a room that was only suitable for Amazonianâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 23, 2016Dear Simcn,  thank you very much for taking the time and reviewing your last stay at our hotel. I'm very sorry, that we were not able to meet your expectations. I guess that offering you to move to a different room would have been more appropriated. Our cooling system works well, and it seems that there was a defect in the control unit in your room.  Other than that, I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Best Regards  Marco Jokusch Asst.
