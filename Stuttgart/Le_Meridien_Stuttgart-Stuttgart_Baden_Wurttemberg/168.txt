I stayed overnight during a business trip and I frankly wish I could have stayed more. Really comfortable room, amazing breakfast buffet, and the lounge is pleasantly reminiscent of an Art Deco theater. I’d like to try the wellness area next time. Added plus: the Malin + Goetz toiletries are quite a treat. Only downside: there’s quite some construction happening right in front so I wouldn’t expect an inspiring view at this point in time. Overall, highly recommended!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Dimitris,  thank you for sharing the experience at Le Méridien Stuttgart with the Tripadvisor Community!

However we hope to welcome you back before that time :)  Best regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division ManagerRead more
