Stayed 10 days in this fabulous hotel. Everything was at the highest level of quality and the service was exceptional. Highly recommend this hotel for any kind of stay. The staff were well trained and very friendly which plays a big part in the stay. The only downside i can think of is the wifi... its so expensive, I've stayed in many hotels and most of the time its very cheap if not free.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
