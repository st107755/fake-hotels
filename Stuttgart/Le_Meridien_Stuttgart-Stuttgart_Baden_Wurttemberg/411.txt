We stayed here for 2 nights and found the hotel very pleasant. Checkin was delayed by almost an hour as they had a huge number of guests arriving but we were given an upgrade to compensate. The location is excellent, 10 min stroll from the central train station and easy access to the main shopping area. The subway was close by and staff were friendly and helpful. The only thing that would have improved our stay would have been the addition of a kettle in the room, but I am aware this is not standard for European hotels.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear ditony01,  thank you very much for sharing your experience about our hotel with others!  The best exit from the main station to the hotel would be the one next to track 16, just walk over the pedestrian bridge and once you exit at the beergarden across the street you already see the hotel. If you carry a lot of luggage your best way to the hotel would be not crossing the bridge over the street but walk a little bit further to the underground subway stop "Staatsgalerie". In that case you avoid any stairs.  I hope to see you staying with us again! Kind regards,  Stefan HummelRead more
