I have stayed at this hotel numerous time for itâ€™s convenience location just 10 mins walk from the train station.  All the staffs at the hotel are super friendly.  Especially Ms. Merz whom notice my birthday was during my stay, and prepare a special local treat as a birthday gift, and Ms. Paris sent a bottle of red wine to the room.  The staffs are the reason for my continuous return to this wonderful hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
