This Hotel is on the expensive side, so I am glad my company was paying for the room.  It's what I would class as your classic American styling. Large grand and king sized beds.  The restaurant and bar are very nice and don't disappoint. The hotel is in a great location not too far (a 7 minute walk) from the main Stuttgart train station. Although when I was there construction in the area meant taking a taxi was easier.  If you are into large expensive American styled hotels, then this place is for you, if you are a man on a budget, or want to be closer to the Stuttgart restaurant and nightlife scene, this place will disappoint.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 31, 2016Dear EastLondonKiwi,  thank you very much for staying at Le Meridien Stuttgart and for sharing your positive comments on TripAdvisor. I'm happy that you enjoyed your stay with us. The construction site " Stuttgart21" will last the next years, and once finished it will be a huge improvement for Stuttgart and its region. Where's a construction site, there's always some obstacles, but as you mentioned, taking a cab is sometimes the best and easiest way, but walking from the train station to the hotel is also a possibility, as it's only a 7 minutes walk.  Hopefully we can welcome you back in Stuttgart in the next future. Until then, i wish you a great time.  All the Best  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
