We stayed in the hotel for two nights and had a wonderful experience.  The staff is very friendly, helpful and highly skilled. We had one wonderful dinner at the Restaurant and enjoyed very good cocktails in the bar.  The wellness area is als very nice.  The location of the hotel is ideal for walking into the city center of Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 5, 2016Dear Roman G,  thank you very much for your time writing a comment on Tripadvisor.
