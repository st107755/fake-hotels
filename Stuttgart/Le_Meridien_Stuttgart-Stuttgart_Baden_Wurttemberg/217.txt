This hotel is close to the main station and its new Stuttgart 21 development.As that has been far delayed the hotel views and access is affected by digging and cranes.So no real view on offer even from the street facing rooms. The junior suite to which I was upgraded is just a large room with an odd toilet.the amenities are standard and coffee and tea service is good The separate closet through far from the toilet is well organised and spacious.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 10, 2017Dear Geeess,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us and also for your time writing a comment on Tripadvisor.  Our Junior suites have a size of 60 m². The suite is divided in the middle of the room by a sideboard where the TV is installed. Only the bathroomes differ from each other in some points. If there is anything in your room which seems odd or unpleasant, please never hesitate to contact the Front Office anytime. My colleagues are always happy to assist in making your stay as comfortable as possible. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about the view from the rooms to the construction work for Stuttgart21. Our windows are soundproof and at least you do not hear a thing as soon as you entered the Hotel.  We would be glad to welcome you back whenever your plans will lead you to Stuttgart again.  All the best,  Verena Kirchenbauer Ass. Front Office ManagerRead more
