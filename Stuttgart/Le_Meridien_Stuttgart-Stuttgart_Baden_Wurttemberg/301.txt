I've been there for a weekendtrip to Stuttgart. The spa is very clean, modern and has a great relaxing atmosphere. To mention is that the way to the spa is getting to the first floor and walking by various rooms to get to another lift that gets you down to the spa.  The rooms are as well nice and clean. Breakfast had a great variety and service was friendly though I find it strange they serve in chef-jackets, but a question of taste.  The only thing I didn"t like was the view onto a huge site, but there was no noice... so it was ok. Sites in a city might be inevitable.  I definitely recommend the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 21, 2016Dear Verena G,  thank you for your nice comment.  Our SPA is really a great place for having a time-out. At the latest after a massage of one of our therapist you are deeply relaxed. The elevator to the SPA are is located at the "Neckarwing" of the building. Please let my colleagues at the Front Desk know if you would like to have a room closer to the elevator and you won't have to walk through the first floor. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about the construction site at the Schlossgarden. We also do have rooms facing the backside of the Hotel where the view is better and you can also sleep with open window.  We are looking forward to your next weekendtrip to Stuttgart!  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation Manager Read more
