We stayed for 2 nights in September. Very comfortable room, all staff friendly and helpful except for one waitress in the restaurant who was a little over zealous & unnerved my wife somewhat. We thought that 25 Euros per person for breakfast was excessive so made other arrangements. Parking was easy to access but costs 20 Euros per day. Room service was very good & restaurant food was nice. Location is across the road from a nice park, the demonstrators didn't present us any problems while walking to the city centre. I would stay here again but would probably book a room at the back to be able to open a window to let fresh air into the room. Room was quiet with the windows shut but way too noisy with them open.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
