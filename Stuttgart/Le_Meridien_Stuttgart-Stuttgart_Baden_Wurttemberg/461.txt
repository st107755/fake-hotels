This hotel is of really good quality. This is the best you can get in the main station area if you don't mind a short walk through the park in morning (which looks more like a building site, due to the new main station building project). It has an excellent fitness room, great spa and gorgeous breakfast, the best I ever had so far. The service is almost too friendly. The only downside is the traffic in front of the hotel, which makes some rooms pretty noise if the windows are open. You are not exposed to the noise if the windows are closed.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 13, 2013Dear “JohnPetrucci“  Thank you very much for sharing your recent experience with us on Tripadvisor.
