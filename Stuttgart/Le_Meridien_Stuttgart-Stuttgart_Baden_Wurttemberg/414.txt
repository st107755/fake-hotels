Stayed here for one night on a European trip for my parents 35th Anniversary. This was my 5th time at the Le Meridien and my parents first. Gave us beautiful rooms and for my parents Anniversary the room given I think was part of the Presidential as it was absolutely wonderful. Also, they were treated with munchies, a bottle of champagne and a signed card from the staff congratulating them!!!…This was the first hotel of 18 on a 4 week trip and being back home now I can truly say that the Le Meridien did the best job at recognizing such a special occasion. Will definitely be back every time I am in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 2, 2014Dear "TDEAC1CAM",  thank you very much for choosing Le Méridien Stuttgart as your initial hotel for your travel throughout Europe.
