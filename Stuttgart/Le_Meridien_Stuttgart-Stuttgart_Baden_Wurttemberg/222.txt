Stayed in a refurbished standard room for 2 nights. The room was lovely, felt very warm and homely. All furnishings to a high standard with a really comfortable bed. Hotel itself has very good facilities. Very nice pool and spa area. The only thing that let the hotel down was the restaurant where the service was generally poor both for dinner and breakfast. Food was ok but nothing special. Service elsewhere in the hotel was excellent. Reception staff made us feel very special. Location good, close to subway and about 10minsvwalk to centre.  Would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
