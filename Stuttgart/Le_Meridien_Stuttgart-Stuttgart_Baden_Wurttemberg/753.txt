First I received a very warm and friendly welcome. My room was not large, but very stylish, a beautiful design and also very functional.  For a rate of Euro 125.00 breakfast was included - and it was fabulous, choices galore!  Food is very good in the restaurant and room service, too. The spa is even better than the pictures look. I loved it! The gym is nice, new equipment and a spacious room - and downstairs the pool and the whirlpool are decorated very zen... what a treat!! I doubt that anywhere in the US you can find such a beautiful hotel for such a great rate! ( Or even double the rate!)  And in additon you are a 5 minute away from the castle and the center of town.  If I ever go back to Stuttgart, I know I'll be back in the Meridien! Read moreDate of stay: April 2004HelpfulShare
