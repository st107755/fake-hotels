Top quality hotel - but expensive.  Good location close to the Altstadt with pay parking.  The hotel appears to be opposite a pleasant park - however be aware that there is a six-lane boulevard (motorway) between the hotel and it. If you can get a reasonable deal (including breakfast) this is a great place to stay in Stuttgart. Le Cassoulet restaurant - see separate review - is not great value - better walk into Altstadt which is only 10-15 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 26, 2011Dear "MJBDublin",  Thank you very much for your stay at the Le Meridien Stuttgart and that you had some time to share your experiences at TripadVisor.
