My overall experience was great.. staff are friendly and helpful.. their service is fast.. the food is delicious.. lots of options.. the WiFi is fast too but not for free in the rooms.. the hotel location is a bit far from the center.. through the park to the centre and train station like 10 minutes walk.. with strollers was a bit hard.. to cross the street steps all the way to the bridge and down again to the park.. otherwise everything was perfectRead moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 23, 2015Dear Mrs. Abeer A,  thank you very much for sharing your great review on TripAdvisor. We are glad, that you enjoyed your stay with us.  We are located very close to the city center, but with the construction site of Stuttgart21, the new tarin station, it's sometimes difficult to find the best way to the city, just when you do have a stroller with you.  I am sure, with your next stay in Stuttgart, there will be some changed at the construction site, which makes it lot more easier to get to the city center when travelling with a stroller.  Best Regards to Dubai  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
