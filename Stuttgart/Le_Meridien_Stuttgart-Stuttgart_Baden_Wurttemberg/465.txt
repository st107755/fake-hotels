This is a nice hotel but not a 5 star hotel.  The rooms are small and not that well cleaned. The carpet in the hotel (rooms and hallways) are very dirty and have stains everywhere. The rooms are very noisy, you can hear people in the room next to you talk.  The restaurant is a big plus. Good food. Breakfast in the morning is great as well, although the hot food was cold very quickly.  The rooms are not cheap at all, rather expensive. This is ok if the hotel gives you value for your money. Well in my opinion they did not.  Le Meridien is part of Starwoord but Westin or W are a much better choice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 13, 2013Dear ”I_Like_Gooood_Hotels”  Thank you for posting your comments on Tripadvisor following your recent stay with us.
