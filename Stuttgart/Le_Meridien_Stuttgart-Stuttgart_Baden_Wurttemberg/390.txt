This hotel was very centrally located, close to the train station and would ordinarily have gotten 5 stars from me. But, the road construction right in front of the hotel was off-putting. But the service was phenomenal. Particularly Marcel, one of the bartenders in the bar. He gave us great suggestions for Christmas markets to visit and a fabulous recommendation for dinner - made us a reservation and got us a taxi. We wanted to eat real Swabian food, not tourist food, and Marcel certainly delivered. Made for a very enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 22, 2014Dear wandrin,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and it is certainly a delight to read that you enjoyed our hotel and its facilities including our bar team and Marcel's effort.
