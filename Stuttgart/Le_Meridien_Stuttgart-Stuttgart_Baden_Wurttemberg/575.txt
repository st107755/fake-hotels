Wow, a 5 star feels like a 2 star from a service perspective. Awful from booking to check out and post leaving.  We are a family and asked for connecting room but it took forever to be sure it was possible, at least 4 phone calls. Once there the rooms were not set up with baby beds and it took another 30 min to get everything sorted. And then the noise of the big road surpringly loud in the kiddies room.   The next surprise came the morning after when we got our brand new car from valet with a scratch on the side and after immediate reassurance that it would be taken care we ended with having to deal with it our selves.  In summary truly awfull in term of service, dealing with liens and organization.  Positive note, the breakfast is very well organized and presented.Read moreDate of stay: December 20111 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 31, 2012Dear “Stefano_Nardo”:  Upon departure you reported the scratch at your car to our manager on duty, however after reviewing security tapes, interviewing the staff involved and seeing the actual scratch on pictures which were taken at departure, we had to come to the conclusion that the scratch was not caused by any staff member; therefore we cannot accept liability in this case.  As a 5 Star hotels we take the safety and security of our guests and their possessions very seriously. Over the 7 year period since the opening of Le Méridien Stuttgart, the number of guest vehicle incidents has been insignificant. When a guest vehicle is damaged we are quick to acknowledge responsibility if we are at fault.  Best regards,  Selim Mokni Guest Relation ManagerRead more
