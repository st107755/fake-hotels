I was disappointed about executive lounge and some room amenities. It was worst lounge I have ever seen. It was turned from a guest room, lack of service. Ordinary coffee machine no coffee cups etc.There was a computer in lounge and there is no privacy, everybody can see you while on computer.  Nowadays, even low budget hotels offering tea/coffee machine in the room. but you can't find it here. Generally staff, ambiance, room condition is satisfactory which has to be.  You don't have more choice 5 star hotel in Stuttgart.Don't expect a privilege or  spacious rooms if you booked executive room.Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relation at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Feb 23, 2011Dear SerkanT3,  Thank you for your rating at Tripadvisor.   First of all we would like to apologize for your inconvenience during your stay with us. The Executive rooms are having the same size as all the other guestrooms in the hotel. The advantage of these rooms are the location on the the higher floors with the best view over Stuttgart.   We are sorry that the cups for coffee in the Lounge were missing. We do check the lounge hourly to avoid these circumstances. However if it should happen, just give us a short call we are happy to assist!   When you would like to use the computer by your self you have the opportunity to use the business center. I appreciate your comment regarding the tea or coffee machine in the room, we do have them in hotel and are happy to provide them to you. Just give us information at time of booking or at check in.
