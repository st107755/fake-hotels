Nice clean hotel, Lobby was very European the staff was great. Rooms were clean a bit small. The fitness facility was equipped well. The great thing about this Hotel is its location it's downtown next to the park and a stones throw from a great Beer Garden.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 19, 2013Dear “Braveheart2810“  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your impressions with other travelers.
