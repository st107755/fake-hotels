 It was a last minute decision, since we figured that our research was wrong and Mercedes and Porsche museums were NOT near the Motorworld at Bolingen.  Booked the hotel on my SPG App, got a standard room, with b/f for 240€ a night, for 2 adults and a kid.   It's about 10 minute Walk from the Stuttgart Central station, but not easy to walk with large luggage, as you will need to invest few steps. The whole of central Stuttgart is a giant construction site, so the view from Le Meridien is completely spoilt, and will probably remain so for a long while.   Better to get a hotel next to the station if you are keen on Central location, or near the old palace/ town square, but anything around the main arterial road leading up to the station can be avoided.

I am glad that you have enjoyed your stay with us. You are absolutely right, there is so much more to see then just the Mercedes & Porsche Museum. You already mentioned some great suggestions. Let me add to visit the Art Gallerie "Staatsgalerie", to which you will find free tickets in your room. Also, close by are beautiful cities such as Esslingen and Ludwigsburg, both conveniently available with a short train ride.  We try to keep the inconveniences due to the construction as little as possible, please accept my apologies for the trouble you had.  We are looking forward welcoming you again on your next trip to Stuttgart! Kind regards,  Stefan Hummel Le Méridien Stuttgart Read more
