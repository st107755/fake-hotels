Last time I stayed here I was an extended guest for several weeks.  I was set up with a deluxe room, plenty of storage, and a great deal on breakfast and parking.  This time, as a platinum SPG member, I was upgraded to a beautiful suite near the spa, free breakfast, free internet, and well taken care of despite my road warrior appearance when I showed up in the lobby.  VERY much appreciated and love this hotel.  Great spot near the train, some museums, the shopping district, and the Saturday market.  Slightly more expensive than other Stuttgart hotels, but very worth it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear flynavy99,  what a great review!!
