Nice hotel in great location near city centre with great transport link nearby.  It took around 20-30 mins in a taxi from the airport or 30 minutes via underground. Staff were very friendly and helpful, hotel was well equipped, shame they don't offer free wifi though.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien2015, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 6, 2015Dear "Emily S",  Thank you very much for choosing Le Méridien Stuttgart on your most recent stay in Germany.
