Enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien.  The hotel is easy to get to from the train station - about 10 to 15 minute walk.  The rooms were modern and clean.  We also had nightcaps in the bar area.  Service was good there.  The only drawback is that the WIFI was not included in the price of the room and was also not complimentarily available in the lobby.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 14, 2014Hi Diane K!  Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay with us! I am surprised to read that there was no free wi-fi in our lobby, as we do offer comp wi-fi throughout the lobby and the business center. Stop by at the Front Desk next time in case you have these kind of difficulties!  Hope to see you soon again!  Stefan HummelRead more
