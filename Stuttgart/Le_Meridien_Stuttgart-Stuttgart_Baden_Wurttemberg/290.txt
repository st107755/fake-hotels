I stayed for 3 nights at the Le Meridien Stuttgart with a group of friends.  We enjoyed the hotel, especially the accommodating staff and spa area.  As of May 2016 some guest rooms are renovated and modern, some are a bit dated.  Mine was one of the unrenovated rooms, but it was still clean and did not appear worn.  My room faced the train station and busy Willy-Brandt-Straße, but the windows provided adequate sound insulation.  The Stuttgart Central Station is in the early phases of a ten-year reconstruction project, so construction is unavoidable in this part of the city.

It's always a pleasure to read that you are more than satisfied with the hotel and its facilities. Stuttgart21, the huge reconstruction Project in the heart of Stuttgart will last the next 5-6 years, and will bring a positive impact towards Stuttgart and the Region, however, where a construction site is, there's always  some inconvinience regarding the traffic or walking pathways.  I do appreciate that nevertheless you enjoyed staying in our hotel. All of our rooms facing the City did get a revision on the windows to provide a pleasant sleep and to prevent any noise from outside.  Our Spa is a great area to relax after a journey or a long day in the City, so you did it absolutely right.  Hopefully, we can welcome you again at Le Meridien Stuttgart.  All the best  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Officer Manager  Read more
