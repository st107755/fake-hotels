We stayed there for a night because it was one of the only hotel left in Stuttgart. It was a bit expensive but acceptable as a business expense. Staying there was a great decision! The service is fantastic. The rooms are huge, very well equipped and beautifully designed. The breakfast was pretty standard, but of great quality nonetheless.  This is definitely one of the best places to stay at in Stuttgart if you (or your business) can afford it.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 27, 2016Dear Teroc_uk,  thank you very much for your review on Tripadvisor.
