The worse part of travelling for my husband is getting to a hotel and praying that I like it.  I can only  say that when we arrived in the city and booked into this hotel I could hear the sigh of relief from my huaband when I said what a lovely room/bar/retaurant/staff even though I took him to a pet shop boys concert......but he enjoyed that as well. To be serious this hotel was one of the best, the staff were wonderful as was the room.  Look forward to going there again soon.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 21, 2009Dear Ilannon,  Thank you very much for your rating.
