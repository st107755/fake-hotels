Stayed here for a night on way back to UK from Italy. Parking underneath, really nice spa area if you don't mind getting naked??? Food was brilliant and the room had a complimentary mini bar. Could it get any better.  Quite pricey but then you'd expect that from a meridien hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 2, 2010Dear Ellisd88:  Thank you very much for taking time and letting us know your opinion.
