The Le Meridian hotel is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. Large flat screen TV, robes and slippers for guests and very helpful staff.  A short walk to the U-bahn or rail station so a car is not required although we did note that this hotel has parking.  The hotel rooms seem to be well isolated from each other and very quiet.  The staff said that the hotel belonged to the Intercontinental chain until a year ago but I do not remember it being as nice then. Also, Internet rates are very good in the winter so took advantage of the Wielnaughtmarkt (Christmas Market) and also got an excellent room rate. Read moreDate of stay: December 2005HelpfulShare
