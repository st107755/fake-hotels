The entire city of Stuttgart is under construction, not the fault of the hotel. The Le Meridien is your refuge from that construction.   The next time I’m in Stuttgart I will stay at Le Meridien. Research options from the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof to the hotel taking the subway, there is a subway stop (staatsgalerie) that is maybe 200 m from the hotel and avoids walking through a park and going up and down stairs with luggage, you may have to change trains so do your research.  If you do not want to see construction ask for a Garden view.  If  air conditioning is insufficient request fan The concierge is very helpful in finding recommendations for what to do in Stuttgart and how to get there.  Special thanks to Sabine for ensuring all of our special requests where taken care of!…Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 22, 2019Dear guest "212tawanp",  thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Hotel.
