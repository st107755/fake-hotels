I sspent the weekend here as a small holiday between jobs.  The hotel is very nice, clean and Super nice staff.  The morning breakfast buffet is one of the best I have seen.  E 22.00 but they fried 2 eggs for me.  Something I have not seen here in Germany yet for breakfast.  They have 4 of 70 TV channels that is English.  They also have French, Italian, Russian and a few others I did not understand..ha ha.  It is a nice 15 walk to a great shopping area.  My view out the window is lousy, but I got a good deal on the price.  Was able to open the window and get some fresh air.  AC has a therostat had a comfortable King-Size bed....Huge bath tub that I took advantage of.  I would come here again.    :-)Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 11, 2015Dear kingrich1,  the entire team is really happy to read that you had a great stay at our property.  Our breakfast buffet is definitely helpful to have a good start into the day. Unfortunately the view out of the window is not the best at the moment but as the city centre is that close you do not have to spent the whole day in your room! ;-)  I hope to welcome you back next time you are in Stuttgart.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
