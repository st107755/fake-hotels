The Le Meridien is a good hotel, with a convenient location to city center, Christmas markets, and train station.  I would not classify it as 5 star luxury property.  It is a little tired and rooms are basic.  It was comfortable however and generally good & friendly service from the staff.  Was not overly impressed with the concierge assistance.  Only dined there for breakfast and it was very good.  We had a room facing the busy street and there is some traffic noise.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 17, 2013Dear “Tokyo_Yoship“  Thank you very much for being your choice of hotel, while staying in Stuttgart.
