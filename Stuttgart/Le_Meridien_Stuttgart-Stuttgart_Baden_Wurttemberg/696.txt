Stayed at the meridien Stuttgart for three nights. The roooms are fabulous, clean and very comfortable. This is a hotel that adds the extra touches and delivers a very high level of service. The hotel is set  in a lovely courtyard and in easy reach of all the City key areas. The breakfasts were excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel.   Stuttgart is a lovely German City which is steeped in its love of culture and has fabulous museums including the Mercedes Benz museum which is well worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2008HelpfulShare
