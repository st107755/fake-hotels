Stayed here for two nights while attending a conference and while the bar and evening restaurant team are very good, the hotel is let down by poor maintenance and rude breakfast staff.  My room was ridiculously warm on arrival so adjusted the heating to 17 degrees and noticed after a while that nothing had changed.

I am sorry to read that your experience with us was not the way it should have been, as the air cooling had some issues during your stay. Please accept our apologies as I can imagine that this causes some restless nights.  In regards to the breakfast we ask our guests to leave the luggage at the supervised area of the restaurant entrance or the concierge, since suitcases at the tables do cause congestion. If that has not been the case at the moment you were there is possible, as we experience this situation mainly between 7:00am and 8:45am.   Again, we appreciate your feedback as this only improves our organization. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the future so that we may restore your faith in our hotel.   With best regards from Le Méridien Stuttgart,  Stefan Hummel Front Office ManagerRead more
