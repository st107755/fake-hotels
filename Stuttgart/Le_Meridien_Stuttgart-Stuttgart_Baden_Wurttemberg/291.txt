- Great Hotel. - Polite and cooperative staff. - Very good breakfast. - Le Cassoulet resturant is serving a very good quality of food.  - Not very close to the city center. - Back rooms are very quite and far from street noise but the view is not impressive.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 23, 2016Dear mabdelhameed,  thank you very much for taking the time to give us this amazing review. It's great to read, that you enjoyed the Food at our Restaurant "Le Cassoulet" and our breakfast buffet, also that you mentioned the positive attitude of our staff. The main shopping street "KÃ¶nigstrasse" is a 7-8 min walk from the hotel. You can also use the Metro, there are 2 stations within 200 m from the hotel.  We are looking forward to welcome you again in Stuttgart.  Best Regards  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
