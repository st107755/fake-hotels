We've been to this hotel several times now and service has been very high consistently. The only disappointment so far was a dusty wash table in the bath room.  We could not decide yet about the best part: the spa and pool area or the breakfast. For me the location was ideal. I could imagine that people who mainly are right in the center of town find it a bit too far off.  I've been here on business trips as well as on family vacation.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 12, 2014Dear “StefanHz“  Thank you for taking the time to post your review on TripAdvisor following your recent stay here at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
