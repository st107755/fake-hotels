I stayed two nights for business, which happened to fall over my birthday. I received a bottle of wine and a card upon leaving, signed by the staff. A very unexpected and kind thought. I was most touched. The hotel itself was excellent. A very comfortable time, and everything you would expect from a hotel of this star rating. Happily recommend to anyone visiting stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien2015, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 28, 2015Dear Mr. "Thomaswalkertenor",  thank you very much for your very positive words.
