Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart is closed by to the train station.  It's one of my top choice when I come here for business.  This trip was with my family for vocation.  The front desk staff, Daniel, not only prepared the suite that I stayed before, he also put the connecting rooms for the kids next room ahead of time, make local recommendations for tourists place & family friendly restaurants, and show the kids some interesting facts about Stuttgart.    That's called preparation to make a returning guest feels like coming home.  Simply wonderful experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 31, 2017Dear Ken,  thank you very much for your wonderful review about your stay in our hotel.
