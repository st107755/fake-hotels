Stayed here a few nights while visiting Porsche museum and factory in Stuttgart. Very pleasant "Business" type hotel. Staff was very accommodating and helpful with our needs. Hotel is walking distance to plaza containing many shops and restaurants.  We booked and paid prior to vist and were able to save considerably from standard rack rate.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
