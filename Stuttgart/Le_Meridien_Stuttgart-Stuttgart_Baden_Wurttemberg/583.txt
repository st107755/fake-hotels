Wonderful hotel, near the train station, although it was said to be walking distance, it really take only 5 minutes to walk to the main train station, but not recommend if you have heavy luggage, it require up and down the staircase and some walking on dirt road, better off to take a taxi for 8 Euro. Nice room, the spa is wonderful with a small pool. Breakfast at the restaurant is very nice, a lot of fine local food and they even give you tea, coffee and juice for take away. Service is excellent.
