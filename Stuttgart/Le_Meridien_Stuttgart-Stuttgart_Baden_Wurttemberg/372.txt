We booked to stay here for one night in April, while doing a short trip in Germany.   The outside of the hotel looks old, but the decor inside is stylish, clean and tidy.   Parking is tight, and fairly expensive for what it is. I was surprised how much a 5 star hotel was charging for its parking.   Rooms are average in size, but clean and tidy. Beds fairly comfortable.   Wifi isn't free.   Breakfast was superb though, and the piano bar in the evening was pleasant to get a drink.   I've stayed in nicer 5 start hotels, that offer better value for money.
