We managed to get a room at the Le Meridien in Stuttgart for a very good price on lastminute.com. The hotel is very impressive. Rooms are large, bathrooms have a shower/bath/jacuzzi (admittedly our jacuzzi didn't work but I didn't complain). It is on a main road but is just a walk across a park to the main town centre and the windows are good at blocking out any road noise. Beds were huge and comfortable. The bar served a great goulash as well! Would definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 19, 2011Dear "dom_b84",  Thank you very much for visiting the Le Meridien Stuttgart and spending you valuable time on sharing your experiences on TripadVisor.
