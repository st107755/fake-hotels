Stayed here 2 days. Very nice and clean room, big bathroom too. Has an iron in the room too! The swimming pool and Jacuzzi are really nice and there is plenty of space to relax after a swim. Lunch/Dinner is of a high standard and can be ordered in the room or in the restaurant area. The breakfast is outstanding. The choice is just great. One of the best! Service is 10/10 from everyone. I will definitely return again!Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 16, 2017Dear RG7_London,  wow, thank you you so much for this Review.
