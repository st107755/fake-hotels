This is truly one of the best hotels in Stuttgart, rooms were large and clean, lobby and bar area nice and relaxing. Its a great hotel also if you want to visit the city centre of stuttgart, its just 10 min walking from central station and koenigstrasse shopping street! And for those who cant bother to walk there is an U-bahn station just next to the hotel (Staatsgallerie)! I reccomend this hotel especially if you can get really good deals!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 16, 2013Dear “Marios8130“  Thank you for taking the time to share your comments on Tripadvisor.com.
