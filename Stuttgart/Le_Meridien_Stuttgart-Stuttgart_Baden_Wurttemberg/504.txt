Close to the city center. Boring lobby. Hotel is worn down a bit. Expensive internet access. Not even a complementary cup of coffee. Overall, I did not feel pampered or anything. I would only choose this hotel again if I get an interesting price.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 9, 2013Dear Mr. “Shendric“  Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We regret to learn that your experience with us did not meet your expectations.   As we know it is very pleasant to start the day with a nice cup of coffee we do provide two vouchers for a free cup of Illy coffee at you bar Lillet in all our guest rooms. Please do not hesitate to contact any of our associates next time if you cannot find the vouchers in our discovery envelope on your bed.   Dear Mr. “Shendric“, we are most unpleased that our staff was not able to provide the exceptional level of service that our guests have come to expect from the Le Meridien brand.  We would be happy to welcome you back soon to prove that we are excellent hosts.  Best regards,  Sabrina Hubert Guest Relation ManagerRead more
