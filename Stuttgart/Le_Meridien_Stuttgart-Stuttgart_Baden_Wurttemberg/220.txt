The Meridian is a really good hotel located in the heart of Stuttgart. The service, the staff, the amenities (especially the gym) are excellent! I've stayed here a few times and I do like the overall quality of the hotel. The breakfast spread and the room service menu are great..The location is not super walker friendly and I think this has more to do with Stuttgart than anything else. It's definitely not as much fun as many of the other cities in Germany.  Overall, the Meridian is a excellent choice of hotel especially for business trips and I'd recommend it to anyone who has to go to Stuttgart on work. If you're looking for a romantic getaway then head over to Tubingen or nearby and do a boutique place instead just for a more local flavor..Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
