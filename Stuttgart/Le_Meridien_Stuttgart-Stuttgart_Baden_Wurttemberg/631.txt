I stayed at Le Meridien Stuttgart for the second time in March and I was not disappointed.  The whole staff treats you like family and make you feel as if you are coming home.  The Front Desk staff is very well trained, knowledgeable and courteous.  Leonie (front desk) was very helpful and friendly.  The concierge staff (Marco and Marcus, head concierge) gave great tips for new things for me to see and do in Stuttgart.  And the spa is heaven!  Prio really pampered me!  Thank you all for a wonderful holiday.  I look forward to visiting Germany again and of course staying at Le Meridien!Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relation at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 21, 2011Google TranslationDear AuntieVern,  Thank you so much for your outstanding rating at Tripadvisor.
