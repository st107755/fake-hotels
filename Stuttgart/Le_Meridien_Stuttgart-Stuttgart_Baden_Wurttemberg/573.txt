We are very pleased to see that you shared your impressions about our hotel on TripAdvisor.  We are glad to inform you that there is also the possibility to book our deluxe rooms. These rooms are facing the backside of the hotel. As you might now there will be a new train station (“Stuttgart 21”) in the next years. Therefore they are rebuilding the city park of Stuttgart.  Unfortunately you were not satisfied with our themed buffets and the food at our “Bar Lillet”. We are very sorry that we were not able to suite your taste.  Dear “oban-boy”, we are very happy that you were satisfied with our staff and like to thank you for your nice words. Therefore it would be a great pleasure for us if we could be your host once again.  Best regards,  Selim Mokni Guest Relation ManagerRead more
