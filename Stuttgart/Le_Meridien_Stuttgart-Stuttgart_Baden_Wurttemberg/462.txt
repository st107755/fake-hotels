I can agree with previous reviews that the hotel is good but not 5 star. The room was a little tired especially the bathroom with the bath looking worn.  The room was a good size with simple decor. There is a large tv but picture quality was not good.  The staff were excellent very friendly and helpful. The spa area was very good with a lovely pool. The hotel is well located close to the city centre and underground station.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 13, 2013Dear “Dalzellst“  Thank you for sharing your feedback on Tripadvisor with other travellers.
