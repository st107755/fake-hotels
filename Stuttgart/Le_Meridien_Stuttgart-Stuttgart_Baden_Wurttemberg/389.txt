I stayed here last year and the room was excellent. Just check in today for a 4 days stay and the room is nothing compared to what I experienced last year although it is the same category.  I requested twin bed and got a king bed and had to switch rooms.  I asked for baby crib and it wasn't prepared.  I tried calling the reception from the room and the phone wasn't working.  Also this time I am coming by car and the parking entrance is too narrow and steep.
