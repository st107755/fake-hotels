Unfortantely the bar is not flexibel to receive any orders after midnight. Even orders to the room cant be received at the bar. Manager Mr. Wahlen explained us it is not possible. As a frequent traveler in 5* and (4*) hotels I can't believe.. A delivery to the room is possible but not to the bar (even the kitchen is still open).  I am ised to different service and offering at Meridian.

Our bar welcomes guests to dine between 11am and midnight and for drinks until 1am. After midnight we do offer a small menu for our hotel guests which is exclusively available through our in room service. This has several reasons and so far nobody had to go to bed hungry as we do have options available.  We try to meet all our requests and are flexibel, but on some circumstances we are not able to fulfill the guests request but are happy to offer alternatives.    Kind regards,  Stefan Hummel Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart  Read more
