The hotel is very nice inside; the outside is plain and on a busy road that is full of construction. We walked over from the main Stuttgart train station and while not far in distance, to cross the main road, you go up a large flight of stairs; if you don't have much luggage, no problem! If you do, just be prepared. Everyone at the hotel was nice and I wish I had thought to book a spa appointment ahead of time as there were no openings when I arrived. It's in a great location, by the park, about a 10 minute walk to the city center and tons of shops and restaurants. About a 35 Euro cab ride to the airport (approx. 30 minutes).

The Hotel Building was planned and constructed end of 80's, but as you mentioned, the inside and the staff is more important, and i'm more than happy, that we convinced you with the staff and our Service. The location is great, as it's easy to reach by car and train and also the inner city is only a 10 min walk. Our Spa is, especially on weekends, very busy, and appointments are difficult to get.  Try to book it 2-3 days in advance. If you arrive by train and do have lots of luggage with you we recommend to take a cab (5 -7â‚¬) or use the metrostation Staatsgalerie or Neckartor to get to the hotel.  I'm happy that you enjoyed your time with us and I am looking forward to welcome you again in Stuttgart.  Best Regards  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
