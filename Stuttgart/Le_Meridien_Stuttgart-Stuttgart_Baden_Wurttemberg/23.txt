I stayed at this hotel for two nights recently and was very impressed.  The check-in experience was excellent.  I was made to feel really welcome, which I truly appreciate.  I also got a quiet corner room on a high floor as requested, which enhanced the quality of my stay.  Among the two minor issues I had during my stay, the breakfast order was messed up a little (although fixed soon after reporting) and during checkout, the computer system did not work.  I did get the receipt emailed to me promptly after my stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
