Our room was on the 4th floor and very modern and clean.the quality of the bed ,linen and pillows were fantastic.our view was overlooking one of the largest building projects in Europe.the spa area is amazing,but if you would like any treatments plan ahead ! We had dinner in the restaurant which was very enjoyable ,well presented and very tasty.good selection of wines. Breakfast the next day was excellent.a very large selection of different breakfast items. We could not fault this hotel and would recommend it for anyone planning a trip to Stuttgart.the airport is under 30 minutes away.a easy walk into town.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 5, 2016Dear marialD5651VG,  thank you for your time, writing a comment on Tripadvisor.
