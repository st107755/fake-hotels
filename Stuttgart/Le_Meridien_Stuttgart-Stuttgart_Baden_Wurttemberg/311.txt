Hotel located within 10 minutes walk to the city center. Room was great and the hotel offered a free access to the spa (sauna,steam room, jacuzzi and indoor pool) it was overall a great experience. Don't get breakfast unless it is already included in the room price. Breakfast was 25 euros per person which was way too much for what I got!Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 26, 2016Dear Youssef M,  thank you very much for your positive review on Tripadvisor.  We are happy that you had a great experience with us. The use of our Spa area free of charge is for all of our guests . In case you would like to book a treatment, like a massage for example there would be an additional cost. The breakfast offers a wide selection of different dishes. We even do have a chef who prepares scrambled and fried eggs four you. It is really unfortunate that you were not satisfied with the buffet. If you have any suggestions please do not hesitate to tell us.  We are looking forward to your next stay with us.  Warm regards from Stuttgart,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
