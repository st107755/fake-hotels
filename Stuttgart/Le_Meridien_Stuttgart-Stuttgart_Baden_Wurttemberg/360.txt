located right near the train station- a little construction never hurt a location. the staff was outstanding. the room clean, airy, quiet and comfortable. after the renovations it will be even better! it will then come complete with a coffee maker. breakfast very good, nice selections and pleasant staff. only complaint, the bbq beer bar rester ant on the second floor outside, the worst service almost ever and the food very fair to poor. eat not he first floor and you'll hit a complete home run with a wonderful hotel!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 28, 2015Hi happystinker,  Thank you very much for choosing Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart  What a great review.
