Le Meridien is in a convenient central location and delivers superior service in all areas. From the check-in process with Nadine to the always helpful Concierges to the Restaurant and Bar staff (especially Julian); everyone was so attentive and took genuine interest to ensure my needs were met and expectations exceeded. Excellent menu variety and cuisine served impeccably in La Cassoulet. A great hotel experience in all aspects! The only thing that could have possibly made this stay better would have been the use of the beautiful black Mercedes SEL 350 parked out front! Sounds ridiculous I know, but it would have been the only detail that would have improved my overall experience at Le Meridien!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 5, 2013Dear “rodeweary“,  We truly appreciate your outstanding review and thank you for highlighting the many wonderful qualities of our hotel.   We are especially pleased that we ensured our needs were met and that we exceeded our expectation. From that moment you enter the hotel we strive to create a comforting and welcoming environment for all our guests. It is experiences likes yours we strive to deliver to each guest and we are glad Nadine, the Concierge and Julian succeed in creating a great experience.   Dear “rodeweary“, we looking forward to welcome you back soon and possibly we will have the beautiful black Mercedes again parked out front, unfortunately it was not owned by the hotel, so you could not benefit from a test drive through our beautiful country-side.   All the best,  Sabrina Hubert Guest Relation ManagerRead more
