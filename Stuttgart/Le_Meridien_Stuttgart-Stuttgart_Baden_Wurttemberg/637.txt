After reading mixed reviews we weren't sure what we were going to end up with, However we were both pleasantly surprised upon arrival.   The hotel was only a 5 min walk through the park to the city centre and easily accessible from the subway.  The hotel staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough to help. We went for the superior room and even though we are a fussy young couple we were actually well catered for.  To be honest the only thing that lets this hotel down is the ott breakfast pricing, I mean 50€ for a breakfast buffet??? Don't get me wrong, it was a posh buffet but not worth anymore than 15 € pp.   Overall i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, just make sure you do your research and find a cheaper breakfast alternative.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 3, 2011Dear Boywonder271983:  First of all we would like to thank you for your recent stay with us.
