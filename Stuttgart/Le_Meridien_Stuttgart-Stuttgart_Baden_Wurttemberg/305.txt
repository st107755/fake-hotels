The hotel has a great location to visit the centre of the city. A short walk across the park takes you in to the historic area. The hotel staff were very helpful with travel / information and the room I had was excellent. Lots of space to relax and work with a desk / wifi etc.. Breakfast had an excellent selection of food. It's also a short walk to the train station that takes you to most places and route back to the airport. The only disappointment at the time of my visit there was a lot of construction going on across the road from the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 8, 2016Dear Mike70382,  thank you for this great review, especially the comment on our staff.  We try our best to provide as much information on Stuttgart and the surrounding possible. Our Concierge team is delighted to plan your trip with you in advance and also while staying with us. Unfortunately we do have a lot of construction work going on in the park across the street. Gladly, as soon as you enter the hotel you cannot hear anything at all.  We hope to welcome you back soon here in Stuttgart.  All the best,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
