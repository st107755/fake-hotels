For a hotel of this standard, there are some very good deals to be had online. This may be reflective of the huge amount of construction work that is taking place directly outside the hotel; on the highway and also opposite in the Schlossgarten, which was the only downside to our stay.   The hotel room was large, quiet and clean. The spa area and gym was luxurious and not at all busy. All the staff we met were helpful and friendly.   Just watch the parking charge for the hotel car park as it is overpriced for hotel guests: it worked out another 25% of our room cost to park the car for one night!

Unfortunately due to the construction work, the view at the moment is not the nicest. However the windows are soundproof and you do not hear anyting from outside. We are glad to read that you were satisfied with your given rooms and also with our SPA area. The cost for parking is 22 EUR per night. On the day of departure you can leave your car in the car park and there will be no additional charges. We also offer valet Service which is included in the overnight costs. As it is also a public garage we cannot do much about the prices.  We hope you had a safe journey back home and you will visit us again.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
