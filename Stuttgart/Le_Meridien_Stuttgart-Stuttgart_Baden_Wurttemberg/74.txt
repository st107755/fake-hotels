Overall a very nice hotel but awful internet üòñ!!! When we complained they told us to log back again and then gave us a code that did not work ... and that a technician was coming the following day.. same story was told the following day... Such a basic service now a days !!! We also mentioned when we did our check out and they didn‚Äôt attempt to say anything üòè Parking is 24 ‚Ç¨ (inside the hotel) and breakfast is around 25 ‚Ç¨ ... you can get a great breakfast nearby for a third of that ... if you just want a coffee in the morning they don‚Äôt sell it either. There is kettle in the room for coffee.
