We just spent a weekend at the Meridien and liked the hotel. The room was of decent size, newly renovated and the bed was super comfy. Staff was generally very friendly, except for our effort to get lunch at the bar - one lonely lady was trying to serve a filled bar, seemed to provide room service and was simply overwhelmed. We left after being ignored for ten minutes.  At the current time it is very difficult to get to the hotel from central station due to the construction of the new station (out of the hotels hands of course) and using taxis seems to be the best way around.  The pool and spa are beautiful, though packed on the weekend and the gym is well equipped.  I would be back when in Stuttgart again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear SFLeonce,  thank you for your recent stay with us! I am glad that you enjoyed most of your stay, but of course see the possible improvement after your experience in our lobby bar.  We will discuss this internally and follow up on the situation. Most certainly it does not reflect our high standards to have you waiting for such a long time, please accept my apologies! And yes, Taxis are an easy way to navigate within the city, but so is the underground. We are in the middle of two stops which are a 3 minute walk from the hotel. You can either exit at the "Staatsgalerie" or "Neckartor" stop. Walking to the main station is easy with no luggage, however we recommend a taxi if you have luggage on you, since you will be facing steps.  With best regards, and until your next stay!
