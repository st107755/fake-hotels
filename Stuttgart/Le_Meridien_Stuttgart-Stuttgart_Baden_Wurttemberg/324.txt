I am Happy to read that you liked our facility and staff at the Hotel. Next time you are staying with us take the train from the airport. There is a S-Bahn running which takes approximately 35 minutes to the Central Station. I will forward all the compliments on the bar and the cocktails to my colleague. The Bar also has a food menue wit snacks like Salads, Pizza,..Try it when you will be back! :-)  I am looking forward to your next visit.
