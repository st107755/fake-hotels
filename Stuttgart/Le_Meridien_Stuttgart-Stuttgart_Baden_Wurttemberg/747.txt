I went here with my boyfriend and it was fantastic!  The rooms were beautiful and quiet (even though on a busy main road) and there are several U and S-Bahn stations within 5 minutes walk, which will take you right into the centre of Stuttgart.  The swimming pool and spa were difficult to find, but gorgeous once you got there.  The breakfast was delicious (especially the pastries) and the coffee was the best I've ever tasted!  I would recommend this to anyone. Read moreDate of stay: August 2005HelpfulShare
