Le Meridien in Stuttgart  is mroe a conference hotel, it has that large sterile feel about it. having said that the rooms are good, well equipped, the staff a re very good, helpful and friendly.  it is opposite the park, which is pretty but currentlt ( December 2011) has a large proest camp there against enlarging the train station. As you walk through the park for a few minutes to get to the town centre, it is soemhting to be aware of. I walked through with my wife several times and although there a lot of them it is not at all threatening, although it may feel different after dark.  So the location is good in summer I imagine it must be very pretty opposite the park with its trees and lake.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 12, 2011Dear "186338Gary",   we like to take the opportunity to thank you very much for taking the time sharing your experiences with others on TripadVisor.
