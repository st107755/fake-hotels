Le Meridien is a good hotel, not far from town center of Stuttgart ; the employees are nice and willing to help in case you need, the rooms are big and the cleaning is quite good (the only thing that i can comment is the room design witch makes the room to dark, the color of the walls is grey , my personal issue with grey rooms :-) ) As overall comment good hotel, great breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear “Paula P“  Thank you for sharing your experience from your recent stay with us at Le Meridien Stuttgart on Tripadvisor.
