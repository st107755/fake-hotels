When you arrive in front of Le Meridian, you are greeted by a massive construction site for the new train station.  Do not let that bother you.  Inside, the hotel staff is welcoming, professional and very knowledgeable about the city.  The hotel room was quiet, large and very nice.  The staff, especially the concierge, whose name I do not recall, could not have been nicer.  They had all of the efficiency of a deluxe grand hotel and all of the warmth of the proprietors of a bed and breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 18, 2018Dear rosienyc2016,  thank you very much for your wonderful review about your stay with our Le Méridien! It was a pleasure reading your comments, especially about our staff of which we are very proud of! Rest assured that I will pass on your comments to them. You are right, the first Impression can not be the best, since Stuttgart is receiving a new main station. But we try to keep the construction outside of the Hotel, is it through the soundproof windows or the beautiful flower bouquets in the lobby.  We hope to see you soon again so you can witness yourself the progress of the construction, it is really fascinating how it changes within months or even weeks.  With best regards,  Stefan Hummel Le Méridien Stuttgart Read more
