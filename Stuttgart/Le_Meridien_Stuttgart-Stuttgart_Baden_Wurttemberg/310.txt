The location was actually very convenient, very close to the main train station except due to the construction at the main train station, we had to climb up so many stairs with our big and heavy suitcases. When we checked out we decided to catch a taxi instead.  The room itself was clean but needed to update soon. We really enjoyed the spa and sauna. Our daughter got a small welcome lego gift from the hotel. We also ordered pizza and soup from the room service and they were delicious. The breakfast was also great and lots of option.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Feb 3, 2016Dear Fransisca1977,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us and also for your time writing a review on Tripadvisor.  The way from the central station to the Hotel is, because of the construction work at the "Schlossgarten", not the easiest at the moment. However there is another option without taking so many stairs. Our concierge team would be delighted to assist you next time you are coming to Stuttgart. In summer 2015 we started to renovate our "Executive" rooms on the fourth floor. This year we will continue with the second and third floor. Your compliment on the room service I will share with my colleagues from the kitchen department.  We hope you had a safe journey back home and we can welcome you back in Stuttgart soon.  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
