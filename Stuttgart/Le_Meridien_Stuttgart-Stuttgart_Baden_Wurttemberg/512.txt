As I mentioned in my e-mail before we are very sorry to read that we could not meet your satisfaction during your residence at our hotel. Feedback of our guests is very important for us. Just with your help we are able to continuously improve us. The idea of my mail was to get more details about the things you were not satisfied with so I am able to forward your notes to all departments and avoid similar experiences in the future. In no way I did want you to have the feeling of an aggressive e-mail and I really hope that you accept my apologies.  Dear „Well_travelled_Dad“, you have my details so please do not hesitate to contact me if I can do something for you. We are all looking forward to welcome you back as soon as possible.  Best regards,  Selim Mokni Assistant Front Office ManagerRead more
