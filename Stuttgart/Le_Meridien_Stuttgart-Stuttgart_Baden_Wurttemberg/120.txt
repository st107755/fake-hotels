The plate inside the elevator indicates 1987 as construction year. A great part of the hotel dates back to the late 80s. The conference room level on -1 seems pretty original. In other words: the hotel is dated.  My room was renovated, the windows were ok as well. Do ask for a renovated room. My room faced the Stuttgart21 construction site which was noisy during day time. Also, lots of traffic, too. The receptionists were effective and polite.   The hotel is 15min walking from main station, yet a lot of stairs.

Unfortunately your stay was not the way were you expected which we really regret.     However, our house also stands for classic chic and we have some guests who prefer this style. But last year we have already renovated most of the rooms which are followed by the function rooms as well as the lobby.
