The rooms were very large by European standards.  They are quiet, comfortable and clean.  Shower was powerful, generous bath amenities.  The staff were very helpful and professional.  Very easy walk over the bridge over the busy street to the park across the street.  Biergarten in the park, very convenient to the hotel.  Main train station just a little further of a walk through the park. Would have been a perfect 5 except that the rugs in the room were a bit worn, there was no coffee/tea in the room, and the underground parking was tight and overpriced.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 23, 2015Dear M B,  thank you for sharing your review on TripAdvisor. We are glad, that you enjoyed your stay with us. Right now, we renew our 4th floor, and by mid-september we'll have 60 new rooms and suites availabe. Maybe at your next stay with us, you can enjoy one of them. The daily rate of our car park is fair compared to the average rates in Stuttgart. Some car parks in stuttgart have daily rates of 25 -30â‚¬, so we think, 22 euros is reasonably priced.  Nevertehless, i want to thank again for this great review and hope to welcome you back in stuttgart.  Best Regards  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
