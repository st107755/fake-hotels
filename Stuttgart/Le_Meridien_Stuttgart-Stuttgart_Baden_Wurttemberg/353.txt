+ Quiet and clean + Jacuzzi * Not really central, but very close the the train station * 25 Euros for a breakfast... so we didn't try it * The staff might be a bit distracted (we had no towels in the room, they wanted to charge us for something from the minibar although we didn't touch it) - As usual with hotels, rock-hard mattressRead moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 31, 2015Dear Romain N, thank you very much for your positive review. I am glad you liked our Jacuzzi in the Spa Area and also your quiet room. Our Breakfast has a great choice of hot and cold dishes. There is also a chef who makes fresh scrambled eggs, omelets and fried eggs the way you want him to. It is really worth the price. Maybe you will try it the next time.  I would like to apologize for the wrong minibar item on your bill and also for the lack of towels in your room. I will check this situation with my colleagues as this should not happen.  I hope to welcome you back soon,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
