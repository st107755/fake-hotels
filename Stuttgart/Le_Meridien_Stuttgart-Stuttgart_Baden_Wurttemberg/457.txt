We stayed here for three nights during the Christmas market season.  I have stayed here several times over the past 15 years, but this is my first stay under the "le meridien" management.  The hotel is fabulous - service, cleanliness, moderness, real King size beds.  It is a short walk to the Koenigstrasse for shopping.  The train station is a little far to walk with lots of luggage, but not too bad if you have packed light.  Pick a room faing the courtyard so you can avoid the police sirens from the b14.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 29, 2013Dear “LizardHntr“  Thank you very much for sharing your positive impressions about your recent stay at the Le Méridien Stuttgart.
