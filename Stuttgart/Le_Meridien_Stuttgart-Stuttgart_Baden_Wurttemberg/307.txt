This is a good business hotel. Clean. Very friendly staff. Nice Wellness area. The pool was a bit chilly for my taste and the jacuzi not working, but the sauna area with different  saunas and steam room was well designed. Workout is open 24 hours. Did not try the restaurant or breakfast. I found the price of 26 Euro for breakfast too high. They did give a voucher for a coffee at the bar which I did instead and was pleased with that. They also gave a voucher for the adjacent Staats gallery which I visited and enjoyed. I had asked for separate beds but we got a kingsize....not a big deal, but still not what I had asked for travelling with my brother. The room was an upgrade and nice. Modern and functional. Great bed sheets.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 4, 2016Dear claudia r,  thank you very much for your time, writing a comment on Tripadvisor.  We are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. I am sorry for the inconveniences the broken jacuzi may have caused. If you would like to have breakfast in the morning and it is not already included in your rate you have two options. You can choose a continental breakfast without any hot dishes for 14 EUR or the whole buffet for 26 EUR. The buffet is really worth the price. We do have a chef who is making the egg dishes the way you like it and we also do have a wide selection of almost everything. Every Le Meridien hotel has an "unlock Art" partner. Our partner is the Staatsgalerie and we offer complimentary entry tickets for all of our guests. I would like to apologize that we assigned the wrong bed type. Please do not hesitate the next time to contact the Front Desk directly and they will offer the right room for you.  We hope we do have the chance to welcome you back whenever your plans will lead you to Stuttgart again.  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
