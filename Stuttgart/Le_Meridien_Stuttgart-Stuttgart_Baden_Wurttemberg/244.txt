We are more than happy to read your compliments on our Hotel and the staff. Unfortunately we do have the construction site on the other side of the street but also our Windows facing the street are soundproof and you do not hear anything. Thank you for your wonderful words about the staff. We love what we do and it is great that you felt it during your stay.  We hope you are already planning your next trip to Stuttgart! :-)  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
