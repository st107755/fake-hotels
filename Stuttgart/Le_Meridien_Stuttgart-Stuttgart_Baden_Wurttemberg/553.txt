This a very nice hotel that is located just a short walk away from the main shopping area in Stuttgart. The checkin was really friendly and our daughter was so happy to get a Mercedes Memory game (and daddy was to hehe). The room was nice and comfy and we really liked the beds.  Do not expect any nice views from the hotel as the location is by a very busy street, but the window isolation is very good and it does not disturb you in any way.  Breakfast was a highlight as they served ILLY CAFFE. Finally proper coffee at the hotel. You can even make yourself a takeaway!  Sadly Internet is an extra (again...what is with those hotels!?) even though you do pay hefty price for room. Walkin rate is 310EUR, but we paid much less for booking over travel agent.  Parking was just horror.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
