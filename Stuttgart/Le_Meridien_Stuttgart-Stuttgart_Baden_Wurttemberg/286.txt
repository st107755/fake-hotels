End of business trip, flight out of Stuttgart was not until Saturday afternoon. Got favourable rate, and got 4 PM checkout without paying anything extra! Huge plus! Very good breakfast buffet, with very friendly servers. Had nice, quiet room facing the courtyard. In general, would say that all staff I ran into, bar, breakfast, concierge, check in/out, all were very friendly and attentive. Will definitively look for room here on my next stay in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 23, 2016Dear Thomas J,  thank you very much for your great review.  We are very happy that we created a pleasant stay for you and that you were more than satisfied with the Service attitude of our staff. A smile does not cost much, but can create a huge difference! Having a late check-out is always a great plus if your flight is leaving late from the airport.  Our breakfast buffet is really a great choice and very popular among our guest. The best way to start the day.  Looking forward to welcome you again in Stuttgart.  Best Regards  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
