Utterly disappointed with this hotel. I stayed here for a night during a business trip and paid a huge amount of tariff to stay in a place which is more like a 2 start hotel. They charge for breakfast, wifi, and everything you would expect to be the basics which comes complimentary with room tariff. They don't even have a coffee maker in the room. The rooms are of average quality and the lobby disappointing. I would suggest consider this hotel only if you have no other choice in the city.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 25, 2014Dear PuttarajAG,   thank you for your recent stay at Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart!  I regret that we have not been able to meet your expectations, as it's our goal to create enjoyable and memorable stays for our guests.  We do offer several rate planes in order to meet the guests need, some only include the room rate, others do include breakfast, internet, dinner and parking.  We do think, that the price for breakfast or parking is in an acceptable and comparable range compared to other hotels in Stuttgart   We all are looking forward welcoming you again!
