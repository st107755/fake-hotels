I already stayed several times at the Le Meridien Stuttgart. It is the best hotel in town, the entire staff is very friendly and always helpful. I love the big breakfast with so many dishes, especially the typical swabian "Seele". We really love it. The rooms are a little bit dark but the bed.... it is a dreaming area, not only a bed. Relaxing in the SPA, the Whirlpool etc I can highly recommend. The concierge and reception staff is really friendly and informed us very well. I will come back as soon as I will visit Stuttgart again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
