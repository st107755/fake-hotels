The hotel is 8 minutes from the Stuttgart central train station and 20 minutes from the airport by cab 35 minutes by train direct.  The hotel services, bar and breakfast were as good as one can expect.  Newly renovated hotel rooms  were spacious and well appointed.  Pool open 24 hours and SPA was wonderful.  Would stay here again when in the area.  Only drawback for walkers is the local area construction has closed a lot of sidewalks.  no idea how long till its finished.

But we try very hard to keep all that outside from once you enter the hotel lobby. Thank you for your detailed review about the hotel, we just want to clarify that the gym is open 24hours, the pool is available from 7am to 11pm on most days.  Hope to see you soon again and best regards from Stuttgart!  Stefan Hummel Le MÃ©ridien StuttgartRead more
