Stayed over 3 nights over the New Years holiday at the property.  Wow!  Had a wonderful room on the top floor with a view of the city.  The NYE atmosphere and location was awesome! Its a 8 euro taxi ride into the downtown area.   In addition, the spa is the creme de la creme.....romantic, very relaxing, not too crowded and very clean.  Already made reservations to stay again in Feb.  Treat yourself to the finer things in life....spend a couple of nights at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 12, 2014Dear “Bimmerman328i“  Thank you for sharing your feedback on Tripadvisor.
