Stuttgart isn't the most beautiful of all cities. But The Meridien sure is a good hotel. Friendly reception by staff. The room is comfortable and beautifully furnished. Nice colours, wood etc. The hotel offers free vouchers for coffee: a drank a very tasteful cappuccino twice. Also nice is he free entrance to the Stuttgart museum. Worth a visit.
