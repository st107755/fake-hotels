The Meridien in Stuttgart would have a perfect location across from the Schloss Garten and the railway station if it was not for the usual politicians who always spoil most things and love to destroy nice environments. For a long time now protestyers have been camping in the garden tostop the politicians from tearing everything down. The hotelitself have excellent rooms and the service is impeccable. The food in the restaurant is not big portions but enough and made with love. You can eat there anytime and enjoy it. The breakfast can satisfy most palates and the inddor pool and spa is excellent. The only drawback is the garage that if you have a big car it is precision driving to be able to get in. Apart from that it is a hotel that I would recommend anytime.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 26, 2011Dear "Tom D",  we are very pleased that you chose the Le Meridien Stuttgart for your stay at Germany.  It is not necessary to walk through the Schlossgarten if you would like to reach the city center. You can just walk along the street and you will reach the heart of Stuttgart in the same time.  Of course we can also park your car so that you do not have to drive by yourself.  We would like to thank you again for your positive feedback and looking forward to see you soon.  Best regards,  Selim Mokni Guest RelationsRead more
