Stayed here for two nights on a journey in mainland Europe.  Staff were very friendly on reception and service areas, they could not do enough for you.

The only reason that I have not given top marks is that my wife and daughter wanted some treatments in the spa, only manicure but was told that they were fully booked for the next 4 days?
