We enjoyed a one night stay at this hotel and found it very pleasant and convenient to the city centre and station.  Our only complaint would be the construction work outside which is not a pretty sight and extensive. No noise over the weekend however during the week it is likely to be a frustration.  The service was excellent and so was the breakfast. I would return again once the construction work is complete which we believe is 5 years away!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 5, 2017Dear Ian S,  thank you very much for your review! I am glad to read that you enjoyed the level of service as well as the breakfast! And yes, the construction might not cause a good view, unless you are an architect or fascinated with vehicles. But don't worry, all of the windows of the rooms are super soundproof and will catch most of the noise which is coming from the construction site. Also, it will not take another 5 years. As a matter of fact, the one in front of the hotel will be gone pretty soon. After that, most of the work will happen in the park.  We would love to see you back with us, let us know whenever your travel plans are leading you back to Stuttgart!  Best regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division ManagerRead more
