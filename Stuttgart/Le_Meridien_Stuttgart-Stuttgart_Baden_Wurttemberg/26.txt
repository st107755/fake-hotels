Stayed here once and will not return. Why: check in unfriendly. Room average. Dinner experience really bad. Food served not at all good. Location not the best. Spa and fitness was better. But next time will try another Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 16, 2019Dear RJF210, thank you for staying with us and sharing your feedback .
