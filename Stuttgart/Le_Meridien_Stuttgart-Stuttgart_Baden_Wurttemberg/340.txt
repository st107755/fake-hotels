Can't find any negatives about this place.  The three of us, wife, daughter and myself stayed in a roome on the newly renovated 4th floor.  The room was a comfortable size, even with 3 of us and very nicely done with modern appointments.  Big bathroom with large shower and plenty hot water.  Didn't eat there so can't rate the food but the bar service was good.  The whole place seemed very clean.  They had a spacius and well equipped gym and a good sized pool and hot tub.  All the hotel staff seemed very friendly helpful and polite. Nightly drinks in the second floor wine bar was a pleasant experience as well.  Short walk to the town, park area and train station.  This would my first choice for a stay in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 13, 2015Dear Jeff R,  Thank you for sharing your impressions on Tripadvisor.
