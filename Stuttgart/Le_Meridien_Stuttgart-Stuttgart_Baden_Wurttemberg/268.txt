We knew from the map that the hotel was not far from the train station, about a 7-10 minute walk.  There is currently much construction going on in the area (new subway lines), so it was a bit confusing to find our way there and it was an unusually hot day.

Warm regards from Stuttgart,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation Manager Read more
