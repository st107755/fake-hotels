We stayed at this hotel just before Xmas.  We got on a train to another city and left our passports in the room safe at Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart.  When we contacted the staff at the hotel they could not have been more helpful. They completely understood our predicament and quickly couriered our passports to us.This enabled us to fly home in time for Christmas.  We cannot thank you enough.  Hotel was very nice and central to everything. Main station is 5-10 mins walk.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 31, 2017Dear "Roger_L_Ramjet",  thank you for your kind words, we are happy that you had a good time when visiting Stuttgart for the Christmas market.
