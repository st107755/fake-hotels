Le Meridian in Stuttgart works for a business trip. It is clean and reasonably well run, but the rooms are small, and the price is high for what you get. The food in the restaurant was OK, but after finishing my meal I waited 20 minutes for a check. I tried to order room service for breakfast at 5:30 am, but the offerings were quite sparse. I would return if I had to, but I would look for an alternative.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 20, 2014Dear "Silverandbluedog"  Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay with us!
