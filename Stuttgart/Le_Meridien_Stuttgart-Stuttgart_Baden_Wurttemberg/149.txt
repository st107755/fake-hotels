Location, staff, room, service excellent. One reason for choosing the hotel was the gym facilities, but disappointingly we were told that the gym had no A/C due to the Spa below??? Equipment is of good quality but being so warm (even during the cold weather) it made my run even harder! It may not be an important issue for most but I need to work out regularly and I expected the Gym (in a 5 star hotel) to be above the standard of less prominent chains. I wouldn't return due to this single issue.....Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 4, 2017Dear BugzyB1960,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us! I also would like to thank you for your positive words about our staff and service.  However I am quite surprised to read your comments about the air temperature in our gym. After talking to the gym staff I am glad to see that they were able to offer you a solution but I am happy to clarify that the gym is air-conditioned. It is actually one of the coolest places in our hotel and so far we have not received any negative feedback. It would be a pity if this causes you to chose a different hotel in the future-  we of course are happy to welcome you back!   With best regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division Manager Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart Read more
