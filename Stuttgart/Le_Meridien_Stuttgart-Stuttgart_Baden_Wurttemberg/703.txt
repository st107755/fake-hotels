I have travelled around the world and have seen all sorts of hotels. I stayed in "Le Meridien" for one night with my 9 year old son.  Le Meridien in Stuttgart is an excellent hotel: excellent service, good and clean rooms, good restaurant (buffet on Fridays) even for my son, very well located and good rates. High value for money.   Next time around, I will definitely stay there again!Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
