The hotel itself was very nice. I have stayed here multiple times and the rooms are updated and clean. Staff is very friendly.   However, to get into the center of Stuttgart you must walk across an overpass over the highway. On the other side of the overpass it is very dark and as a female alone at night this can be a bit scary and there can be people just hanging out up and it can feel unsafe. With that being said, it is a short walk to the city center which makes the hotel ideally located.   The breakfast buffet is expensive but delicious.   The spa itself was a bit lacking in amenities but I received a good massage.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 22, 2016Dear agmiller2001,  thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.  We are glad to read that you liked our staff.  Unfortunately we cannot do anything about the construction work across the street in the schlosspark. However I do understand that you don't feel that comfortable walking there alone in the dark. Our Concierge is happy to assist showing you an alternative way wherever you would like to go.  Hopefully you will visit us again.  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
