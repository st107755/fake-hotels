The rooms were nice.  The staff were all great and very helpful.  When we checked in, they reminded us of the dinner reservation they made for us before we arrived.    The breakfast is outstanding with a nice 'eye opener' when you walk in.  The location is close to the central station and an easy walk to town.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 16, 2015Dear Deac83,  what a pleasure to read your review!
