We booked a flight from Stuttgart giving us the chance to stay at the Meridien and again, best bet if you visit Stuttgart. It central, has a great spa and modern rooms. From the concierge at arrival to the receptionist, checking me out we felt pampered all the way and will return.  Have said that we stayed in various hotels in Stuttgart, as well the Schlossgarten, however none of them are able to beat what’s in Le Meridien on offer. If you need tickets or anything related to your stay, you have a highly motivated team at the front desk and the Guest Relation Manager Verena is pro-active and very hands-on making your stay just perfect.  We are happy taking a minute to review and recommend the hotel – our number 1 in Stuttgart!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 10, 2016Dear Philip F,  thank you so much for this amazing review!!
