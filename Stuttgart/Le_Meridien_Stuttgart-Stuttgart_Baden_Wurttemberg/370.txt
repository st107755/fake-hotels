I was very very pleased with our stay at the Le Meridien. Located about a 10min walk from the hbf and the city center, it was a great location! At first on the outside It doesn't look like anything special especially with some construction areas around the exteriors, but that changed as soon as you walk through the door. Its a very stylish and luxurious hotel especially the front lobby area! The staff was extremely helpful and provided us with maps and directions to some of their favorite sights and restaurants. The rooms were extremely nice and clean, while providing a fast wifi connection to boot! Overall the nicest package of service, cleanliness, and luxury you can find!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 19, 2015Dear "predcole",  thank you for your recent visit!
