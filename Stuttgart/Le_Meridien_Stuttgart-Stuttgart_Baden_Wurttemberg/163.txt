Greeted by professional and personable staff at the check-in. The room was as advertised, very clean and modern. Great bed. The fitness facilities were exceptional. One of the best equipped and spaced hotel gyms I have ever experienced. There is also hot tubs, sauna, steam and a pool. Great facility. The only negative is that there is a lot of construction in the area. I did not hear it nor did effect me other than an inconvenience for driving and walking. Great location, very central to transit, shopping and access to the highways.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 1, 2017Dear Frank_1268Z,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us and also time  to share your experience with others here on Tripadvisor!
