The location is great. Fairly close to the Central Railway Station, which is about 10 mins walk from the hotel, the hotel upgraded us to a level, very pleasant surprise. The hotel is old, but I like it. Very friendly and helpful staff. The facilities include gym, swimming pool, Jacuzzi, and sauna. I personally think this should be re-branded as a JW MarriottRead moreDate of stay: August 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 18, 2020Hello theguyfromthatonebar!
