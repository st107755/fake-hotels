This hotel meets all Le Meridian standard. Nice in room coffee as usual. Room is new and nice. The light is the mirror is shower room is super bright. I do like it. But the robe is dirty which surprises me. They should not place this kind of stained robe as shown in photo. That’s the reason I reduce half star ;) Fitness is open 24 hours. Big room, lots is equipment. The way to go to fitness is a bit confusing, but it’s located together with spa. The light in fitness is too dim. The music is super soft. I feel like in spa room rather then in fitness which,on the other way, you should feel enthusiastic not sleepy here.

We appreciate your feedback and also would have loved a clear 5 * rating, but I do understand the reason for the 4.5 stars and would like to apologize for the dirty robe. This should not have happened and I can assure you that this is not what you should experience whenever you are staying with us. Please accept my apologies!  Also I would like to thank you for the feedback about the music in the gym, we will look into this to see whether it can be changed. Have a good time and we would be very pleased to welcome you back to Le Méridien Stuttgart at one day. With best regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division Manager Le Méridien StuttgartRead more
