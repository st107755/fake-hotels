Big rooms perfectly cleaned, beautiful bathroom with big and functional shower. The bed is really comfortable, one of the best ever. Reception personnel are very kind and helpful.

Didn't try spa and gym.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 21, 2016Dear syzygy4547,  thank you very much for your review.
