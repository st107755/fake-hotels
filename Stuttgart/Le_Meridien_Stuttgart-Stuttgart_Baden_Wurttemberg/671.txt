Expensive and poorly located hotel, don't bother paying extra for the "park view"  you will be looking at it over a four lane motorway and no chance of opening the window.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 12, 2009Dear BournemouthBenge,  First of all, we would like to apologize that we could not meet your expectations. There are no extra fees if you book a room to the "park". Our so called "park view" is facing the "Schlosspark", literally translated "Castle park". Unfortunately, between our hotel and the park there is a street which can be easily crossed by a little bridge; however the quality of our sound-proofed windows is the best.   If you have a room facing the quiet courtyard you can leave the windows opened. This category has a different price; that is correct.  It takes 8 minutes to get to the center of Stuttgart on foot, 10 minutes to Daimler Musuem by car and 20 minutes to Porsche Museum by train.    BournemouthBenge, we think there was a misunderstanding and we are very sorry about this inconvenience you have experienced. We hope this will not prevent you from staying at Le Meridien again.   Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.  Kind regards  Guest RelationsRead more
