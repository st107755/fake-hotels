I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this delightful hotel. The front desk staff were very helpful indeed assisting all of my needs whilst staying in Stuttgart. My only gripe... is that that the bed could be a little longer, being 6ft I didn't expect my feet to hang out the end & the pillows also offered little support. Otherwise, all in all a very pleasant experience & should I return to Stuttgart I will defiantly consider staying here again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 14, 2014Dear “Thetobester“  Thank you for sharing your impressions with other travelers here on Tripadvisor.  We were delighted to see that you enjoyed your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart. Thank you for your kind comments about our Associates! They are working hard to exceed our guests’ expectations and it is nice to see that their efforts are recognized in this forum. Our beds have a size of 1.80 x 2.00 meters. Being 6ft, the size of our beds should still give you some inches to get a good night sleep.  Dear “Thetobester“, it would be our pleasure to welcome you back to Le Meridien Stuttgart in the very near future!  Kind Regards,  Sabrina Hubert Guest Relation ManagerRead more
