My first stay in Le Meridien was a good one. Stayed ina number if hotels in Stuttgart with work and this is definitely the best I have stayed in. Rooms spacious, modern and clean. Beds comfortable, breakfast good. Staff helpful and friendly. Short walk from the train station, although a little difficult to find because of the construction. I followed the directions on the hotel website and managed to find it ok.  If the opportunity arises I will definitely stay here again.
