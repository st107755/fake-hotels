We stayed here only one night, it is a large hotel, it is a nice hotel but to me it seemed a little dark, I found the décor old, some rooms and part of the hotel were in the process of renovation. The hotel is on a busy street but it is convenient to walk downtown during the day taking the bridge just outside the hotel, you pass by a  park a few areas that may be too dark and lonely at night to walk.  At night you may want to walk to the main street and then cross the intersection to go downtown instead of taking the bridge.  Service was very good, my German is not very good, but they spoke English of course.  Our room was large, quiet and beds were very comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 23, 2013Dear “Cucuchi“  Thank you very much for choosing to stay at Le Méridien Stuttgart and for taking the time to post your review at TripAdvisor.
