When I booked this hotel I was not aware that the road it is situated on is a highway of sorts, too many lanes and far to much traffic to cross on foot at all. Of course there is  an elevated walkway directly to the hotel entrance, but again, we were faced with many, many stairs with all of our luggage. It is probably fine if you take a taxi from the station.  The hotel is very nice though, and we were quite happy once we settled in. The staff are friendly and very helpful. We didn't have any meals there. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the main shopping area where there are many restaurants and other food vendors. My husband had a delicious pancake bought from a vendor. I would stay there again if I didn't have much luggage to carry.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 12, 2013Dear "annikins",  Thank you very much for staying at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
