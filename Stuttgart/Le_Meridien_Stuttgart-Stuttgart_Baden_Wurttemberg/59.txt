Having tried many hotels in and around Stuttgart in the past 3 months, we finally decided on choosing Le Meridien hotel as our contract hotel as it has most of the qualities a business traveller would expect. Excellent check in service with polite and friendly staff and a very high level of English spoken. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Buffet breakfast is also excellent. Tip: the hotel has just completely renovated the Spa area and it is well.worth a visit. All in all highly recommended and one of the all round best hotels.in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 16, 2019Dear guest "davlew14",  On behalf of the entire hotel team, we want to thank you for sharing your most memorable experiences with us during your recent stay at Le Méridien Stuttgart.
