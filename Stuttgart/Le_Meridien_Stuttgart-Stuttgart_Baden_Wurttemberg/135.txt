Good rooms, good breakfast, good lunch. Excellent service. 2 people in our group had their luggage lost by the airline, the hotel was went above expectations to help them (helped them get to the stores to buy some new clothes, contacted the airline regularly for updates). They were still helping us when our trip took us out of Stuttgart to Bonn.  I had a small issue checking in. They checked me into my room, I went upstairs and the room was locked from the inside. They were puzzled and apologetic. Fixed the situation right away.  We made use of their business centre regularly.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 22, 2018Dear Melinda,  thank you for sharing your experience about your recent stay with others on Tripadvisor" I am glad to see that you have enjoyed your stay and that especially our concierge team was very helpful with the issues you had.
