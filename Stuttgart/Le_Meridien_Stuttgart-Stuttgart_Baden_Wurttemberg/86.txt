Really enjoyed the hotel - well located, a short walk from town, the train station and easy access to the subway.  Breakfast was one of the nicer buffets I saw on my trip.  Wifi worked great and despite the area being a giant contraction zone at the moment I didn't notice any noise.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from rWallenborn, Guest Relations Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 4, 2018Dear Guest "VanRain",  On behalf of the entire hotel team, we want to thank you for sharing your most memorable experiences with us during your recent stay at Le Méridien Stuttgart.
