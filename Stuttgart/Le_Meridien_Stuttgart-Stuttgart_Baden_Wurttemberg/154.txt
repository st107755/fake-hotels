The rooms we had were recently updated and had really nice ameneties. The staff was helpful at recommending local/non-touristy restaurants. The in-hotel restaurants were very pricey. The location was convenient but a bit annoying to get to due to being torn up for construction. I assume this will be better once that's resolved. Couldn't beat the price for the location and quality. The only issue we had was the AC was broken in one room and we had to relocate - minor hassle but not a huge issue.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 20, 2017Hello JesetJou,  thank you for your review here on Tripadvisor!
