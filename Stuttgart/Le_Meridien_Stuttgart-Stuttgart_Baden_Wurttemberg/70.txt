We absolutely loved everything at the hotel. Check in and check out went perfect and smoothly. The spa ( swimming pool, sauna and Hammam) and the fitness room are just perfect. The breakfast has absolutely everything you want and on top of that we have been upgraded to a bigger room so thanks again! There is parking for 24 â‚¬ a day and you have to walk 10 minutes to be at the heart of the walking street and at the city center. Nothing to complain about, we had a perfect stay!
