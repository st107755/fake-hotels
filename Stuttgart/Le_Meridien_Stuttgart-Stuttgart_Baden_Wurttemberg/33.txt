This hotel's problem is their office Manager  M. Jokusch  If you are willing to risk your reservation then it is more likely to happen in this hotel regardless if you have confirmation email from them or not. The office Manager is not even willing to look at the email in my mobile, because he already gave the rooms to others. We are family with children and travelling a long distance we arrived to this hotel to find out that our reservation is cancelled.!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 19, 2019Dear shakoveski Yes, we cancelled your reservation.  But why don't you tell the TripAdvisor community the reason for the cancellation? In a business, we have to make decisions and later, we have to deal with them. Your decision was to make a reservation and using a invalid creditcard for the guarantee. I decided to cancel it, as a invalid creditcard is no guarantee.  In the end, this was the issue. We contacted you, but get no reply.  So, please don't hide this facts to the TripAdvisor readers, as they are interested in reading truthfully and serious surveys.
