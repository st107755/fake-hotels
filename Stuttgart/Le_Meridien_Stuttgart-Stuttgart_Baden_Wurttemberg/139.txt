The hotel is what you expect from that level: nothing bad, mostly great and some little flaws, nothing great. That is a good place to stay if you come for work. The spa is wonderful, large, with a great pool and a good service. The massage was good and well priced. Food and beverage were flawless. The underground carpark is very convenient.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 4, 2018Dear Arbalcha,  thank you very much for your review here on Tripadvisor.
