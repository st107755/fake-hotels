Hotel was conveniently located. Bottled water provided  and was replaced daily. Minifridge had room for personal items. Font desk personnel very helpful, friendly and accomodating. As a platinum, did not feel room was upgraded, but not sure. Mattress was firm but sleep was good. Very Quiet.  A/c did not seem to work efficiently, room remained warm so we just opened the window and the outside air cooled the room. Breakfast buffet was provided as a benefit with many items provided, breakfast staff could be friendlier, lacked a welcoming attitude. Overall, a good restful stay when in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 23, 2015Dear alank1101,  thank you very much for your review on Tripadvisor and also for beeing a loyal member of our starwood preferred guest program.  While your stay we were refurbishing our 4th floor, where nine of our eleven Junior Suites are located. Due to this it was unfortunately not always possible to upgrade our Platinum guests. If your A/C did not work I would like to apologize for this inconvenience. I am also sorry that you did not feel a welcoming attitude when you went to breakfast. I will talk to my colleagues about this situation to improve the service in the morning.  Thank you again for your stay with us and I hope to welcome you back soon.  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
