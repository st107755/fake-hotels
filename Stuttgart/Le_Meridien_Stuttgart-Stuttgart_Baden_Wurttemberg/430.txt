We had a surprisingly great experience at this Le Meridian.   The interior design was basic though well done, room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.   Service was spectacular. The staffs had been very friendly, helpful, welcoming, personal and provided much more than expected.   We also tried the room service which was pretty good compared with all the other meals we've had.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 14, 2014Dear “Advisor987654321“  Thank you for your recent stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart and for writing so favorably about us.
