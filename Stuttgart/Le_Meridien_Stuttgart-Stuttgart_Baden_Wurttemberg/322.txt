We had 2 nights in this hotel. Surprisingly the location is bad although it is not that far,but we had to carry luggage and climbed up and down so many stairs and passed by a big park. It spoiled our honeymoon mood. In front of the hotel,there is a project under construction. It is dark and dangerous while we were walking back to our hotel and passed by the park at night.Anyway,the breakfast and service were good. But I think this hotel is more suitable for business travellers as they can access here by taxi or cars. For those who have no transport,there are many other choices over there.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear Naomi326,  it is really unfortunate that your stay with us was not the way you were expecting.  Since we have the construction in the “Schlossgarden” the way from the central station to our Hotel is a little bit more complicated. I can understand that with heavy luggage this is not comfortable. However there is also another option without taking the stairs. Please contact our Concierge next time in advance and he would be happy to assist you.  Dear Naomi326, the Team and I would be happy to welcome you back whenever your plans will lead you to Stuttgart again.  We wish you a wonderful Christmas time.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
