The hotel is very close to the main railway station and also to the city center, and some important attractions. All around are constructions, as the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (main railway station) will be reconstruted. But when you are inside the hotel, you are in a peaceful haven. Service is excellent, the rooms are spacious. Breakfast it something not expected delight.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 19, 2015Dear 545medva,  thank you for staying with us!
