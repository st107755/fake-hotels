We were greeted with smiles that were genuine. No phonies here. The room was comfortable, clean and quiet. The hotel is a short walk to the train station which is very convenient for travelers. It also close to a fun walking street Koningstrase with many restaurants and other shopping. Easy access to transportation to the Porsche and Mercedes museums. Don't miss Stuttgart and be sure to stay at the Le Meridien.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 16, 2019Dear esteemed Lar M,  thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
