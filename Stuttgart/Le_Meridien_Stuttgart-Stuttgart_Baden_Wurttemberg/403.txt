Excellent location with walkway distance to main train station. Very good breakfast and comfy room. Only improvement suggestions I can make are: free wifi also being available in the rooms and there is better shower equipment available in the market that matches this hotel's quality level. Anyway, it is a recommendation for sure.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear gumerzeci ,  Thank you very much for choosing Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart for your trip to Stuttgart.
