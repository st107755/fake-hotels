We were here for one day and arrived in the city via train. While it is possible to walk to the hotel from the train station, take a cab.  It's a bit of a hike and there is construction between the hauptbahnhof and the hotel. The rooms were nice sized and the morning breakfast was great. The staff was very helpful answering questions we had and assisting in getting us on the correct train to Esslingen. Unless you need to be in the heart of the city, the Le Meridien is a great hoice in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 22, 2014Dear AI O,  Thank you for your wonderful comments and for choosing Le Meridien Stuttgart for your stay.
