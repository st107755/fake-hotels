Let me start with the positives, this is a nice hotel, in a nice location for getting around town.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  The gym was adequately equipped.  The breakfast was full of fresh food, and had ample variety.  The downside for me was the lack of amenities for Marriott/SPG elite members.  There is no lounge, nor is there any offer to make up for the lack of a lounge( maybe an appetizer or drink or two at the bar?).  There was no offer of a welcome gift, but I digress, I am spoiled as an elite member. I would most likely stay here again.  The quality of the hotel speaks for itself, the restaurant associated with the hotel (located upstairs and outside) is excellent. I just didnâ€™t get spoiled.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 8, 2019Dear esteemed donaldg353,  thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
