Nice hotel for a business trip - clean, quiet and with nice gym and restaurant. Wish there were earlier breakfast options and a coffee pot in the room but everything else was good. Location is convenient to shopping, restaurants and local transportation.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 27, 2016Dear dmlindc,  thank you very much for your review.
