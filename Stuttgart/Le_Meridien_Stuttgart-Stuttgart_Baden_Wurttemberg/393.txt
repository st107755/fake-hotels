We loved to spa that included 3 saunas and other attractions. Gym is big with new machines. The bar had the biggest choice of alcohol drinks I ever saw in my life. Rooms are good size but have nothing special. No tee or coffee machine but we received free coffee vauchers as spg gold members. Staff was nice by German standards. Location is noisy on a highway. On the map it looks just on the main station but if you really need to go and catch a train it will take you more then 10 min. Would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 30, 2014Dear Ronishefner,  thank you for staying with us! It was a pleasure to read your positive comments about our SPA and fitness.  Yes, it's indeed a pleasant and relaxing area. Our hotel is located within a walkin distance of 10 min to the main station, and very easy to reach by car. If you would prefer to sleep with a open window, i would recommend our deluxe rooms, which  are facing a courtyard.  Whenever your travel plans lead you back to Stuttgart we would be delighted to welcome you back!  Kind regards,  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
