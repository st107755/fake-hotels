It is a weak hotel services for this level (5 stars) I have called from my room on Sunday morning around 11 am for questioning the desk about  "Brunch" offer. Yes, we have, it is from 11.30 to 2 pm. So, I chech out at 11.30 an,d I have asked to add two brunch menus on my bill. : "We are sorry it is fully booked today by a group"...Why they did not tell me when I have called the first time 30 minutes before. As hotel guest we had zero possibility to access fro teh brunch (breakfast time was closed at 10.30)... So weak for this level of hotel !Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 31, 2013Dear „olivier d“,  Thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.  We are very sorry to read that you were not that satisfied with our hotel. Unfortunately there had to be a misunderstanding as we had two places reserved for you at the brunch.  We are very sorry for the inconveniences.  Dear “oliver d”, it would be a great pleasure for us if we could welcome you back as soon as possible to demonstrate you  that the guest service is the big strength of Le Meridien Stuttgart.
