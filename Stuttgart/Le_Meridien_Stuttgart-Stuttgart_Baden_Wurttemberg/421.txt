Convenient location to the main train station with a walk through a park in order to get to the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and a good size. Wi-fi in the lobby and business centre is free, however wi -fi in the rooms needs to be paid for. For us breakfast wasn't included so i can't review that, but overall it was an enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 13, 2014Dear “Burntoast0“  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience at Le Meridien Stuttgart with other travelers on Tripadvisor.
