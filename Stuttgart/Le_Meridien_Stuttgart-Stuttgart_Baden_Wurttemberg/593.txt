The Le Meridien Hotel in Stuttgart is located in the north of Stuttgart - the Schlossgarten is right across the street, great to go running there. Staff is friendly and the hotel is usually quite booked as it's full of consultants most of the time. The rooms are spacious and nice, the bathrooms are great. The rooms facing the street are a little loud, but the ones to the back are just fine. Breakfast is really good, a wide variety of food to chose from and attentive waiters. Company rates there are okay, but the normal rates are somewhat steep.Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Feb 16, 2012Dear "TripReporter177",  Thank you very much for spending your valueable time on sharing your experiences about Le Meridien Stuttgart on TripadVisor.
