No Working WiFi (hello people, its the 21st century... and you promise your high end BonVoy elites FREE WiFi). Another Marriott promise broken.  The restaurant is gross and mismanaged.  No A/C.  Paper thin walls, couldn't get a decent night's rest with all the noise.  We weren't comfortable here, you probably won't be either.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 9, 2019Dear guest "Filmcraft",  we do appreciate your feedback and your business as a loyal Marriott Bonvoy Elite member. Thank you! Unfortunately it seems that your stay was not as you were expecting.   I am quite surprised to read about your impression of our restaurant. While tastes are different we for sure do not have a "gross" and "mismanaged" restaurant. There are high standards both from Marriott and German law on which we get checked on a regular base.   The partial absence of WIFI in our hotel that weekend was due to the fact that there had been a major power cut incident at the Stuttgart Main Train Station. Construction workers had accidentally drilled into the city’s energy supply and glass fiber cables, causing a power cut not only to the hotel, but the whole local area, leaving the surrounding office buildings, apartments and traffic lights with no electricity and internet connection for hours.   Please rest assured that we do not intend to break any promises at this point, but I hope that you understand that there is not much that a hotel staff can do in such a situation other than comforting its guests, whilst the local authorities and IT professionals restore the usual status quo.  Dear "Filmcraft", our goal is that every guests leaves the hotel with a smile. Therfore we would be pleased to welcome you back on another visit to our beautiful city in order to restore your faith in Le Méridien Stuttgart.  Kind regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division Manager Le Méridien Stuttgart Read more
