The hotel is quite nice and has all the amenities.  It is close to the main train station and pedestrian mall.  The new train station is under construction which really has messed things up just in front of the hotel.  The rooms are very nice and the bed is quite comfortable.  The bathrooms are possibly the highlight, if you're in to that sort of thing.  My only complaint was the wifi was great by the door, and nonexistent at the desk...which is not terribly helpful.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 13, 2013Dear “Barnsey9999“,  We very much do appreciate your comments regarding your recent stay at the Le Meridien Stuttgart.
