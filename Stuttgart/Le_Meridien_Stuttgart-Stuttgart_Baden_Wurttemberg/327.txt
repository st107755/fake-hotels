Great location and very nice property in Stuttgart.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Platinums get full breakfast, which was very nice.  I'd like to really thank Lisa at the front desk for being very helpful and making it an enjoyable stay.  We greeted by first name from Lisa each morning with a smile and really appreciate that.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 23, 2015Dear Brady1919,  in behalf of Lisa and the entire team I would like to say thank you for this great review.
