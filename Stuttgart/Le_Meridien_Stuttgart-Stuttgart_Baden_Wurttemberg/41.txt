I have stayed in this hotel several times now and it is certainly the best hotel in Stuttgart. The location is great, the rooms are spacious and beautifully finished and the staff are exceptional ! It would take a lot to beat the experience of a stay here.  I look forward to my next visit and thank you for looking after me again üëçRead moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 14, 2019Dear guest "AGW43444",  Thank you so much for your delightful words.
