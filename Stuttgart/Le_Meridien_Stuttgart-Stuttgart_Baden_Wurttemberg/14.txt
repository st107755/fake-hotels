We stayed at the Le Meridien in Stuttgart and right from the minute we entered the service was superb. At the check in counter we were greeted by one of the staff members who checked us in within minutes. The room was ready for us even before the scheduled check in time.

By the time we had lunch and came back to the room, there was a very tasty dessert served for us which was complimentary.  The house keeping service was very efficient.
