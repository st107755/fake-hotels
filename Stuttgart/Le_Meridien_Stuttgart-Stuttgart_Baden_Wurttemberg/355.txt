A great hotel.  Really enjoyed my stay.  Reasonable price.  Friendly staff.  The rooms are spacious and well kept.    I absolutely loved the spa and made sure to visit everyday as its so peaceful down there.    My only criticism and the reason I haven't given it 5 stars is the lack of free wi fi in the rooms.  Even budget hotels have free internet access throughout the hotel these days and a â‚¬6 per day charge is a bit excessive.
