This hotel has a great location right across the street (with an overhead walking bridge) from a beautiful park and an easy stroll to the main train station, lots of restaurants, cafes, and shopping. A block from the "U" that makes getting almost anywhere in the city a breeze. The room was nice and clean. Only complaint is that the air conditioning didn't really cool the room at night.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 11, 2017Dear Jim R,  thank you very much for your time, writing a review.
