from my point of the view, this hotel is not remarkably beautiful from the outside but the more from the inside. rooms are spacious and modern.  advice: ask for a upgrade to  the refurbished ones. spa area is not too big but has two saunas and a steam bath.  I appreciated the offering of complimentary water and apples. staff is super polite and friendly. the restaurants and bars are nice and not too pricy. I had dinner for two with steak + pasta with truffles for like 60â‚¬. if you come by car you can use their own car park. if you are travelling on budget you can also find cheaper parking lots in nearby streets. would recommend this hotel to everyone.
