Would not stay here again.  The rate of $200 per night excluded breakfast, wifi, parking.  Room nice but not worth the price especially facing Wily Brandt Str. which is very noisy.  Additionally, we received the most incredibly rude response from an employee in reception to our request for a king size bed.  "We're not accustomed to having two men share a bed."  Though receptive to our complaint, management simply provided a bottle of wine as an apology.    Upon check out also got a bill of $130 for parking, wifi, coffee & tea room service for 2 days.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 11, 2012Dear grdohm,  First of all, we would like to thank you very much for your recent stay with us and the review on TripAdvisor.   You and your partner made some unwelcoming experiences while you were with us. Our colleague at the Front Desk mentioned a sentence which is absolutely not acceptable. We would like to express our sincerest apologies for that. We can assure you that our property is a very open minded, gay friendly hotel for all guests. Of course we do offer king-size beds to male or female couples, however, as you can imagine, we do verify upon arrival the bed type preference. We are very sorry that we have missed that in your case.   After you reported this incident to our Manager on Duty we just wanted to underline our apologies with the bottle of wine. We very much regret that you have experienced this as inappropriate. As our Front Office Manager, Mister Stefan Hummel, wrote you in a separate mail we hope that you can accept our apologies for the inconveniences you had during your stay with Le Meridien Stuttgart.  Dear grdohm, we are all looking forward to welcome you back in Stuttgart as soon as possible so that we have the chance to correct your impressions.  Best regards,  Selim Mokni Guest Relation ManagerRead more
