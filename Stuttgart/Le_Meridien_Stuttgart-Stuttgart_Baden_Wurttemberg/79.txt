In my opinion, it’s the best hotel in Stuttgart. Very nice, clean rooms, super accommodating staff, very decent breakfast. There is some construction going on next to hotel, but it was not really noticeable ( noise wise). Location wise, it’s a bit off the main center street, but in many ways it’s a pro, not a con. Will definitely come back againRead moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare
