Very shabby and sad, depressing experience. Badly needs renovating. Staff were mostly lovely and helpful apart from one doofus. Breakfast was good.  Room was dark and depressing. Amenities lacking - no kettle, tissue box. Room service food was awful and the tray was not cleared for over a day even after I asked for it to be cleared. Restaurant only had a very expensive buffet option and there was nowhere else nearby to eat. Wifi connection very slow.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 23, 2015Dear Batmaya,  thank you very much for sharing your experience on Tripadvisor.  It is really unfortunate that your stay was not the way you were expecting. We just finished the renovation on our 4th floor and step by step we will also refurbish the remaining floors. I will forward your comment about the roomservice to our Manager. We do offer kettles at the Front Desk. Just ask my colleagues the next time you are staying with us and they will bring one to your room. If you do not wish to dine in one of our two restaurants, our concierge or reception team is always happy to assist you with reservations in restaurants close to our hotel.   It would be great to welcome you back to Stuttgart in the near future!   Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
