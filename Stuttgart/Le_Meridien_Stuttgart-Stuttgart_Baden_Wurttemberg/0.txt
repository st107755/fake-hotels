The staff was so friendly and accommodating to my family and I. The service was outstanding and the breakfast was the best around. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting. Mirjam and her staff are the friendliest people to see in the morning. I donâ€™t write reviews often, but this one was worth the time.Read moreDate of stay: August 2020Trip type: Traveled soloHelpfulShare
