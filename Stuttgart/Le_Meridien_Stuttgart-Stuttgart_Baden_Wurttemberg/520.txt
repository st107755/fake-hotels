The service was excellent. Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. The breakfast was superb. The hotel is within walking distance - 5 to 10 minutes - of most of the major tourist sites and is on one of the major roads through the town so taxis are plentiful. The hotel has everything you need for business travel too. If you are traveling in December, the hotel is within walking distance of the main Christmas market, which is amazing and easily the best I've seen in Europe.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 16, 2013Dear “GeoHL“,  Thank you very much for your nice words on TripAdvisor.
