We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff was very professional. The room was a nice size and very comfortable. Neat picture on the wall that lit up from inside. Great soundproofing in windows, which overlooked a busy street but nothing could be heard. Location was a long walk to the central area. I wouldn't want to walk it in cold weather! Internet charges and parking charges were very high.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 18, 2009Dear sunnyl,  Thank you very much for your rating!
