This is a smart and comfortable hotel and was just as I had expected from reviews on trip advisor.  I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the complete lack of effort by the bar staff to move on a persistent and blatant prostitute repeatedly trying to get my attention and invading my privacy whilst having an 8.00pm supper at the hotel's bar.   Maybe late at night some guests want these services, but i didn't and I would have expected the hotel management to take a firmer line.Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 20, 2011Dear Damsoncottage,  Thank you very much for you recent visit to the Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart.
