Travelling on holidays my husband selected this hotel given it’s location to the central city and Christmas Markets which were only a 5-10mins walk from our hotel.  The Christmas markets where along the same lines as those we have visited in Copenhagen & Hamburg but still enjoyable and a cheap and tasty option for dinner.  We hadn’t added breakfast to our booking and where offered a cheaper rate at 19 Euro per person instead of 26 which we took. We had to accept it on check in otherwise the offer was no longer available.   We were lucky enough to receive a room upgrade so our room was very spacious.  Valet, concierge & breakfast staff where all professional and friendly. Umbrellas where out and available while raining and snowing.  A very pleasant stay.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 20, 2017Dear Htravel69,  we are very pleased to read that you enjoyed your visit in Stuttgart.
