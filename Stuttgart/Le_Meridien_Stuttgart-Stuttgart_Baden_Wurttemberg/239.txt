Nice hotel but way over priced. This hotel is for the German elite and business elite. They offer very little for a high price. Gym was nice and breakfast offered a good spread. The gym was free and that was about the only thing provided free of charge at a almost insulting charge for a room. Internet was crazy slow and in half the hotel your phone won't work. Spa is really nice again very high price for both Germany and Stuttgart. I travel a lot to Stuttgart there is better hotels at a better price available.

It is really unfortunate that your stay with us was not the way you were expecting. The fitness area and also our SPA, with pool and Jacuzzi, different saunas including a steam bath and infrared cabin, are completely free of charge for all of our guests. Just in case you book a treatment, like a massage, you have to pay for it. If you have any troubles with your internet connection please never hesitate to contact the Front Desk. Our IT Manager would be happy to assist.  We would be glad to welcome you back, whenever your plans will lead you to Stuttgart again.
