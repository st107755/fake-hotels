We are really thankful for every Guest comment we receive.   Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart is situated very close to the city center and also close to the main shopping street as other tourist favorites in Stuttgart.   All our rooms do have soundproof windows, however as already discussed with our manager; we do highly recommend booking one of our deluxe rooms which are a little less noisy. Also, we would suggest to book directly with the hotel, as we can find and offer the best room type which is meeting your needs. I am sure you understand that when you book, like in your case, through a 3rd party website that we can only offer other room categories upon check in.  Dear Bagpuss, once again, thank you for your rating.   Kind regards  Guest RelationsRead more
