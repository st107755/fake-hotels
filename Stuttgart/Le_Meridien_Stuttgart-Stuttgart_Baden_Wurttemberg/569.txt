Le Meridien Stuttgart is located in the heart of the downtown area. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The staff is very polite and service is qualitative. Breakfast is very very good, offers something for all eating habits. The only downside is that the interiors of the building could use some renovation to look more contemporary. Overall, great stay!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
