Great Service from the moment you step into the reception. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was a little crowded but very very well stocked. Best of all, great location. We were just 15 minutes walk away from the city centre and the shopping area ... and the Christmas night markets. Additionally ... just a short 10 minute drive to the MB Museum. Very nice hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 29, 2013Dear “EYD“  Thank you very much for your great feedback about your recent stay at the Le Méridien Stuttgart.
