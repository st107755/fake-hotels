I stayed one Night on behalf of Business. Hotel doesnt look too fancy from the outside but it is actually pretty good. Rooms of decent size - very good selection of TV channels. Bathroom ok. Minibar rather expensive. A clear minus: WLAN not free of charge. Breakfast pretty good. Seems to have a good SPA but havent had Time to go there.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 23, 2015Dear Torsten K,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us.
