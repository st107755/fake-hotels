Absolutely great time, as we had our pet dog , we just needed to make sure that the hotel would accommodate us. We contacted the reservation team to say he we had our pet with us and the response was just great, very accommodating with everything just arranged. Check in, amazing , great front off house staff and very attentive. We then had the guys send us a blanket and bowl for our pet without even asking...  We were amazed!!! I’ve travelled the world but these guys have been just amazing! Great team, great hotel... we will definitely come back! If you travel with your pet...... this hotel excelled over every other we have stayed in ! Credit to everyone we had dealings with in this hotel.
