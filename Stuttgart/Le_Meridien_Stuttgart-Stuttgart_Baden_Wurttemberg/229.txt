Great hotel and meeting facility near the Stuttgart Central Station. Rooms are modern, top quality. I had a good night sleep. Everything feels new. The bathroom amenities are premium quality. Excellent bar, great breakfast, friendly and helpful staff. The banquet service is great, meeting rooms are functional. Definitely a place I would recommend and where I will come back to.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 4, 2017Dear Joe K,  thank you for your stay with us.
