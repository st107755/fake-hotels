We are glad that you liked our Hotel and enjoyed your stay with us. All of our rooms are equipped with a climate control system, which is influenced by the outside temperature. We do not have AC’s as they do have in warm or hot regions like the middle east or the US. I am sorry for the inconveniences if it was too hot in your room. Please contact the Front Desk next time and they will find a solution for any issues.  We hope we can welcome you back to a "short and sweet" stay soon! :-)  Sunny regards from Stuttgart,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation Manager Read more
