Great base to explore the city of Stuttgart, just a few minutes walk from the main railway station. Staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was amazing but was not included in our room rate. The cost was 20 euros but it really was worth it, no need for lunch!! Room was pleasant and the bed was comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 3, 2013Dear “Anna N“,  first of all we would like to thank you for staying at Le Meridien Stuttgart. .
