I stayed at this hotel many times in the past. Even though service was never excellent, the location was quite convenient for exploring Stuttgart. However what I had to experience during my latest stay (during Covid-19 pandemic) was appalling and terrifying. Upon checking into my room I noticed numerous contaminations of floor, cupboard, bathroom, chair that proof that this hotel is not taking its responsibilities towards its guests seriously. During normal times such stains would be regarded unacceptable for a 5 Star Hotel. During Covid-19 pandemic this is grossly negligent and jeopardizing the health of the guests staying. I am shocked that a hotel that is a member of one of the largest hotel chains gets away with this. Upon complaining a cleaning lady was sent to remove the stains - no further cleaning was provided.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2020LocationCleanlinessServiceTrip type: Traveled on business3 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
