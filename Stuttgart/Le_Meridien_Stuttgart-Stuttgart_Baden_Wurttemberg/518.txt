I recently stayed at le Meridien and had a lovely experience. From the early check in I was given after arriving from NYC, to the great concierge who made a dinner reservation last minute for 10 people I had a very pleasant stay. I was able to experience room service, which was prompt and polite, and took a quick trip to the gym which was small but functional.  The staff at both the bar and restaurant were professional and accommodating.  I would definitely recommend staying at le Meridien if your travels take you to Stuttgart. I look forward to staying there again in the future.
