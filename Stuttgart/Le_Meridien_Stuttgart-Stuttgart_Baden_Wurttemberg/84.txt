Stayed for one night while in Stuttgart for business. The location is great, 10 minutes walk from the main shopping street. Unfortunately there is major construction going on around the hotel at the moment. The staff were great, very helpful, could not have been better. I came early to use the spa but both the spa and swimming pool were closed for maintenance. Hopefully next time. Very nice room, great bed, no bath.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare
