Very nice hotel, very near to the city centre. The room was very comfortable, clean and with very good furniture. I suggest the morning breakfast, it's amazing with very good quality food and a big variety. The car park,also if you need to pay for it, is very secure and it's the perfect choice for leaving the car there and visit the city.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 23, 2016Dear Mauro G,  thank you very much for taking the time and giving us this amazing Review.
