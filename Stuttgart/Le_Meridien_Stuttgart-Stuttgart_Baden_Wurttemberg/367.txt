Despite its bland external appearance this hotel is beautiful inside and offers a great service.The location is excellent too. Our rooms were lovely, the beds super comfortable and the staff (particularly Stephen at front desk) were superb. The train station is a couple of minutes walk -  as are the main areas. I highly recommend this hotel for leisure or business.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 19, 2015Dear Shehzad S,  thank you for your nice comments about your stay in Stuttgart.
