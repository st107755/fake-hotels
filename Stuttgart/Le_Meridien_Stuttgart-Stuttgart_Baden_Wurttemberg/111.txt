This is the 2nd time I’ve been to this hotel and it’s perfect. Everything about this hotel is right... the location is great, the staff are so helpful and friendly, the rooms are large modern and beautifully decorated and the breakfast choice is 2nd to none. The spa and pool area is excellent with everything you could ask for and there’s loads of secure underground parking. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and can’t wait to come back. I also like that I had the same room as last time 👍Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 2, 2018AGW43444, thank you so much for your feedback about your second stay.
