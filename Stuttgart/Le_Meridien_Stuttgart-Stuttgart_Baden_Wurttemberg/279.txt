Currently staying at this supposedly 5* hotel and although the common areas are impressive and bedrooms are ok, the service and dining facilities are really spoiling our stay. The bistro restaurant at the hotel is only open 12-2.30pm and the main restaurant only opens from 6, so there is quite a gap when all you can order are bar snacks. We have now been waiting over 50 minutes for our burger and pizza! Really not good enough for a hotel of this quality. We dined in the restaurant last night, the buffet food was excellent but again the service was poor with plates not cleared between service and lots of waiting for food to be served. We have one more night at this hotel and so far I'm not impressed....Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 29, 2016Dear "johannahball",  thank you very much for your comments about your current stay.  Our restaurants are open for lunch and for dinner, in between we do offer the menu at our Bar Lillet. You have the choice from traditional items such as a Club Sandwich, Burger, Salads and more.  In case you cannot find anything from the menu, just let our staff know and we will do our best to fulfill your wishes. Also, we do offer 24hours in room dining.
