We had a fantastic two night stay here. The level of service and quality you've come to expect from Me Meridien!   Rooms are clean, comfortable and modern. Breakfast was phenomenal and staff are always ready to assist.  Location is central and my only comment would be to make the overnight parking more cost effective for hotel guests.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Sandor F,  thank you for staying at Le MÃ©ridien on your recent trip to Stuttgart!
