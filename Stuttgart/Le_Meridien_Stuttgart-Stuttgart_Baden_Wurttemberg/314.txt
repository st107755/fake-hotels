This hotel is in a good central location next to plenty of shopping.  The train station is also very close for easy transportation.  There are no views to speak of and no platinum lounge.  The service was also good and there is a nice spa to retreat to.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 1, 2016Dear Michael F,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us.  We are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. Unfortunately the view to the park at the moment is not that nice. When the project for building the underground train station is finished it will be an amazing view again. :-)  Hopefully you will be our guest again soon.  All the best for 2016!!
