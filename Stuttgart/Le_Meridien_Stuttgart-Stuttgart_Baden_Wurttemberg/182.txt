Chic Room was expectedly clean and nicely designed and well appointed.  Breakfast was excellent, with freshly sequeezed (by yourself) carrots, celery, ginger, orange juices.  Wide variety of cereals, fruits, teas, sasauges, etc. Wifi and Air conditioning were good and facilitated a very comfortable rest from the hot summer.  Bath shampoo and soap smells nice!   Can request for no housekeeping for a small reward.  Free bottled water in room.  Observed that the middle of the connecting rooms have stand up showers, which I prefer.  My only minor complaints were that the curtains did not fully block the sunlight at the edge and the shower water was not hot enough (turned to max but still just warm although I reported at the conceirge)Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 12, 2017Dear pengboon,  thank you for your time, writing a review.  The compliments on our breakfast buffet I will share with our head Chef. Perfect, you had a great start in the morning. Your note about the curtains, we will discuss in the team and work on a better solution. I also informed our maintenance team to check the water temperature to find a way to improve it.
