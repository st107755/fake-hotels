I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel; First of all, I liked the location right across the street from the park where I really enjoy nice walls. Secondly, the room and toilet were specious and well decorated.  I had a car and it was very easy to reach the hotel and use the underground parking. But if you don't have a car the main station is within walking distance from the hotel  Breakfast was great with excellent variety of dishes, will return in case I travel to Stuttgart againRead moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
