It's a beautiful and well maintained hotel in the centre of Stuttgart. Because of my SPG status nice upgrade to a renovated junior suite. I really like the new design, specially the wooden floors. Cozy hotel bar with great staff. In the morning they serve a delicious breakfast with lots of fresh fruits and juices. 'll definitely come back if I have to be in StuttgartRead moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 26, 2018Dear Frank012,  thank you so much for sharing your feedback with others here on Tripadvisor.
