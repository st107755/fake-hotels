I agree with all of the reviews that give this hotel an outstanding review!  From the moment we stepped into the hotel until our check out, we were treating like royalty. Very helpful staff... Friendly... Every single one of them we encountered! If only all hotels were like this Le Meridien!  Our room was nice sized... Location is perfect. Will be recommending this hotel to friends and clients!
