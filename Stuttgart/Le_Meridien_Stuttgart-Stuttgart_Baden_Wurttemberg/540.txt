Great stay here, I was here for a weekend stay while on an extended trip to Europe for work.  I couldn't be happier with the experience. Staff were excellent - happy to let me mangle German or switch to English, whichever I preferred.  Rooms were ok size, bed very comfortable. Bathroom was modern.   Breakfast was really excellent, among the better spreads I've had with Starwood or Intercon.   We went to the Volksfest (kind of like Oktoberfest) and had a blast - staff was able to provide some pointers on best options for enjoying that experience. There's a large park across the street, perfect for a jog or stroll.  The train station and nearby shopping/restaurants are a 5 minute walk.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear „Forca_Barca“,  Thank you very much for your great review on TripAdvisor.
