We tend to visit this Hotel at this time of year. We stayed from 26/08/15 until 3 /09/15. As always our stay was really good. the reception staff were attentive and listened to me in German although my German is not that good. I believe that the staff are almost as good at English as me a native speaker. The breakfast was buffet style with many choices with a chef on hand to cook ones eggs.  I believe that there is something to eat for every diet. The Hotel has a excellent Spa with a swimming pool , steam you and three saunas. we had not long arrived and were settling in to the room when a member of staff arrived with a complimentary bowl of fruit. A really nice welcome. There is free wifi in the lobby area not free in rooms. Yes I would recommend this Hotel again.
