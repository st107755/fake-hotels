I had my wedding ring stolen by a member of staff. They did not even report it to the police. I was there on a business trip and had to go searching for a police station myself to report it. Guy at the front desk told me "they trust their staff" and I did not even receive an apology or offer of compensation.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone but if you happen to be staying there do not leave any valuables in the room.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 19, 2012Dear „589BT10“,  This is a serious allegation without any proof whatsoever.   Fact is that you have forgotten a small silver box in your room, you checked out and left the hotel. The box was found by the cleaner in the room and reported as lost and found item. When you picked up the box our Front-Office Manager invited you to report the alleged theft  to the police.   That out of all items in the box a wedding ring was missing and must have been stolen by a staff member is a very serious accusation and of course we offered to assist you with the police. For whatever reason you choose not to report it to the police, instead you are now making good on your threat to post negative comments on public forums if the hotel did not compensate you financially.  We are very sorry that you have lost an item with such strong sentimental value and understand your disappointment at its loss. However without a police filing and your cooperation we cannot cast any doubt above the trustworthiness of our staff or start an investigation. Please accept that under these circumstances we cannot be held responsible or assume any claim.  Dear „589BT10“, as we said before please do not hesitate to contact us whenever you need further assistance.  Best regards,  Selim Mokni Guest Relation ManagerRead more
