We had two nights at Le Meridien Stuttgart for a short trip to Stuttgart. The staff was excellent and we had a lovely garden view room. We had a very good buffet breakfast even though it was a bit pricey. The concierge was really lovely and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear "vv212",  Thank you very much for spending your valueable time on sharing your experiences about Le Meridien Stuttgart on TripAdvisor.
