I visited this hotel with my family for 2 nights using Hotel points. I booked two connected rooms. Hotel staff were very nice and friendly. Hotel rooms were well appointed and clean. Breakfast was very good. It is more a business than a family hotel, but still we were well received. There is a construction just in front of the hotel that makes the view from the rooms fairly ugly but no noise was heard.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear NZIP,  yes, the view might not be the best right now, however it is quite exciting to witness one of the largest infrastructure projects in Europe.
