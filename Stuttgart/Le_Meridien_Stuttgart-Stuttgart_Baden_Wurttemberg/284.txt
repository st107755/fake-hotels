First time visiting the hotel and I was not disappointed. Very nice hotel, clean and spacious with good service and rooms. I did not try their breakfast and it was very expensive – there are good possibilities in the surroundings. Fast check-in and check-out and parking space just in the basement was very convenient.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 23, 2016Dear Allan J,  thank you so much for this great review!
