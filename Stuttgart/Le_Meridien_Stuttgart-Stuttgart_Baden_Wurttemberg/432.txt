We enjoyed our room and large bathroom and several closets....one with ironing board!  Dinner was 60 Euros for one salad entree and one steak entree.  Salad bar was best I have ever seen in any country!  Service was great!  Breakfast a buffet for 25 euros for one person.  Nice choice of Traditional German or traditional American!  Nice fresh fruit bar!  Location seemed to be in Industrial area!  No shopping nearby!Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 14, 2014Dear “Textraveler2013“  Thank you for staying at Le Méridien Stuttgart and for sharing your feedback about our hotel with the readers of the Tripadvisor review site.
