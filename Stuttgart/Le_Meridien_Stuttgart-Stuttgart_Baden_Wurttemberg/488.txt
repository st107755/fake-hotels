We landed in Stuttgart and went right to the Le Meridien hotel.  A great place to stay-wonderful staff and fantastic location.  We walked through a beautiful park to the Koenigstrasse and enjoyed the sights of Stuttgart!  We found the hotel to be quiet and a great place to relax after a long journey.  We will stay here next time in Stuttgart!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 22, 2013Dear “Suzanne1425“  Thank you so much for taking the time and share your review regarding your recent stay with us at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
