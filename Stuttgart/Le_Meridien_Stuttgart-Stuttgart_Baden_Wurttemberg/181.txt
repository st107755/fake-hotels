We researched this hotel online and it looked very good, had good reviews and was in the right location (easy walking distance to the very interesting town of Stuttgart. Upon arrival you are very aware of the massive construction works happening out the front and across the road from the hotel, which from an accessibility and visual point of view diminishes the features of this hotel! The hotel itself was very good, with excellent staff, a great lobby with a great collection of sculptures and other art. The rooms were impressive, good internet, free parking and a brilliant pool, spa and sauna! Breakfast was very good with a good selection and good service. The small restaurant Medoc was quite good but not brilliant. Unfortunately a good hotel was spoilt by the construction site.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 12, 2017Dear Peter and Frank... A,  thank you for your recent stay with us.  Unfortunately we can't do anything about the construction work. Stuttgart has a huge Project called "Stuttgart21" to build a new underground train station. Before starting the Project we replaced all of our windows to make sure our guests are not disturbed during their stay. We are happy to read that you, beside the construction word, enjoyed your time with us.  We would be glad to welcome you back.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Assistant Front Office ManagerRead more
