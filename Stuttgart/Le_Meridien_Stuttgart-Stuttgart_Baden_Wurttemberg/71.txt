The problem is the location.  The hotel is at the edge of a large area of urban reconstruction which looks likely to last several more years.  Until then, it's a nightmare to get to:  walking alongside a busy road (almost an urban motorway).  It may be well situated when all this is done but it's an unattractive location right now.  Check-in (and departure) staff very welcoming and helpful.  Room service on day 1 was late and not what was ordered.  Room (a "chic") room was very nicely decorated but small and, in my view, overpriced.  Internet slow.  I might try the place again but not until the construction is over.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 23, 2019Dear Howard G, thank you very much for staying at Le Meridien Stuttgart as well as sharing your review with us. I am very happy, that you mentioned the reception as excellent, as this is my direct responsibility.  However, it's very sad, that we could not convince you of us. I will follow up with the room Service departement concerning the wrong order. Our hotel is located close to the inner City and the main Station, which has the advantage of short ways and easy walking, but also the impact of the new building of the main station (Project Stuttgart 21, which is the biggest infrastructure project within Europe)  As these construction is on public ground, we do have no influence on any construction work or decisions, that they made and even if there's an impact on us. We always recommend our guests to take a cab if they call us and ask for advices, how to get to the hotel.  I know, it's only a short distance, but taking a cab is sometimes more pleasant than Walking to the Hotel with all the luggage.  Dear Howard G, i would be very happy, if you would decide again for Le Meridien Stuttgart.  Please feel free to contact me if i can assist.   Best Regards  Marco Jokusch Front Office Manager Read more
