The rooms are really spacious, chic design, and amazingly comfortable beds. Food really nice, great facilities, and lovely staff.  The location is 5 mins walk from the hauptbahnhof, and about 20 mins drive from the airport.   I believe this is the best hotel in the city! It has a classy traditional, but chic hotel feel inside. Recommended. :)Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 8, 2019Dear esteemed williamxwells,  thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
