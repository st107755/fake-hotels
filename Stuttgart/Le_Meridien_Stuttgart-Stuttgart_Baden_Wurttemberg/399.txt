Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Rooms were excellent. Excellent breakfast buffet. Lots of variety, fresh. Very close to main train station, only about  a 10  minute walk. Paid wifi in room but free wifi in lobby.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 12, 2014Dear Rob P,  thank you very much for your review.
