The Meridien in Stuttgart really leaves very little wishes open. It's in the middle of town, has a quiet but luxurious atmosphere, some art, comfortable rooms (which just get renovated), a reasonably well-equipped gym and very friendly staff. The absolute highlight of the place is the breakfast, which doesn't leave any wish open, you definitely have to try it!  On the downside is the ongoing construction work outside, the little view from the rear-facing rooms and the missing club room, but here we're talking very high standards. For me this is the best hotel in town!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 11, 2017Dear Ken W,  thank you very much for your stay with us.  We are glad, that you had no unfulfilled wishes during your stay. The compliment on our breakfast I will share with our head Chef and his Team. You are right, the view from the rooms is not as nice as it was before the construction work started. However we try our best to provide a comfortable and convenient time.  We hope, you will visit us again.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Assistant Front Office Manager Read more
