Spend two nights at this great hotel. The room has a great size, modern decoration, a nice bathroom. The breakfast buffet is really nice, recommended. Service is nice and very friendly. Check in service was a little slow with a small line. The concierge service was very kind and suggested a good restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: June 20161 SaveHelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Jonatas R,  thank you for your recent stay with us.
