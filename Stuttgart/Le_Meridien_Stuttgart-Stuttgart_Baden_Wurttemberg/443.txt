It says it all above. I will add the guts at the bar were fantastic and accommodated my unusual drinks request. Breakfast was great and a fantastic selection was offered. You do have to walk over a bridge to get to the centre which is fine in the day but I wouldn't recommend it at night. We took taxis due to the scary looking characters hanging around the other side of the bridge!Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 24, 2014Dear “amberchatwin1985“,  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback on Tripadvisor following your recent stay with us.
