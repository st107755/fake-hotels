Le Meridien was fantastic hotel. The service is the best you will get and quality of hotel rooms great. We had a basic room and it still had a garden view with all the trimmings.  There are some serious road works going on due to a complete rebuild of the main train station, other than causing some issues with access to the park directly opposite it wasn't that big a deal. The hotel has a pool with all the sauna/steam room facilities you could ask for.  Staff were always helpful and nice.  Parking is available under the hotel but it's not cheap at €25.

I am totally happy to read that you think our Hotel and Service is fantastic. We are really proud of our staff and I will forward your comment to my colleagues.  For the price of 22 EUR for parking we also offer our valet service. We will take care of parking and bringing back the car whenever you like.   I hope to see you again here in Stuttgart.
