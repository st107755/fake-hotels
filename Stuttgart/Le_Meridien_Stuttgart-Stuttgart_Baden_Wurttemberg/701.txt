Although, location-wise it is a bit away from the main city centre or shopping precinct, this hotel is worth staying when in Stuttgart. The duty manager Stephan were extremely helpful. He & his team members made us felt very welcomed and go out of their to help us with city sightseeing information and also helped with organising the hotel to airport transfers for a group of travellers. Buffet breakfast had an excellent range of food to select from. The rooms were modern, clean, bright and airy. The staff wre very efficient and polite. If I ever go back to Stuttgart again, I will definitely stay here as a preferred hotel.  Many thanks to the great service provided by the staff!  Keep up the good work!Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
