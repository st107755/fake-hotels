It's a Merdian, it's one of a chain and we were in Stuttgart for just the one night for a Wedding the following day. No worries then but no real expectation either.But for us, there such short time, reception and concierge went out of their way to help with restaurant recommendations and directions. So now knowing what it is I commend you to go and the managment for their proficiency. Hopefully by the time you do the burgers of  Stuttgart will have their major re-development underway to make it a really worthwhile 'destination'.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
