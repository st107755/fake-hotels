Hotel Le Meridien is very plush.  The front desk staff are wonderful, with excellent English language.  The hotel location  is excellent for exploring the heart of Stuttgart, or catching trains to other locations.  There is a bahnhof (train station/underground) 1/2 block down the street, with the main train station across the wonderful park (Schlosgarten).  This is a fairly short walk/stroll from the hotel across the park to the station (5-10 min)  It is safe, well attended, and well lit.   Drawback - Walking out the hotel front door is along a very busy main street, with no shops, cafes, or stores.  The main area of such are a few blocks walk, over to Konig Strasse.  This is a wide boulevard for pedestrians, with shops, cafes, and much more.  Delightful.  .Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
