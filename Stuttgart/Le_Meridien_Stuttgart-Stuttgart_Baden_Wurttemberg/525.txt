Stayed there one night after Christmas. One would expect that during this season in Stuttgart the hotel operates on a reduced level and that a bar would be closed and so on. Well, the contrary is the case! I rarely had such a great welcome at a Meridien. The bar, where we had night cup, was a very welcoming spot with truly great service. The great experience continued with the excellent breakfast. The room we got was very spacious and tastefully appointed. We enjoyed every bit of our stay there. In addition, the location is perfect. Very centrale and near to all cultural attractions. Another great feature is their secure parking downstairs. Very well done and very well managed. Congratulations to the staff. Will defenitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
