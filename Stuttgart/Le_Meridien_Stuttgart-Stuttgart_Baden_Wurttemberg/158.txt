Trying to navigate through a building site from the main train station to the hotel wasn't the best introduction to Stuttgart, but the welcome at reception was fantastic.  My room was spacious and comfortable.  Although the room was on the first floor facing the street, the wasn't much traffic noise and I didn't get disturbed. I visited the pool area on the first evening and enjoyed a swim and the whirlpool. The gym is small but well equipped, I was delighted to find hand weights, mats, wobble boards and medicine balls in addition to the ubiquitous running machines. I ate it in the hotel restaurant on one evening, the food was delicious and the service was good.   This is not a cheap hotel but it was a very enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 19, 2017Dear Rachel,  we appreciate your feedback about your recent stay with us!  Yes, the way from the station to the hotel can be challenging. We do recommend a taxi if you have a lot or heavy luggage with you, since the walkway to the hotel has some steps in between.  But I am glad that your impression has changed once you arrived in the hotel and that you have enjoyed the hotel. It looks like that you have used most of the hotels departments, that is great!  With best regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division Manager Le MÃ©ridien StuttgartRead more
