The Le Meridien is an amazing hotel that is big, open and has really nice rooms. The rooms are large, clean and modern looking.  The hotel is located right across the street from a large park with downtown only a 10 minute walk away. The park has running and biking trails.  I would stay here again in a minute!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 3, 2017Dear Terry_Edwards,  thank you very much for your kind review.
