The hotel is in the middle of a building site at the moment so it is not going to look its best.   When we left about 6 police cars surrounded the building... The check in was polite, and the doorman courteous opening the door and greeting.  50 euro deposit put on credit card on arrival, and was not cancelled on check out.   Still pending over a week later. The room was ok  -  housekeeping could have been done much better Breakfast choice was good -  although the coffee machine was broken,  another guest was disruptive holding a loud phone conversation and the staff didn't seem to care that it was annoying other guests Check out was polite - we were given some chocolates and an apology for the state of the room.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 18, 2017Dear Richard,  thank you for your stay and also for your review! We appreciate your effort to tell others about your stay, however rest assured that we are not happy that your stay was not as you were expecting. Police cars in front of the hotel are extremely rarely, on this occasion there was an investigation going on which was not in our hands. In our hands however is the service of the Housekeeping, we will use this feedback to continue to improve our service, thank you very much! Also we will disuss internally how we can improve the breakfast experience for everybody.  It would be great to welcome you back one day!  Best regards,  Stefan Hummel Rooms Division Manager Read more
