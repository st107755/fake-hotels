We chose the Le Meridien Stuttgart for its great location by Schlossgarten etc. That's functional and we liked the ease of accessing the inner city. The rooms were rather too functional for our liking. Breakfast was rather disappointing: okay choice but overcrowded (no free tables, guests scrambling for food and space) and early finish (10:30, on a weekend!). The spa was outright disappointing: again overcrowded, not enough seating space, everything soaked, and no staff to be seen. I was lying next to empty glasses and a half-eaten apple for an hour, when I decided I had had enough.

I am sorry to read that your stay was not entirely to your complete satisfaction.  We do offer breakfast from 6:30am to 10:30am in our restaurant. Especially on the weekend we recommend an early visit to the breakfast area, since most guests tend to sleep in on the weekend and therefore join almost all together at a later time. If you prefer a breakfast time after 10:30am, we recommend to order by Room Service, there you can have breakfast until 12 o'clock noon.   Your comments about the spa have been passed on to the Spa Management. There should be regular checks from the staff at all areas of the spa to make sure, that the entire area is clean.  Beside of that we are glad to see that everything else was fine. We would be happy to welcome you back to Le MÃ©ridien on your next visit to Stuttgart.  Kind regards, Stefan Hummel Rooms Division ManagerRead more
