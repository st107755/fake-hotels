One the the best staffs I have encountered. Extremely helpful and genuinely nice people. From the front desk staff to the breakfast service everyone was professional, warm and helpful. Property was nice and met the standards of this chain. Spa was relaxing after day of walking Christmas markets with our Children and recovering from our flight.
