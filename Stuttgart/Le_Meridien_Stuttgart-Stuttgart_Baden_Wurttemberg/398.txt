I'll keep this short.  Great, normal, clean, friendly hotel.  Stay here, but do yourself a favor and don't stay in the front. The street noise is insane. I was on the first floor above the awning in the front. The window opened, so there was a nice breeze, but I had to close it at night to buffer the noise.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 16, 2014Dear Biancaontheorad,  thank you for staying with us! I am very happy, that you were satiesfied with the hotel, however, i also noticed your comments concerning the rooms to the front.  A good location in the city center is usually associated with traffic noise, therefore all of our windows are sound insulated, and we are just finishing a revision of the windows. They do block the noise very well. But i agree with you, that finding sleep with an open window is difficult.  Next time, ask for one of our Deluxe rooms, which are facing the courtyard and allow it to sleep with open window.  Dear "Biancaontheroad, whenever your travel plans lead you back to Stuttgart we would be delighted to welcome you back!  Kind regards,  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
