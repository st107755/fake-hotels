This hotel is awesome!  From the time we checked in until the time we left, everything was excellent.  Everyone on staff was very nice and accommodating.  I was traveling with my five-year-old son and they made him feel so special.  Easy access to shopping and transportation.  Tip:  If you plan to take the train to and from the hotel, I recommend you take a cab as it is not easy to carry your luggage through the park.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 5, 2009Dear NCtraveler,  thank you for sharing your impressions from your last stay with us. It was a pleasure having you! You are right, if you carry a lot of luggage, the cab ride might be the best idea, otherwise it is just a short 10 minute walk through the Schlossgarten. I hope to welcome you and your son again.   Kind regards, Guest Relations.Read more
