This was my first experience at the LeMeridien Hotel & it was truly an OUTSTANDING hotel in every respect.  From the SUPERIOR professionalism, friendliness & first rate work ethic of Anastasia in Reservations, to the EXEMPLARY Front Desk Staff personnel of Janina, Sara, Gotz, Daniel (& to the others whose names, I am sorry to say, I cannot remember now - but who were as equally SUPERB to both myself and my group of five), to the TERRIFIC work of both the Cleaning Staff and Restaurant Staff, I recommend this hotel with enthusiasm.   GENUINE courtesy and friendliness are two special hallmarks of this hotel, and whenever I have the opportunity to return to Stuttgart in the future, I will ALWAYS make the LeMeridien Hotel my first choice. One will NEVER be disappointed!
