This hotel is new and the distance from city center is about 10/15 minutes walking. As there is a big construction in front of it, it is better to take a taxi. The room size is fair and parking is private and expensive (22 euros/day). The soundproof window is the best.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 3, 2016Dear Luiz A,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us.  At the moment the most convenient way from the central station to the Hotel is to take a taxi. Especially if you have heavy luggage. However our Concierge team is also happy to assist explaining the other options if you contact them in advance. The Garage is a public one, that is why we unfortunately cannot do much about the parking prices. Nevertheless, compared to the other car parks in Stuttgart the prices are in the lower range.  We hope you will visit us again if you are ever coming back to Stuttgart.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
