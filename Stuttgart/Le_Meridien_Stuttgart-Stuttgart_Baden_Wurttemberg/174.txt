Stayed here for a week with 4 other couples/families and could not fault this hotel.   Excellent, well appointed rooms, delicious food and thee best service from Marcel and his team in the bar who made sure we had everything we required each evening after our busy days in and around the city.   Would definitely recommend and stay here again if we visit Stuttgart in the future.
