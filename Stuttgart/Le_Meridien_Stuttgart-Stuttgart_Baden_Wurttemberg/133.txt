The Le Meridien is an upscale hotel right across from the train station in the center of Stuttgart. My room was very nice though my business partner had an older room that had not been refurbished. The hotel has  wonderful breakfast spread and a terrific spa, indoor pool and small but updated fitness room. Other than breakfast the restaurant inside the hotel is just so so. The hotel has a very good conference center that can accommodate a good size group.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Feb 5, 2018Dear Sandy W,  thank you so much for choosíng Le Méridien on your most recent visit to Stuttgart.
