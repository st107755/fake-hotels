Stayed at the Le Meridien Stuttgart on September 29'th 2011. The Hotel is great especially the staff. It was a last minute reservation but the staff welcomed me with great service . The hotel is in a good location close to the train station and there are 2 subway stops within a block of the hotel. the central district is also only about a 10 minute walk  but it is the service that sets this hotel apart. Rooms are a standard Le Meridien but again service is a step above. Recomend it highly.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
