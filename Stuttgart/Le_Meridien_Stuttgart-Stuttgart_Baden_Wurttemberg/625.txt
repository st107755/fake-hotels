Hotel was very nice although I would say the room was slightly on the small side. Room cleaning was lacking as empty water bottles were not removed and the desk area remained dusty throughout our stay. The bar was not a very sociable area although the bar staff were very friendly and helpful. The spa and gym facilities were very nice and relatively quiet except for one afternoon when two young children were playing noisily in the pool.

You are right, in the park there are currently protestors camping there to protest the construction at the main station.  Usually they do not bother anyone.  At most they might ask you if you are interested in discussing the construction or invite you for a cup of tea, but nothing more.   I am sorry about the inconsistent service of housekeeping. A dusty area or any empty bottles which were not removed is most certainly not a standard you should expect when staying with us.   Dear Christine, once again thank you for your review. I wish you an enjoyable summer.  Kind regards, Stefan Hummel Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
