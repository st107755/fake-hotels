+Good location; convenient access (on foot) to main city center and starting point (by car) to other destinations in and around Stuttgart +Friendly staff and good service  -Construction works on road outside hotel and park across street from hotel caused some inconvenience -Rooms looked like they were fitted out in the 1970s with only minor recent upgrades  Overall, worked well for us given it was a driving trip. For those not driving and without need for the hotel's secure underground carpark, there may be better options closer to the city center / across the street from the main railway station.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear WillP,  thank you very much for your review and for sharing your comments on tripadvisor. You mentioned, that the hotel does need a refurbishment, and since monday last week, this is in place.

So, you can see, that we have already seen the importance of a refurbishment and the next floors are aslo in planning.  Hopefully, you'll find some time to come back to Stuttgart and can enjoy your stay in on of these rooms.  Best Regards from Stuttgart  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office ManagerRead more
