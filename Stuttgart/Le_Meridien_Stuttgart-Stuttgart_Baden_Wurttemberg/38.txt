The hotel is nice and the staff is good. The rooms are very clean and have all the necessities. Breakfast is very good but not cheap. Not sure if there are other places to eat breakfast close by.

It’s around a 15-20 min walk to the center.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 8, 2019Dear esteemed  rhkrhk,  thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
