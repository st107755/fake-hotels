Real delight of a hotel right in the heart of the action in Stuttgart. Amongst the best check ins I have ever experienced, professional, courteous, above and beyond with help. Really impressed. Rooms in the new section spacious, tastefully decorated and clean. Don't be put off by the construction of the new underground train station across the road, the rooms are whisper quiet. Didn't have time for the spa but that looked wonderful as well. And take advantage of the free gallery pass, saves you around 15€ and one of the finest collections in Europe is just a few minutes away Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 12, 2016Dear ukaustravellers,  thank you for this great review.  We are really proud that you experienced the best check-in at our Hotel. We are more than happy about such a compliment. This year we will continue with the renovation of our rooms on our second and third floor. Hopefully you will also like them as the design will be a little bit different.  There are definately enough reasons to come back to Stuttgart soon, e.g. visit our Spa area, have a look at the new renovated rooms,... :-)  All the best,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
