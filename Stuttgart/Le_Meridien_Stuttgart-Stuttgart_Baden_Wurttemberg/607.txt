We do not have a single nice word to say about this establishment, its staff is most terrible, unfriendly and plain rude. These people absolutely destroyed my family nice trip through Germany. If we ever travel again through Stuttgart, we will Never Stay Again in this Place.  This hotel charges high prices, but gives extremely Low Quality Service.  Suggest to All Travelers - Avoid it at All Costs, if you want to enjoy your trip.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
