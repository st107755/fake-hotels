Old exterior but the room is nice and newly renovated. The parking garage is a bit tricky to get in and out as the entrance and exit are pretty narrow. Don't miss the breakfast!! Probably the best breakfast we had for the whole Germany trip. We loved the self-service juicer machine! The service are good and very friendly.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien2015, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 6, 2015Dear "Chayaphol L",  Thank you very much for choosing Le Méridien Stuttgart on your most recent stay in Germany.
