Did a one night here after flight cancellation. Did not know it was so far from airport but the hotel stay was great. Stuttgart is like one big building site at moment due to train construction but hotel and room is oasis from this. Mercedes building is not far and planetarium over the road. Bed and room amenities good and bar restaurant great fish and chipsRead moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 27, 2019Dear guest tnick48,  Thank you so much for your delightful words.
