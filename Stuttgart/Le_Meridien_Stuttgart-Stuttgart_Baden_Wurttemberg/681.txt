The hotel was very clean and quiet. The staff was accommodating. Parking was extra. The cost was 18 Euros a night. There really wasn't any other option for parking. There is a large park across the street. It was easily accessible by a walkway. There was a beer garden in the park. At the far edge of the park was the train station. It was in easy walking distance. We were there during a warm spell and the air conditioning really wasn't up to it. It was warm in the room at night. That was really our only complaint.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations Supervisor at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 10, 2009Dear Holmes Fam,  Thank you very much for your note.
