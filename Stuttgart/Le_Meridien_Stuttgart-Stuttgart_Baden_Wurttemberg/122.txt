This was my second time here. You're always made to feel welcome. Staff are friendly and efficient and rooms are up to date and clean. Perfectly situated close to Hbf and parks and a short walk to main shopping area. It's opposite the Stuttgart 21 building site but as it's one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Germany's history it's a view worth having. And the building work doesn't impinge on comfort at all.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 19, 2018Dear Officiousbystander,  it was a pleasure having you as our guest in the hotel!
