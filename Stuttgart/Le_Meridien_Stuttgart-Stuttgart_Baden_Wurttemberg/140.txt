We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The room was very comfortable...., we got an upgrade on arrival. The bed was massive and the staff were extremely helpful. The gym and spa was great. I really liked the whirlpool.  The breakfast was really tasty and had lots of choice. The hotel is located about five to ten mins from the city centre and located really close to the train station.  We spent new years eve in the hotel and there was lots of activities planned.  The rooms were really quiet so we had a lovely relaxing time !!Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 3, 2018Dear PhoenixLizzy,  thank you very very much for your beautiful review!
