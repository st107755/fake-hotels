I stayed here for 2 nights whilst on Stuttgart picking up a new car at the Mercedes factory.  It is a perfectly OK 4+ star business focussed hotel. When I was there it was for the most part very quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful.   Two negatives:  *     The rooms overlooking the main road have excellent soundproofing but unless you don't mind sleeping with the air con going (which I do) then you will fry in the heat in the summer  *    The chef isn't as good as he thinks he is. The restaurant purports to be French focussed. I had something called "cassoulet" for my main course. I know exacty what that dish entails. Whatever it was I had that night it certainly wasn't cassoulet!! Sadly it wasn't very good full stop! The wine list was impressive though  Set against thatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2007HelpfulShare
