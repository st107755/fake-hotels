I have stayed here twice for work and both times it was lovely. The staff are great and so welcoming. The service is high standard. The food is great and well priced. Everything is stylish and comfortable. I could live here quite happily. The pool looks incredible but have never used it. Would recommend this hotel without hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare
