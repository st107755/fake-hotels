We were on a business trip. This hotel was right by Stuttgart Central Station which was very convenient to explore Stuttgart and to commute to other places. Service and facilities were 4-star. Room was clean, spacious and modernly decorated. Breakfast was generous.   It was just a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 21, 2011Dear "Wimmie",  It was a pleasure reading your comments on Tripadvisor, thank you for sharing those!
