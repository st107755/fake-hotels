We recently stated at the Meridien Stuttgart for a short trip to Germany. The hotel was a short taxi ride from the airport. Check in was smooth and fast. Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The u-bahn was right down the street, a short walk away. The location was pretty central to the things we wanted to see, mainly Canstatter Volkfest. The street outside was clean and quiet despite a massive construction project going on. WiFi was great.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from rWallenborn, Guest Relations Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 31, 2018Dear Mr. Guest "Jamie P",  On behalf of the entire hotel team, we want to thank you for sharing your most memorable experiences with us during your recent stay at Le Méridien Stuttgart.
