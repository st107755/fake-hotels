This hotel is across a park from the train station.  If you are travelling Europe and have time for a rest from heavy sightseeing, this is the place to go.  The pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, showers were superb.  The breakfast buffet included champage and fresh squeezed orange juice--for mimosas if you like.  There were 5 kinds of honey, huge selection of meats, cheeses, fruits, breads etc.  The rooms were large and comfortable. Expensive but worth it. Read moreHelpfulShare
