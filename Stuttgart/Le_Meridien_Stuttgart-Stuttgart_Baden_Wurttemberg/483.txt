I spent one night in Stuttgart and stayed at this hotel. It's walking distance from the Stuttgart HBF (main train station). So if you have little luggage do not get a taxi. The customer service is very good, the room was nicely renovated and modern. I would definitely go back to this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 8, 2013Dear “Oncofighter“  Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on Tripadvisor following your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart.
