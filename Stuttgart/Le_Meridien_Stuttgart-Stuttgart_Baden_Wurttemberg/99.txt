When we stayed here there were a lot of road works on the go. The hotel helped with everything though to still mae it enjoyable (walkways were not always clear etc.). We loved it there! Not too long too walk to the Main Station, City Center and other sights. Great!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
