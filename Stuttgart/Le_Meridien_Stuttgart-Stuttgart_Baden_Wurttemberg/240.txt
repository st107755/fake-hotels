The common areas of this hotel were very nice and parking was conveniently located in the basement. Staff were friendly and professional and the breakfast was top notch. The location of this hotel will probably be great once the construction across the street is complete.   But for me the real minus was our room, which, though in theory located one floor above the ground floor, was still directly at street level due to the way the street inclined up on that side of the hotel. This means that we had to keep the curtains drawn tight or feel like shop mannequins on display for all wandering or driving by to see. My suggestion would be to request a room on a higher floor if you are going to stay here.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 21, 2016Dear ExpatTraveler2,  thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.  Our Superior rooms are located on the first to third floor, facing the street. Our Deluxe rooms are located on the same floors but to the quiet back of the house. If you would like to be on a higher floor, I would recommend to book one of our Executive rooms, which are on the fourth and fifth floor. If you need any assistance with booking the right room, please never hesitate to contact our in-house reservation department under +49 711 2221 2990 and they are happy to assist.  We hope you had a safe journey back home and we have the chance to welcome you back.  Kind regards from Stuttgart,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation Manager Read more
