My fianc√© and I just got back from a weekend of visiting the Christmas markets. We had a brilliant time. The hotel is lovely and staff were very friendly and helpful! The spa is very relaxing and very clean. We would stay here again!

Thank you for your review! Its nice to see that you have enjoyed your stay with us, I have passed on your comments to the team! From the mainstation it is a good 10 minutes walk. You can either exit the S-Bahn at the mainstation or exit the long-distance or regional trains and then use the exit at track 16 for the quickest way to the Hotel.  Hope to welcome you back one day!  Kind regards,  Stefan Hummel Front Office ManagerRead more
