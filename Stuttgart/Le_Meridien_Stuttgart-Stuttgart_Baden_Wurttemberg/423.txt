However we would love to clarify to you and other Tripadvisor readers, that at no point we were rude or disrespectful towards you. When an accident happens, such as yours, it is clear from our side that this person is responsible for the damage. We have only forwarded the actual cost for the repair, and you have received those copies upon departure. At no point did the hotel overcharge you or added any further fee to your account.  Our garage is big enough to suit cars like an S-Class Mercedes or a BMW 7series. We also do offer valet service with no additional coast.
