Great Breakfast: this hotel offer an execellent breakfast compared to other hotels in Europe. it has a wide variety that suits all ppl.  the hotel in general is good, it is only 10 min walking to the famous most crowded street in stuttgart. the stuff are helpful and very friendly. the one thing that i disnt like in this hotel is the air conditional, the weather was a bit hot and the air conditional seems to not be disgned for such weather.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 10, 2016Dear Mayed A,  thank you for your time, writing a comment on Tripadvisor.  The breakfast buffet really offers a wide choice of different dishes in the morning. If you are not that hungry and you don't like to choose from the whole buffet we also offer a continental breakfast, which excludes all hot dishes. Thank you for your compliment on our staff. I will share this with my colleagues. I am sorry for the inconvenience because of the Aircondition. Please let the Front Desk know next time and I am sure we will find a solution for making your stay as comfortable as possible.  We hope you had a safe journey back home.  Warm regards from Stuttgart,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
