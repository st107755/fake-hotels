Stayed for 3 nights in late September at the excellent Le Meridien.  Location is good adjacent to a large park and less than 10 minutes walk from the main train station, shopping area and nightlife.  Hotel itself was very good value (Â£100 per night for a room) for a 5 star and had decent sized, modern rooms and  well equipped leisure facilities (steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, pool and gym all good).  Breakfasts were excellent with a wide choice.  Staff  friendly and helpful with no pretensions.  Overall, highly recommended. Read moreDate of stay: September 2006HelpfulShare
