The LeMeridien Stuttgart is in a nice building With a nice interior architecture. Reception staff was ok. Service at the breakfast room was not very good. On Sunday most of the tables were occupied and there just was not anyone to seat us. I had to ask for help to seat us, as I am handicapped and no one offered to help. Surprisingly, also the service was unfriendly and slow.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Jakob G,  thank you very much for your review on Tripadvisor.  On sundays we always have a little challenge with our tables at the restaurant. Most of our guests going to breakfast very late. Although my colleagues are trying to clean every table as fast as they can sometimes there is a little waiting time. I apologize for this inconvenince. Another option would be to order room service next time to avoid this discomfort. I will forward your comment to the responsible Manager to see if we can improve the breakfast service in the morning.  I hope to welcome you back here in Stuttgart.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
