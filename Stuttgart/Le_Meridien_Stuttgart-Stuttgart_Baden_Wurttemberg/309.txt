As hotel is not definitely a real luxury hotel,but has convenient rooms and suites with modern design.Where the hotel is unbeatable is in its service that is the real luxury in the today's hotel industry. From the check in to the concierge and from the housekeeping to the restaurant,the service in this property is really fine,almost impeccable . Prompt and friendly,efficient and speedy with a small exception in the lobby bar,where I was looking for the service of a coffe for a quarter of an hour,but even this was a management problem as the staff of the bar is used for room service also... Spent two days there and definitely recommended.Cetrally located and the feeling of a home away from home.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Feb 3, 2016Dear PLSPG,  thank you so much for this amazing review.
