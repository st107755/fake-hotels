Quite a big hotel. Starting to be a little dated, but very comfortable. Gym, beauty and spa are a little grotty Great breakfast Unfortunate the location isnt great as there are 4 year long construction projects across the road which are constantly noiseyRead moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 7, 2018Dear belle899,  thank you for visiting Le Méridien on your most recent trip to Stuttgart! I am glad that you enjoyed the stay! If you feel that the hotel is a bit dated I am happy to inform you that we are in the middle of a renovation phase, about 50% of the rooms were already renovated as well as currently the public bathrooms and the bar. Should you visit us again try one of our chic rooms, those were already modernized.  We hope to see you again soon and wish you all the best until then!  Kind regards, Stefan Hummel Le Méridien StuttgartRead more
