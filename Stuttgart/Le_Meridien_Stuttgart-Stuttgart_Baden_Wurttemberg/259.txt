One of the best hotels I have ever been in Germany - been here 4 times overall. The customer support is an example to follow, rooms are big and clean, the SPA is awesome and the breakfast is one of the bests ever. Certainly a nice spot to stop by when you come to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 22, 2016Dear Matheus C,  thank you for your time, writing a comment on TripAdvisor.
