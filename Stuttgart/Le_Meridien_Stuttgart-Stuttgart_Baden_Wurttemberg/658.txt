We stayed at this hotel for almost a week and we really had a very nice stay. The hotel staff and housekeepers are very good. Breakfast is rich but rather expensive. It is located near the center and the central station although you have to walk about 10-15 minutes through a park and the stairs to reach the hotel are a little tiring if you have suitcases. Jacuzzi was excellent but the swimming pool was too cold. Also the lights in the room were very weak. Generally a good, modern,clean,central enough hotel in StuttgartRead moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 22, 2010Dear Michalisk:  Thank you very much for your rating. We really appreciate your good woods about your stay with us. You are right; if you travel with a lot of luggage the stairs in the Schlossgarten could be critical. In this case you have also the opportunity to walk through the Staatsgalerie subway station, which is easier as there are no stairs. Another option would be a short taxi ride, which takes about 7 minutes and is not more then 10€.  We are already looking forward to welcome you again at Le Méridien Stuttgart.  Kind regards  Guest RelationsRead more
