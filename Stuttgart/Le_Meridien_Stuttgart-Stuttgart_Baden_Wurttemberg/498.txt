Location: 4 Cleanliness: 5 Bathroom: 3 Amenities: 4 Room Space: 5 Staff: 3 I stayed here on a business trip. From the hotel it is a little stroll through the park to get to the city center. The rooms are pretty large and nicely furnished. I thought the price was a little on the high end. After showering the bathroom floor was soaked on both mornings I stayed there. All with all an enjoyable stay but I don't think I would stay here again on my next visit to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jul 5, 2013Dear “rcblokdijk“  Thank you very much for your feedback here on Tripadvisor and for voicing your concerns.
