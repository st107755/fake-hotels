I stayed in Stuttgart for 1 night in September  2017. This hotel has very nice big modern rooms - clean , quiet, great location ... it is just 10 min walk to center . I can highly recommend it when you are in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 19, 2017Dear amadeu1,  I am glad that you have enjoyed your stay at Le Méridien Stuttgart!
