The hotel is by far the best hotel we saw in Stuttgart.  It is far nicer than it's sister hotel in Frankfurt.  The hotel is on a busy street just across from a beautiful park.  It has a pedestrian bridge that crosses over into the park.  And the hotel did a very good job of sound proofing the rooms, you could hear the street at all.  The hotel offers a very nice pool and a nice fitness area.  The rooms were well appointed and had lots of charm.  I would go as far as to call this hotel as nice as a four seasons or ritz carlton.  it was a very nice relief from the Le meridien in frankfurt.  So i would say if you can get a rate for under $300 dollars then this hotel is worth it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 14, 2010Dear Dandrew,  Thank you very much for your rating at Tripadvisor.
