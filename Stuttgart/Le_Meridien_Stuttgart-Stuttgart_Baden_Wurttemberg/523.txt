We spent 2 nights in this friendly hotel.  The rooms are very stylish/well-designed and equipped.  The front desk staff were wonderful, providing a welcoming environment, a great dinner suggestion and even an umbrella when it was raining.

Two items to consider when booking this hotel:  1) the mattress is rock hard -- only about 5 inched thick with an exceptionally-firm surface, and 2) if your room faces the front, the road noise and street lights preclude one from sleeping with the window open.
