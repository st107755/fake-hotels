Renovated rooms are ok, however the hotel is too slow in anticipating needs and should be more proactive when serving the customer. Breakfast is good and the bathroom is ok. Parking convenient and the hotel is quite centrally located.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 2, 2016Dear VfB 1893,  thank you for your review on TripAdvisor.  It is unfortunate that your stay with us was not the way you were expecting.  All of our rooms in the Hotel are in good condition. The 4th Executive floor has a different design than the other rooms. Currently we are renovatig two floors to provide even more comfort. For the whole team it is really important to offer a friendly and customer-orientated service to all of our guests. If there is something during your stay, that you think we could improve, please never hesitate to contact me or my colleagues at the Front Desk directly. We are always happy to get suggestions how we can enhance our service.  We hope we can welcome you back, whenever your plans will lead you to Stuttgart again.
