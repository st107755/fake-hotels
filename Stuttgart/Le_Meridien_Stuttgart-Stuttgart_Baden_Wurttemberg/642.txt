Stayed here with friends visiting the Porsche and Mercedes museums. From arrival to departure everything was great. Staff were efficent and friendly, breakfast was superb. The Spa was very stylish with a nice pool, remember to change first in your room and wear the bath-robes!Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
