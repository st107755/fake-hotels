We booked this hotel for a group of six of us to visit Stuttgart.  We wanted a hotel close to city centre that wasn't super expensive.  We got three twin rooms for 720Euros so brilliant value.  As soon as we arrived we were made very welcome, with offer of maps and any assistance to enjoy our stay in Stuttgart.  Rooms were clean, spacious and with air con also very comfortable in the warm weather.  Free use of a safe was very welcome and the shower was one of the best I have used.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly, particularly the bloke in the hotel bar who seemed to really enjoy keeping us in drinks on the Saturday night.  All in all a very pleasant, great value hotel that I would not have any hesitation in recommending to anyone...Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 26, 2012Dear "Vard2205",  Thank you very much for choosing Le Méridien Stuttgart on your most recent stay in Germany.
