The hotel is quite lovely, the bar and dinner areas are okay though food pricey. The rooms were lovely and neat with good sound proof. The outside location has some construction going on around and its about 10 minutes walk into the city centre with shops and all. Not too many restaurants around this shopping street except for steak house.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
