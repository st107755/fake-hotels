It's the second time that I stayed at the Le Meridien in Stuttgart which is very centrally located and offers all the services you expect from a five star hotel. The check-in process was quick and efficient and the staff was always very friendly and helpful. Parking and Internet access are unfortunately not free and rather pricey. The breakfast was superior which I highly recommend. All in all I would again go for the Le Meridien when I am back in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: March 2010HelpfulShare
