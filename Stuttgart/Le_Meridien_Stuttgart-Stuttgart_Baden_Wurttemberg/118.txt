So the room itself was nice and the staff pleasant.  It is a 10 minute walk to a castle and shopping area which is not bad.  However, the breakfast deal stinks.  With Marriott Gold status we did not get free breakfast.  Thats fine, just wanted to mention it since we didnt know Starwood has different rules.  When we cheked in, dude asks if we want to pre pay for breakfast which is a request I have never heard before.  It was 19 euros, typical for a hotel breakfast.  Due to the aforementioned wslk, we changed our mind and were going to eat at the hotel but it had gone up to 27 euros.  Ridiculous.    The room was very quiet despite being on a busy street and near LOTS of construction.  The housekeeping service was poor.  They did not have our room done until 1630.

We are happy to see that you have enjoyed the room and also had positive encounters with our staff. Our breakfast costs 26€ per person, this is the official price, however we do offer a special if you decide upon arrival to join us for breakfast on every day it is only 19€. I do no see any bad side of this deal, it is clearly communicated and benefits you as the guest as well as us as the hotel since we have a more exact number of guests which we can expect to join us for breakfast.  All the best and kind regards, Stefan Hummel Le Méridien Stuttgart Read more
