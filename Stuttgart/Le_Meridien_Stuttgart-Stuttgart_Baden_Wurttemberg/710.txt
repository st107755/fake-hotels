Just returned from the hotel and it is a class act.It would have got a five except while the breakfast was very good by European standards it did not match the Melia in Berlin.However i would have no problem recommending the hotel to anyone,everyone was helpful friendly the rooms were as the photographs,clean tidy and well equipped .Stuttgart is ok but for Christmas Markets Cologne is better ,but i would recommend trips to Tuebingen and especially Esslingen on what is a superb and inexpensive public transport system.Read moreDate of stay: December 2007HelpfulShare
