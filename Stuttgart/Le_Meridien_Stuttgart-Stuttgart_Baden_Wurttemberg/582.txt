This hotel is what you would expect from a le meridien. Nothing more nothing less. Pretty central location, friendly staff, ok rooms. The whole property is in acceptable condition, common areas look nice, rooms need a bit of refurbishment. Pobably one of your best options in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
