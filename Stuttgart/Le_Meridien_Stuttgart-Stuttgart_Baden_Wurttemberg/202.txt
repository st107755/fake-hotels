It was a one night stay. Hotel was as expected. Rooms and bathroom were modern and large. Staff were very friendly. Excellent breakfast, and if you pay when you check in, it is cheaper. Car park available at a cost.  Close to train station.   Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 7, 2017Dear Yavar K,  thank you for your brief review about your stay.
