We arrived here at the end of a brutal, three flight, 18 hour trip.  The hotel let us check in early, which was much appreciated.  Every employee was very nice and efficient.  The room service food was excellent and fast.  The hotel is located in an area that makes it easy to walk to the city center.  The rooms are very nice, the beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are clean, updated and modern.  Although it's on a busy street and our room faced the street, the windows are either double or triple paned because there was little to no traffic noise.  This is the only place I'd ever stay in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 5, 2013Dear “baps27“  Thank you for taking the time to share your comments and observations following your most recent visit to Le Meridien Stuttgart.
