Entering the elegant lobby of Le Meridien Stuttgart transported us to a place of serenity and luxury amid the immense rail construction project in the middle of Stuttgart.The staff was charming, as well as professional. We chose this property because I am a long time Starwood member. I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the United States, but none outrank the Diplomatic Suite of this property. I regret that we only had time to stay one night before leaving Stuttgart. The hotel also provides free passes to the excellent Stuttgart Art Gallery, where i was impressed and surprised with the eclectic art collection. Stuttgart will improve when construction is completed. Meanwhile, bask in the pleasures of the excellent Le Meridien Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 31, 2016Dear MomNC,  thank you very much for your great review and for beeing a loyal guest to Starwood in the past years. We are very happy, that we created a memorable stay for you and your family. Very sad, that you only had one day in Stuttgart, but your decision to visit the Stuttgart Art Gallery, our UnLock ART Partner, was great, as it offers a huge art collection. You're also right, our Diplomatic Suite is one of the most impressing rooms in our hotel, but that it outranked one of the finest hotels in the States!? Wow, thank you very much!  We do appreciate that!  Hopefully, we can welcome you again at Le Meridien Stuttgart.  All the Best  Marco Jokusch Asst. Front Office Manager Read more
