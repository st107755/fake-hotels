One of the best I ever had, thanks from my whole family + free room upgrade  + breakfast outstanding, with "natural" juices and several gourmet choices  + pool and spa very very good, and open till 11pm, wow  + art collection in the lobby  + staff courtesy was amazing, from booking to reception and support for any issue one of the best I ever had, thanks from my whole family + garage was big and directly connected to the hotel    negative aspects were not so many, and actually most were not really on behalf of the hotel:  - moquette was a bit old, but actually it was ok: no smell, no dirt  - position was on high traffic street BUT no noise inside the room  - the park was under re-structurizationRead moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MarcoJokusch, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 31, 2016Dear Papunz,  thank you very much for your great review and for sharing your comments on TripAdvisor.
