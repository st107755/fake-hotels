The hotel is good, one of only a few truly international standard hotels in Stuttgart. Big lobby, nice renovated spa with pool and jacuzzi, opulent breakfast with good choice. Rooms are sizeable and modern. Only drawbacks - location not perfect along a busy street not quite in the city centre (but only 5-10 mins walk). And I would recommend a back room, the front room is obviously  noisy because of the busy street.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 8, 2012Dear “John_Evans1951“,  We would like to thank you for staying at Le Meridien Stuttgart during your trip to Germany.
