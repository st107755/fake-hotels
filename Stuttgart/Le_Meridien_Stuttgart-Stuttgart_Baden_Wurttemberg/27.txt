I originally choose this hotel for a business trip since ti was centrally located in the city center, upscale, had a parking garage, fabulous breakfast and air conditioning. I keep coming back due to the high level of service from Sophia at breakfast always checking in with me and givng me a hug when as a solo business traveller I need one. From Riedel the concierge that always asks me about my day and helps me to plan amazing adventures on my days off to just the superb service from all the staff. I will always pick this hotel since the staff greet me by name as like family (with the caveat that it's family you want to see!). I highly recommend this property.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 12, 2019Dear guest "Jen M",  Thank you so much for your delightful words.
