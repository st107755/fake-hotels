Great hotel.  I try to stay here whenever I can get a rate within my business travel budget.  The rooms are modern, clean and efficient.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet is the best I had in Europe.  The selection is amazing.  It’s a short walk through the park to the bahnhof and downtown.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 8, 2013Dear “Kavemanbob“  We appreciate that you have taken the time to write this positive review of Le Meridien Stuttgart and shared it on Tripadvisor.
