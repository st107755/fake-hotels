I've stayed in Le Meridien Stuttgart a few times now and have always had a very pleasant stay. The staff are polite and helpful and the location is very central with easy access to the Park, main shopping street and the busy station.   Rooms are clean and spacious and the gym and spa facilities are a nice touch.   Make sure you grab a room which includes a breakfast rate as it is not cheap at around 20 Euro's! The food in the restaurant is very good but the service could be better.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded May 16, 2013Dear “tallphilc“,  thank you for taking the time to provide a delightful feedback here on Tripadvisor.
