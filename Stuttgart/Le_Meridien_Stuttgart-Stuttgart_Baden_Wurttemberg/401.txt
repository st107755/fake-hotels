Very friendly, excellent wellness area, nice bar and very good breakfast buffet (optional).  We were just disappointed about the room.  It had only one chair, so if you have a drink in your room, one person has to sit on the bed. The mattress was not comfortable at all, definitely not worth a five star hotel.  We had a street side room, and in the morning you can hear the traffic.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from LM_Stuttgart, Leiter Front Office at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 6, 2014Dear Daschou,  thank you for staying with us!
