No real complaints here whatsoever: location opposite the giant construction site of Stuttgart's new railway station, but no noise to be heard. Very nice staff. Spacious (business) room. One of the best breakfast buffets we had (please buy a lamp for the egg station - the chef has to work in semi darkness).   However, the rooms and in particular the public spaces could use an update. The hotel clearly shows its age right when you walk in that decades old brass and dark wood foyer. But that wouldn't prevent me from booking here again. Very nice place!Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
