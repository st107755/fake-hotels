According to the front desk, there is no way you can get to the hbf main station without carrying you luggage up fleet of stairs due to the construction in between the hotel and station. could literally see the hotel from the station but really difficult to get there with the construction site. Employees were energetic and friendly, rooms are acceptable. Have to join their "SPG" club to get free wifi.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 23, 2016Dear vanvan1308,  thank you for your time writing a comment on Tripadvisor.  The quickest way from the station to the Hotel is trough the park and up the stairs over a bridge. There is also a way from the station which is without stairs but takes a little bit longer. If you do have heavy luggage I would recommend the second option. Our Concierge is always happy to help planning the easiest way for you. If you do book directly with us the Internet is not only complimentary in the Lobby but also in your room. Our Starwood Preferred Guest "SPG" program has not only the advantage of free internet. You can collect points in over 1 100 hotels and redeem them for free nights,drinks, upgrades, etc..  I hope to welcome you back here in Stuttgart.  Best wishes,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
