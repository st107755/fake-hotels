We loved our room at Le Meridien but the checking, check out and breakfast we lacking. Lines were way to long at the front desk and we have never been to such a poorly managed breakfast. They had a good variety of food but it was nearly impossible to find bowls, glasses for fresh juice and there were no open table due to being short staffed. The coffee machine was also broken and a mess. For 300â‚¬ a night we definitely expected better service.
