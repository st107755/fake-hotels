I recently spent a couple of nights here at this property. Its conveniently located close to the railway station and also a reasonable ride from the airport.  Pros: Good service, Starwood status recognized. Adequate Fitness facility with top notch equipment. Good albeit expensive onsite restaurant.  Cons: Not much to do outside the hotel - its in the middle of nowhere.  Tips The concierge will give you concise directions to get around town using public transport or a cab. An oh yeah - if you are like me (an American) you will appreciate that all the cabs there are late model Mercedes Benz's! Make sure if you have time to go the porsche and Daimler Benz museums. They are well worth it.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien2015, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 21, 2015Dear Mister "lutzbuy",  thank you for choosing Le Méridien Stuttgart for your recent stay in Germany, Stuttgart and also we would like to thank you for your positive statements due to our surrounding area and the hotel itself.
