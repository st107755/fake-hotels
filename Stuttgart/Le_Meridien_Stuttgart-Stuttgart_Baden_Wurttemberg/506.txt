First impression; dated exterior and large heavy doors that a fellow with two suitcases had to struggle with in order to gain access to a nice lobby. Polite Front Desk staff, with a swift and informative check-in. Being an SPG member, I am used to getting a cache of water bottles, but when I inquired about extra water, this hotel offered to have a paid bottle sent to my room. Little things.  The room was standard business, with decent decor and a newly renovated bathroom. The gym is great, the sauna also good. Didn't use the pool, but it also looked nice.  Breakfast was nice and included in the room rate, which added some value to an otherwise higher price for a hotel that was average.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Apr 8, 2013Dear “Michael F“  Thank you for sharing your views and expressions of the Le Meridien Stuttgart with the Guest Portal.
