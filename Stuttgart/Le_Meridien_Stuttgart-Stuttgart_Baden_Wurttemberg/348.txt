It's a well placed hotel, near the train station and for many respects this is a nice hotel.  The rooms however need a good refresh, mine felt dated, shabby.  The real problem was with the staff.  They we're almost rude in their dealing with guests, especially the breakfast staff.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear LocalDine,  Thank you for your time writing a comment about your stay with us on Tripadvisor.  At the moment we are refurbishing our 4th floor and next week will have new designed rooms. Little by little we will also renovate the other floors.   I would like to apologize if our staff did not treat you the way it should be. Our Hotel is known for caring and friendly employees. I will follow up on this situation with my colleagues at the Restaurant as we are really proud of our pleasant staff and a situation like yours should not happen at all.  Please accept my apologies for this inconvenience. If you are in Stuttgart again I hope you will give us a second chance. You can contact me directly any time.  Kind regards from Stuttgart,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
