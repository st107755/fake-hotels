Delicious brunch - well worth the three week wait.    We called on a Friday, to get reservations for that Sunday.  They were booked that Sunday already, and the next one. We made a reservation for the third Sunday.    There were freshly a chucked oysters, perfectly prepared asparagus with Hollandaise, everything I tried was good.  I left fulfilled but not stuffed & happy from the Sekt.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Tawnya H,  thank you for your comment on Tripadvisor.  The brunch is not only popular für our in-house guests but also for local people. That is why sometimes there are no more reservations possible, especially on holidays. I am more than happy that your experience was worth the wait.  We hope to welcome you back soon and maybe there will be a table availabe spontaniously. :-)  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
