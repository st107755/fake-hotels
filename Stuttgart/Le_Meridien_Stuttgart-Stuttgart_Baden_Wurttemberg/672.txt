Positives:  **Check-in was excellent, professional, and friendly. **The room was large, comfortable (particularly the bed!), and quiet.  The quiet is outstanding considering the busy road outside. **The spa is outstanding - the staff here is excellent.  A note for US guests - the sauna area is "clothing discouraged". **The concierge desk did a great job helping me to find a power adapter for the wall outlet.  Negatives: **The internet charges are excessive, 21 Euros/day.  The sign-in page suggests 60p/minute is available, but both a colleague and I were charged the maximum amount of 21 Euros regardless of actual usage. **I asked the staff to help me find somewhere to do my own laundry in the area because the hotel does not have one and the hotel charges for this are offensive. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare Response from Guest_Relations_LF, Guest Relations at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 8, 2009Dear Chemical Laser,  Thank you for your rating and the nice words about our team, we passed your good words forward to them.
