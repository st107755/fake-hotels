Everybody in the hotel was very friendly and trying very hard. However the location is "sub-optimal". We had the room towards the construction site of Stuttgart 21 and a main street. The room is OK but not spacious.   The minibar is quite difficult to open and difficult to find. You also have an ironing board in the room. Well in a five-star hotel I usually take advantage of the laundry service.  Disappointing were extremely loud and drunken Chinese in the bar. Also disappointing that restrooms there are equipped with urimat plastic pissoirs. OK for a parking lot on the highway but a no-go in such a hotel.  Overall, you get better in other hotels in this category but absolutely acceptable to stay for one or two nights.

It is unfortunate that you were not totally satisfied with your stay. Sadly, the view to the construction site of "Stuttgart 21" is not really nice but our windows are soundproof and you do not hear anything from outside. If you would like to sleep with an open window, we also offer rooms to the quiet back of the house. I apologize for the disturbance at the Bar. My colleagues are informed to avoid such situations in the future.  Also your comment about our restrooms I forwarded to the Management to think about a better looking solution.  We would be glad if we could welcome you back to show you, that we are a five star Hotel.  Warm regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
