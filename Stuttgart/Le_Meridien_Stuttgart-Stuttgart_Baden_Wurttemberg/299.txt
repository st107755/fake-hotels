I had a not so nice view to the extremely busy street. My room was in the first floor, so it was extremely loud, especially as I tried to open the window.

Unfortunately the view to the Schlosspark is not the nicest at the moment. If you would like to sleep with open windows I would definately recommend to book a room in our "Deluxe" category which is facing the quiet gardenside. If you have any questions to different room categories please do not hesitate to contact my colleagues of our inhouse reservation departement under +49 711 22210.  We would be happy to welcome you back.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
