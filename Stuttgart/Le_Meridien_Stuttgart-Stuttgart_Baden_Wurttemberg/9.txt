This is a fairly old hotel that is trying to maintain a standard but not really succeeding. Access by foot is really difficult whilst the train station is undergoing a massive rebuild.  Three sets of stairs and ramps. The path is not well lit at night if you are a woman on her own. The recognition of club members was minimal. We did get before noon check in which was great.  Breakfast was fine.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jan 14, 2020Dear guest "scotaussie",  thank you very much for taking time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at our Hotel.
