The Le Meridien Stuttgart definitely lived up to the positive reviews on Tripadvisor.  The location is convenient whether you are driving or taking the train.  The room was nicely decorated and very quiet (even though there is a relatively busy street outside).  There is a walkover bridge for a ~15 minute walk to the hauptbahnhof.  Parking (20euro) is convenient and secure.  The real standout was the service and staff, which were exceptional.  A special thank goes to Selim for making this a memorable stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from Selim_Mokni, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Jun 17, 2012Dear "ez311",  Thank you very much for your stay at Le Meridien Stuttgart and your review on TripAdvisor.
