This hotel is pure class. The rooms are beautiful and stylish, the food in the restuarant is lovely expecially the buffet breakfast and the spa area is beautiful and relaxing and even better if you get to spend it alone in there relaxing like I did. I got lost finding the Spa though it is all the way down past the first floor bedrooms.  Great stay, opposite the park, nice in the summer for a beer and a relax,  I would definately recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2006HelpfulShare
