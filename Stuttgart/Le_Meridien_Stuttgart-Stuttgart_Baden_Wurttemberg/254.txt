The hotel is for sure a good one, still not my kind of hotel as it's quite vintage and the aspect is quite baroque. Nevertheless I have appreciated it, the staff is very friendly and the room spacious and clean. I really don't like the carpet all over the hotel but the housekeeping service is doing a good job to keep it clean and tidy. I stayed only one night and it was perfect as it's located only 10 mins walking from the train station. In addition, the SPA is included in the price and it's remarkable. One of the best SPA inside a hotel, that I have ever seen: a big swimming pool, a jacuzzi, a steam bath and 3 saunas (90째, 70째 and infrared 40째). Amazing! Overall, I would choose more contemporary hotel but for sure I'd go back to experience the SPA :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter G채stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Trickypv,  thank you very much for your recent stay with us.
