I have been coming to Stuttgart very frequently and this place is my favorite. This is a perfect business hotel. Good location, perfect sleep, nice and spacious rooms. Hotel has multiple restaurants and all are quite good. They serve nice breakfast. Staff is well groomed and takes good care of guests. Hotel is situated very near to main station and downtown shopping area.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Mar 24, 2014Dear “YouSeeShah“,  Thank you for taking the time to share your comments following your recent visit to Le Meridien Stuttgart.
