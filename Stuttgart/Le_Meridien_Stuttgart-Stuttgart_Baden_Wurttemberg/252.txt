We have stayed at this Hotel before. It appears that rooms have been refurbished since our last visit. The room we had had a excellent shower with twin shower heads as opposed to a bath. This suited us as my wife has trouble climbing into a bath. As normal the reception staff were business like and very helpful and had time for guests. The buffet breakfast was again excellent with a great selection of different foods. Also not long after arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who knocked on our door and provided us with a plate of fruit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Sep 16, 2016Dear vblong53,  thank you for your recent stay with us.  Last year we started with the renovation of our Executive rooms on the fourth floor. This year we just finished the renovation of our Deluxe and Superior chic rooms. Great that you liked the new design. It is always a pleasure to have little surprises, like the plate of fruit, for our guests to make them feel welcome at our property.  We hope you had a safe journey back home and you will visit us again.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Guest Relation ManagerRead more
