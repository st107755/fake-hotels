I frequent the SPG brands, and Le Meridien is one of the better ones. However, this property in Stuttgart routinely does not provide exec rooms or upgrades to SPG-Platinum members. I'm 0 for 3 now, and even when there is space showing on the website, they say they are full. I am not one to press, if they don't provide the upgrade that is fine. I booked a king and was given twins....just not impressed after this stay.   The room service was very fast and quite good. The bar/restaurants were also quite good for hotel food. Nothing special, but certainly good if you don't feel like walking.   Try to get a room that does not face the street. It can be quite noisy.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Verena_Kirchenbauer, Leiter GÃ¤stebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 21, 2015Dear jonathan f,  Thank you for sharing your stay with us on Tripadvisor.  We always try to give Upgrades to our loyal Platinum Guest. Unfortunately now and then it is not possible for us to upgrade to one of our Executive Rooms or Junior Suites but at least to a room that is facing the quiet garden side. I would like to apologize if my colleagues did not explain the reason for not getting an upgrade properly. Maybe the Hotel was fully booked one day within your reservation period. It is really important to us to make the stay for our guests memorable and comfortable. It is sad that we did not exceed your expectations the last time you stayed with us. I am happy to be the person to contact whenever your plans will lead you to Stuttgart again.  Kind regards,  Verena Kirchenbauer Verena.Kirchenbauer@lemeridien.com Guest Relation ManagerRead more
