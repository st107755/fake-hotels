This is my second stay this year and this time it was with my family. When I stayed earlier in March the hotel was relatively quiet. This time it was during the Stuttgart Volksfest which is a peak time for local hotels. The same high level of service and friendliness applied as earlier in the year. We're always made to feel welcome no matter how busy they are.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MLangenbucher, Guest Relations Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 13, 2018Dear Guest,  First of all thank you for your repeated stay with us!
