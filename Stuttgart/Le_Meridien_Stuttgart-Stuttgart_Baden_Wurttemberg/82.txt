I stayed in this hotel a few times before. Now it's really old and not up to 5 star standard: smallish rooms (some updated), deficit of towels in the bathroom, no water in the room. Marriott status was hardly recognized - no upgrade. Breakfast was average at the best.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from rWallenborn, Assistant Front Office Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Nov 18, 2018Dear guest "Konstantin72"  thank you very much for your recent stay at Le MÃ©ridien Stuttgart. Thank you as well for taking the time to share your thoughts after the departure with us.  At first I would like to thank you for your loyality with Marriott, SPG and Ritz Carlton and please accept my apologize that you did not receive an upgrade at your recent stay. All of our members, that need special focus and a special treatment, because they are our most loyal guests and can expect a different service. But we do have a lot of loyality guest, that are visiting us on a regular base every Monday to Thursday. Beside this fact, our rooms and suites, which we use for upgrades are also in the availability, so they can be  booked by all of our guests, which limits the possibility of upgrades for us and our loyality guests.   Dear guest "Konstantin72", i will take your comments due the towels and the no water in the bathroom to our executive meeting tomorrow, because this is definitely not one of our high standards. Unfortunately, i cannot undo what you experienced but rest assured, that we take this comments very serious.  I wish you all the best and we are looking forward welcoming you again, please feel free to reach out to me, if you need assistance with your next stay.  With best regards,  Nadine Kummer Assistant Front Office ManagerRead more
