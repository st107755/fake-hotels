I stayed at the Le Meridien for 4 nights on a recent trip to Stuttgart. The hotel itself was excellent - large, comfortable rooms and excellent service.

Thankfully the soundproofing and black out curtains mean't that once in your room the construction wasn't really noticed.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from LeMeridien_Stuttgart, Manager at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Aug 8, 2019Dear esteemed BBCH2014,  thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Hotel.
