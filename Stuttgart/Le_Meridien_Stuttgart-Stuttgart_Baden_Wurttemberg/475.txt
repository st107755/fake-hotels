This was a repeat visit and I happily encountered the same commitment to excellent service. The rooms are large and well appointed with upgraded showers, etc. The 24 hour gym is large with a good selection of cardio and strength related equipment. The only negative is that the machines do not have individual TV screens, and the one common TV needs to be blaringly loud in order to be heard.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from SabrinaHubert, Leiter Gästebetreuung at Le Meridien StuttgartResponded Oct 17, 2013Dear “mojo2014samba“  Thank you so much for taking time to share your review regarding your recent stay with us.
