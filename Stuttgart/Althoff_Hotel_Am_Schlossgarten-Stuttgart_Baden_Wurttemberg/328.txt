We stayed at the Schlossgarten last summer and loved it so much, we booked it again this summer.  Hotel has consistently high standards.  Our room was exactly as we thought it would be....clean, functional, beautiful.  Amazing breakfast - we sat outside every morning overlooking the beautiful city park.   Location of the hotel is perfect.  No need for a car, You just can't go wrong with this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 12, 2014Dear London.dreaming,  We appreciate your comments regarding your stay at Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
