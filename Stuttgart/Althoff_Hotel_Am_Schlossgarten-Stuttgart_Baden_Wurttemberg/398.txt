The hotel is next to the shopping district which is connected to the Schlossplatz. It is a 5min to the Schlossplatz and the old part of Stuttgart. The Christmas Market was open which made it great. The hotel staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very clean, and the breakfast is very good. I did not use the hotel restaurant for dinner as I ate in town at Ochs and Willi,(another great review).  The only con is the gym is a couple minute walk. Other than that I would stay here every time I come to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 12, 2012Dear Awayfro,  Thank you so much for the positive review of our hotel.
