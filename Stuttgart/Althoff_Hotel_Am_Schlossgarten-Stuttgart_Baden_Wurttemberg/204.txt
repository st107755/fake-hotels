Location was perfect - easy walk to main train station, main shopping strip and lots of parkland nearly to exercise or relax in.  Food at the restaurant was wonderful. Breakfast seemed slightly overpriced, like most hotels.  My room was on the park side which had lovely views.  The room was very comfortable, clean and good value.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 12, 2016Dear PJYoung1982,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
