Certainly not new, and the rooms are in the old school mode. Decor a little tired but clean and comfortable. Lobby is again tired, but I didn't find it nearly as bad as others have written. And theres no reason to hang around the lobby anyhow.  Staff were professional and helpful. Biggest surprise was the formal restaurant - superb, modern cruisine which ranks up there with the top flight in London, Paris. Breakfast also very good.  It does not have a 'holiday' hotel feel by virtue of its location (opposite the main train station) and age. But as a business hotel, I found it solid and would stay again.
