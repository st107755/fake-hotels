We stayed two nights and were happy with this hotel. It is in a superb location: directly across from the main train station, and next to the park. We were lucky to have a corner room with views of both. It has a Michelin-starred restaurant (that I did not eat at) as well as a casual bar/restaurant with a lot of outdoor seating (I did eat here - totally adequate food, a pleasant atmosphere). Staff extremely cordial. Wifi is not free and neither is parking although at E15 per night it wasn't outrageous - and the hotel overall is a good value for the money. The decor is not to my taste (a bit too heavy) but it was certainly clean and comfortable which are far more important. They put a red rose in the bathroom: a nice touch.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 11, 2012Dear CatPacker,  The entire team wishes to than you for your nice description of your stay with us.
