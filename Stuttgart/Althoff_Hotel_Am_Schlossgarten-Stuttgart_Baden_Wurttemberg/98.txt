I booked this hotel not for price but for its reviews and tbh they didn't falter. The staff make this hotel, Reception, Valet, Bar ALL were very warm and assisting. Maps drawn by the gentleman on the bar for places to eat and drink and the receptionists where excellent even with a free brolly service. Rooms were ok but very clean. Lobby immaculate.  Negative - My only negative point was that the breakfast was 27 euro's each and was VERY expensive for what bit was. Spoilt what was a great weekend a little.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 28, 2017Dear Matthew C,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your wonderful feedback.
