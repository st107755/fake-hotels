After taking 28 hours from Copenhagen to this hotel via Air Berlin, and without our luggage the staff welcomed and helped us with basics. Having missed the first nights prepaid stay due to the delay, they gave us a v nice room. Comfortable, quiet, very clean  hotel, with some old world charm. Do not be deceived busy the average exterior of the building. The location is great with sights, eateries and easy access to the trains makes for an excellent visit. Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 28, 2017Dear Danesuzie,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
