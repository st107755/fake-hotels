Super convenient - right at the train station - so perfect for quick a stop-over. Check-in was a breeze, my Leader's Club membership was noted, and I had a nice gift in my room. They needed a few minutes to ready the room, so I had a voucher for a drink, which I enjoyed in the bar adjacent to the lobby. Check-out, no problem, along with a little treat... at the train platform in no time. I will certainly return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 2, 2013Dear Josanpu,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
