"Am Schlossgarten" is at the best location in Stuttgart - just on top of the KÃ¶nigsstrasse, perfect for shopping - we expected a good service (for that costs....) and we got what we expected. The rooms are perfect clean every time we stay there - no matter if you got the suite or the standard room. Personal is skilled and cover any wish you may have (we traveled first time with a baby). Hotel is just above a car park who is pretty expensive for Germany but ok if you think about the location you are. The dinner at the hotel was good but pricy, better you leave the hotel and go to one of the restaurants in the area. Breakfast is one of it's kind - large buffet with anything you need.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 8, 2012Dear Mr. S.,  Thank you for your warm words regarding your stay with us.
