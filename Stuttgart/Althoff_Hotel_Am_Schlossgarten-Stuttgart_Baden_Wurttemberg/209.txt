Getting to Stuttgart is really easy. The railway station at the airport can be accessed from the terminal building and the train journey is only 25 minutes. Stuttgart Central Station is across the road from the hotel.  Although located by a busy main road, the rooms are quiet. Very high standards of maintenance and cleanliness, as you'd expect from a hotel of this rating, but the prices are not astronomical.   The reception staff speak perfect English, embarrasingly good compared to my German!  Every member of staff we came across was helpful, friendly and genuine - there's a pleasant atmosphere about the place which comes from having a good team.  Food and drink is quite pricey, but the quality is excellent.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 19, 2016Dear John D,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
