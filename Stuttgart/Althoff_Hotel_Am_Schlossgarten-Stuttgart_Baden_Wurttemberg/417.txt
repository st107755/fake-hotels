A hotel in a great location. Right next to the Main Train station and shopping high street. 25mins away from the airport via the S Bahn train. The service at the reception was excellent. We requested a high floor with a nice view, we arrived one hour early and a room was not available that met our request so the Hotel gave us a drinks voucher for the bar whilst our room was prepared. We left our luggage at reception and when the room was ready our luggage was taken to the room. Our room was exceptionally clean and well appointed. Fresh fruit in the room plus turn down service. WIFI was available in room, but there was a charge for this. We did not eat in the hotel as the are so many options in the city center, so can not leave a comment other than the room service breakfast menuâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 13, 2012Dear MrMmrsM,  Thank you very much for finding such nice words to describe your stay with us.
