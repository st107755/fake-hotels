I have stayed one night in one of the Junior Suites. Believe the hotel is far below international 5 star standards and is close to the average business hotel that there are so many near the railway stations in every European city. Ugly building, very standard rooms, lots of mistakes in service. Location is very close to busy shopping street that gets quite unpleasant in the evening. Breakfast is better experience, but again nothing special. No concierge service, just reception assistance. Please note that they charge high fee for WIFI !Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 12, 2014Dear AS71  Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your stay at Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
