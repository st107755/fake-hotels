Agreed, hotel ‚Althoff am Schlossgarten‘ won’t be listed among the latest design hotels but the customer service, attention to details and warmth certainly make up for rooms which are not 21st century style.  Upon arrival, as a guest you are sincerely welcomed, staff makes an effort to remember names and each request is answered with a polite, service-orientated ‘yes’ .  This pleasant experience continues during breakfast: staff will quickly remember your preferences, aims at entertaining also unusual requests and has an excellent service attitude. Enjoying breakfast from the balcony in summer - overlooking the park - is even better ;)  As a ‘home away from home, Althoff am Schlossgarten is my ‘go to’ destination in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from Roving39125537105, Geschäftsführer at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 1, 2019Dear Paul H, Thank you so much for your stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to write such a detailed and wonderful review of your visit.
