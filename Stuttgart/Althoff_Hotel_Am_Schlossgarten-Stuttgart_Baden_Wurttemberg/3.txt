So, where to start? Firstly, our room (a junior suite) was clean and comfortable. Amble parking is available (at a fee). Staff has been really friendly and professional. However, our room is facing the Sky Beach bar, so we have “enjoyed” loud music both nights here. The breakfast is so-so but the price isn’t. The hotel corner of the park is occupied by some unsavory types, so you don’t want to go that way at night. Not sure I will be coming here again.

While I am very pleased to learn that you have enjoyed the room and the services offered, However, I am sorry to read that the restaurant from across the street kept you up at night. I have already contacted the responsible Manager to ensure music is not played so loud in the evening hours.  In regards to your observations about the people in the park, please let me assure you that Stuttgart is a safe environment and the city has taken all necessary measures to ensure no one has to feel uneasy when walking around town.   Thank you again for your feedback and I truly hope that you will give us another chance and return to the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten in the future. We for sure would be thrilled to welcome you back.  Kindest regards and all the best,  Ulrich Schwer Managing Director  Read more
