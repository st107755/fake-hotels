Business trip. One night and arrived late so we did not have dinner or anything. Internet NEVER worked. How can a Leading Hotels of the world, not have working wifi, no backup plan. next morning it still did not work. hum. My room was nice and spacious. It did face the trainstation though. when I went to bed I thought the windows were open as there were alot of noise. But they awere shut. really bad insulation. woke up at 5 am as the city woke up due to the noice level. seriuously questioning that too. had a good breakfast. seemed to be more staff than guests so almost overtended, will try a different hotel next time.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 25, 2014Dear KG_pofok,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten .
