On a recent trip to Stuttgart I stayed again in this nice hotel in the very city centre on the corner of a large park. I had a nice, very quiet room overlooking the park.  The room was well decorated, with a little bit too much dark brown. A quite large working area with quick Wifi and sufficient connectors. The bathroom was well equipped. The personnel is very kind. The hotel restaurant is outstanding. The room rate was ok.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 21, 2015Dear AntonioJulioNegro,  We would like to thank you for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
