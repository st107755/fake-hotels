Very Nice hotel...not old but not new. The fact that rooms are a bit dated is outweighed by the fact that the hotel is well maintained. No better location for downtown...next to subway and shopping is right out the front door. Excellent breakfast and a great staff.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare
