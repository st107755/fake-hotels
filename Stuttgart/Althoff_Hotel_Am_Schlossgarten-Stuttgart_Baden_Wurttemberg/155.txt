I recently stayed here for 2 nights and enjoyed my time.   The staff were very attentive and helpful and gave some great restaurant and advice about the local area. The location of the hotel is very central and made accessing the local sites very easy.   The room was small but typical of a European hotel. It was well appointed and nicely furnished. Had a nice view. The only downside to the stay was the outdated bathroom. It was very clean but in need of a renovation.  All in all I would recommend this hotel!!Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 13, 2017Dear KaiserAbby,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
