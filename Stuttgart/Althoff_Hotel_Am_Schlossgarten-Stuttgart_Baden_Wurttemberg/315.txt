This hotel was recommend to us by the person that arranged our Mercedes European delivery.   We stayed here one night before picking up the auto.  We enjoyed the hotel very much.  They knew it was my wifeâ€™s birthday the next day and provided champagne and a few other goodies.  The room was spacious and modern.  The buffet breakfast was excellent and all of the staff was friendly and helpful.  Would not hesitate to stay here again when in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 12, 2014Dear RacingFan2006,  Thank you so much for your kind review of your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
