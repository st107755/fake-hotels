Location is opposite the hauptbahnhoff in the centre of Stuttgart. Reception was friendly and the staff spoke very good English. Only had the standard room, but this was clean, plenty big enough with views over the park. Room had a good size comfy bed, flat screen TVs with English news channels, hair dryer, desk and a very small safe that an iPad wouldn't fit in. The bathroom was clean, but only had a small shower.  Would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 21, 2014Dear MrMmrsM,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
