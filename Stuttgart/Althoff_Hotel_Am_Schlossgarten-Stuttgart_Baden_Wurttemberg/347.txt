Another last minute decision to stay.  This time with no luggage.  The Receptionist was outstanding.  She found us toothbrushes, toothpaste, deoderant and shaving kit.  Nothing was too much trouble. The room was spotlessly clean and everything else we needed was available.  An exellent nights sleep in a comfortable and quiet room.  The location was perfect for shopping and sightseeing the next day.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 25, 2013Dear Alison P,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
