Not a bad place, relatively clean (but not spotless), comfortable beds, nice shower, decent internet, hitting my Big 4 wants in a hotel, but some major deficiencies.  If you want a shirt ironed, no service provided, but they will provide you with an iron.  But my only real major complaint is the poor functioning Air Conditioning.  Simply, an expensive hotel should figure out something as basic as AC.  Yes it was a hot day, but still not an excuse!  And can there be some sort of exercise room?  Staff was nice and tried hard and the breakfast was well above average!   I would return, this hotel was not a good value proposition.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Geschäftsführer at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 27, 2019Dear d h,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.

At the moment we have a technical failure of one of our compressors, which will be fixed within today. Moreover I am really sorry to read that your experience did not meet your expectations concerning our service. Of course we offer ironing of our guests clothes. I will talk about this issue with our front desk team - something likt this should never happen again. Due to our structural conditions we do not have a fitness room or any SPA facility, but we offer cooperations with some surrounding facilities - just contact our team at the front desk. They are glad to help you.  We all would wish that you will visit us again in future giving us another opportunity to convince you from our service!
