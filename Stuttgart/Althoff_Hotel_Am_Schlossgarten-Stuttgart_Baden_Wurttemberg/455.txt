The Hotel Am Schlossgarten is a small jewel near the train station, the Konigstrasse shopping area, and the beautiful Schlossgarten park. My junior suite did not have much of a view, but I was informed in advance. I opted for the room amenities instead. Very spacious, beautiful bathroom, flat screen tv, comfortable bed and seating area. Offers room service, restaurant, and late night bar. Very accommodating staff, for fee internet. Other reviews nixed the pillows and they are lacking if you prefer a firm pillow.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
