Great service, great food, brilliant location.  From the moment you arrive they are so helpful and cannot do enough for you. The bar and lounge did great drinks and we had food in Vinothek - lovely.   Hopefully we'll be able to come back in slightly warmer weather to sit outside the cafe!  Lovely rooms, very quiet and comfortable. Thank you for a great stay!  Only niggle - wifi is expensive.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 7, 2013Dear kes1981,  Thank you very much for reviewing the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
