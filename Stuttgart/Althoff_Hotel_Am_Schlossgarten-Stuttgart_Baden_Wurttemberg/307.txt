The staff were fantastic, the location is perfect for exploring Stuttgart and the surrounding Christmas Markets (it's right by the central station).  We had a Junior Suite. Great size, comfy bed. Definitely in need to redecorating - especially the bathroom fittings! The fan was also very noisy all through the night.  Overall, I think it was overpriced but we had a great time and the staff and location made up for a rather disappointing room.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 16, 2014Dear Nat2302,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
