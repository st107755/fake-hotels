I stayed here in November for the 4th time, and it is always a pleasure to see so many familiar faces at the Schlossgarten Hotel. Staff is always attentive, helpful and polite, the rooms are good and comfortable (shower is a tad small) and the location in perfect.   Try their cafe next door and enjoy it for breakfast and/or dinner. Staff is knowledgable and helpful. The bar is a good place to enjoy a nightcap. Housekeeping is fast and attentive, but I recommend that you put the "Do Not Disturb" sign on your door if you are staying in your room during the day, as they have a habbit of checking your room several times a day.

I am very happy that we managed to receive full marks this time.  Please let me tell you about our internet station in the lobby you can use free of charge. The EUR 27 flatrate for 24 hours is not Wireless LAN only, it also includes the complete selection of our Pay TV Movies. WLAN only is charged with EUR 15. Certainly you are right when you say this is not cheap as well, but we ask for your understanding that we have to pay our provider, who takes care of the high security requirements of a public network.  We are very happy about your comment and now are looking forward to your fifth stay with the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.  Best regards,  Werner Braun General ManagerRead more
