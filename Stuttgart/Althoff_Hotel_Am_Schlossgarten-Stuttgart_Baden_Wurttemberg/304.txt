a most welcoming staff,allowing us to have early access to our room. First rate comfortable bedroom...quiet at the back of the hotel. There is a nice wine bar attached to the hotel with a good choice of local wines...excellent. Breakfast was expensive ,25euros, but good quality if not value.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 10, 2015Dear kattyukres,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
