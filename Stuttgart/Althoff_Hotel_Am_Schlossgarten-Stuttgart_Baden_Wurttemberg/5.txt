The hotel is a refreshing reflection of both yesterday and today.  Traditional in appearance and comfort.  Modern in convenience and efficiency.

The rooms are small by U.S. standards, but they are comfortably furnished and updated with contemporary amenities.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from Ulrich_Schwer, Geschäftsführer at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 29, 2020Dear William M,  thanks a million for your kind words and wonderful review.
