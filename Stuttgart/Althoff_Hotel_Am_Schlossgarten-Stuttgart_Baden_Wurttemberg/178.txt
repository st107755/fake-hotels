We came at the start of Christmas Market, and it a quick 5 minute stroll to the rear of the hotel.  Thank you to the front desk for the great suggestions on dining and shopping. Our rooms were spacious and relaxing, perfect for our busy days of sightseeing. The breakfast was wonderful! Loved the honeycomb. We will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 27, 2016Dear chris_explorer,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
