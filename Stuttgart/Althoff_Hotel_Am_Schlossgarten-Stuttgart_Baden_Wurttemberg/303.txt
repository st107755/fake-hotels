Wonderful experience from start to finish...with dining in their premier restaurant.  Rooms spacious and a bottle of wine when we walked in!  Front desk very helpful!  A must place to stay and easy walking on the Plaza Mall.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 10, 2015Dear Bayouexec,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such wonderful comments about your stay with us. It made me very proud to read your wonderful review; I will be sure to share your comments with my team and it will be my pleasure to thank them for providing such excellent service to you. It is a motivation for all of us to reach such kind lines.  Our hotel is indeed situated in the center of downtown Stuttgart, hence walking distance to the shopping district (the famous KÃ¶nigstrasse) and the main train station and on the other hand directly next to the park.   Our Executive Chef takes great pride in serving only the best meat and products - nice to read that you were able to enjoy his cooking so much.  We are looking forward to welcoming you back for your next stay in Stuttgart.  Kindest regards, Your Althoff Hotel am SchlossgartenRead more
