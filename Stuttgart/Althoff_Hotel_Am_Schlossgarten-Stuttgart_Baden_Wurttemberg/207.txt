With a friend, we have a very nice rest drinking in the café of this hotel. The place is also soothing in the middle of Stuttgart ! The waitresses and waiters are very nice. I advise to go there if you want to have a milkshake in the afternoon with a nice view on the garden. Moreover the prices are really good.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 1, 2016Dear Jos T,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Café at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
