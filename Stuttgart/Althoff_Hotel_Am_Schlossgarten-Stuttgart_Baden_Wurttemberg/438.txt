I stayed at the hotel for a brief two night stay over the 2012 bank holiday weekend.    It really is an excellent city hotel - the rooms are modern, bright and very large, the food is good and the hotel is very well situated in the city centre, and provides an excellent base for sightseeing (e.g. Mercedes Benz and Porsche museums, etc.)  What really stood out for me was the warmth of all the hotel staff (without exception) - they clearly take a lot of well-deserved pride in their job and it showed itself in their enthusiasm, efficiency and cheerfulness, as well as their willingness to go out of their way to be of assistance.    Very well done!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 11, 2012Dear Peepiceek,  Thank you so much for such positive comments on your stay with us - that is an extra thrust of motivation for our team and gives the power to fill our guests with enthusiasm.
