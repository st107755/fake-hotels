I stayed at this hotel with the recommendation from my son, who now lives in Stuttgart. It was my first visit and the hotel locates at the center of the city. Very convinient for many purposes, including sightseeing and shopping. I stayed during the holiday season, and probably since it was full, some service staff wanted me to go out around 10 o'clock in order to clean the room. Still I will likely stay at this hotel at my next visit. シュッツドガルトに住む息子に勧められ、初めてのシュッツドガルト訪問で滞在。市の中心部に位置し、観光にも買物にも便利です。クリスマス直前だったため満室で、日によって、朝10時に部屋を掃除したいと出かけて欲しがるスタッフもいて、落ち着かない朝もありました。全体的に静かで落ち着いていて、お勧めではありますが、寝間着をお忘れなきよう。Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 8, 2016Dear Canoe40010,  Thank you so much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
