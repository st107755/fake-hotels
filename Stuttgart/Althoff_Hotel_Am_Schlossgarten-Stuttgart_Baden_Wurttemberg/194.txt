First time at this Hotel. 15 minutes from the airport and right across the street from the train station. Very nice room. Great view over the park. The staff were wonderful. The bar has outside seating overlooking the park. Will stay there again next time I am in Stuttgart, Highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Mark F,  Thank your very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your great feedback. It made me very proud to read your wonderful review; I will be sure to share your comments with my team and thank them for making your stay special.  Our hotel is indeed situated in the center of downtown Stuttgart, hence walking distance to the shopping district (the famous KÃ¶nigstrasse), to many cultural highlights and the main train station makes it very easy for our guests to travel to our hotel.  In summertime we serve drinks and cocktails in our outside bar with a beautiful view to the Schlossgarten.  We are looking forward to welcoming you soon back again.  Sincerely, Ulrich Schwer Managing DirectorRead more
