I stayed for two days and it is a very good value for money. Perfectly located near the railway station as well as near to the shopping complex.

The service is good and they speak English.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 26, 2012Dear Sangram_das,  Thank you very much for posting your comments about your stay with us.
