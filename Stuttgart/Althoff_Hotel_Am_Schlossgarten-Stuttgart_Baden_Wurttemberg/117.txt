I am sorry to read that your experiences did not meet your expectations; please allow me to express my sincerest apologies.  Please let me ensure you that the hotel has undergone a complete renovation of all areas including all 106 guest rooms over the past 5 years. We are continously re-renovating areas throughout the hotel and will continue to do so every year.   I am sorry for the bad quality of our Wifi. Please let me tell you that we are already working on it as it is too slow if there are a lot of useres who are using streaming services on differnet devices. We hope we will fix this issue as soon as possible.  We appreciate the time you took to share your concerns, and it is our hope that you will give us the opportunity to better serve you in the future.  Kind regards Ulrich Schwer Managing DirectorRead more
