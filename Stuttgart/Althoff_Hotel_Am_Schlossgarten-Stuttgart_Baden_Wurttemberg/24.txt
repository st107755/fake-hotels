This is one of our favorite hotels ever! The accommodations are absolutely lovely, the location couldn't be better, the hotel restaurant was great, but the front desk team was THE BEST we have ever encountered. We flew from the States and our luggage missed our flight. It was a two day ordeal trying to locate the luggage and have it delivered to the correct hotel. The front desk team was not only helpful, but invested in recovering our luggage, including very long waits on the phone trying to help. They also called ahead to our next hotel in Munich to help recover our prepaid fees, but we were happy to stay one more night at the Althoff anyway.  Thanks again to you all! You are truly wonderful.
