I wanted to pick the best hotel in Stuttgart to stay at and am happy to say I made the right choice.  The bed was very comfortable, breakfast was fantastic, and we felt welcomed and had a great stay.  We stayed here two nights and couldn't have asked for more from the staff.  It is close to all the attractions, close to the train station, and they have a cute terrace to sit out on to have breakfast if you don't want to sit inside.  To get to the train station I discovered that you don't even have to cross the street.  There is an underground path to get you to the other side of the street where the train station is located.  Over all it was a great experience and we would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 7, 2016Dear Europeantraveler0504,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
