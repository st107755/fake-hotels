Never, ever, and no way- to call this hotel a 5-starred lol. We arrived almost at midnight, and cant say, that we were so welcomed, the guy at reception seemed to be wicked. They made us wait for almost an hour to arrange our booking(they couldnt find it). We booked a suite, but didnt look like that: country style bed, wardrobes with scratched broken doors, old bathroom with smell like in hospital...  next morning my amazing impression was full filled with a restaurant. My advice: dont take a table by the window, cause youll be amazed with view: double barber wire looks like ghetto... on top of that, if the weather is not sunny, u unconscionably start thinking about your actual nationality, roots and politic situations in the world😅😅😅🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 1, 2018Dear Centeroftheworld,   thank you very much for taking the time to share the Feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor and for giving us the opportunity to react. We feel deeply sorry for the service gap that you had experienced upon your arrival to the hotel and would like to assure you that we will speak with the respective team internally to avoid such situations in future. Concerning your room I would be pleased to get the opportunity to personally speak with you and can offer only that you might contact me directly on braun@hotelschlossgarten.com  We would also like to clarify that we have no barbed wire around our building, what you had mentioned is wrong and is a simple net to protect the terrace and its guest from the many birds we have in the nearby Schlossgarten park.   I look forward hearing from you soon.  With best regards,   Michael Braun  Hotel Manager Read more
