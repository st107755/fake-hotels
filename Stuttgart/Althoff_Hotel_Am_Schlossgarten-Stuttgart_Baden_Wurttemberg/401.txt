The location of the hotel is perfect (it was the reason, why we chose particularly this place). We stayed for 2 nights in a junior suite for 3 persons. We liked our room a lot, the staff was attentive and polite. Live music at the hotel's bar was very nice. We would like to have the Internet for more reasonable price or for free, though.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 4, 2012Dear mur4a4aya,  Thank you so much for taking the time to write your comment on your stay with us.
