This is truly one of the most distinguished typical German luxury class Hotels around! Solid style with perfect service, nice rooms and a great Breakfast-experience on the sunny garden side! Our firm also hosted a little 30 person event in the 1st floor conference location. Great venue and well serviced drinks and finger food! Hard to find such a witness of the 60s and 70s German Wirtschaftswunder years!Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 28, 2012Dear kklasen,  Let me express our gratitude for the charming description of our hotel and your stay with us.
