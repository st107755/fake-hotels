True 5-star hotel in a fantastic location. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Bell hop service was extremely helpful. We booked two rooms - an Executive and one Superior room.  The Executive room is very small, but cozy and luxurious and has all the amenities of a 5-star hotel. The superior room is much larger. The superior room we were in (room 710) had a beautiful view of the city and park and even had a little balcony. Nespresso coffee machine, mini bar and all necessary toiletries in the bathroom were provided. Turn down service at night. The bar was quiet and comfortable. The service very polite and efficient. Just what we needed after a long day at the Christmas market. I will definitely stay here next time I visit Stuttgart.
