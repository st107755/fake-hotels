The hotel is right across the train station. Modern and clean. The front desk staff is amazing-the British lady was extremely helpful. the room was spacious and clean. We had one mix-up with the extra-bed and before we could complain, the front desk got apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast. Our booking was handled by Ms Mullhauser who promptly replied to our emails. The reception gave me an excellent tip to visit the cigar bar at the hotel next door.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 18, 2016Dear IndianInNYC,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team (especially to the front desk team and Ms Müllhäuser) for providing such an excellent service to you.
