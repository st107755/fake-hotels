We stayed here for 2 nights.   Having arrived early we expected we would need to leave our luggage and head out but no a room was available for us straight away.   Room was comfortable although a little in the small side. Bathroom just had a shower which had plastic doors and a crack in one of them.   Bed a little in the hard side and pillows extremely soft.   Whilst we had a comfortable stay the room was a lower standard than that which I would expect for a leading hotel of the world establishment.   Great location though for our base.
