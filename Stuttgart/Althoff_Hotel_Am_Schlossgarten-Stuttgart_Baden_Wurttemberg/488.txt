This is a very good hotel with excellent acomodation. The room is above average in size but there is something that let me and my wife very surprised:  In the first day, we went to the bathroom and there were a lot of shampoos and others.  We spent these things and in the second day, they putted all again ! ( if you think that we are mad, you are not a constant traveller... I don't know why, but most of the hotels think that the prices are lower in subsequent days of your arrival and don't replace the things that are presented in the first day ) This was the main point ! ( besides the staff and everything )Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare
