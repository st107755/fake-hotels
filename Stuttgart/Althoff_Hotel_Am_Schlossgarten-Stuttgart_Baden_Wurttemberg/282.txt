Quite happy with the hotel. Staff extremely amiable, room spotless and spacious with a nice walk-in closet (we have a king junior suite). True, the towels aren't the fluffiest and there's no tub, only a shower, but the location right on the park is perfect for our needs.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 1, 2015Dear Mrsvanm,  Thank you so much for your kind review of the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
