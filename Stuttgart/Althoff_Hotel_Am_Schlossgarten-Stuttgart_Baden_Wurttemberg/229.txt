At every step of the way, we received excellent service here. The reservation and charges were always correct; the pillows and bedding were all synthetic (as we requested). Our room was on the 6th floor right by the elevator, but we heard no noise from its operation. It was a deluxe room (32 sq. m) and quite comfortable. The service at breakfast was flawless; we could help ourselves to food, or the staff could bring it-the level of availability of service at breakfast is unmatched at most hotels of my experience. The hotel is very near the railroad station. That is very convenient, and there was no noise. We would certainly stay here again on any journey through Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 21, 2016Dear jtp4,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
