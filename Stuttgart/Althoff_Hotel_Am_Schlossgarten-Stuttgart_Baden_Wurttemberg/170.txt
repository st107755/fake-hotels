We can all improve - so 10 should be an aspiration not a destination !  But this hotel sure gets close. Facilities and Service excellent - the latter achieves the challenging balance of professionalism, personalisation and friendliness. Very well done. Room a bit small - would recommend going for larger if available / affordable. Food excellent. Ideal location with secure parking if required.  I'm not easily impressed - but I was here.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 20, 2016Dear MikeN2013,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
