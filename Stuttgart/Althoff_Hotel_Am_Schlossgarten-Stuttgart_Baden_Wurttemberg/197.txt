This hotel is at such a good location in Stuttgart - very easy for subway and train travel but that is not why I love it. There is shopping right around the corner as well as  museums and a great central square to relax and sit in a cafe. The staff here is so helpful and attentive. The rooms are large and comfortable. It is a very good place to stay with family.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 29, 2016Dear 212NYC11th,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
