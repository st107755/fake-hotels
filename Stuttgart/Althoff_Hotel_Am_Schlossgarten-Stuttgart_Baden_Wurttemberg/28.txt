This 5 starts hotel Is perfectly located next to the most comercial street in Stuttgart. It is a medium size hotel . Rooms are classic decorated but very functional al the same time . The bathroom is rather small but fully renovated. The bed is very comfortable and quite. The breakfast is served on a nice atmosphere and offer a large variety of food with excellent service. Reception staff was very nice and helpful at all time . I stayed at room 404 close to the lift but luckily very quiet.
