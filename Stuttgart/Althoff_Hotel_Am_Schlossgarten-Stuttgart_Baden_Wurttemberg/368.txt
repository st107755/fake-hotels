We stayed for a night here a couple of weeks ago. The hotel was absolutely wonderful in every way. The service was wonderful. Our standard room was large and we were lucky enough to get a room with a lovely view of the garden. The room was tasteful and spotlessly cleaned. We had dinner at the hotels Michelin starred restaurant and had an amazing meal. Every member of the staff we encountered was very helpful. I would be very happy to stay here again the next time I visit Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 31, 2013Dear WinnieLyngkaer,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
