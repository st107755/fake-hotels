Went with a group. Well greeted, good size and well equipped room, great breakfast.  Great location, next to main train station, tourist information, shopping street and historical buildings.  Also enjoyed morning walk along the small lake.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 9, 2015Dear BobBobGolden,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
