Perfect, is possibly the only word to describe our experience at this hotel. Right from arriving in front of the hotel until getting back into our valet retrieved car at the end of our stay, we were made to feel special by all of the staff. Hauptbahnhof is across the street with underground access 50 yards from the front if the hotel, the schlossgarten next to the hotel is a nice place for a post dinner wander. If you want to some shopping, the hotel is located at the top of tbe main retail precinct and Schlossplatz only a 10 minute stroll.
