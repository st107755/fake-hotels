Very friendly staff, wonderfull breakfast, staying in such an hotel is really a pleasure. Vinotheka for small meals is very nice. The cafe am Schlosgarten is nice for a short snack. Neighbourhood to the main shopping street is an asset. Similarly for the National Gallery and the Opera.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 26, 2013Dear Rorub,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
