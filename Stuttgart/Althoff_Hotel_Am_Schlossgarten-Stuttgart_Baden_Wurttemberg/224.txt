Right next to/above the train station (and even better, you can't hear the trains), this hotel's location is so useful for anyone who needs to be in central Stuttgart. It was extremely easy to get to direct on a train from the airport. You can also easily walk along the main high street to get to the shops and restaurants etc. The rooms are fairly small but very clean and high quality. There was good wifi throughout. The breakfast was excellent. One night we stopped in the piano bar and had a drink which was also lovely. The service was very good and they printed our train tickets cost-free. We found they had left the heating on the highest setting as it was snowing outside, but this was actually much too hot. Would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 23, 2016Dear_sabinabrimson,  Thank you so much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your winderful feedback on TripAdvisor.
