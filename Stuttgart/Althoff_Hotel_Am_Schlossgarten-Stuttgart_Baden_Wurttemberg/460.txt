This hotel works, excellent greeting in the reception, rooms quite large like the cars. No breakfast included, which is a shame,  Beds are very comfortable,  Clean and tidy is everything,  Feels a bit mecanical,  would love some personal touch, But would stay again, value was good.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
