Got a good deal for a classic room. Hotel a bit old fashioned but very good service. Breakfast very good, but extra 23 euro.

Would stay here again especially if they included free wifi.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 13, 2012Dear GFM_59,  Thank you for your positive comments on your stay with us.
