For business or pleasure, this is a very pleasant hotel. Good amenities, nice staff and a fantastic restaurant. You can have the option of the bar, upstairs restaurant or their terrace restaurant - depending on the weather.  Service was excellent and location great. One could be in the city centre in a few minutes or at the S-Bahn to take the train to/from airport in 3 minutes.  Although this is listed as a '5*' hotel, it doesn't have a pool or fitness room. However, so often I come across hotels that get 'two stars' just having these, but their restaurant and/or rooms don't match the status.  I'd delighted to say that without the obligatory fitness room, this hotel excels in all areas.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 7, 2011Dear AvidIrishReader,  Thank you very much for the comments regarding your stay with us. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.  We really regret that we can provide no pool or more fitness facilities than the jogging path in the park or the Fitness Studio not on property, but in walking distance. Please be assured that we are looking for space for those on property for ages, and are very happy for proposals.  But we are happy that you have enjoyed your stay, and I shared your comments with the entire team, who I am certain is encouraged by your remarks.  We are very much looking forward to your next stay with us.  Sending our best regards,  Werner Braun General ManagerRead more
