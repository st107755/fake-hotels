The location of this hotel is excellent, and I would recommend a room with a garden view, not just for the view but to avoid traffic noise.   The room was large except for the bathroom. However we did have a problem as the air conditioning was switched off. Although the weather was quite cool it was impossible to open the windows more than a few centimetres, presumably for health and safety reasons, and if there was any wind they immediately blew shut. Therefore the room was quite stuffy.  Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and found the reception staff most obliging.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 26, 2014Dear John A,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
