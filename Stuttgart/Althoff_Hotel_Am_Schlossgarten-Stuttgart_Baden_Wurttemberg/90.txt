Stayed here in December as we were visiting the Christmas Market. We arrived early Friday morning and to our pleasant surprise we were able to check in - a big tick already. The room was comfortable, well maintained and had everything we needed.  The location was ideal and it took no more than 10 minutes to walk to the market - we intend to return this year which in itself tells you how good this hotel is. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot review this but if its anything like the rest of the hotel, I am sure it will be fabulous.

As a member of The Leading Hotels of the World, the hotel continuously strives to meet your needs and expectations.  Our hotel is indeed situated in the center of downtown Stuttgart, hence walking distance to the shopping district (the famous KÃ¶nigstrasse), the Christmas market, which starts every year at Wednesday before advent season, and the main train station makes it very easy for our guests to travel to our hotel.  We are looking forward to welcoming you soon back again.  Sincerely Ulrich Schwer Managing DirectorRead more
