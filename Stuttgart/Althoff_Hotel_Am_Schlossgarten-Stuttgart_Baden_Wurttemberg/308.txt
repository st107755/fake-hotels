We had a great stay, all is true, People are top friendly, rate was good and included a very very large and varietal breakfast buffet.  The stay weas pleasant and while the rooms are maybe not top notch brand new renovated, the bathrooms are ok in size and ok modern and the beds are fantastic to sleep in.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 24, 2014Dear FOL1003,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
