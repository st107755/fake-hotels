Well located hotel in the heart of Stuttgart, helpful staff that guided me through the sunday closed city where to go. The breakfast is excellent with fresh honey that you can have a spoon of. Small details made the breakfast outstanding. Quiet rooms and a cozy bar. Will stay again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 4, 2016Dear Andreas N,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
