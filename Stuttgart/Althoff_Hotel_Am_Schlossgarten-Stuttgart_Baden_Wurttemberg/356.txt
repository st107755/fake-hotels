We spent three nights here.  The Summerfest was going on for the week and the music kept us up the first night.  The hotel graciously moved us to a quieter room.  The breakfast is awesome and hostess and staff at restaurant were lovely and welcoming.  The hotel wasn't luxurious for a 5 star but it was comfortable and convenient.  I would stay again and definitely recommend it.  It is located in very easy walking distance to the train and centrally located for easy sightseeing and shopping.  A great place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 12, 2013Dear CAMNYC1,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
