The Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten is my hotel of choice whenever business brings me to Stuttgart, and is perhaps my favorite hotel anywhere. The atmosphere is charming; the amenities are first class; the location is perfect; the food and drink could hardly be better; and, perhaps most importantly, the people are absolutely wonderful. I love staying here -- it is truly a "home away from home."Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 1, 2014Dear JSF53,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
