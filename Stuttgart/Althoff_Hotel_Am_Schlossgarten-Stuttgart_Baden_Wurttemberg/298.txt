Great service and location!  The staff is wonderfully helpful at every turn.  The rooms are nicely sized with comfortable beds.  The showers are quite small, but the rest of the bathroom is well outfitted.  Close access to the main train station.  Great shopping abounds!   Would definitely return & recommend!  Their local dining suggestions were outstanding as well.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 26, 2015Dear mauimeplease,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
