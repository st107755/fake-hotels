Room was nice, but shower was VERY small. It was in a good location near shopping and trains. My room overlooked the large park. The breakfast buffet was a little pricey (26 euros per person) and thought it included with the price of the room to begin with.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear Melody M,  Thank you for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for the time you took to share your feedback. It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.   We agree with you and are very proud of our location, on one hand in the middle of the city center and on the other hand directly next to the park.  Please let me tell you that our Café on the ground level offers an à la carte breakfast every day from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., where the prices are lower than the prices for the breakfast buffet.  Please note that you are more than welcome to call our reservations department directly next time to help you with reserving a room with a bigger bathroom which will meet your expectations.   We are looking forward to hosting you once again in the near future.  Kind regards, Ulrich Schwer Managing DirectorRead more
