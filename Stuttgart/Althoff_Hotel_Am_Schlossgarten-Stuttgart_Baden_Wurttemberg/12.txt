My wife and I stayed at the Am Schlossgarten for 2 nights during our trip around Germany. A very nice hotel with a very helpful staff. If you are arriving by train, it is across the street from Stuttgart HbF. Our room was very clean and roomy. The hotel is in a great location for walking around Stuttgart and there are many good  restaurants within walking distance. For us, a huge bonus was a very modern, clean laundramat right around the corner from the hotelâ€™s front door.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from Roland_Fredersdorf, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 4, 2019Dear Steve,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write this review about your stay I am glad to read that you enjoyed the location and service at our property.
