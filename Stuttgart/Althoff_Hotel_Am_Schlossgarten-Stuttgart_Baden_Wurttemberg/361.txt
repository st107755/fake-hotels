The hotel is perfectly located in the city centre in immediate proximity to the shopping streets, central station, museums. Nevertheless the rooms are quiet, some even looking to a large park; I had booked a standard room but to my pleasure I got an upgrade and a very nice large room. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the breakfast offers excellent choice (the marvelous different sausages!!). I had a very tasteful dinner at the terrace with typical south German cuisine,excellent!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 22, 2013Dear Wolfgang S,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
