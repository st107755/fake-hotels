We were staying in Stuttgart to see a ballet in the Staatstheater. The hotel is perfectly located 5 minutes walk through the park from the theater. Parking was directly underneath the hotel. Our "superior" room was large, comfortable, overlooking the park. Airconditioning didn't function and I couldn't get the WiFi to work. Service was excellent - very friendly and always ready to help. â‚¬24 per person for breakfast is too much, IMHO.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 25, 2014Dear timk43,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
