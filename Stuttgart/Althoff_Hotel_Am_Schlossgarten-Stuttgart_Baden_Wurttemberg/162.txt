Came to Stuttgart for just an overnight stay prior to catching a train the next day. As far as getting to and from the airport, it's super easy and fairly cheap by local train. It's a very short walk from the main train station (haputbahnhof) and right next to the main pedestrian and shopping center. The staff is really great and friendly, and the breakfast is very good. The rooms are nothing special but comfortable. The next time I stop in Stuttgart for any period of time, I plan on staying here again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 30, 2017Dear CLemond,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your great feedback.
