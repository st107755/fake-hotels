I sayed at the Hotel am Schlossgarten last year for several nights.  Very gracious staff, comfortable room, perfect location, and the best breakfast buffet I have had in my frequent trips to Germany.  I have stayed at Le Meridian in Stuttgart several times.  It is a fine hotel, but I much prefer the Hotel am Schlossgarten. My daughter and I are returning to Stuttgart in the latter part ofAugust for several days, and look forward to returning to this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 11, 2012Dear PVSCalifornia,  Thank you for your very nice comments regarding your stay.
