A great spot to stay to do business, rooms are large and clean. Although not modern by any means it is still very comfortable and well situated for business meetings etc. Staff extremely obliging, allowed us to check in at 10am and breakfast buffet was also very good value. I would return again, as location and staff were of a great standardRead moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
