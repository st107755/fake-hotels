It the location that makes staying here special.  Within walking distance to the park, shopping, restaurants and train station.  We were in Stuttgart to visit the Mercedes Benz and Porsche Museums.  Convenient to all points, with underground parking across the street. Nice Breakfast buffet.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 5, 2014Dear chichenuxmal,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
