Located right next to the Stuttgart train stations (both the S-Bahn and the DB).  The location is ideal if you are planning on taking the trains.  Booked through LHW I received a free upgrade and had a nice view.  Stuttgart was warm the week I stayed, but no issues with cooling in the room.  Amenities are a little limited as I don't believe they have a gym/pool, but the park is next door for a run/walk.  Staff was very welcoming and had dinner one night at the bar.  Food was very good, but the bartender's knowledge of craft cocktails was amazing.  He really took the time to make the cocktail perfect.  The bar alone is worth a visitRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 10, 2018Dear Monetthecat,  thank you very much for your positive rating on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to share it with us.
