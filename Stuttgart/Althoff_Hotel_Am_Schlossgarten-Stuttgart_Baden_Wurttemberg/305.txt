Great location in front of the Hauptbanhoff, this hotel feels very warm. LHW are very well taken care (I got a room upgrade on the 9th floor which is definitely worth it). The service at the front desk is excellent with good English speakers which is helpful given my poor German. Breakfast is also very good. Very good hotel for business travellers as well as for a leisure trip.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 4, 2015Dear mmadar,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
