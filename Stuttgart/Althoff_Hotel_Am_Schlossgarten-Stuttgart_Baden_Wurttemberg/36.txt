We visited Stuttgard within March for a short vacations, it is one of the best choice in Stuttgard, the Hotel is clean and quiet and this is bearing in mind it is straight in the downtown. You may enjoy the pedestrian shopping surrounds and the tube station being next to the hotel. The beds are nice, the rooms are clean. No objections to the staff and all ! The only problem may come if you wish to visit the Mercedes or Porsche museums which are not close, but taxi or the tube may be a good option.Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 17, 2019Dear sergea457, thank you very much for your Kind words regarding your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your Review on TripAdvisor.
