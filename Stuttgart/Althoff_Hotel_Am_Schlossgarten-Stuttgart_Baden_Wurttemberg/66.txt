This hotel is one of the few 5 stars in Stuttgart. The room was small (and I found out I had a suite....). Ac very weak, bad wifi and a very small toilet. I would give the maximum points to this hotel if it was a 4 stars. But how did it get 5? If this hotel gets 5 stars, then how many stars should any Peninsula, St. Regis, Four Season and so on get? 10?  I think whomever is giving out stars in Germany is a little loose. That said the hotel is not bad, but donâ€™t expect to find a real 5 stars.

Reading your comments I understand that your main criticism is the hardware of the hotel in terms of the room size, the AC and the WiFi. For this I would like to sincerely apologize and can ensure that we are currently working on upgrading our WiFi Network which should be up an running soon. Due to age of the building and its location we for sure have some restrictions and for sure are not comparable with the flagship properties of any of the brands mentioned in your review. We are constantly upgrading our offerings and  I would be very happy if you could contact me on braun@hotelschlossgarten.com to ensure that you had the correct room category as well as to personally assist you with any future booking. I hope that you will allow us another opportunity to convince you from our services and that we, as many other hotels also, have 5* correctly given. I look forward hearing from you and hopefully will be able to personally apologize for what you experienced.  With kind regards, Michael Braun Hotel Manager  Read more
