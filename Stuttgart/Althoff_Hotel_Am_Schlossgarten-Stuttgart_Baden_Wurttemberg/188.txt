This hotel is conveniently located across from the Central Station. I was given a Superior room with a view to the park. The staff was warm and friendly.  This is the same hotel that Mercedes Benz host their Customers who are visiting.  The amenities is good. The bathroom is provisioned with Penhaligon's shampoo and shower gel from the famous boutique of London. The staff found out that I was celebrating a birthday and sent up a bottle of Riesling! So thoughtful. The area is safe to walk around. I would stay here again. Most definitely.
