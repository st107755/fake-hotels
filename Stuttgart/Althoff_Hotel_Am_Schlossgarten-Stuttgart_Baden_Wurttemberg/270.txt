Stayed here for one night only but the hotel was to my expectations.  The rooms are at a good size, the beds comfortable and the location amazing, close to the train station and within the city center.  Had breakfast and it was way over my expectations, with great service and amazing variety of food.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 27, 2015Dear pinchivida,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
