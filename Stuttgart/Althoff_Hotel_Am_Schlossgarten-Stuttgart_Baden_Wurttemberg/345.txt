We have just returned from visiting Stuttgart Christmas market & stopped at the Am Schlossgarten. The location is excellent, right next to a main walkway full of shops & only 5 minutes walk from the Christmas market. Also very close to the rail station. We stayed in a superior double room which was lovely. Huge bed, we reckoned about 7 ft wide, with a large TV, mini bar & seating area. No kettle, so I was glad I packed my own (being very British). Breakfast in the hotel was good, mainly fruits, breads & yoghurts with options of eggs however you liked. Found the staff more than helpful & everyone was very pleasant. For such a central location, this was a nice quiet hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 9, 2013Dear vera123,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
