First, Hotel Am Schlossgarten has a superb location between/overlooking the park (the Shlossgarten) and the main pedestrian shopping area and outdoor markets. Second, the hotel is relatively small and quiet with fewer than 20 rooms per floor. Third, the room furnishings, bed, linens and towels are first quality and comfortable. Fourth, the food quality of the restaurants is excellent. The cafe restaurant for simple breakfast does not open until 10:00 am--which is a mystery to me--but there area many simple breakfast option in the nearby shopping walkway. Fifth, the staff is excellent by every measure and, if called upon, treat guest requests as they would their own needs.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 31, 2017Dear William M,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
