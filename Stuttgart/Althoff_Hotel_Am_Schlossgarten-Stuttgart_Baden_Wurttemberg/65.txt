We chose this as our base in Stuttgart as we were making a lot of day trips by train  The hotel is perfectly located for this as it is literally across the road from Stuttgart Hbf and at the end of the very long main shopping street. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout. Our room faced the train station which is not the prettiest of views but the room itself was pleasant enough. The bed was super comfy and ensured a really good nights sleep. TV featured mostly German channels although Sky News was available.  There was a mini bar (charged) and a complimentary bottle of water left each day. Turn down service occurred each night   If you want a very central location close to all the action in Stuttgart then this hotel ticks all the boxesRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 17, 2018Dear Steve T, thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten!
