This is a Leading Hotel of the World affiliated structure. The location is really great, just at 5 minutes walk from the city center. The staff was really friendly and the room was nice with the bathroom quiet old. Negative aspect, the continental breakfast was average with really bad cappuccino, certainly not worthing the price.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 29, 2016Dear hugues n,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
