A typically German hotel.Well run,lacking nothing but maybe a little bit dated in parts in the corridors and bedrooms.Clean and friendly though.(Which is more than I can say for Stuttgart which was very dirty and downbeat and was very unimpressive.)        Special mention must be made of the very efficient Gerlinde Otto on the front desk who helped with a boarding pass issue I had.She was brilliant and saved the day.Many thanks.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 16, 2016Dear LordOddie,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
