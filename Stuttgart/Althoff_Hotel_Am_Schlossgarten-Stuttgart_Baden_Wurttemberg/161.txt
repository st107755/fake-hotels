First, Hotel Am Schlossgarten has a superb location between/overlooking the park (the Shlossgarten) and the main pedestrian shopping area and outdoor markets. Second, the hotel is relatively small and quiet with only a dozen or fewer rooms per floor. Third, the room furnishings are first quality and comfortable. Fourth, the food quality of the restaurants is excellent.  The cafe restaurant for simple breakfast does not open until 10:00 am--which is a mystery to me--but there area many simple breakfast option in the nearby shopping walkway. Fifth, the staff is excellent by every measure.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 13, 2017Dear William M,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your great comments.
