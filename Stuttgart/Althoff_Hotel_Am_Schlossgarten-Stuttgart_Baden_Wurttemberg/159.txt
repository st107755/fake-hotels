I always choose this hotel in Stuttgart, even when I have a morning flight out.  Its proximity across the street from the Hauptbanhof, connection to the S-Bahn (directly to the airport), and location on Königstrasse affording access to the best shopping and restaurants in the city make it an obvious choice.  This time, I was placed in one of the smaller rooms, which was still OK.  I wouldn't mind more access to English-speaking TV, such as CNN (Skynews and Bloomberg were all that seemed to be available) and perhaps a movie channel, but this is not a deal breaker.  The breakfast is quite expensive and excellent, but I am normally not in the mood for so much to eat after a good dinner the night before, so I usually just grab something on the street--there are many options.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 13, 2017Dear Paul N,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
