Stayed at the Althoff for 2 nights.  The hotel has a central location just off the main shopping district.  We found the rooms cramped and not as modern as the website would have you believe.  Bathrooms felt dated (yellow square tile, tan walls, etc...) and the double twin comforter on the bed was uncomfortable.  Front desk and bell staff were very friendly and helpful.  Overall, a decent hotel but could use a facelift.
