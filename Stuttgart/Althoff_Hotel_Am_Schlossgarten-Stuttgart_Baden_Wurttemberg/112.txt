The hotel itself is situated conveniently 5minutes walk from the main shopping centre. Good restaurants/bars are all accessible by foot (walking distance 5-10mins). The hotel itself is lovely, with good size rooms and modern amenities. The staff are welcoming and very helpful. We had a room with park view which was beautiful by day however, it should be noted that there are some homeless people in the city and many of them convened in the park directly next to the hotel at night. Staff moved them along quite quickly but two had begun camping outside the entrance doors when we arrived back from a meal out. Overall, for a shopping weekend away a great hotel choice.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed and great review of your visit at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten. It made me very proud to read your wonderful feedback; I will be sure to share your kind lines with my team and thank them for making your stay special.  Our hotel is indeed situated in the center of downtown Stuttgart, hence walking distance to the shopping district (the famous Königstrasse), to many cultural highlights and the main train station opposite of our house makes it very easy for our guests to travel to our hotel.   We are looking forward to welcoming you soon back again.   Sincerely  Ulrich Schwer  Managing DirectorRead more
