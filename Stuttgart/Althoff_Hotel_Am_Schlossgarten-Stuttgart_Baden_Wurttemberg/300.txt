The hotel has the best possible location in Stuttgart. It is few meters from Königstrasse, the main shopping street, very close to the main railwaystation, close to opera and state theatre. In the middle of the city centre but at the same time in a park. Service is excellent, rooms are big. The whole hotel needs to be renovated. Breakfast buffet included everything you could wish. The hotel Cafe is excellent offering some special punch in metal cups.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 1, 2015Dear Olgica J,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor. We are pleased to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.  We agree with you and are very proud of our location, on one hand directly next to the park and on the other hand in the middle of the city center with walking distance to the shopping district, many cultural highlights and to the main train station.  Please let me tell you that our Café on the ground level offers an à la carte breakfast every day from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., where the prices are lower than the prices for the breakfast buffet.  We look forward to hosting you once again in the near future.  Kindest regards, Your Team at the Althoff Hotel am SchlossgartenRead more
