I find this hotel very convenient for its location and facilities, so I keep coming back. Right at the start of the main street, it offers a quick browsing for the city who came even for a day. The staff is helpful and charming and the breakfast is amazing. The heating was not working properly during my visit so I was provided with a small heater which was not quite enough though. Still, I appreciate the efforts of the staff, even though I think this is not acceptable for a five star hotel, especially in Germany.  I'll keep going back no matter what.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 24, 2017Dear dnpsn,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
