Location is perfect, staff is very friendly, rooms are spacious, clean and nicely furnished. Just a very enjoyable stay. We would definitely return next time in Stuttgart! Did not try the restaurant but there are certainly enough of them located around the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 12, 2013Dear Dobarv,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
