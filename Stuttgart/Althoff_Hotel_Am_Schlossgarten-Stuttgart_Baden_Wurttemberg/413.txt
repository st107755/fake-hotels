This is a very well-run hotel. While it is located conveniently close to the train station, it is not negatively impacted by its proximity. It is adjacent to a large park and to the shopping areas. The staff was professional and helpful with our requests for assistance.   Our room #611 was furnished in a traditional style and was very comfortable. The bathroom was lovely, had excellent lighting and was appointed with thick towels, makeup mirror and amenities. The beds were very comfortable and the comforters light and puffy. We enjoyed the complimentary bottles of water each day and the way the bed was turned down at night.   Wifi was available, but we were disappointed that it was not free. We enjoyed good a la carte breakfasts in the cafe rather than at the more pricey buffet.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 9, 2012Dear Mr. or Mrs. turtlez,  Thank you for taking the time to comment your stay with us.
