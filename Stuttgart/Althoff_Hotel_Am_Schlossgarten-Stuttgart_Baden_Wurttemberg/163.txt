With regular business trips to the Stuttgart area over the past 12 months I have stayed at this hotel many times. Only if I can not get a room do I try other hotels but always this is my first choice. Last visit despite a very late arrival (after midnight) staff were still very helpful and attentive as on all other occasions I have checked in and out. Rooms are comfortable and the breakfasts very good unlike many hotels I stay in. Location a very short walk from the main station makes it very good for travel to all companies in the Stuttgart area and further afield and also for the airport (~30 mins) on S-Bahn.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 30, 2017Dear Kitenics,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
