We stayed over the weekend in the Hotel. It is ok but for us not really a Leading Hotel. The rooms to us are seriously old-fashioned and small. Bathrooms ok. Breakfast ok but also rather on the standard side. Big minus - SPA is missing likewise the gym. This is  something would expect from a Leading Hotel and in this category.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 7, 2018Dear McSurf, thank you very much for your rating on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
