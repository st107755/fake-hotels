Is situated just off one of main shopping streets and opposite main train station (Hauptbahnhof). Easy to get to from airport (Flughafen) using S-Bahn S2 or S3, journey time 30 mins and costs 4 Euros. Despite central location rooms are very quiet, air conditioned and spacious (and very reasonably priced for such a quality hotel). There is a large park bordering one side of hotel, offering pleasant walks. Tourist Information is just round the corner. Hotel staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and polite, keeping us well supplied with drinks during the tension of the Deutschland v Italien football match !Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Sadie64,  Thank you so much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to review your stay on TripAdvisor.
