In some respects this hotel is excellent such as the standards reached by the staff who were very friendly and efficient, the location is very central and the decor is also very nice.  The breakfast was quite good quality.  I think there are few things that let this hotel down and is why I have only given the rating I have.  For example we were placed on a smoking floor which just reeks and if it wasn't for the fact the rooms have two doors creating a vacuum we wouldn't have stayed.  I can't believe a five star hotel still allows smoking because of the stink!  The rooms are also very small and far too hot (even with the window open).  The problem with when the windows are left open is the location means it is incredibly noisy with constant sirens and other typical city noisesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 22, 2015Dear Sam H,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
