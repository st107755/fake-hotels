this 5 *hotel combines things that you rarely find in a hotel.it is just 100 meter away from the train station and just few steps from Koenigsstrasse (King's Street)  the central shopping and business street in Stuttgart,and at the same time facing a beautiful garden "the wonderful Schlossgarten".we were fortunate to book a deluxe room that faced the garden,the scene was amazing, you feel as if you are staying in a resort not in the most crowded area. the breakfast also was so tasty concentrating on the quality more than the quantity.I highly recommend this hotel for those visiting stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 15, 2015Dear Mona199,  Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review on your visit to the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
