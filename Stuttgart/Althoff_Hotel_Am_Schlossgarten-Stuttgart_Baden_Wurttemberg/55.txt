The hotel is situated adjacent to the former palace, Schlossgarten, Opera House and the Koeningsallee. Easy walk to the older part pf town, the delightful Markthalle cathedral and main station. The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean but slightly old fashioned.  Very comfortable and roomy, they nevertheless evoke a sense of luxury. Friendly staff and great location make for an overall excellent experience.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 20, 2018Dear SweetnSourKraut,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor!
