Right across the street from the main train station so its very accessible from the Airport and even from other cities in Germany connected by train. It was very easy to find. Also, very close to the city center where all the shopping and restaurants are located. It is perfect for a first timer and a business traveler. However, rooms are very small and the hotel infrastructure is very old. Smoking Rooms are a no go even if you're a smoker you cannot just survive there. The obviously do no deep cleaning there and rooms are too small to get fresh smell anyway.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 8, 2015Dear AhmedElnaggar,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.We agree with you and are very proud of our location - directly next to the park and in the middle of the city center witk walking distance to the shopping district, to many cultural highlights and to the main train station.
