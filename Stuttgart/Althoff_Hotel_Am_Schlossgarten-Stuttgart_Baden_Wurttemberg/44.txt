Stayed in this hotel on a recent business trip to Stuttgart. Great location, just a few minutes walk from the Main Station and also has underground parking next door to the hotel. Large rooms, with flat screen TV and Nespresso type coffee maker. Excellent buffet breakfast with friendly staff. Bar area is good for business meetings. The only negative point, no fitness studio on the premises, hotel has a partnership with an external fitness centre, but we did not have time to check it out. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 20, 2019Dear davlew14,  thank you very much for the Feedback and your positive rating on TripAdvisor after your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
