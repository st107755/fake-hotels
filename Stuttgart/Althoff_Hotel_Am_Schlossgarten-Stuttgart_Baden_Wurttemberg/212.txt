Overall great hotel! The room I had was modern with fast wifi and very quiet considering you are central to everything. Now the best part. All the staff, from the bellman to the reception and the restaurant(both breakfast and dinner) are EXCELLENT. No request was too small and allowing me to speak my terrible German and English was very helpful. Would stay again!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear john C,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
