This is a pleasant hotel, decent rooms although my air con was a pain. Good bar, underground car park with lift access (€18 a day) . Very friendly and efficient staff.  Very good bistro, did not try the Michelin restaurant but it looked good.  €23 for breakfast is steep.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 17, 2013Dear PIHP,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
