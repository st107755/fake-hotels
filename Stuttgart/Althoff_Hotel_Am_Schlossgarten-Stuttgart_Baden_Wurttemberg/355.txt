The quality of accommodations and service at this hotel is second to none. My family travels for leisure at least twice per year. New York, Western Europe, Caribbean, etc. we have never received the quality experience that we get at the Schlossgarten. From the room to food, everything could not be better. The staff are a prime example of what hotel service should be everywhere !!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 12, 2013Dear Eurojimmy13,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
