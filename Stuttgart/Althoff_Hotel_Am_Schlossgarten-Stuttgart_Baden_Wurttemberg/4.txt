Although this hotel is across the street from the train station, you would never known it.  It is very quiet.  And with its location, it is very convenient to the Christmas Market - exit left from  the hotel and take the next left onto the major street which leads you to the markets ( most of which ar past the Neues Schloss and Altes Schloss to Marktplatz).    THe hotel has a very (and I mean very) friendly staff.  On every encounter with the front desk, I was met with a smile and the answer to all my questions.  The bar staff is equally pleasant and helpful.  I found the staff at the hotel to speak better English than some I have encountered in the US.  The room was comfortable with plenty of space (I was a solo traveler).  It was clean and housekeeping made sure of it every day.  The bathroom was clean and tidy - small by US standards, but very adequate for my stay and larger than some other hotels in which I have stayed in Europe.  All in all, I can easily recommend this hotel for whatever your business or pleasure may be in Stuttgart or its environs.  I found the proximity to the train station to be a benefit because I took a day trip to Heidelberg and another to Strasbourg (whose Christmas Market I highly recommend).…Read moreDate of stay: December 2019ValueCleanlinessServiceHelpfulShare Response from Ulrich_Schwer, Geschäftsführer at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 6, 2020Dear JohnKMiamiLakes,  you truly made our day - thanks a million for your wonderful feedback.
