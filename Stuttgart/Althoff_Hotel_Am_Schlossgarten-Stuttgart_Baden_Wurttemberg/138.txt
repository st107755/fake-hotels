We booked our trip with Expedia for 4 nights including flights.  We arrived at the Althoff hotel and check in was quick, we had a corner room on the 6th floor with views to the train station across the road and the park at the back of the hotel.  As this trip was a treat for my birthday the hotel left champagne, fruit and towel art in our room, what a lovely touch - thank you!  The rooms were of a good size and immaculately clean and serviced twice daily, with a turn down service at night.  Bathrobes, slippers and complimentary water in your room.  Staff were friendly and helpful, we also enjoyed drinks in the bar on one evening and the bar tender was very attentive.
