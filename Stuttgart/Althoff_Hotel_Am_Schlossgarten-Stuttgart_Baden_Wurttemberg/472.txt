A great Hotel - located opposite the main train station and beside the Schlosspark. Shops, restaurants all close by. Excellent service, very helpful reception staff. Lovely ,old fashioned room.Well equipped bathroom. We went to visit the Mercedes and Porsche Museums. Both  tours were  in English and they are both most interesting. A lovely city and a great Hotel.
