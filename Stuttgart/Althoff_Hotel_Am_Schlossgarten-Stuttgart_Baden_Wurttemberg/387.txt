We stayed here with my family (2 small children) last summer and found this hotel to be excellent. Wonderful location nearby the railway station and the shopping area. Expecially the staff was very good and very attentive from the first moment we came to the hotel. We can heartily recommend this hotel to families also. We will be definitely back when next time visiting Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 7, 2013Dear NCLFI,  Thank you very much for reviewing the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
