I stayed at Hotel am Schlossgarten for one night on May 21, 2007. The rate was 155,-- Euro without breakfast.   At arrival there was no doorman in charge so I had to carry the luggage on my own (at reception a bell boy was available). As a Leaders Club member I got an upgrade to a deluxe room with seperate foyer and large seating area (no. 517). Fresh fruits, choclate and a bottle of mineral water were complimentary in the room. A shirt was pressed until the next morning (4,50 Euro), shoe shine was complimentary during the night.   I ordered a club sandwich via room service, which was good. A bit annoying was an additional service charge for delivery (3,50 Euro for a regular dish of the room service menu - have you ever paid a pizza delivery service seperately for delivery?).  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2007HelpfulShare
