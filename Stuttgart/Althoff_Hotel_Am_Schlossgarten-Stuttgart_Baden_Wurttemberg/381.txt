The hotel is in the middle of the center. All major spots are in the walking distance. Staff is friendly. We had a dinner in the restaurant which was very delicious. Rooms were very clean and big enough. Only negative thing I can say is the size of the toilets. They could be a bit bigger.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 9, 2013Dear C_360,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
