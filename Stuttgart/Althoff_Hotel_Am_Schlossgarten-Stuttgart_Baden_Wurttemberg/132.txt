Everything about our stay was great but the staff was really amazing, so friendly and helpful, and communication wasn't a problem at all, they all spoke perfect english which was good because I don't speak any German. The lobby bar is nice, very limited selection of wine by the glass but the ones I had were excellent, and the food we had there was good.  We decided to take a taxi from the airport because the hotel entrance wasn't clear in google maps, and as it turns out you really have to watch for it on the right as you pass the train station on your left. We rented a car at the train station, (limited hours of operation) and parked one night at the hotel, easy valet parking at a reasonable price.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 30, 2017Dear Lynn R,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
