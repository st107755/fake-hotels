Stayed at the Althoff for three days in December 2012, for the Christmas markets. The hotel is in a very convienent location, both from the airport and the city center. The rooms are big, and there is a very good range of toiliteries in the bathroom. The robes and slippers are a nice touch too. Breakfast was not included, and I thought priced a little high, however there was an excepitional range of food on offer and all very good quailty. The staff at the reception were very good and knowledable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and if in Stuttgart again would want to stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 4, 2013Dear valued guest,  thank you very much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
