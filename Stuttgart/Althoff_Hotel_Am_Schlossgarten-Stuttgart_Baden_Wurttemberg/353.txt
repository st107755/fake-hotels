We have visited Stuttgart many times but this was our first time staying at the Schlossgarten Hotel.  It felt like home.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful, friendly and warm.  Our room was lovely with a view of the park at the back of the hotel. Location is perfect...just across from the train station.  A highlight was breakfast!  Beautiful buffet - seating choices...outside on the patio or inside with a view.  Lovely. Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 18, 2013Dear London.dreaming,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
