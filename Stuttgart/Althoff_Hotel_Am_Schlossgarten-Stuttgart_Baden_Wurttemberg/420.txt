We stayed with our 3 adult boys (23,22 and 21). Had three rooms. All very clean and comfortable.Staff were very friendly and helpful. If you have a choice, choose park view rooms as the shopping precinct side can be a bit noisy until about midnight. Head to the old town for the restaurants and upmarket shops. The boys liked the Sky Beach on top of the nearby department store (this was the bar causing most of the noise). My wife is an early morning runner and in reception they can give you a map. All in all a good choice for a city break.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 31, 2012Dear HoraceNorthYorkshire,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience of your stay.
