We stayed here for one night upon arrival to Germany and were grateful to have such a large and comfortable room.  The service was good and we enjoyed our drinks in the lounge.  The location was very close (3 minute walk) to the train station which was perfect for hopping on the train to visit the nearby Porsche museum.  It is also walkable to shopping and multiple eating and drinking options.  A great first night of vacation.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 18, 2017Dear juliesullivan27,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
