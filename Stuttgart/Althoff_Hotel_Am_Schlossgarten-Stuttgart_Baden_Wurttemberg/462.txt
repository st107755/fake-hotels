We stayed here on the way to a 3 week trip around Switzerland by rail from Edinburgh.  4 weeks later, i can truthfully say that we did not encounter a hotel with a better restaurant and staff attitude.  The building is a bit of an eyesore, but that's ok when you are inside it.  Our Deluxe Double had a very nice view of the park and was clean and spacious with a good seating area.  The buffet breakfast is expensive at EUR 22, but where isn't.  It was excellent.  The hotel has 3 restaurants, with a bistro-type on the ground floor, Michelin 1 star and Weinstube style upstairs.  We ate in the Weinstube, as we couldn't be bothered with the posher experience, and were fortunate enough to be able to sit outside on the terrace overlooking the park.  Food was really excellent, comingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
