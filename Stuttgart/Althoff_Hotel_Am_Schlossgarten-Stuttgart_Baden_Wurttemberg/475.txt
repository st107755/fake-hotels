The one thing that stands out in favor of the hotel is its location. Right opposite the main railway station and adjacent to the main shopping area and in the city downtown, hard to better. There are also plenty of dining options in the vicinity. The service is pretty decent, nothing that stands out. The room that I stayed in looked straight out of the 70's and requires a serious makeover to make it more comfortable for the business traveler.Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
