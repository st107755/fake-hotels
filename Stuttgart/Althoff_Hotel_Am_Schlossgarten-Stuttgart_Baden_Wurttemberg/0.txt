Stayed here end of August and it was everything that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Room was comfortable and had some nice touches, although you could see where the odd bit of works needs to be done. We had a Park Suite which like all suites is on the top floor. This was the only hotel of the 4 that we stayed at during our trip around the south west that offered full service. No restricted menu in the restaurant, breakfast was one of the best in a very long time. The staff were all ways there, the breakfast crew remembered our name and what we had the day before.  Location is central and ample parking below.Read moreDate of stay: August 2020RoomsCleanlinessService1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Ulrich Schwer, Inhaber at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 7, 2020Dear Draftbear,  thank you so very much for having stayed with us and taking your time to tell us about your experience.
