Stuttgart was our second stop on our four stop Germany road trip.  It's a great place for day trips.  The Am Schlossgarten was amazing.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful. Parking is next to the hotel in an underground garage, 19 Euros  a day.  The valet will get your car for you , same price ( self park/valet ).  Hotel is located across from the train station, for some people that may seem a little noisy.  We had a Junior Suite King Room.  It was rather large for a European hotel room.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 7, 2018Dear rich1donna_123,  thank you very much for your excellent review of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback with us.
