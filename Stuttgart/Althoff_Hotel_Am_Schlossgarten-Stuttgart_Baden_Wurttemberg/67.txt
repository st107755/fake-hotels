We are sad to read that you did not like your stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and have so many critical points to address afterwards whilst I am happy to know that you liked the service provided by our team. Please be sure that I will also discuss your feedback with our culinary team.  We all appreciate your feedback and would like to learn and improve from there! I would be happy if you could contact me on braun@hotelschlossgarten.com   I would like to mention that some parts like the location of the toilets is simply due to the size of the lobby and as you might agree not so easy to change in a building which was built in the late 60`s on the other hand I can guarantee you that everyone and including the management is eager to constantly improve the hardware and the soft skills of the hotel. Many things have been changed over the past years and are planned for the future.   We all aim to learn from our mistakes and hope that you allow us the opportunity and accept my sincere apologies for the service gaps you experienced.  With kind regards, Michael Braun Hotel ManagerRead more
