After I read so many reviews, I decided to stay at this hotel. As the result, I am so happy with it. Located next to big Schloss garden park and the main shopping street. You can easily go shopping or relaxing by walk. In a very safe area not dangerous at all. Super clean and luxury hotel. View from my room. Super!!! Of course, friendly and helpful stuff as well. Will come back again soon.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 21, 2018Dear ILOVETRAVEL2004,  thank you for your excellent rating and the kind review of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten!
