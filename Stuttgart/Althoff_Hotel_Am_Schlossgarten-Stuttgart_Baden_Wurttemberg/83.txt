This is a very fancy, elegant hotel. The rooms are very nicely decorated. The bed is very comfortable. Staff is friendly and ready to answer to any request. The breakfast is great. Includes a selection of french cheeses, german charcuterie and many other options. The only down is the bathrooms. For such fancy hotel, the shower should not wet the whole room.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 30, 2018Dear Luis F, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to share it with us.
