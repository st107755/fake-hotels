Hotel was nice enough. But the staff was AMAZING. The service was just top notch all around, room service, front desk, bell guys...all great. The food was also really good. We did have an issue with the AC one evening which was miserable but they fixed it once made aware of the issue. It's in the heart of all the action so it's a great location.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 24, 2017Dear Jay c, Thank you so much for your kind review of the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
