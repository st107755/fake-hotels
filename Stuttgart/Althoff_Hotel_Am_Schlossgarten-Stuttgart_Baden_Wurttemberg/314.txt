The Althof Hotel in Stuttgart is one of those hotels that you feel sad when you need to check out. The facilities are very good, very well located; in downtown a few meters from the Bahnhof. The service is excellent; everyone is willing to help you with a smile. The room I stayed was very nice, with ample bed, good resting area and excellently designed and furbished bathroom. The breakfast buffet is superb, again with a very fast and smiling service. At the second day the attendant already knew my name. I don't rember of a hotel where the bell boy offers to help you with my luggage until the train platform. Congratulations to the hotel management and staff.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear pingsao,  Thank you very much for your visit at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to review yout stay on TripAdvisor.
