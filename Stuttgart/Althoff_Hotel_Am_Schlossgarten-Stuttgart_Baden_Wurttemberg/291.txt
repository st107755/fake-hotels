Facing a park but very close to the railway station, this is an excellent hotel with matching service. The decor in the rooms is classic with a modern twist. We stayed in a recently decorated room and it was an excellent room. Very quiet and of comfortable size.  Penhalions bathroom amenities add a special note to the bathing experience! The hotel has excellent dining facilities and a popular cafe with wonderful pastries and cakes. Have stayed here multiple times and could recommend this hotel fully.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 27, 2015Dear Johanna O,  Thank you very much for your time to review your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
