We had a very comfortable stay at this super (centrally located)  luxurious hotel .You can reach the hotel via an escalator from the Main station  The check-in process was done in minutes and with a smile ! The room was newly renovated and was big enough for the 3 of us . I was staying in the Schloss garden facing room and was fortunate to be able to see a great view .
