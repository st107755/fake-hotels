This is a very clean hotel.  Rooms are very nice (would recommend to my clients).  The location is great with subway right across the street and outside shopping mall within walking distance.  I will make reservations at this hotel every time I am in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 21, 2016Dear Burlingham,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
