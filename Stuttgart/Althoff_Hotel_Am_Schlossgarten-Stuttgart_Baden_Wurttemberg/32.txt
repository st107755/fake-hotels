We stayed there for 3 nights and found the location to be just sensational It is right next to the main train station which has both  the local and inter city trains The hop on hop off bus operates from the front door and the main shopping area and restaurants are right there as well  It is right next door to a park and our room had  a view over this beautiful area  The rooms are not over spacious but well appointed and comfortable with an old world feeling The staff were most helpful and friendly making your stay there a pleasant experience  We could recommend this venue if you are in Stuttgart  Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 24, 2019Dear robink894,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the positive feedback after your stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
