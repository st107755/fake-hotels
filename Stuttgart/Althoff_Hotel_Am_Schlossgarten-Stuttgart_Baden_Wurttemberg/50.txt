This is our second stay at this hotel with friends. All the staff - Reception, Bell Boy, Bar, Cleaners all make you feel very welcome and are extremely attentive.  We stayed in a Deluxe room this time which is very large, with big bed and lounge area. Bed very comfortable. Coffee machine in room.   Music entertainment in bar in evenings which is a nice touch. Drinks in bar reasonably priced.  We didnâ€™t have breakfast as believe this is very over priced but plenty of cafes around local area.  Location is perfect for Christmas Markets.  Will always stay here when returning.Read moreDate of stay: December 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 12, 2018Dear Beard44,  thank you very much for your excellent review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to share the impressions of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten with fellow travelers around the world.
