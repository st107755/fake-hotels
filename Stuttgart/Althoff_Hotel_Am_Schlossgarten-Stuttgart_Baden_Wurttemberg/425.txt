We were very surprised at how well priced this hotel is.  The room was so spacious with a seperate room for luggage, clothing cupboard, fridge, large very modern bathroom.  Nice to have a lounge suite. Located at the bottom of a 2 mile long shopping mall and across from the station which you can't hear.  Short cab ride to dine at restaurants with the locals.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Easytobook.com Date of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from hotelschlossgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 31, 2012Dear David F,  Thank you very much for the friendly words you have found to describe your stay with us.
