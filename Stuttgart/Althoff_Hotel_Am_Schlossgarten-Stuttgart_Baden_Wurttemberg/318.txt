From the very smooth check-in until the equally smooth check-out, the experience was brilliant. The hotel feels immaculate and certainly better than both The Savoy and Regents Park in London. My room was wonderful, with every detail covered, the bedding was luxurious. My biggest compliment must go to the breakfast, the service and quality was royal. The attention to detail was incredible.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 7, 2014Dear Meggo1709,  First of all I would like to thank you for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
