Lovely place to stay right in the heart of the town. We had a great room on a high floor overlooking the park. When we booked, we mentioned that it was an anniversary stay and by the time we arrived, there were beautiful rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed. Staff were really very pleasant, room was exceptionally clean. Cakes from the coffee shop downstairs - delicious!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jan 21, 2015Dear Jets1978,  Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review of your visit at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten. It made me very proud to read your wonderful review about our rooms and our staff; I will be sure to share your comments with my team and thank them for making your stay so special.  Our hotel is indeed situated in the center of downtown Stuttgart, hence walking distance to the shopping district (the famous KÃ¶nigstrasse) and the neighbourhoog to the main train station makes it very easy for our guests to travel to our hotel.
