Of course the best location in stuttgart, but this is not the only plus for this hotel! Rooms are nice, better to take garden view rooms, the view is just superb! Food is excellent too in the restaurant, apart from decent good breakfast! Service as usual all over in Germany.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 26, 2014Dear NaveenJain65,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
