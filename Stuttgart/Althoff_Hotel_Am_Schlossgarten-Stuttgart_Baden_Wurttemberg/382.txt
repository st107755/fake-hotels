36 hours in Stuttgart the Althoff was a delightful oasis on a weeklong multi-city trip.  Service was excellent, breakfast buffet had more than one could ask for, (and launched a warm, soft pretzel binge. If you live them at the ball park or streets of NYC, German soft pretzels are the creme de le creme- crispy outside, soft inside.) the location is a short walk to quick lunch or neighborhood shopping if you have time.  Oh, and large bathrooms, always welcome.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 2, 2013Dear C O,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
