We have visited every hotel in Stuttgart and without question, the Schlossgarten Hotel is the BEST place to stay. This was our 8th visit there and it has become one of the highlights of our stay in Stuttgart..the people and facility are that great.   For starters, the location is second to none. A couple minute walk to the UBahn(train) and the world famous Konigstrasse. A couple fitness centers within short walk too. A laundry facility is behind the building and open convenient hours.  A major renovation a couple years ago updated the rooms and hotel but kept the old fashioned charm.  Take advantage of the fantastic breakfast. Be sure to ask for a room that faces the park.  Cant say enough good things about this wonderful hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 29, 2013Dear Scott S,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
