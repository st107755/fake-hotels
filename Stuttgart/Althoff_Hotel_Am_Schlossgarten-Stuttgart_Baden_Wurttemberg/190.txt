This hotel is easy to find and close to everything in downtown Stuttgart.  The Hop On - Hop Off bus stop is just across the street, and the main train station is also very close.  We didn't try the hotel restaurant and didn't pay the additional cost for breakfast, so cannot comment on the food service.  However, the hotel desk staff were very kind and helpful.  This is the perfect place to stay for a weekend visit to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 18, 2016Dear KMF123,  Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review on your visit to the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
