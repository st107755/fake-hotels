The hotel is very close to the hbf station.  I arrived around noon but they were able get me a room.  The room is a decent size though the bathroom is a little small.  Not bad for european standards.  Bed was comfortable.  Everything was clean.  I would stay again though it was a bit expensive.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 21, 2017Dear eng333,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
