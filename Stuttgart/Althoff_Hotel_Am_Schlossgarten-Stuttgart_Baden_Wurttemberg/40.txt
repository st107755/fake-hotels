We spent a weekend in Stuttgart in Althoff, which proved to be a good choice. The junior suite we got was reasonably spaced, with walk in closet and large shower although no tube. The furniture is functional but a bit baroque, you rightly sink in the sofa. Good breakfast, good restaurants - one with Michelin Star. No fitness facility at the location - you need to go to their cooperation partner - which is not convenient for us.Read moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 24, 2019Dear A_Baden2014,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
