This is a great hotel for discovering Stuttgart. It's positioned right next to the main shopping/restaurant area. The room was fine and the food also. Easy parking in the large underground garage. On the less positive aspect, we were not allowed to sit outside on the terrace of the bar in spite of the beautiful warm evening weather. No coherent reason was given. There is also no exercise room which is inexcusable for a hotel of this standing. Make sure you get a deal with breakfast included since they charge â‚¬28 per head for the buffet.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 23, 2018Dear Peter C,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor. Whilst we are very pleased to learn that you liked your room as well as the food in the hotel and the overall location we are less happy to learn that you had to experience some service gaps during your stay with us for which I would like to apologize. Please be sure that I have spoken with the team concerning the operation of the outdoor terrace. We also regret that we are unable to offer a gym in house and have therefore teamed up with a health club in the City which we recommend to our guest.  We eagerly work to improve our services over time and hope that you will visit us again soon!  With kind regards,  Michael Braun Hotel ManagerRead more
