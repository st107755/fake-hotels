the hotel is directly in city centre same street as railway station, with shopping just around the corner, very clean and  very comfortable, with very friendly and helpful staff. even though it is on a very busy main road it is very quiet, no noise from outside and the bedrooms have a double door so you don't get any noise from the corridor. excellent breakfast, ate in the bistro in the evening, small menu but the food was good and staff excellent. would definitely stay again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 6, 2017Dear haighsharon,  I truly appreciate you taking the time to write such detailed and wonderful comments about your stay with us; it will be my pleasure to thank the team for providing such an excellent service to you.
