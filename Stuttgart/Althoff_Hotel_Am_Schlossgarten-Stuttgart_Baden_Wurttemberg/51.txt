Stayed at the Althoff - great location for the Christmas markets. The service is fabulous - from front desk to the bar. Lovely hotel, clean rooms. But, what sets this place apart is the service - I cannot praise them more. Great job. Will definitely stay here if we come back!Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 12, 2018Dear DrBoolUSA,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the impressions of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor and for your praising comments.
