I arrived early evening and departed early the next day, so I did not spend much time at the hotel.   My room was very nice and comfortable.    The staff was courteous and helpful.   Breakfast was very good with many choices and nicely presented.    Would return without hesitation.   Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 13, 2017Dear MassTraveler,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
