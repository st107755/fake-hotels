Spent one night at the AM Schlossgarten Stuttgart. We arrived by train and were able to walk underground to the hotel. Great not needing to negotiate busy roads with luggage. That evening there was a wine festival in town so that was just a real treat. The hotel location is just perfect for a short stay in the city as many sights were easily within walking distance. We ate lunch at the hotel and went elsewhere for breakfast and dinner.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Nov 9, 2014Dear Jane P,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
