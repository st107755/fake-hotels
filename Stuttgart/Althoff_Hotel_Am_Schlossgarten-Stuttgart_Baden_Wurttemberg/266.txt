One Word: Fruhstuck!  The best part of the hotel was definitely zie breakfast. I have never seen a spread like that before: cured meats, eggs, juice, salmon, you name it they had it. The terrace overlooking the schlossgarten is a great area to enjoy your food.   Rooms were mediocre, they are a little small but nonetheless clean. This is an extremely pricey hotel so I guess that's okay. Centrally located, close to the main train station and also close to the S-Bahn.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 30, 2015Dear David P,  Thank you very much for reviewing the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
