Stayed for 1 night, staff were lovely, reception desk spoke perfect English and were very helpful. Room was a good standard and had lots of special touches, door from bathroom/entrance to bedroom was a great addition, stopped noise from corridor. Breakfast was lovely, wish I’d had the “to order eggs” had something for everyone and nothing was too much trouble for them. Checkout was easy and well organised as was check in. Great location would recommend hotel for a short break. Central shops and eateries 2 minute walk away.
