I spent a great night in the Althoff Hotel--and it met my expectations of a 4 to 5 star hotel.  The food options available were top notch, and the wine selection was extraordinary.  The room was clean, and had the typical robe and slipper-type amenities.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone willing to pay a typical 4 to 5 star hotel fare, but not for those on a budget.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 23, 2016Dear Maile B,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your great feedback on TripAdvisor.
