This hotel is located very conveniently across the Stuttgart Hbf and at the beginning of Koenig Strasse, the main shopping street in downtown Stuttgart. The rooms are clean, neat and functional and elegantly done. The staff are fairly friendly. The breakfast spread in teh restaurant is good. I'd recommend this for a trip to Stuttgart for its location, mostly business type travelers in teh hotel though.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 19, 2013Dear Jaganr,  Thank you so much for your kind review of the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten.
