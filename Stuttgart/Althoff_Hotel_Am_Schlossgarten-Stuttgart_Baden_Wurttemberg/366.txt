Really nice hotel; courteous wait staff. Good location for local shopping and food. My room was quite large and very clean. The breakfast (which was extra) was delicious. They have a underground garage which was convenient.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 25, 2013Dear Boldtravelor,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
