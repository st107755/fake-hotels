This is one of the two Stuttgart Hotels that Porsche use for their European Delivery Program (the other being the Stiegenberger Graf Zepplin).  The hotel is located just across the street from the main railway station, which is about 1:15 by ICE from Frankfurt airport.   Located next to the Schlossgarten it is a small, comfortable and quiet modern hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, clean a comfortable, I can highly recommend it as a great place to start your European Delivery experience!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 18, 2015Dear LarryCable,  Thank your very much for reviewing your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on Tripadvisor.
