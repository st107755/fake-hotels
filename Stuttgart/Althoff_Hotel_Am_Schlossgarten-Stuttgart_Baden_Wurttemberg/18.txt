Went there with my wife and kids to mainly ago around the mercedes and porche museum and made the right call to go to this fantastic hotel.  A great hotel in all aspect.  ALL the staff were very polite and attentive.  The hotel also dont spare a moment to show hospitality gestures when it comes to room amenities (eg water bottles) and were very kind with the kids.  Very clear the hotel has smart management team. We loved the breakfast terrace and the coffee shop at the garden. The location is second to none...on the koeing strassa (excuse my German!) which makes convenient for lunches, cafes and dinner.  If you want to feel home when you are in Stuttgart,  make sure you go to Althoff ASG hotel!
