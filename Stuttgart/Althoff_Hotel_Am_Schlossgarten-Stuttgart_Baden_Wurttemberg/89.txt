This is a 3 star hotel. Definitely not a 5-star or luxurious hotel. That said, the staff are friendly and helpful. Very close to shops. Not many restaurants nearby. We were meant to stay here for 3 nights but could not bear to stay another night. It is rather old and dusty.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Feb 5, 2018Dear pheweet139,  thank you for taking the time to share the Feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
