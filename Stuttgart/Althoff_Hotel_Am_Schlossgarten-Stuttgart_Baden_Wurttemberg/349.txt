Rooms are very modern and quiet. The breakfast buffet is excellent as is the service.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 10, 2013Dear tbschrader,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
