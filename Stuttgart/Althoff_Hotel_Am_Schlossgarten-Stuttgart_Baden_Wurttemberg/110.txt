I stayed at this hotel at the end of a business trip in the region. I selected it due to its proximity to the main railway station. But it was much more than just a station hotel. Elegant with comfortable rooms and beds. And a super friendly staff. It is also situated on a lovely park - perfect for running or strolling. The only real downside is the wifi; it was horrible. Almost impossible to connect to and once you did connect, it was painfully slow. This needs to be improved!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Geschäftsführer at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 21, 2017Dear GroteAppel,  I would like to thank you for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for the time you took to share your feedback.
