Don't go there if you expect fresh and contemporary design. Decoration is very very classic, not particularly entertaining, but staff was nice and room was large and well-furnished (although I believe I was upgraded, so a normal room will be smaller). Bathroom a bit small, and again, not very modern and attractive. However, very good location and a decent price.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jun 25, 2013Dear Mans25  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
