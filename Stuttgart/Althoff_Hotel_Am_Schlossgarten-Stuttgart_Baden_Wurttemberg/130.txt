Great location steps from the main train station. Super handy if you take the train from Munich. If you drive, parking is $19 euro a night. We don't stay at 5 star normally but this was an Expedia booking, so it was a better deal.   Older style hotel with large rooms. Staff takes the right steps to make you feel welcome and at home. Beds have nice comforters with firm mattresses. We hadn't checked the hotel out as we are only here for two nights and rushing around to see the Mercedes Benz and Porsche Museums. But am sure they are well appointed. They have buffet breakfast for $27 euro which we read is good but my wife and I don't eat much in the morning so we didn't try.   There are so many places to eat around the hotel if you don't want to travel far but we like to eat atâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 17, 2017Dear Jason K,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your great feedback.
