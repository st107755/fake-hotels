We had a suite with a balcony. The balcony was very small, needed renovations. There was no bellman at arrival, we had to take care of our luggage.

All in all just ok, very old fashioned style.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 10, 2018Dear HDus413,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
