We stayed here with the Mercedes "Personal Collection" package and the upgrade was well worth it. Hotel couldn't be more suitably located for gardens, shopping and station and only 4 stops on public transport to get to the mineral baths.  Staff were very helpful and food was superb, room spacious and well appointed.  Attention to every detail.  Dinner and breakfast were both superb.  Having read some of the reviews I was a bit dubious but I think the hotel must have had a refurb since they were written. Would definitely choose this hotel again.
