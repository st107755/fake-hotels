We have just completed a 3 day stay at the Althoff and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is situated opposite the station, and adjoins the main shopping street. Itâ€™s close to all the main attractions in central Stuttgart. The staff were friendly and welcoming, the rooms were spacious and light and immaculately clean, and the bed firm but comfortable. We had a Nespresso machine in our room for that early morning caffeine fix. The bathroom was roomy, with a shower over the bath and plenty of large towels. There were robes and slippers for both of us. All staff members spoke good English, which helped to compensate for my poor German. We can thoroughly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded May 29, 2018Dear John G, thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us on TripAdvisor.
