This is a stylish hotel with clean comfortable rooms and just across from the central train station. After a long overnight flight and a train ride, we were grateful for the proximity. The upside is also the downside, as there’s a goodly homeless population surrounding the hotel. This isn’t usually a problem for me, but the community was lively and made a lot of noise into the evening. We were unable to sleep with a window open.  The restaurant is terrific and they do one of the best breakfasts I’ve had at a hotel.  Bed was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was nicely appointed and had everything we needed.  The staff were also very friendly and helpful.
