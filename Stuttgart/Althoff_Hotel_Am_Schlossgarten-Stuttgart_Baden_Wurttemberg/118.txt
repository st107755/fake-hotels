Althoff in Germany are recognized for their association with signature chefs and Michelin quality dining experience, alas this one in Stuttgart was is not one of those hotels. The hotel was clean and presentable, but not quite the luxury a "5 star" is suppose to provide. The rooms were very dated with the hotel lobby not particularly inspiring. From what I'm told there really isn't any other great options if you want to stay in the city. For business trips it is fine, but not recommended for vacations or anything romantic.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 22, 2017Dear w0rldtraverller,  Thank you for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
