The title says it all.  The staff was fantastic and the room very clean.  The rooms A/C was terrible.   I when to another room that was offered but I did not notice any difference with temperature.  Staff did bring us an oscillating fan which helped to a degree.  The hotel did have a slight excuse since it was during a major heat wave however since the hotel claims itself to be one of the finest in Stuttgart I expect A/C that would lower the room temperature lower than 27 degrees C.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Jul 27, 2015Dear JPatek,  Thank your very much for your visit at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for the time you took to review your stay.
