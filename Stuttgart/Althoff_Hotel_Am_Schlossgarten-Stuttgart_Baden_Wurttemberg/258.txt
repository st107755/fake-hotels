I travel for business A LOT, and these rooms are very very small. It is a busy place, so hard to feel the service is personalized. Breakfast waiters and front desk staff, pretty great though. I did have room service dinner, and though NO PLACE to put it, was fantastic!  There needs to be a better option in town.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear freedatravel74,  Thank your very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel a Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback.
