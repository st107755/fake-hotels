We stayed here for 3 nights and found it a very good hotel with friendly service. There are a number of of very positive things about the hotel: - the location, right in the centre next to the Tourist Information and opposite the train station but next to a big park with beautiful views. The main shopping street is just around the corner. - the hotel is child friendly, we investigated a number of hotels but this was the only one willing to add to 2 beds to our room (it was a junior suite). - there are lots of options to eat, it's even possible to skip the buffet breakfast and have it in the cafe which usually works out cheaper. - the hotel is very comfortable with a certain sophisticated charm - it's not trendy but the basics are right.Read moreDate of stay: February 2010HelpfulShare
