Location in perfect, just opposite Hbf, on the edge of the central shopping area.  Hotel is luxurious, as you'd expect for this cost.  However the hotel told us:  1.  There are no fitness/leisure facilities included 2.  Tea/coffee making facilities in the room are limited to a specific type of coffee.  If you want decaffeinated coffee or any sort of tea, you have to pay for room service.  A further issue we faced was that the room door didn't shut tightly.  This wasn't too unexpected due to the age of the building.  But it did annoy us that the door would keep banging during the night because of air movement in the corridor.  In hindsight I think I should have booked at the Park InnRead moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 24, 2019Dear Mark D,  thank you very much for taking the time to share the feedback of your most recent stay with us at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor and for your critical words. It is correct that we do not have a gym on site but have a partnership with a local gym not far away from the Hotel. Also, we are more than happy to provide capsules of decaffeinated coffee with no extra charges. Tea or herbal infusions, you are right are at extra charges. As you rightfully say, due to the Age of the building we face at time such challenges but will definetly look into this as we are always upgrading the product as well as we do soft refurbishments.   We all hope you will visit us again in future!  With best regards, Michael Braun Hotel Manager Read more
