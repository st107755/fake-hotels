The hotel was perfect for a city break.  Very convenient for the main station and U-Bahn, the opera house and theatre.  The main shopping street is close by as is the park and pretty lake.  A very enjoyable stay with lovely breakfasts and a choice of restaurants within the hotel.  All members of staff were efficient and very friendly.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from Ulrich_Schwer, Geschäftsführer at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Dec 22, 2019Dear V W,  thank you so very much for your feedback.
