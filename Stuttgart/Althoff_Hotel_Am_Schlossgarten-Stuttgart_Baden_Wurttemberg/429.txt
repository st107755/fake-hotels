This is an excellent hotel very close to the train station and the main shopping areas of Stuttgart. Very easy to get to from the airport by public transport. We had a suite and it was excellent, and very good value. Beds were a bit soft but wide selection of pillows available. The staff were all very friendly and helpful - happily listening to my phone when I had bought a German Sim and needed to activate it and get the data package activated. The one bad point was that I was activating a local data package on my phone because of the charge for internet access made by the hotel. Overall a really good place to stay and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Check the offers online and possible upgrades by checking in with Foursquare.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 16, 2012Dear GrahamP81,  Thank you for finding such nice words to describe your stay with us.
