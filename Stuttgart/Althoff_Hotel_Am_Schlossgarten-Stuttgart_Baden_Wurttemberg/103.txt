We booked a deluxe king room. Our car was valet parked when we arrived. We found the reception staff friendly & gave us good service, showing us everything in our room. The room was nice  but smallish, a good bathroom but again smallish but it had a separate shower unit. There was a small safe,  really only for things like passport, mini fridge, & free wifi for all devices. The wifi however was terrible it kept dropping out & needing to be reconnected, once connected it was very very slow. We chose to eat in our room one evening & the  room service was very good although not much room for things to be set up. Breakfast cost  â‚¬29pp. The hotel is situated within walking distance from the shopping centre & places like Schlossplatz. Overall we enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffHotelGroup, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Oct 18, 2017Dear sm05060,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on Tripadvisor.
