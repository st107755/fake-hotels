We were on the mercedes experience and the hotel was brilliant. The best i have ever stayed in! The breakfast was something special and both of the resturants were lovely. I would completely disagree with all of the reviews on this hotel and would only think that they are a rival hotel looking to get more busineess. After reading the negative reveiw on this site i was apprehensive about going however the "dead animals" comment raised concerns on the run up to the stay but was an unfounded concern. The airline lost our luggage and the hotel did all that they could for us and stayed in contact with us until the items were returned to us. I would like to thank the staff and also recommend this to anyone going to stuttgart. Read moreDate of stay: December 2005HelpfulShare
