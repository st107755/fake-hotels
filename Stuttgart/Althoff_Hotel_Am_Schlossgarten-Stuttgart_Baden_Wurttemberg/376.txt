First time to stay here, but what i can say is "perfect" stay during my trip for 2 nights here.  Location is the best for this hotel, just attached to shopping street of Stuttgart and opposite to Hbf; so very convenient for everything.  Service is superb.  Room is very nice and bed is very comfortable.  One of the best hotel during my trip in Germany.  Would love to go back again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Apr 22, 2013Dear Visitlimp,  Thank you very much for your stay at the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
