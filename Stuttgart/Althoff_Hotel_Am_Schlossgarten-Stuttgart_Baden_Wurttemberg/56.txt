It is located between a park and the shopping district. My room looked over the park. The bed was comfortable and I had a little sitting area.  We had drinks in the lobby bar, nice setting overlooking the park.  The bathroom very small, but had everything you need. The breakfast is very good. I was tired the first night and ordered room service. A panini and a very fresh salad hit the spot. They have a fantastic 1 Star restaurant that is divine.
