A modernized old building.....decent hotel....nothing special!  Overpriced!  Clean room and very nice bathroom. Very bad restaurant, not so good breakfast! The staff was really sweet and helpful and the location is perfect! Overall not bad, but not my choice if I ever visit Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Aug 12, 2013Dear IZABELA S,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
