Pros: -Cozy room with a very comfortable bed  -Bathroom well appointed -Bedroom door cancels out all noise -Breakfast Buffet was superb -Staff very friendly and accommodating. -Great location-easy to walk through the downtown area  Cons: -During the week, downtown Stuttgart is a ghost town after 8pm.Read moreDate of stay: January 20131 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from AlthoffSchl0ssgarten, Manager at Althoff Hotel Am SchlossgartenResponded Mar 18, 2013Dear Needtohitlotto,  Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Althoff Hotel am Schlossgarten on TripAdvisor.
