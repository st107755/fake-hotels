Please allow me to express my sincerest apologies for the problems you have encountered.  I have been in personal contact with city authorities in regards to the situation in the Schlossgarten park. There have already been several meetings and workgroups with the Mayor's office and other local authorities to adress the issue.  We have seen lots of improvements over the last couple of weeks since the meetings started.  In regards to your other observations, please let me ensure you that the hotel has undergone a complete renovation of all areas including all 106 guest rooms over the past 5 years. We are continously re-renovating areas throughout the hotel and will continue to do so every year.    I am very sorry to not have personally been around during your stay so that I could have adressed your concerns right there and then.  I would like to thank you for your constructive feedback which I will take as an opportunity to continuously improve our service and product.  Sincerely,  Ulrich Schwer General ManagerRead more
