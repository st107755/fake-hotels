We recently stayed with Steigenberger and were happy with our choice. From the start  checking in at the reception desk, speaking with Ron, we were greeted with a warm welcome and filled in on details. Ron was very informative and knowledgable. We appreciated his excellent English and advice. We were delighted with the location and quiet soundproofing of the windows. The layout of the room couldn't be better with room for someone to read while someone sleep. A couple of chairs and small table to sit if you eat in for the evening. Using the underground public transport, walking to restaurants or grocery extremely convenient. Breakfast one of the best we had.
