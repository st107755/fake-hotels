We recently returned to this hotel having been there on a number of occasions, but the standard has dropped since our last visit.  The rooms were uninspiring, small and no internet connection.  The towels and the robes were old, washed out and thin and my husband contracted athletes foot from the shower.  Definitely not 5 star.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 20, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for having chosen our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin for your visit to Stuttgart.  We are sorry to hear that we were not able to convince you of our product this time. It is always very helpful for us receiving as much details as possible to be able to work on the mentioned points if possible already during your stay. Internet connectivity was for example recently increased, therefore there might have been a problem as well with the device. Our technicians or receptionists are always more than happy to be at your service to solve any challenges.  We very much hope, that you will give us another possibility to welcoming you back in order to positively surprise you again.  With kind regards,   Spiridon Sarantopoulos General ManagerRead more
