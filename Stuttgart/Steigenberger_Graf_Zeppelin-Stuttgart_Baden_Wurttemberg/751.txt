This hotel was booked for us by Mercedes-Benz when we picked up a car in Germany. As you would expect, it was a top-drawer hotel. The staff were all amazingly helpful, from the front desk to the porter that urged us to get a short taxi ride to the M-B museum nearby (he was right!). The room was spacious with a comfortable King bed. Unfortunately, the gourmet restaurant was closed for remodeling but the other restaurant was very good & featured local dishes.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the wonderful breakfast this hotel served. From a plethora of juice choices to scrambled eggs to muesli with a variety of nuts & seeds. It was excellent. Also close to a pedestrian shopping street.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 31, 2013Dear Kathryn and Terry  Thank you very much for the great review and recommendation to other travelers!
