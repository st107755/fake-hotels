We stayed for five nights with our two children (8 and 3). We opted for a larger room which proved to be well worth the money - a huge area with a giant sofa bed and walk in wardrobe.  The staff were all first class, especially at breakfast. The food at breakfast was fresh and delicious. The home bakes specialty breads were fantastic as were the croissants and scrambled eggs.  We ate in zeppelinos one evening and were again impressed. They were also great with the kids and split the burger beautifully for the kids without me even needing to ask.  The pool was a great addition and was really useful for knackering the kids out - not sure the other guests appreciated our noisy kids though.  A great central location, super clean, great staff and delicious food. Well worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 26, 2019Dear esteemed guest, what a great review of your stay with us - thank you so much!
