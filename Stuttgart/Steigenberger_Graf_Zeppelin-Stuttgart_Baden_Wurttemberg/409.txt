Check in was fast, and staff were very friendly. The room was clean except for two stains on the carpet by the door. Disappointed that there was no coffee pot or complimentary coffee. No ironing board. Very sparse bathroom amenities. Bath towels were low quality and worn out. The room was facing the central courtyard and very quiet.  The bed was very comfortable. I learned a valuable lesson - if you want your room cleaned properly leave a tip EVERY DAY. It was a mistake I'll never make again. Would I go back to this hotel again? Yes, I would.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
