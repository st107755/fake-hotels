Not an especially cheap hotel, the Graf Zeppelin has the advantage of being right at Stuttgart central station.  It is also only a 5 minute walk from the "action" in the centre of the city, which during my stay seemed incredibly bustling and energetic.  It is an extremely comfortable hotel with excellent rooms and service overall.  It has two restaurants open over summer - one very pricey and Zeppelinos which is more moderately priced.  All the service staff were in my experience charming and accommodating.  I would definitely stay again.
