Extremely pleased with the Graf Zeppelin. Very efficient front desk personnel who had a room available for us upon our 8:30 am arrival from an overseas flight and even upgraded our reservation.  Rooms are spacious, very clean with nice bath.  The staff were very proficient with directions, maps, train schedules, restaurant recommendations, all done with a smile. Nice business travelers gym and very nice Spa. Surprisingly good Mediterranean restaurant in the hotel, Zeppelinos.  Friendly lobby bar. Great location across from the train station. All around one of the best city centre European hotels.
