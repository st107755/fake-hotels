The Graf Zeppelin is located in the heart of Stuttgart across from the train station. I found this to be very convenient since my wife and I arrived via the TGV. We stayed one night because we were doing the Mercedes European Delivery. The staff upgraded our room to a junior suite, which was a large modern room.

Best regards,   Spiridon Sarantopoulos General ManagerRead more
