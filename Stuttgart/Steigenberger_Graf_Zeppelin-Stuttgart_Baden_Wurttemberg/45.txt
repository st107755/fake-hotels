We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your overall stay at our hotel. The inconveniences according to the room service we truly commiserate. Please rest assured that we will use your valuable feedback to check on our quality standards. In relation to the use of our hotel facilities (the Zeppelin Day Spa and fitness area) after check out we hope for your understanding that due to insurance reasons we are no longer liable for anyone who is not one of our guests anymore. So we offer our checked out guests the use of our spa area for an entry fee as the insurance will be valid with the closure of a new "contract". It would be a pleasure to welcoming you back during your next visit to Stuttgart to positively surprise you. With best regards Melanie Domin Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinRead more
