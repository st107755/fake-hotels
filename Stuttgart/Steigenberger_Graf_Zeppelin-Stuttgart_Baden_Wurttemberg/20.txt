We wanted a quality hotel for a whole week with good transport links in Stuttgart and really pleased with our choice.  With quick access to S and U bahn services we were able to achieve many trips with ease. The view from the room wa not the best - but then it was mainly got sleeping.  Great breakfasts served by a good team of waitresses.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 19, 2019Dear William,   thank you for your excellent rating and your recommendation of Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin to other travelers.
