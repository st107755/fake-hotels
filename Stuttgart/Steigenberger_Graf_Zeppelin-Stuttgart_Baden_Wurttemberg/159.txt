We booked the junior suite for 3 nights, very comfortable room and extremely well designed. Room service efficient. For the price one would expect the bottled water to be replaced each day rather than just on arrival. Hotel location excellent for the shops and main train station. On a busy road but well sound proofed. Reception staff friendly but clueless on car rentals or recommending restaurants. Management need to sort out the cleaners who knock from an early hour even on the last day when they should be told when the client has vacated.
