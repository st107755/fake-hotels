A regular visitor to Stuttgart my most recent visits have been better than usual due to the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin. A lovely place to call home for a few days or a few weeks, its a great venue with great rooms  and facilities in a great location. The little extra we spent was probably saved on taxi's and its always a welcoming place to come home to. Never had a bad stay.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 4, 2017Dear guest,  We are very pleased that you have felt comfortable again with us and always like to come to Stuttgart.
