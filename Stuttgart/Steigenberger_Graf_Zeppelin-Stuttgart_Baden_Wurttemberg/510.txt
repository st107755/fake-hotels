Perhaps a little more than expensive than average but definitely justified. Nice staff which was helpful when my booking was incorrect (thanks Julia!!!). Clean and modern. Location perfect with shops and restaurants. In front of train station. Spa on 5th floor (best floor I guess). Would happily come back. No hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Mar 27, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
