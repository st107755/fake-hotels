We spend a day in the Spa. The pool and sauna where small and not even petfectly clean. At the cosmetic in the spa the responsible staff acted bored and was not interested in the customers at all. Even though it is an expensive house they do not invest in qualified staff. Very dissappointing.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 14, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback.
