This is very good busienss hotel. Superbly located right opposite the main train station and near the lower end of Königsstrasse.   It has a day spa, pool and gym. We did not try them, but they looked impressive.   Plenty of in house restaurants too; Zeppelino’s was very good.   Rooms really good; we got a great junior suite, room 312. Very spacious. Our good deal might have been the result of me mentioning I worked there years ago.   All the older hotels around will not have a better value for money. Only Motel One, a block up suggested some promise and the same proximity to station.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 23, 2018Dear esteemed guest, thank you so much for your great feedback!
