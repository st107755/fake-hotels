Standard issue old style European hotel, but with lots of hot water!  Conveniently located on the west side of the hauptbahnhoff it is within walking distance of everything central to Stuttgart.  Like a lot of central European hotels, the a/c is on the light duty side so during hot weather things get a bit warm.  My only real complaint about our stay was the "free internet".  Not even close to being usable.  Capped at 1Mbps you have to pay an extra eight Euros a day for the "premium" service.  It is also a bit pricey for what you get.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
