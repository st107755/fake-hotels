Hotel is facing the Main train station and just around the corner of main shopping street. Although it seems to be an old building this hotel is for sure a pure 5-* hotel. Nice pool, generous breakfast buffet with nice view and our King size room was spacious and modern, facing the courtyard. Perfect hotel for business and leisure, very friendly staff. Property has own parking garage.  We had a good deal with Stuttgart Tourism Office which is located at the beginning of main shopping street.Read moreHelpfulShare
