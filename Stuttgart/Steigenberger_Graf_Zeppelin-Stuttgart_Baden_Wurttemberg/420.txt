We are in the south of Germany and this hotel reflects it. Slightly conservative, slightly old fasioned. But overall a very high quality, be it meals, room service, rooms themselves and staff. Staff is discreet, friendly and utterly serviceminded. This combined with the very central location and the reasonable price level (the quality considered) makes this hotel essential for business or high quality travel. I have been here before, and look forward to next time.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 29, 2016DearMr. Messmann,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
