Hotel is very nice. Room was good, though bathroom was a little smelly. The room could do with some tea/coffee facilities.  Shower is in the bath...probably expected better for such a nice hotel. Service was very good, polite and very friendly.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 1, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
