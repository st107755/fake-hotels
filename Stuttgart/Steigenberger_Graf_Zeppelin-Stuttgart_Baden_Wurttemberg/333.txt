Spent three nights at the hotel on a trip to visit the Christmas market. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. The room was well appointed but I was disturbed by a halogen spot light outside the window that shone all night and made the room very light. The staff found us another room the next day and upgraded us too. We didn't eat in the hotel but we did use the pool and sauna which were lovely. I would definitely visit again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
