I left my wallet with the hotel and called them to check.  First they told me they could not find it.  Only after I told them I need to report this to police, they miraculously found it.  As there are some important IDs in it, I told them to send it back using the faster method available and I will pay for all expenses (even send them an authorization form for the charges).  Not sure if they do not understand me or what but they send using a method that will take 3 weeks to arrived when there are faster services that took 5 days.  There are also other issues that I will not highlight in this review but overall service is NON EXISTENCE!!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 5, 2019 Dear Mr. bartman76,  Thank you very much for choosing Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin and for taking the time to provide your feedback.
