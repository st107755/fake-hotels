We stayed for one night before picking up our car at the Porsche factory. Both Porsche and Mercedes use this hotel for their european delivery program. The hotel is very well located in front of the train station and walking distance to the major attractions. I was not expecting much from central Stuttgart and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is a high standard business travel level with an attractive lobby, and large clean and modern rooms. The breakfast is great and the staff was very helpful with directions and advice. I travel a  lot for business, and this is a good one.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
