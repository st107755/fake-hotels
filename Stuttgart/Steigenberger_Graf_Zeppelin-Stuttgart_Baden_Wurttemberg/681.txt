We've just spent two nights in Stuttgart at the Graf Zeppelin and have no hesitation in recommending it as a very good place to stay.  We had a deluxe room on the second floor which was spacious and immaculately clean.  Lovely big bathroom with bath and separate shower. The check in staff were very courteous and friendly, as were the staff at breakfast and also in Zeppolino's restaurant (nice food too). The hotel is opposite the central train station so extremely convenient. It is also a quick walk round the corner into the main shopping area and up to the rather lovely central square. Stuttgart is a vibrant, lively city with an historic heart.  The museum in the old castle is worth a visit, and definitely take a look at the historic market hall.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 29, 2014Dear Sara,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the lovely compliments concerning your stay with us.
