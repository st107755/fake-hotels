We stayed in the Steigenberger in Leipzig and here in Stuttgart. The hotel is very nice, the bed so comfortable, and the bath products lovely. Reyes, the concierge, took great care of us here. The hotel is located in an area that is convenient to shopping and sight seeing.Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 31, 2018Dear esteemed guest, thank you very much for your outstanding feedback!
