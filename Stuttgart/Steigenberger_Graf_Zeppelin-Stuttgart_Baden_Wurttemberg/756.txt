My husband and I stayed in the hotel for 3 days. It was a good price-value investment, since the hotel is just 5 min walk from main train station and, therefore, in city center. Hotel's staff was friendly and helpful. The only minus point that the hotel does not have ergonomic pillows in "pillow menu", but that's a matter of personal preferences (if you are used to such, bring your own!). Hotel pool allows one to relax after a busy day. Spa treatments can also be booked, there is a sauna and gym.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 31, 2013Dear Mrs Urania289  Thank you for your review and your recommendations to other travelers.   We are thankful for your feedback and asked our Executive Housekeeper to look into installing a pillow menue – because we do have choices available, we obviously just need to advertise that better.   We hope to be your host soon again and please feel free to leave a note with your next reservation with the request for a different choice of pillows.  Best regards,  Spiridon Sarantopoulos General ManagerRead more
