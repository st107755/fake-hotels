I stayed one night at this property during a recent business trip.  It is very convenient to the central train station as others have said (visible directly across the street as you exit the station).  Staff are friendly and obliging, rooms clean and large (for European standards) and the breakfast is excellent.  I was upgraded to Jr. Suite on arrival, which was a most pleasant surprise.  I had flown from the Western part of the US, with two connecting flights, and so had spent the better part of 20 hours in transit.  I arrived the hotel around 1:30pm and my room was available (unexpected surprise #2).  The fitness room is small: one treadmill, two elipticals, a bike, and a few weights.  It is located within the spa and available 24 hours/day with a room key.  WiFi is availableâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
