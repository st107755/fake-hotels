This is the 2nd time in 4 years we've stayed at this hotel and it is still the best deal we've been able to find--still.  Well located, great price and very nice, comfortable accommodations.  I had a corner room this trip, so room was larger than normal and included a larger than normal bathroom.  Room is well appointed and made for a very comfortable stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
