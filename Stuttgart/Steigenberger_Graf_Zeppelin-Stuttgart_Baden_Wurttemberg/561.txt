Good location near main train station and pedestrian area of Stuttgart.  Clean, comfortable rooms with plenty of space.  The cigar lounge is a plus for those who care for a smoke without having to freeze outside in bad weather.  Mostly helpful staff with a little bit of attitude from some of the wait staff, but no big deal.  I would highly recommend for a stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 8, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind feedback and your evaluation of our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin.
