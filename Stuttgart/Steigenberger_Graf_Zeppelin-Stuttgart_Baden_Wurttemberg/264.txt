Very centrally located across the street from the main railway station and just one block from the main walking and shopping street, it is probably the best hotel in town. We had a deluxe room which was a good size with a good size bathroom but no bathroom door so if either of you got up at night the light woke the other. The king bed was actually two beds pushed together with two separate duvets and not a king as advertised plus the absolute worst pillows of any hotel in the world. Also there was no coffee maker which every hotel, and certainly ones of this caliber, should have. The front desk staff could well do with training in a smile and friendliness as guests are your livelihood and not a bother.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
