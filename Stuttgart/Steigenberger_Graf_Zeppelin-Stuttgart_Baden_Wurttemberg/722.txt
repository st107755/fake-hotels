We stayed at this hotel to take European delivery of our Mercedes Benz. The reception staff, especially Kirsten and the concierge, Reyes, were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are awesome with all the extra amenities. We had huge windows that allowed us great view of the city.  The breakfast was outstanding, a variety of fresh breads, yogurts, cut fresh fruits, cheese, eggs, jams, cold cuts, cereals, pastries, etc. The restaurant experience was enhanced by Beverly, who made sure that we had everything we needed. She was super efficient and very friendly. We stayed there four nights.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 19, 2014Dear traveler  Thank you very much for the great review!
