Excellent location less than 100 meters from Stuttgart Central Railway Station. The hotel staff were nice and quick in response. Nice furniture with International and Arabic TV channels. The breakfast buffet was excellent with different options. However, you could not provide me with a smoking room, which i did specify in my hotel reservation through Booking.com. The Wi-Fi service was very poor and could not access my e-mail during my stay. Please do something to improve this service since it is very essential for business visits.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 15, 2014Dear Abdullah,  Thank you very much for having taken the time for this detailed review of your stay.
