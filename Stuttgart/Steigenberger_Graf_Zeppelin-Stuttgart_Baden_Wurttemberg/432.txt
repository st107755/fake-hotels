I stayed last month for three nights with the "Stuttgart Entdecken" package.  My room was large, modern, and quite comfortable.  Surprisingly almost no city noise.  I particularly appreciated the helpfulness of the staff including before arrival, as I sent a few e-mail questions beforehand about Stuttgart sights which were answered promptly and helpfully.
