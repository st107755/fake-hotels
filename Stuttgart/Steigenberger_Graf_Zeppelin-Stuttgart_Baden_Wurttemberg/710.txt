We stayed here as a group of friends for a stag night, the hotel is located in the city center and you can reach the train station in 5 minutes. The main shopping street is also just around the corner. The rooms are great and very comfortable.  The staff was really nice, the service in the smoking lounge was a little slow at moments. The Chinese and Bavarian breakfast choices were nonexistent or very poor.  NO FREE Wifi, I still can't understand that such a place doesn't offer free wifi and this would be a reason for me not to return to the place a second time.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 12, 2014Dear Mr Schorsch_lux  Thank you for your feedback and for sharing your experience with us.
