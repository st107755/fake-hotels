Nice hotel ambience with excellent location! Hotel was conveniently located just opposite the Stuttgart hbf. Going anywhere was very convenient. Super liked the nearby Bake factory bread shop which offers nice coffee and bread at very affordable price. Will definitely go back again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
