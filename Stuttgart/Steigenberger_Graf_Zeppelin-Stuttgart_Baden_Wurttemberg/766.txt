Excellent hotel with premier service. Check in was a bit slow but several large groups seemed to arrive at the same time. Bell staff very polite and helpful. Everyone was very professional. Breakfast offerings were excellent. Very convenient location to Stuttgart Main Station yet neighborhood was clean and well kept. Convenient to shopping and to the Christmarkets.. a beautiful place to visit at the holiday time.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
