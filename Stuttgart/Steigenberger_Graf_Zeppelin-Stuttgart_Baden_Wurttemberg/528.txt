Very nice hotel, friendly staff, great location just across from the main railway station. Admittedly, with all the construction around the train station, the streets in the direction of the Hauptbahnhof and Schlossgarten are a mess, but the city center is on the hotel side, so the construction can be mostly avoided. The hotel itself is very comfortable and clean and the staff were helpful and pleasant.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 1, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the great evaluation of our hotel.
