This is one of the outstanding hotels I have ever stayed in.  The front desk employees were excellent, knowledgable and completely cooperative.  The restaurantants were wonderful and the hotel was clean and up to date.  It was truly a wonderful experience and I'd do it again in a minute.  The whole experience just can't be beaten.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
