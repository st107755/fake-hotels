The hotel is located just 100 meters from the main train station  So you arrive easily from the airport just to the entrance of the hotel I was upgraded to a junior suite so that was a great surprise for me. The suite was clean and very big great shower . One evening I ate at the Zeppelino restaurant and it was a good dinner.  Breakfast is very good with a nice variety and great espresso coffee.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Mar 25, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you very much for your outstanding feedback!
