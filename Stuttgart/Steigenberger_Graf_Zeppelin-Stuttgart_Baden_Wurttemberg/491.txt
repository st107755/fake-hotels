One of the best 5 stars hotels I've stayed in. Super clean and big rooms, very helpful and attentive staff. Sauna and steam room area is a bit small, but at the time there was no one there. Would definitely recommend this hotel and looking forward staying here again!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 21, 2016Dear Mr. Geert,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
