It is the details that make you feel cosy and happy in a fice-star-place. Specially when it is a traditional Hotel with old school charme and quite exclusive high pricing. A bottle of water first day (for two) and than Nothing more is astonishing and makes you feel bad for such a small but important detail. Cleaning service not perfect was another story for d√©tails. For the pricing, attention to client could have been much better. The gym and the Equipment is small and completely outdated. Breakfast is great and enjoyable; The Zeppelin could appreciate a refreshment in spirit, service and style!
