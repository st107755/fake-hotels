Again, we booked the hotel after reading the great reviews from Trip Advisor. We only had a one night stay and we enjoyed it very much. Centrally located, in front of the train station this hotel is very modern and part of a chain. The rooms are very comfortable, with a beautiful bathroom and great wifi. The breakfast was not included in the fare and was very expensive. So we had breakfast in the hotel in front of the Steigenberger. We recommend this hotel for the location and very modern and comfortable rooms. P.S.: my husband forgot his cell phone and the staff was very quick to send it to us via mail. Thank you for a prompt response.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 12, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the great evaluation of our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin.
