One room seemed to be newer but less big, the 2nd room is much older but have a walk in closet.  Hotel is nice, lobby nice, service alright. Location across the central station very convenient. 1 block away is central shopping area.  The crowd around the hotel is however not the greatest. Although no sign of crime but the atmosphere is rather "unsafe". At night the streets in front is full of racing exhaust noise and emergency response, which somewhat confirmed my feel.  Nice to be overnighter.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 9, 2016Dear Mr. Jimmy Prosper,  Thank you very much for your feedback and the good evaluation of our hotel.
