Enjoyed our stay at the Zeppelin, good size rooms and very quiet. Close to everything including the Christmas Market, shopping and the train. Staff was helpful and made dinner reservations for us two of our three nights and made a great recommendation for an Italian restaurant close by with great food and a nice atmosphere. Very clean and nice rooms.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 23, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your great feedback.
