I spontaneously booked a room with only 2 days notice and Graf Zeppelin took great care of me! The staff answered the phone on the first ring and were delighted to accommodate my request for a 2 bed hotel room on such short notice. The price was also very affordable and I would rate the overall experience a 10/10! Seriously! The bar in the lounge is exquisite and cozy, with a very welcoming atmosphere. The other hotel guests we're very professional and I loved the high-class environment :)Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 1, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you so much for your outstanding feedback!
