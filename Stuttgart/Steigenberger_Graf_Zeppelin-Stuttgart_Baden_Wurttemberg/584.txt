This is a nice property. Nice lobby, good size, clean rooms, wonderful shower. We very much enjoyed our stay here.  The location is a big selling point. It is located across the street from the main train station. The area around the station is not bad like most cities  so it is very convenient to the surrounding towns and to explore the heart of Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 31, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share your impressions about the latest stay with us.
