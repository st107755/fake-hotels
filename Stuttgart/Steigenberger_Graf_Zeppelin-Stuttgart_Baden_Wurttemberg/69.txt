This is a beautiful, stylish hotel in the middle of Stuttgart. Great location just across the main train station and at the start of the shopping street. Roomas are roomy,l and clean. Breakfast buffet was also really good. The spa is not so big but has the essentials bigger pool, sauna and steam sauna. There was no bubble pool and to compensate for that the water on the normal pool could have been warmer.

It is a pleasure to hear that you spent a memorable time with us and especially liked your room and our substantial breakfast buffet. We highly appreciate your constructive feedback according to the Zeppelin Day Spa. As a city hotel we are very glad to be able to offer a spa area of 500 m² to our guests and hope for your understanding that the space for a bigger pool or sauna is limited. Please rest assured that we still take your feedback very serious and will forward it to the responsible decision-makers. We hope to welcoming you back for a future occasion and remain in the meantime with best regards Melanie Domin Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinRead more
