I stayed at this hotel as part of a Porsche Travel Club tour in September 2015.  The room was clean and the bathrooms were nice.  The location is perfect for exploring the city and is located across from the train station and near a large shopping area.  It's also convenient to go the Ballet/Theatre.  I tried a few hotels in Stuttgart over the years and this one is one of the nicest so far.  The service was good and the people were very friendly.  Also the food was tasty and well-prepared.  I don't have any particular comments on the facilities other than I got to see some professional football players there and if they were using the gym I'm sure it's pretty good.  Also, the bar on the first floor is great for having a nightcap and a cigar!
