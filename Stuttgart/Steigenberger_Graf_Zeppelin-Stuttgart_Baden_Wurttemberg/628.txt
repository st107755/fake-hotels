Beautiful hotel and great location. Comfortable and spacious. Good restaurant with polite waiters. Breakfast with beautiful scenery and good food. BUT Staff is polite but offers very limited help. Provide incomplete / incorrect information is not acceptable in a hotel like this. And it happened more than once.
