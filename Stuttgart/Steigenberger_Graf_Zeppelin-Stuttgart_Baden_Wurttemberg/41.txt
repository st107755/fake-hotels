An excellent location for you to start your vacation or stay in Stuggart.  It is right across the road from the main railway station, easy access to the city square and the information bureau is directly across from the train station as well. A very supermarket is also virtually just next door.  There is a hop on, hop off bus just near the information bureau.  Rooms were clean, well maintained and quiet.  Only one negative, the staff did appear to want to help or assist with luggage when we first arrived. (We do our own bags anyway)Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 11, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you for your feedback and good evaluation.
