A super location and great food. The hotel is within walking distance to good shopping and right across the street from the DBahn station, Avis, Hertz and Lufthansa check-in. The friendly staff all speak English. The rooms are definitely superior and well priced ( for Europe ). Underground parking for those that drive is alone worth a lot given the dearth of parking spots in larger cities. Would suggest that those folks driving South take the #465 highway (the old original ) and avoid going out via the A8 ( lots of construction ).Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 16, 2014Dear traveller,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and evaluation of your stay with us.
