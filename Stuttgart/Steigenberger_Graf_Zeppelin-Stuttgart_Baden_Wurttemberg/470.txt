Just back from a 2 night stay at this excellent hotel for my husband's 50th birthday. We were very pleased to have been given an upgrade, thank you so much to the hotel management for making this such a memorable trip. Our room was amazing with a lovely living area, huge bathroom, and all the luxuries you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We chose to pay for breakfast and were not disappointed, the choice and quality was excellent and kept us going to mid afternoon. We used the swimming pool and sauna which was lovely and quiet. Great location next to main railway station so really easy to get to from the airport. Can't fault this hotel at all it more than lived up to our expectations Thank you very much to all the attentive and professional staff who made our stay so enjoyableâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 15, 2016Dear Guests,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
