Located opposite the main station and just a few minutes’ walk to Königstrasse, the main shopping street. Friendly and helpful staff at reception. Spacious room with standard small bathroom. Overall the hotel looks like the 1980s. Breakfast buffet offered a good selection, service was prompt and friendly and the restaurant has a very large window front (very nice in the morning).Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 9, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you for sharing your valuable evaluation with us.
