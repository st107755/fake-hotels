I agree with several other reviewers:  good hotel, not great, but excellent location.  The Graf Zeppelin is directly across from the main train station in Stuttgart, so there is easy access to travel both within the city and beyond.  The hotel is in the heart of the shopping district and near to museums and restaurants.  The rooms are large and comfortable (although the pillows are a bit skinny), service is adequate.  Slow internet is free but high speed costs 8e a day which is an unreasonable price - it should be included in the cost of the room! The gourmet restaurant is excellent, but the everyday restaurant is just so-so. To push this hotel to excellent, it needs free high speed internet, better pillows, better general restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 4, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your detailled feedback and evaluation of your stay with us.
