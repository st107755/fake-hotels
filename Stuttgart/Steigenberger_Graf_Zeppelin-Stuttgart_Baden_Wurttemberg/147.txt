This hotel is very nice. Has almost everything to be a 5 star.  Staff was great. Common areas and room very nice. Spa and gym excellent. Room has just about everything you could ever want except, it was stifling in the room. Dry is an understatement. Windows do no open. We felt trapped in a junior suite. Pillows we're awful and lack of them is curious. I get more pillows at budget hotels. And finally. Are you serious with the internet. It is worthless. For 3 bills a night I expect internet that works. I could not accomplish simple tasks with your internet. And the finishing touch as I wrote this, the Nespresso machine didn't work.  I really liked what I saw and felt when I arrived. But I couldn't stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 20, 2017Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your constructive feedback and the evaluation of our hotel.
