Stayed 2 nights at this hotel while in Stuttgart for biz trip. While the staff are friendly, and it is a great location (walking distance to old town). I wasn't happy with the quality of the room,  guess I expected the hotel and the room to be a bit more modern. The room phone wasn't working for the duration of my stay. It was just an ok place.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 2, 2013Dear Mr S  Thank you for your feedback and for sharing your experience with other travelers.
