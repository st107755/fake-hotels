Rooms were cancelled as you guys sold it for higher price to someone else making up an excuse problems with CC card. Problem being for you, that card didn't have any issues, funds were there and there was no auth request, which would go through anyway. Very, very unprofessional, and given the fact that cancellation happen number of days after original booking, makes that I will not stay any more at your hotel and used to recommend it to other people from my company.  Effect is that every week someone from our company was staying at your hotel, not anymore as we cannot count on confirmed booking anymore.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
