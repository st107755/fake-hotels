This hotel is wonderfully situated across from the railroad station and a block or so over from the pedestrian mall.  The employees are extremely attentive and helpful.  The room was delightful but I found the bed a tad hard and was not able to sleep well.  (I am a side sleeper.). Also, the free internet is frustrating.  It was very slow and I kept getting knocked off of it when I was in my room; from the lobby, it was fine.  They do have a paid upgrade that I chose not to purchase.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 10, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and evaluate your stay.
