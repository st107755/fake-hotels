I just spent two nights there and was concerned about some of the reviews but I thought the place was wonderful.   The rooms are gorgeous and brand new.   Very nice appointments.   The pool is large and warm and wonderful.   I ate dinner in the restaurant two nights in a row and the food was excellent.   The location is excellent, very close to the train station and the main walking street.
