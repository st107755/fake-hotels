I really want to like this hotel but it lacks so much. It does have a great location and the concierge and valet were friendly and spoke English very well. The bar is definitely not anything to rave about. Our room seemed clean but reeked of cigarette smoke. Everywhere. It permeated everything in our tiny room- furniture, bathroom and bed (the bed was comfortable) Almost all the rooms have the option to smoke.

It is very important to us that all our guests feel well taken care of and may enjoy their stay with us. We are sorry to hear that you faced inconveniences that negatively impaced your experience with us. We are always happy to receive any feedback directly on site because sometimes a room change for example is possible. We offer a limited number of smoking rooms which are all located on the same floor and don't impact the rest of the guests. We are very sorry, that we were not able to allocate a non smoking room to you but will keep this in mind as your preference.   It would be our pleasure if you give us the possibility to positively surprise you for your next visit to Stuttgart.  With kind regards,   Spiridon Sarantopoulos General ManagerRead more
