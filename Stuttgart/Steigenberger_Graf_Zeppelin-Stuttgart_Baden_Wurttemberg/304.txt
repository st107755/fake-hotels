We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The staff was very friendly, the standard room was large and bright, the service was good.   At check-in we were told breakfast would be cheaper when ordered right at the desk than ordered at the breakfastroom next morning. We did sou, but apparently this information was not given to the stuff in the breakfastroom, so we were charged the whole amount. But breakfast was rich and tasty.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 26, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
