Just back from 3 days in Stuttgart and would thoroughly recommend staying here. Great facilities and very comfortable room. All the staff very friendly & knowledgeable about bars/restaurants. Wifi very reliable. Fantastic location opposite station and 2 mins walk from konigstrasse. Stayed in a few steigenberger hotels and although they are all good, this is the best.
