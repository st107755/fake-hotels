The only thing wrong with this hotel is the view from the outside. Without the other positive tripadvisor reviews, I doubt we'd have gone in. However, I'm glad we did, we took a delux room which was very large with a superb bathroom. An exercise bike, weights and skipping rope were all 'amusing' extras for the room. The pool is very pleasant and the bar was good fun. Plus, if you don't fancy the fancy in-house restaurant there's a fantastic steak bar just across the road.
