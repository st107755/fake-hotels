Extremely clean, with all that you need in the room, catering for smokers and non smokers.   Swimming pool, sauna and steam room with nice bar to complement the ambiance, modern style.   Located in the heart of the city 2 mins walk to the main Stuttgart HBF central station.  The service level has exceeded my expectations, although had some issues connecting with the Wifi but seeked assistance with the reception, and front office manager (Christian Geßlein) i believe, he provided outstanding customer service with a smile and a witt. Never had any issues after and super fast Wifi.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded May 14, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you so much for your kind feedback and the positive evaluation of your stay with us.
