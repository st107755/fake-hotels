Nice hotel with great staff, very well located in front on the main station. Breakfast is wonderful with a wide selection of delicious German breads. It's next to Konigstrasse, an important shopping area of Stuttgart. Rooms are wide and comfortable. The meeting rooms are also really nice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
