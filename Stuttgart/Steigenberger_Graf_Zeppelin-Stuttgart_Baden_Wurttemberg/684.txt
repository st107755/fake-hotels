Went to the Grand Prix and had a night at this hotel before moving on!  We arrived early and all the staff were amazing and really helpful and answered all our million questions. The hotel is really well located opposite the main station making it perfect for travel around Germany if that's what you are doing.  We used the spa which was lovely and really clean and nice even if you are not having a treatment. It may seem like a business hotel but we loved everything about it and the great staff who even let us store our bag for a few hours on the Monday before we caught our flight home, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 24, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your positive impressions about your stay with us here in Stuttgart.
