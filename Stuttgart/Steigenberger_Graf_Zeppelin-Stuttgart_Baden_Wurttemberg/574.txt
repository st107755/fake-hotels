This is an average hotel.  Room was average.  It was large but the furnishings were average.  Bed was comfortable.  Wifi was decent.  The service needs some improvement.  It took a long time to get someone to help with our bags.  When we checked out there was a long line with only 1 person working the front desk and people were frustrated with how long it was taking.    Breakfast was so-so.  It was ok but not great.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of construction going on around the hotel so it was not so easy for our driver to get to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 16, 2015Dear Karen,  Thank you very much for having chosen our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin for your stay in Stuttgart.
