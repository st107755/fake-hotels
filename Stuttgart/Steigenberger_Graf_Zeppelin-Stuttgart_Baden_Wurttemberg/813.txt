The hotel is right opposite the train station which was very convenient for me. Even though it is an old hotel, the room I had was very nicely renovated.  Bed: I had a very comfy queen size bed. Internet: expensive (14.50 EUR/24h) but worked like a charm Spa and Pool: beautiful (!) pool side and a wonderful steam room and sauna. Bath robe was on the room. Slippers where missing and when I called, they where delivered in no time. Staff: very friendly and fast.  Cannot say anything about the breakfast, as I did not have any (I went across the street and had some croissant and excellent coffee at Segafredo bar in the main station).  Altogether I can recommend this hotel and most likely will be back.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
