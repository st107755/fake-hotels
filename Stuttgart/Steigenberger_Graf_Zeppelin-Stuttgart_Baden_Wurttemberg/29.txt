This is the 3rd time I have stayed here and was not disappointed.  Service is excellent and rooms are great.  Cleanliness is spot on.  Breakfast is probably the best in town that I have found so far.  Centrally located and easy to get the train station.  Overall, pretty good!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 22, 2019Dear Mr. Button, thank you so much for your fantastic feedback and your valuable loyalty which we highly appreciate!
