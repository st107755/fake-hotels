Stayed at this property for 3 nights with my wife and two children and had a great experience. We booked a junior suite and were not disappointed as the room was quite large and very comfortable. The room was equipped with a flat screen TV, Radio/CD player, minibar, and Nespresso coffee machine. The bathroom was huge and featured separate tub and shower. All of the amenities in the hotel were very modern and maintained in excellent working order including the day spa on the 5th floor. The pool, steam room, and sauna were excellent and there was no extra charge for using them. Best of all this hotel is located right in the heart of the Stuttgart shopping and entertainment district so a car is really not necessary. The main train station and the local trains are all within 100â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
