The location of this hotel is perfect with the train station  just across the street and within walking distance of the shopping area downtown (less than a 3 minute walk). The staff was very courteous and the hotel was well kept. The only negative I have is the sleep quality. My bed was two twins or fills pushed together so there was a crack in the middle, the pillows aren't that great and there aren't any sheets just two giant comforters so either your hot or cold...but I would definitely stay at this location again.
