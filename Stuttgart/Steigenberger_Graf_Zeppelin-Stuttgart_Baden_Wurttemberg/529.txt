Nice hotel that I visite for the second time! very good location, nice athmospere, friendly staff. But poor quality of the food ordered through room service (3 times) although breakfast was just fine but at an unreasonnable price (26€). In the end, It was not really a very good value for money deal (150€ breakfast not included)Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 1, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having chosen our hotel again during your time in Stuttgart and for sharing your feedback with us.
