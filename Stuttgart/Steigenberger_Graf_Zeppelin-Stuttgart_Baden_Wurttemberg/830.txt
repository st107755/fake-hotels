Most of the rooms have been refurbished and the remaining rooms will be back within the next couple of weeks. Until then, we did face some challenges with internet in only a few areas of the hotel.  The same is to be said for cooling: our full system will be running normal again after all rooms are back into service. Until this time we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.  All other comments were passed on to the relevant department heads so they can investigate and address issues directly with their teams and initiate improvements wherever needed.   We are looking forward welcoming you back to the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin in not too distant future.   Cordially yours,   Bernd A. Zängle General ManagerRead more
