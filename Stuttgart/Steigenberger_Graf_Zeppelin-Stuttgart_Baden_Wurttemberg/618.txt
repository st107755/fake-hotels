This month I've visited the Steigenberger with my girlfriends to have a nice day in Stuttgart. We went to the spa for manicure and a masssage. I have never seen so unfriendly and inkompetent staff. Service was completely missing! Not what we expected for that price! The manicure of my friend was very poor and my massage was not better at all. I am clearly not recomending this Spa! Beside of that, the Hotel is nice but definately not worth that price!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded May 7, 2015Dear Anita,  We are very sorry to hear about the inconveniences faced during your visit.
