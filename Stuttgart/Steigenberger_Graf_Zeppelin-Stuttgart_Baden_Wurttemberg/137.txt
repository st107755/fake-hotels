Reception Staff very attentive.  The only down side of the Hotel is the Bar and Seating Area extremely small for the amount of guest in the hotel. We often found ourselves having to stand to drink our coffee or drinks.  The Breakfast Staff Excellent especially Hannah.  She is a credit to the Hotel nothing was too much trouble for her.  The room was far too hot and the air con did not work sufficiently  to keep it cool.
