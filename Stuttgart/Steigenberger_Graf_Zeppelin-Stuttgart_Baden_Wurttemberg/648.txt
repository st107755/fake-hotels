Well located for a weekend visit with easy access from airport and to station.  Good pool and spa facilities.  Hotel restaurants dated and average. Recommend Italian restaurants further up the street, and the Grand Cafe on Charlottenplatz for a good breakfast at less than half the price of the hotel's.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear traveller,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us.
