We had a fantastic 4 day stay in this hotel. Check-in was very quick and our rooms were ready for us. Our room faced out onto the main street but noise was not a problem. Room was very big with a walk in area that had wardrobes, safe and storage area for suitcases. Bathroom was excellent with separate toilet.  The only complaint we would have would be the prices in the bar. Very expensive but then it is a 4 star hotel. We didn't try the restaurants as there are plenty of places to eat in the area. Breakfast was lovely every morning. Christmas markets and shopping excellent.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
