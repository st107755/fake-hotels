We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. We arrived around 10.00 am but the rooms was not ready. We checked in, left the luggage and returned in the evening. Even if we booked a normal twin bed room via booking.com we got a larger room which looked very good with walk in dressing and a big bathroom.  The breakfast was very good. You could order fresh made eggs varieties, pancakes and coffees. The lobby looks old but well maintained. The lobby bar was not always open but you could still order some drinks and they would bring them from the restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
