Well appointed rooms that were spacious and comfortable. Would be the worst pillows I have experienced and the options weren't much better making for not so good sleep. We found the rooms were very hot evn with all heaters off and the room air conditioning on low. With the unbelievably good pillows again it was hot sleeping. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as they wanted 27 euro each which we thought was over the top. We did however enjoy the cigar selection and a great single malt after dinner in the Cigar Room. Ideally located opposite the Stutgartt Hbf giving access to all areas easily.  Would consider other options for accommodation next time.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 4, 2015Dear Simon,  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback and the evaluation of your stay with us.
