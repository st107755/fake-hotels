My time in Germany so far has been fairly average when it comes to hotels and to be honest I wasn't expecting much as we'd chosen this one based on it proximity to the train station, and oh am I glad we did! Committing the cardinal sin by arriving before 11am hoping for an early check in, not only were we welcomed with open arms and a friendly smile, we received a significant upgrade on the room. We also received very helpful advice on getting around and to top it all of they gave us a â‚¬50 Hugo Boss voucher each.  This upgraded room is new, clean, huge and very well appointed. Stay here, relax and enjoy.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 22, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the positive evaluation of your stay with us.
