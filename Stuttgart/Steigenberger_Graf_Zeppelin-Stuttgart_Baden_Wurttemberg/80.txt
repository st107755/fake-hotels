Dont expect any service at all. Too bad we were not allowed into the spa which was the reason we booked the room. We were asked to pay 150 eur extra for the spa, which was included in the room price. .Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 7, 2018 Dear Mr. Jensen, Thank you for taking the time to describe your impressions here. We are very sorry to have to read that there were misunderstandings during your stay. As a hotel guest, but also from outside, the use of the spa is not only permitted, but even desired. It is very unfortunate that you probably received false information. We may promise to pursue this internally in order to avoid such incidents in the future. Unfortunately, we cannot revise what has happened and would therefore be very pleased if you would give us the chance to convince you of us during your next stay and enjoy relaxing hours in our spa. Yours sincerely Bernd A. ZÃ¤ngleRead more
