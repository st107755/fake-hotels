Stayed in the hotel and found to many issues to ever come back.  Dirty chairs with stains, his keeping does not clean behind table, bathroom shower from the previous century, spot illuminating the building illuminates the window at night the window so not posible to have a dark room and air conditioning makes a noise and does not work.  Horrible experience for an hotel that is suppose to be a 5 star with 5 star prices.  It fits very well with the main train station that is in shambles as this hotel is also in shambles.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 7, 2018Dear guest, We are very sorry to have to read that your past stay at Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin was not the unforgettable experience we had hoped for.
