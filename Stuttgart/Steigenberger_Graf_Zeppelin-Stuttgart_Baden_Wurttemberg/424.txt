I enjoyed my 2 week stay at the Graf Zeppelin.  The room was kept very clean, and the staff were very friendly and attentive.  After the first few days on site, they knew which room I was in and about what time I would pick up my car from the valet, saving me time on my way to work.  The food at the restaurants was also good, and very convenient after a long day at work.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear Matthew,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
