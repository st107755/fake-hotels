I stayed here for 1 night on Thursday 26th November.  The hotel is very nice and across the road from the main train station.  It was also only a 5 minute walk to the Christmas market, which is why I picked it.  The service at the hotel was friendly and professional and could not be faulted.  When I had an issue with the safe in my room the concierge quickly came to my room to fix the problem.  It is a shame that I was only in Stuttgart for 1 night but the next morning I had to take the train to Zurich.  If I return to Stuttgart in the future I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your great feedback and the fantastic evaluation of our hotel.
