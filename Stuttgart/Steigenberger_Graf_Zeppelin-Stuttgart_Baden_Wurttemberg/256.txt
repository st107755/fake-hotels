Stayed in Steigenberger hotel with a family for one night. We received a suit upgrade which was very nice, spacious and clean. Rooms can get a bit out of air as you cannot open the windows. Lovely comfortable bed. Reception staff and lobby porter couldn't have been more helpful and nice. Breakfast true pearl. Quiet quality selection, table service of a wide egg selection, drinks and pancakes for children. Service again very proper.  Hotel is old and not very attractive from outside but fully renovated and elegant inside. The best thing about the place is its central location, next door to central rail station, subway, main information center and main pedestrian street.  Truly quality experience if in Stuttgart we will definitely stay again. Anna Demirci Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
