Just had 2 nights here with friends. Excellent location, friendly front desk, good size room with extras (Junior suite) as you would expect, very clean and decent bathroom. The pool and sauna area was very nice, very quiet and a great addition to the hotel.  Things went wrong however at breakfast. They appear understaffed and under trained. The room was only half full and we had to wait 10 mins for a table to be cleared.  There were at least 5 tables we could see that were not cleared and not many staff to help. The food was ok when we eventually got a seat.  More attention needed in this important area as it was our lasting impression of the hotel which was a shame....Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
