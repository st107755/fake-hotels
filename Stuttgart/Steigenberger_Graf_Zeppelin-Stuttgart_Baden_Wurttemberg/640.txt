Just across the street from the train station and one block from Konigstrasse makes this a great choice for the tourist. The room was ready when we arrived, but the receptionist was not very helpful. I asked about the bed and was told it was two twins put together- not too happy about this. Had to ask for a map of the Old Town and directions to the X-mas markets, which were given more willingly by the other receptionist. The room was fairly large although the TV was across a long room and not easily seen from the bed which was very low to the ground. The breakfast was included in my package- bacon was cold and stuck together, eggs were dry and too firm. Breads were very firm and not to our taste, while the fruit selection was horrid. Not one banana, no berries of any kind.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 4, 2015Dear Sue,  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback concerning your latest stay with us.
