Booked the Graf Zeppelin coz of its proximity to the station. The hotel has the most amazing rooms and service. We came in early and were given a room asap. Thank you so much. Having travelled for a good 4 hours and changing a couple of trains with luggage, it was a welcome respite having been given our rooms earlier than expected.We have stayed in a lot of 7 star hotels but the rooms at this one left us spellbound. The room had a walk in closet and the bathroom was superb! Just was sooooo happy that we will have to return again to stay with them for longer. There was a iphone-ipod speaker system too and the coffee machine was an added bonus. We were given 30 minutes free wifi access. The subway is just a few steps away from the hotel entrance. The breakfast was impressive.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
