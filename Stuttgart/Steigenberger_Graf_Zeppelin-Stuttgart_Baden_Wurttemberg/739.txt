This hotel is in the middle of everything. We were 3 friends sharing a room and paid 265 euros. For that we got a big nice room with a spacious and beautiful bathroom. Breakfast was also included and it was plentiful. They had everything you could think of in a beautiful dining room. Only negative is that wifi was only available for free for 30 mins a day, otherwise you had to pay and register with your credit card. If you get a good deal for this hotel, I certainly recommend it.
