If this review was based on my opinion on my room alone it would have been marked as 'excellent'.  I thought the room was amazing and the little touches were all there.  The bathroom was excellent.  So, what went wrong?  We went for a relaxing swim in the spa and despite the notices around encouraging peacefulness, it was more like a children's playground!  And, the staff did nothing about it.  In addition to this, my card was overcharged and despite paying for my room on booking - they chose to charge me again!  I called the hotel about this and it was dealt with but shouldn't have happened in the first place!  Watch your card statements.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 20, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your detailed feedback and the evaluation of your stay with us.
