Hotelroom (junior suite)  was clean, but has some wear and tear. The minibar was not restocked when we arrived, and when we notified the receptionist he asked us to breathe on him. A very unpleasent experience, especially in front of other guests standing around the reception. We were informed upon arrival that we could enjoy the spa included with our room, and was planning on going there while waiting to go to the airport on our last day. When we went to the spa after breakfast, we were told we had to pay a fee of 50€ to use the spa, since it was after checkout time. Hotel was probaby nice once upon a time, but I would recomend looking elsewere if staying in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 7, 2018Dear Christian, We regret very much to have to read that we could not create for you in the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin the experience which is so close to our hearts as hosts.
