Well, I flew to Stuttgart from krakow on New Years Day and I booked this hotel for 110 â‚¬, breakfast included. When we arrived the room was not ready ( at 15,00 hours ) so we went for a walk, Then we came back and they took us to a giant room  with a Gymm, a walk in shower, there were 8 lamps...,  Honestly, I think that they gave us this room because when we arrived they had not our room ready and because in this industrial city New Years Day it is not vebry busy but, my experience there is fantastic, what can I say???
