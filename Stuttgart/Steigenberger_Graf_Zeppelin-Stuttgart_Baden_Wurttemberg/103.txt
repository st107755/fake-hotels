The hotel has a perfect location right in the heart of the city centre.  It's a nice big hotel, the breakfast is really good with a wide variety.  I had only 2 issues with the room. 1. The curtains do not cover the whole window so there was light coming in and I cannot sleep with any light in the room 2. The A/C was not enough for me. My room was still a bit too hot for me although I had the A/C on the highest fan and the lowest temperature. Other than that, everything else was fine :)Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 9, 2018Dear guest, We are pleased that you were able to spend a great time in the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin.
