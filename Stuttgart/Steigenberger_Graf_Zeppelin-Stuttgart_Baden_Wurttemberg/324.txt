Every time I have stayed in a Steigenberger in Europe the service has been impeccable.  I was taken aback when I arrived in Stuttgart for an overnight between a seminar in Tuebingen and a weekend in Paris before heading back to the U.S..  I was upgraded to the most beautiful suite---a total surprise and delight.  The front desk staff reminded me of the location of the Christmas market and, as a result, many in my family will have some special, hand-crafted gifts. I will always take the opportunity to stay again in a Steigenberger.  Thanks for the great experience.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 28, 2016Dear Kirk,  Thank you very much for your great feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
