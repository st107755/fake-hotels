Stayed one night at this hotel it was very nice and very german hotel.... soft beds nice bathroom nothing super modern but perfect for a 1 night stay to visit Stuttgart. Its right near the main shopping part of town and has a great restaurant. Breakfast was wonderful , I assumed it was part of the room rate but it was not and at 25 Euros it was expensive but really really nice first class for sure. I would stay here again if in Stuttgart however I would look at other places for 25 euros for breakfast and 14 euros for internet is an extra expense other hotels would have complimentary.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare
