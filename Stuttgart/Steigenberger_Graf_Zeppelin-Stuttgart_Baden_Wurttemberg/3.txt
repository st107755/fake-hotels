Had a one night stay at the Graf Zeppelin in Stuttgart in a Deluxe room. The room was nice and clean and the bathroom was also clean. The details were just not what you expect from a 5* hotel. The amenities folder was old and not updated, the soap in the bathroom was in a bottle at the wall (cheaper and same as in 2 or 3* hotels) The milk at breakfast was still in the carton from the supermarket. The bar and restaurant was hardly frequented. The gym was small and basic and although the staff was very professional and friendly I left with the impression that the hotel has seen better times. Maybe they should use the time the new station is under construction to renovate the hotel. But maybe the location for a high end hotel is not ideal either and it should become a 3* hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 10, 2020Dear esteemed guest,  thank you very much for the evaluation of your stay with us.  We hope that you were able to enjoy your overall time in Stuttgart and apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations. For all Steigenberger hotels are deeply involved in sustainability we avoid single wrapped items. Therefore we use the green soap dispenser.  Thank you also for bringing the milk packages to our attention. On our breakfast buffet you find several types of milk like full-fat, low-fat, soy milk or lactose free milk. To make this selection quite clear, also for guests who do not speak German or English, we provide the milk in the original packages to show also the picutres and help the guests. On your behalf we would be more than happy to serve that seperatly in a jug.   It would be a pleasure to welcoming you back to the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin to positively surprise you.  With best regards  Bernd A. ZÃ¤ngle General Manager Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin Read more
