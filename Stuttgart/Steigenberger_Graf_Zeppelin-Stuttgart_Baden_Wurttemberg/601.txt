The Hotel was recommended to me by one of my friend who lives in Germany telling me this is the best in Stuttgart. AGREED the hotel was really good.The room was Spacious,The Staff were very friendly,The location is the best feature of this hotel.Close to restaurants ,shopping ,tourism office and train station. One thing i missed in this room is the coffee maker. I stayed around 5 days it was excellent.It is not cheap but worth the money. Sure I will stay again and advise my friends to stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 8, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to review your stay with us.
