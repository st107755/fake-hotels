Staying many times at Steigenberger Vienna, I have chosen this hotel for our two nights stay in Stuttgart. The reception staff was really helpful (especially Bianca), giving us a friendly welcome and offering precious hints and infos four our stay in Stuttgart. The room was not their strong point, being a little outdated and small, but clean. The breakfast is ok, but can not be compared with Steigenberger in Vienna. At the last floor there is a very nice Spa area with a great pool which is very welcomed after a busy day.Read moreHelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 31, 2013Dear Mr or Mrs MyTravelPassion  Thank you for your feedback following your stay with us.
