This hotel was perfectly located just across from the Main Train station.  The Twin room with the extra bed was spacious and the bathroom was very well laid out.  The pool and sauna were appreciated as well. Just a short cab ride from both the Mercedes and Porsche museums which were the purpose of our visit.  We have had very good experiences with this chain of hotels in Germany.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your great feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
