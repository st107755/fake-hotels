Stayed in a deluxe plus room.  Ultra modern, complete with my own gym in the room.  Great food in the lobby and located directly across from the Hauptbahnhof.  Stereo w/CD player vs. the usual radio channels available on the TV.   Sound-proofes from the traffic; wouldn't mind living there for awhile.  Highly recommended! Read moreHelpfulShare
