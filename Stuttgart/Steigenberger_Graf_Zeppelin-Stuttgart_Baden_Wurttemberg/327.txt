Well, I should've known my stay at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin would be noteworthy. Did you say Zeppelin?  Heck yeah - it rocked. Between the well appointed rooms, coffee service in the lobby, and one of the most complete breakfast buffets I've experienced, I have to rate this place very high. The only snag that I hit was arriving early and the hotel was sold out, which meant no early check-in. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through Stuttgart. Finally, it is located right across from the train station, so it's super accessible.
