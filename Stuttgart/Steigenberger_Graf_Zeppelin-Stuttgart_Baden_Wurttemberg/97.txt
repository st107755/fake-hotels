The hotel is ok with good location   But with the hot weather hitting Stuttgart the AC on the entire hotel was extremely bad. We were given a room that was even worse and when I talked to the lady at the front desk she was extremely rude and went out of her way to ensure that she didn’t care. She was telling us the hotel was full and rooms are available. But she managed to find us a room when I threatened to leave the hotel.  As for the rest of the stay it was ok although the complementary water was never refilled.  Never again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 9, 2018Dear esteemed guest, thank you very much for having taken the time to review your stay with us. We hope that you enjoyed your overall time in Stuttgart even though we had some of the hottest days of this summer. As our air conditioning system is not used to such high temperatures we truly apologize that your room was not as cold as you wished. According to your feedback about our team we can assure you that we directly addressed the issue internally as the described behaviour does of course not correspond to our service standards. Please consider also that the complimentary water is just a welcome gift from our side. We can only apologize for the mentioned inconveniences and reassure you that we will do our very best to grant an impeccable stay if you consider our hotel again for a future occasion.
