We stayed at this hotel for five days.Its location is perfect. The train station is just across the hotel. It's very near to KÃ¶ninstrabe, the shopping street.The hotel staff is young, helpful and kindly. The breakfast menu had many varieties. Our room was clean and comfortable. The wi-fi had no problems in connecting and was fast. We were very pleased staying at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
