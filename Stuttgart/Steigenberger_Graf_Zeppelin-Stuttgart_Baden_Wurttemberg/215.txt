When I turn back my country, I noticed that you made double charge. The provision and actual charge. This is happening second time and I could get the provision fee within the 3 weeks for the previous trip . I am travelling Germany often and this is happening only in your hotel(please make benchmark with other hotels , especially Moevenpick how do they solve this problem ). I will never stay and offer your hotel in the future . Also, I will not let my personnel to stay in your hotel .I strongly ask you to make re-reimbursement paymentRead moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
