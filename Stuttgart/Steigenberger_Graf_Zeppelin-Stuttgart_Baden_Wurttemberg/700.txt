Fantastic example of the brand,located in the middle of downtown near the Hauptbahnhof and the main shopping areas.Big,tastefully decorated public areas,uber polite,helpful staff. Rooms are large,modern and spotlessly clean.Not the cheapest hotel but I thoroughly recommend it.A good time to visit is in December for the Weinachstmarkt,it`s one of the most underated in Germany and it`s right on the doorstep of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded May 25, 2014Dear Nick,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback concerning your stay at our hotel.
