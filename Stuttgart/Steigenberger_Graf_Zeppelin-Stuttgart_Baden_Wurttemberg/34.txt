This was as expected of a 5Star hotel. Staff were great, location is perfect, it’s very clean, good bar, etc But For a 5star, you don’t even have tea or coffee facilites in your room ( we were in a suite too)!  Secondly you can open the windows or control to aircond, so it was stinking hot in our room at night.  We got NO sleep. I expected a bit more.......oh wellRead moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, PA to the General Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 3, 2019Dear BJandAli,  Thank you for preferring our hotel and for taking the time to leave a review. For we always longing to improve our service quality, this is highly appreciated.  We are more than happy to inform you that Nespresso coffee machines are already ordered and you will find them from Deluxe category and above shortly.  We apologize for the inconveniences you had due to the high temperature outside and that you needed to decide between open window and air-condition. Due to Steigenberger has a green soul, we are trying to protect the environment as good as we can. One part of that is to minimize electric power consumption. Therefore our cooling system runs only with closed windows.     Dear BJandAli, for your overall rating is positive, we hope that you will stay with us again during your next visit of Stuttgart.  We wish you a pleasant day and remain,  yours sincerely  Angelika Bross Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin Read more
