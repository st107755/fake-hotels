In town to pick up a car in Zeffenhausen, stayed for two nights and really enjoyed everything about the property and location.  The rooms are really spacious and very nice.  Ate in Zeppelino's restaurant and enjoyed a delicious US steak and yummy salad of lamb's lettuce and the most delicious bacon!  Friendly service and courteous wait staff.  The hotel is very close to shopping and great local restaurants.  We stayed here in January and were so glad to visit again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Inhaber at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 2, 2013Dear traveler  Thank you very much for the great review and recommendation to other travelers!
