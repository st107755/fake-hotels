The hotel is located opposite Hauptbahnhof and therefore conveniently located. The hotel is clean and the bed is very comfortable, however, this is not on the standard if a five star hotel. The decoration is awkward. It has been refurbished partially which you can see because there is no real style. Nothing matches really which makes the room not as comfortable as expected. Most of the staff are friendly but others are not. You expect to feel comfortable during every part of your stay but that is not the case. The breakfast is good but nothing special and if you turn up at 9, a lot is empty already. I would not recommend staying for the regular price.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 20, 2018Dear Thea Angelina, thank you very much for your feedback.
