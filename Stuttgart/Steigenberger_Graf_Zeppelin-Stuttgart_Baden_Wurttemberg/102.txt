Stayed one night.  It was a nice room and hotel.  Convenient to train station.  However, the A/C didn't get cold enough in the room.  I called to be sure I was working the thermostat right.  However, I was not going to call a technician at 11 PM (when we were in the room ready for bed), and the hotel was disinterested in offering anything to me.  It would be nice if they were proactive.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Deutsche HospitalityDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 16, 2018Dear esteemed guest, thank you very much for your feedback.
