This hotel is the consummate host.  Friendly and attentive service started at the front desk  when we walked in three hours early before check-in time.  We were offered refreshments while we waited for a room to become available.  Room was impeccable from the floors to the sheets.  Well-stocked mini-bar had our preference drinks.  Morning "Frühstuck" breakast delay was elegant and well-tended.  Additional on premise restaurants provided everything from Haute Cuisine and Steak House to an authenticSchwabian (Regional Specialities) Stübe.  After 22 hours of delayed air travel, it was a great place to rewind and recharge!Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 29, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the great evaluation of your stay with us.
