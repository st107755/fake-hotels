After flight got re-routed, we decided to stay for the weekend in Stuttgart and then drive home. We picked this hotel and were not disappointed. It's a nice hotel in very central location (the car stayed in the garage all time). The room was spacious and quiet, the bathroom also nice with a big shower. The pool and sauna were also nice. Some room for improvements: - TV could be larger (Deluxe Room) - free internet was very slow. It would be good to have e.g. fast internet for free included with X MB / day and then switch to slower internet or pay. It's annoying when you just want to browse some websites and it's slow.  When in Stuttgart next time and I need central location, I would hesitate to come here again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 10, 2014Dear Jan-Hendrik B,  Thank you very much for sharing the experiences from your recent stay in Stuttgart.
