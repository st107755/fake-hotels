We stayed here in December and again in January as we started our vacation in Stuttgart and ended there as well. Our rooms both times were very nice and really relaxing after a day of touring around.  They were very clean and the furnishings comfortable and elegant.  We had a marvelous Christmas Eve dinner at the more formal restaurant and great,y enjoyed the evening with my wife, daughter and son.  They are both in their 20's and they enjoyed the hotel as well.    The hotel rooms are very quiet, well appointed and clean. The staff was very helpful and made us feel welcome.  They made our visit a special experience.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 18, 2016Dear Paul,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
