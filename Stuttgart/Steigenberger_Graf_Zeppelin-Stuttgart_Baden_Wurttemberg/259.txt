We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were extremely helpful and restaurant Zeppelinos was very very good. The buffet breakfast was also excellent. Will visit again if we return to Stuttgart and recommend to family and friends. Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
