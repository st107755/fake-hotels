This hotel doesn’t feel like a generic chain hotel which is great if you travel frequently.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Öffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 1, 2019Dear esteemed guest, what a fantastic feedback, thank you so much!
