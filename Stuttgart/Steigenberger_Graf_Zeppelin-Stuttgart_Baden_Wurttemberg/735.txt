Great location across from train station and 1 block away from Konigstrasse.  Rooms were clean well appointed and the staff was accomidating. Small window in the rooms on the back side of the hotel make them a little dark and would have been nice to have more that 30 minutes of wi fi per day. If you need to iron a shirt plan ahead, limited availabliity.  Overall , great hotel!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
