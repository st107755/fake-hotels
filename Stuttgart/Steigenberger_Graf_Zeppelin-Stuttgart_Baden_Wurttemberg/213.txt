The whole stay was perfect! Before we got there the staff was engaging to make sure we had a room accessible for a disabled guest. When we got there the front desk staff were wonderful. The room was beautiful and comfortable. The restaurant food was delicious and the bar had a great selection. And the location was perfect! Overall wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this hotel. Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
