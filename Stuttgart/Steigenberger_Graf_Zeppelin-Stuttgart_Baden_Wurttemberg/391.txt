A lovely hotel and very convenient to the railway station and central Stuttgart.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Our first room was very spacious.  When we returned a week later, our room was small in comparison but still very comfortable.  We certainly appreciated the air conditioning!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
