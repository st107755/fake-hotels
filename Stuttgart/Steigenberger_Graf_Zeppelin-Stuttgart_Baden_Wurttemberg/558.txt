We arrived in a hire car from Salzburg. We dropped the kids off at the hotel and then tried to drop the hire car off at the station across the rd. We couldnt find the drop off place and the hire car staff at the station were very unhelpful. Our knight in shining armour was the concierge of the Steigenberger! He hopped into the car with my hubby and helped him find the hire car drop off - even he found it difficult!  we had 2 interconnecting rooms and they were roomy and quiet. The location is perfect to walk everywhere. We loved the cigar lounge in the hotel - it was a treat. The breakfast room was spectacular. The main restaurant was closed the night we were there so we went to the steak place next door and it was soooo good.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 19, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the great evaluation of your stay with us.
