We spent 3 nights in Stuttgart at the Graf Zeppelin. Besides a very nice room, the internet was gratis in our quarters. The daily breakfast buffet was always delicious, if not always the same but the assortment of foods was wonderful. The beds were very firm and the pillows were quite thin but the room otherwise was great. The location was excellent and it was easy to walk to the shopping areas and other points of interest.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 12, 2014Dear Kate,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your valuable feedback and opinion about your stay with us.
