Visited Stuttgart for Porsche/MB, and stayed at the Steigenberger for 4 nights.  Room was good and spacious, with everything in working order and very cosy. The hotel is pretty much directly above the Hauptbahnhof station, upon exiting a random choice of escalator from the underground I was at the side door already. Close proximity to main street, and an Europcar rental office downstairs came in very handy. Good food at the restaurant downstairs (Zeppelinos) but slightly pricey.  The good: Service. Got in at 1130am, which was way too early for check in, but reception had a look on their system and let me put my bags up early. They also advised me on where to get a SIM card (Media Markt next door), and were generally very friendly and helpful. In particular, MANY THANKS to Janaâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
