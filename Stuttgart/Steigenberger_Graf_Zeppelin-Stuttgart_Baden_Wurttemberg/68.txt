A five-star Hotel, across the street from the main railroad station with all the amenities.  Excellent and rich breakfast buffett, fine dining and excellent service make a guest feel at home at the Steigenberger.  A pool, cozy sauna and wellness area make your stay in Stuttgart a pleasure.  The prices are more than fair and it is accessible by car as well as railroad.  The nearby subway station lets you reach all the important points of interest with ease and speed.  A highly recommendable hotel for the business traveller as well as the family.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 22, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you so muich for your outstanding feedback!
