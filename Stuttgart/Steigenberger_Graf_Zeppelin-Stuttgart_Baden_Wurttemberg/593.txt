We stayed here one night on Porsche as part of our pickup program and one night on our own.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, from the front desk through the bartenders in the lounge.  Small, but nicely furnished (classic/modern) and efficient room, with a little sitting/TV area and a well planned bathroom.  The TV with the welcome message was a nice touch.  Right across from the train station, so if you're using public transportation, it's a good location.  The breakfast buffet --though a bit pricey--was good (eggs cooked to order at your request included) and had lots of selections.  Good coffee.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear guests,  Thank you very much for having chosen our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin for your Porsche pickup trip to Stuttgart.
