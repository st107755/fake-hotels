I read some reviews here, talking about dust, dirt, worn out furniture, etc... i don't know who these people are, and what they saw. I can only tell you this much: This is a truly 1st class hotel, highest quality, outstanding people serving, no detail left to unchecked. It is silly to speak ill of such a high quality hotel.  Breakfast was what you would expect of a 5 star German hotel. Everything up up to standard, not down to a price. period. Book it, enjoy it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
