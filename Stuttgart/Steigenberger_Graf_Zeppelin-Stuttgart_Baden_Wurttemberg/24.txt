My wife and I spent three days in Stuttgart, staying at the Steigenberger Count Zeppelin.  We could not have been better cared for.  The room was excellent and, unlike some American chain hotels which hide local character, this was German style at its most comfortable and elegant best.  Breakfast was superb and we can only encourage everyone to try this great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 2, 2019Dear esteemed Carol,  thank you for your excellent evaluation of our hotel.
