I stayed in this with my family last Aug 2015 in the Summer vocation.  I did a lot of search on the luxury hotels in Stuttgart because it was my first time to this city.  The location is great, and the suites were excellent.  The view in the restaurant is very attractive and the food was on the top standard  We had one bad experience in this hotel during check out, when the valet parking staff didn't give us the car key and he left for home.    we had to stay in the car with my little kids for 1 hour till the other staff found the car key.  Actually the concierge didn't give this issue a big attention till we raised it 5 times.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 29, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your evaluation and your feedback.
