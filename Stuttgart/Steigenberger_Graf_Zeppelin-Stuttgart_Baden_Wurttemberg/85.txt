Located opposite Stuttgart Hbf, the Steigenberger is conveniently located to everything. The staff speaks perfect English and the facilities are top notch. Having travelled for three days straight to get here, we were pleased to bed checked in early so we could crash. This hotel is totally refurbished and even the rugs shine. You could eat off the floor. Our bed was very comfortable and the room amenities are high quality.  All staff are very pleasant. I've stayed at Steigenberger properties before and they are all excellent.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 4, 2018Dear esteemed guest, thank you so much for your fantastic feedback and of course for being such a loyal guest of Steigenberger!
