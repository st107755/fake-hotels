The Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin Stuttgart was on our bucket list as long as the Althoff Hotel Am Schlossgarten. When we had the chance again to go to Stuttgart in September we split our two nights between the Graf Zeppelin and the Althoff.   The Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin is a large, grand hotel, just opposite the Main Train Station.  When entering the lobby the check in is in the front with a large photograph of a Zeppelin airship. Overall the hotel is very well branded and there are a lot of historic photographs, showing the airship and light features in the shape of Zeppelins are placed on the Mezzanine floor and lobby. It is also included in the hotel's logo.  To the left is the Zeppelin Bar and to the right the Davidoff Cigar Lounge.  Check in was friendly and efficient. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 23, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time for such a fantastic and detailed evaluation of our hotel.
