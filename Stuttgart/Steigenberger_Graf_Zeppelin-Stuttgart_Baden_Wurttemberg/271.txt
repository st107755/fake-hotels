I enjoyed a one night stay at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin.      The hotel was unremarkable, but offered the level of service and comfort that one would expect from such a hotel.    Location excellent for central Stuttgart, and right next to the station.  Would use again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 15, 2017Dear James,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
