Really enjoyed our short stay at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin hotel. Our room was on the fifth floor and more than adequate size. Very comfortable bed and large bathroom. Service throughout our stay was excellent. Nice quiet bar to relax in. Location in centre of Stuttgart was ideal, easy access to transport and city centre.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 28, 2018Dear estimated Guest,  Thank you so much for sharing your feedback regarding your last stay with us.
