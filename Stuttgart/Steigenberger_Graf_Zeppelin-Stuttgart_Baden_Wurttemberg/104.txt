Very close to the main Stuttgart train station,this hotel has all that one would expect from a first-class establishment.  This being the third time we have stayed, we were pleased to see that the standards have been maintained.  Each time we have had an excellent meal in the on-site restaurant, this time the veal was superb !  The breakfast buffet is extensive but at € 29 is perhaps a little expensive for people like us who  only want a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee or tea.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Deutsche HospitalityDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 9, 2018Dear esteemed guest, Thank you for your detailed feedback. How nice to read that you were already our guest in the past and we could convince you. Our rich breakfast buffet leaves nothing to be desired. Because we want to make all our guests happy, we also offer a small breakfast, which is also in lower price. Enjoy this with your next stay. We're looking forward to see you soon, With kind regards Bernd A. Zängle General ManagerRead more
