Had to stay over in Stuttgart, was on a business trip. Came early, a free room was quickly fixed. An upgrade, but still beats having to wait 5 hours. Perfect junior suite, very comfortable and well equipped. Staff service and friendliness at a very high level. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 21, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
