I have stayed at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin numerous times simply because the staff's service is exemplary; the hotel is newly renovated and the location is simply THE best in town.  Returning to the Graf Zeppelin is literally like coming home . . . the service team remembers your name; they try very hard to provide you with the same room at each visit; and their responsiveness is second to none.  Thank you Graf Zeppelin for making a business trip a pleasure.  Peter SontagRead moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
