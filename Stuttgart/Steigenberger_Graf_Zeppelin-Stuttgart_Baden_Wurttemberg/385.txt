Hotel is centrally located next to the Train Station. From outside the hotel is nondescript but once inside it is a different story. Our room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. It had all the amenities one expects from a Steigenberger Hotel. Staff service from Reception to Breakfast Staff was very friendly and very efficient. Breakfast buffet was excellent. So, overall a very positive experience and we definitely will recommend this hotel to our friends and return should we come back to Stuttgart.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 7, 2016Dear Joerg,  Thank you very much for your great feedback and the good evaluation of our hotel.
