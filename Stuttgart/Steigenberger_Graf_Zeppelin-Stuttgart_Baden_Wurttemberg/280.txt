I was picking up a European Delivery Mercedes from Stuttgart and this was one of their recommended hotels.  We had taken the train from Zurich and it was literally across from the train station. Very convenient. The front staff could not have been nicer. There was a convention so all the restaurants were booked up. They recommended the most charming Weinstube with local charm and food. Our room included breakfast which was outstanding. It was a glorious extensive buffet with extremely delicious food. I would have easily given the hotel a 5, but it was slightly dated. An excellent choice for convenience and hospitality. Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
