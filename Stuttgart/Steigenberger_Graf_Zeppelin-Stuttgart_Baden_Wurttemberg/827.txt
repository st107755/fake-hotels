Great location opposite the railway station with comfortable soundproofed rooms. Whilst we received superb service in Zeppelino's restaurant and at breakfast, staff on reception fell far short of a 5* hotel. Having booked and paid for 2 rooms we were told on arrival that we had only one until we proved otherwise by producing the voucher. On checking out we were asked to pay for the rooms although we had already handed over the pre-paid  voucher at check in.. Fortunately I had a duplicate which I produced after the second demand for payment, At no time was any apology made for the error and it seemed to be up to us to prove the rooms were pre-paid.  I realise that computer errors occur but a pleasant manner and an apology would have been appreciated.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 22, 2011Dear Traveller  Thank you for your honest feedback regarding your stay in our hotel.

We will certainly do an internal follow up with the agent involved.   We as the hotel have the responsibility to prepare your check in, control the details provided by the agent and to ensure a warm welcome for all our guests.
