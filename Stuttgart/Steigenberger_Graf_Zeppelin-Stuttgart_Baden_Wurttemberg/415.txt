My husband and I were in Stuttgart for our friends wedding.  The hotel is directly opposite the main train station. It's also close to the 'high street'. Good place to begin and end a walking tour The room was spacious and clean. Shower was great.  One thing though is we asked for a double bed..not sure why we got two singles beds put together??!! Can be a little awkward for a couple.  Other than that we enjoyed out stay. Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
