Wonderful hotel located right across from the main train station. Has an indoor pool,  and several restaurants specializing in the local and international cuisine.  In addition, there are several cafes, bakeries, and a steak house within walking distance. Felt safe, walked around Stuttgart and through a park.  Taxi's readily available too.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Inhaber at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 31, 2015Dear Lori,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the great evaluation of your stay with us.
