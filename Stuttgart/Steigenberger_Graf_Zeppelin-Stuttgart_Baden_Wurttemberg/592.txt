Requested junior suite with additional bed; all done to perfection. Perfect location as well; quiet even for being on a main street, and close to all the restaurants and nightlife your stay needs.

Ultimate bonus; desk staff (gender unimportant) that took a personal interest in making sure my vehicle and myself were well-prepped for the next journey. It's always the little things that are most impressive - right?Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback and experiences from your latest stay with us.
