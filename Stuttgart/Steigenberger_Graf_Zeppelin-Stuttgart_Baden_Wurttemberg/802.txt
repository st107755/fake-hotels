Across from the main station and walking distance (minutes) to the park, shopping, restaurants, and several museums.  Very modern furnishings and decor.  Comfortable and functional if a little small.  Service was polite and efficient.  There was a Shiseido Spa on site, as well as a gym and pool - but I didn't have the time to check them out.  CONS: only 30 min free internet per day, parking was 20 Euro a day.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded May 7, 2012Dear traveller  Thank you very much for your feedback.
