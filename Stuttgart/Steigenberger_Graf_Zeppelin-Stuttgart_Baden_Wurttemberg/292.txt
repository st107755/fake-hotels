A very nice business hotel with a very pleasant pool and sauna/steam room.  It is ideally located just by Stuttgart's main station with excellent transport links.  It lets itself down by pathetic internet speeds and overpriced food and drink.  The staff were all very professional and helpful and I enjoyed my stay there.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 26, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
