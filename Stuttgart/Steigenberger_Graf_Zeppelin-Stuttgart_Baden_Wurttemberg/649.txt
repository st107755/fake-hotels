Upscale hotel (older exterior) modernized inside. Rooms/ showers are trendy and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was included with the room- good quality and selection. Room service food selection was okay. Go to the Zepellino's- the hotels restaurant MUCH better quality food. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great location- I walked 1 block to get to great selection of shopping and outdoor cafes. Overall a great stay!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 29, 2014Dear Eliz,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us.
