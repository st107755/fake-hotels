We had 4 rooms. 2 rooms are big but the condition is not up to he standard for a 4-star hotel. The other 2 rooms have newer condition (maybe in to progress of refurbishing the hotel) but smaller. I am disappointed overall.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
