This is an outstanding hotel in downtown Stuttgart, just across from the main railroad station.  We received a free ugrade to a suite that included free breakfast.  The room was fantastic: down pillows and down blanket, a flat-screen TV divided the bedroom from the living room and could be rotated 180 degrees so that one could watch it from either room.  The decor and the bathroom were very modern and shiny.  We received a welcome drink and fruit plate (with the fruit already cut).  Our daughter sent us flowers and champagne, and the staff, without us asking, provided a vase and an ice-bucket.  The buffet breakfast was fantastic, offering choices like we have never seen elsewhere: there  were about a dozen different cold cuts, a dozen different cheeses, even four kinds of eggs. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
