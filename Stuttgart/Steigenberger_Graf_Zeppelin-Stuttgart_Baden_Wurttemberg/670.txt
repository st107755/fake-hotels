We slept one night during a stop in Stuttgart. The location is in the centre of Stuttgart just in front of the railway station.  The personnel at the reception was rather cold but efficient. Good the room and much apprecciated the wellcome chocolates. The TV had a good list of satellite channels.   The car parking / valet cost â‚¬ 20 per day.  Breakfast excellent with a large choice of food usually available at a breakfast. Again staff helpful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 19, 2014Dear Tony,  Thank you very much for your feedback and for evaluation your stay with us.
