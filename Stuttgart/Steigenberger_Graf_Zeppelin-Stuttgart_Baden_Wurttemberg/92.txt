It’s almost 4:00pm my wife and I and another couple have been traveling all day through Germany and our room was not ready. All we wanted was a hot shower something to eat and a bed. We booked the hotel months ago we were very disappointed that we need to wait more than hour for our room to be cleaned. We were guaranteed by 3pm the room would be ready. Not a happy traveler.   On another note the reception girls were very nice but the male manager not so.  However the Hotel reception area is nice and the room are very nice.
