I stayed 5 nights during August 2018 with family. The rooms are spacious and well maintained. Best of the room is the shower water pressure. However rooms lacks some basic amenities for a rated 5 star hotel such as iron, coffer and tea. Water bottles provided for free only once upon check in.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 29, 2018Dear esteemed guest, thank you very much for your feedback about your stay with us.
