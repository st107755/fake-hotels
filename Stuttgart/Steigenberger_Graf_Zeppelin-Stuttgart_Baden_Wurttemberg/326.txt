This hotel was perfect in absolutely every way.  Perfect staff interactions.  They were very helpful.  Easy checkin.  Wonderful proximity to the Weihnachtsmarkt.   The spa was absolutely amazing.  The sauna was a bit small but the gorgeous pool area easily made up for it.   I highly recommend the breakfast.  It was more than worth the price!Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 28, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
