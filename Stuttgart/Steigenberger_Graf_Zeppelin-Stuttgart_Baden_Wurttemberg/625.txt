A lovely Hotel right in the centre of Stuttgart, friendly check in and very informative of our where abouts during our stay. The room was  clean and big in size, we did choose for the junior suite so did expect a nice room this didn't disappoint. The meals we found very expensive and out of line for breakfast costs, we didn't eat there during our stay but would expect the food to be of a high calibre for this prices. I would stay here again but would hopefully select a deal with a breakfast when with my family again, however enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others who like a higher end of the scale Hotel .Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Mar 4, 2015Dear Bruce,  Thank you very much for your detailed feedback and the kind evaluation of your stay with us.
