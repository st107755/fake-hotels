A group of 8 of us had a two night stop here. The hotel was found easily and is centrally located. Check in was very efficient and the 8 of us were processed very quickly. Staff were very helpful and had a really positive demeanour.  Whilst it seems very much like a business hotel the gym and spa were better than often found. Breakfast was an extensive buffet but with hot dishes (e.g. Omelettes; scrambled eggs etc.) available in addition. There is a nice bar, which serves snacks, and a really good restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
