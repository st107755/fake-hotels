Very central location, friendly and impeccably polite staff. Rooms spacious and comfortable, super clean and well maintained. The decor and ambient every 90s but not unpleasant. The spa is a delight and very relaxing, 24-hour gym a bonus. My only gripes are that the road outside super noisy so you can't really open windows and wifi very slow indeed.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 15, 2016Dear Almuth,  Thank you very much for your wonderful feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
