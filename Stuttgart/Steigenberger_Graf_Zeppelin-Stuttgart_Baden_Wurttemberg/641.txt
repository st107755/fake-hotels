While Stuttgart is a great place, the Graf Zeppelin was disappointing. Service at check in was impersonal and rushed. Neither of the front desk attendants made me feel like a welcome guest.  The room was lovely, but the bed was horrible. I can accept two twins placed together if the mattresses are comfortable. However, this was not the case. The mattresses were not the quality I would expect in a fine hotel.  Of the five hotels I used in Germany on this trip, the Graf Zeppelin was the only one that I noticed problem with cleanliness.  However, this was just a minor issue of dust on the arm chairs.  The dual vanities and shower were nice.   I recommend this hotel only for its location opposite the train station.  I highly suggest Valle, a nearby restaurant, for a great meal!Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 4, 2015Dear traveller,  Thank you very much for your feedback concerning your stay with us.
