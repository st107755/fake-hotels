Stuttgart main train station is nearby; no need to use a taxi or public transport to reach the hotel.  Most all central Stuttgart shopping is within walking distance.  The hotel is clean; bath rooms should have more soap.  Air conditioning is okay; you can open the windows. There is a small pool on the 5th floor with other fitness and spa facilities.  The breakfast buffet is very good. The hotel has no senior rates.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jun 15, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your good feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
