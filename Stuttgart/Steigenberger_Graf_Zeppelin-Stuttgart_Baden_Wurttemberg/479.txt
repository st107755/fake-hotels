One of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in for the money.  Spectacular room and bath. Many high tech features available in the room.  Location could not be better. Close to train transportation with train directly to airport.  Very best in shopping and restaurants within walking distance.  Excellent food and service at Graf Zeppelin restaurant.   Would definitely stay here again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded May 21, 2016Dear John,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
