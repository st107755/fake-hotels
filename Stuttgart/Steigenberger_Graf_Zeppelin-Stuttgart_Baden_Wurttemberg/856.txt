We stayed here for one night in the month of May.  The hotel is located directly across from the train station in the heart of Stuttgart.  Close to everything.  We had room 309 which is an absolutely superb suite.  Even had it's one mini-gym.  Service, food, etc. was all excellent, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
