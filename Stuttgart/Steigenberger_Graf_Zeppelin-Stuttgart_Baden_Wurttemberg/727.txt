We stayed here for a weekend during the beer festival. Found the hotel quite bland with no real outstanding features. Nothing particularly wrong with it, great location, fairly well presented etc. but nothing that made it outstanding or memorable which is what one might expect from a £250/night hotel. The staff requested a print out or email of the booking voucher, which I found unusual and slightly irritating and wifi was limited to 30mins per day which I found slightly stingy. Not that I needed the internet, but the fact that I had been limited in a £250/night hotel did grate on my nerves. Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
