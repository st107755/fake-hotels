Located right across from the Main station, it is a short walk away from Konigstrasse, the main pedestrian shopping zone of the city. Hence most of the museums are withing striking distance. They have underground covered parking for which I paid 20 euro a night. The breakfast is very comprehensive. They have cheesecake for breakfast!! Even though it is a buffet bf,  the waiters are very active, taking away used plates and pouring you some coffee. Great. The deluxe double was large and comfy, even with 2 small kids.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 2, 2013Dear Mr and Mrs SidSingapore  Thank you for sharing your experience with us and other travelers on Tripadvisor.
