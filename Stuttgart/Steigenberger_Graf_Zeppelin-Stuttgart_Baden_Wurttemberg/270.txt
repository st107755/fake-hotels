i never been disappointed in any steigenberger hotel. also the one in stg is very reliable and service level and attention for the guest is high the building and room furniture are not ok, but no more then that. location if traveling by train is perfect the main strengh is the personel and the guest awareness that is very high - without that is becomes uncomfortable.
