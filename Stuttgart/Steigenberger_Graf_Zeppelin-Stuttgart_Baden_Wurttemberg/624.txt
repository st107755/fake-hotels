We stayed at this hotel last night as part of the European delivery of a Mercedes. The hotel is centrally located, just across the street from the train station and a few short blocks to the pedestrian area. The room was spacious with a sitting area and a king sized bed. Nice walk in closet and a huge bathroom with a separate tub and glass enclosed shower. The bar is small, but nice with a pianist in the evening. Breakfast was great as well. All in all, this was a very nice hotel.
