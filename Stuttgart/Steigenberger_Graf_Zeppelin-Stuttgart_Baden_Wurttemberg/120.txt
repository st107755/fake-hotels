Don’t get me wrong, the hotel isn’t bad...  It just doesn’t look like a 5-star hotel  Rooms are big and clean, but nothing special   Staff is nice  Location is very good  Breakfast is average. I have had much better breakfasts in other places I visited in Germany and Austria...  Again, not bad, but nothing more than enough!Read moreDate of stay: April 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 17, 2018Dear Alvadi, Thank you very much for your feedback.
