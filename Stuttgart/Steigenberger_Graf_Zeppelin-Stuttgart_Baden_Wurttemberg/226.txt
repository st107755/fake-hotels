I had a wonderful experience staying at this hotel. Clean rooms with comfortable beds. Staff was friendly, location was great and close to the Hauptbahnhof as well as  hundreds of shopping malls.. food was great as well, the hotel restaurant is neat and I particularly enjoyed the steak. Taxi service is also available just right in front of the hotel  I would highly recommend this hotel and I can't wait to stay here again.
