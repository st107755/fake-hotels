The hotel is first rate, in a perfect location for exploring Stuttgart, Esslingen and Ludwigsburg. Staff are courteous and professional. The rooms are lovely and spacious and the spa is very nice. Being near the main shopping street and station makes getting everywhere very easy. I recommend this hotel very highly.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
