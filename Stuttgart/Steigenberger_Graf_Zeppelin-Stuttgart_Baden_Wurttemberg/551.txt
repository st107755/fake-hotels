I travel quite a bit and always am surprised when 5 star hotels do not meet that level. I would give Steigenberger hotel 3 stars at most. When we arrived we noticed that the corridors leading up to the room and the room itself stank of cigars - no surprise as a non-smoking hotel decided to locate a cigar lounge on ther ground floor, meaning all the smoke travels up via aircon tunnels. The bathroom was very basic and the room was not very clean as i discovered by moving one of the twin beds to one side. Completely overpriced hotel with only good thing going for it - the location.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 19, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having chosen our hotel for your stay in Stuttgart.
