Stayed here before but needed to come back for business. Service in this hotel is very good, they are polite and helpful, and nothing is too much trouble. Checkin was an easy task, very quick effecient and helpful. The reception is a decent size but not over the top. To the left is a coffee area, to the right is a smoking lounge and to the left again is the bar. Rooms are very clean and a decent size with free wifi. Bathrooms well equipped with large walk in shower and rain shower head. Double sinks, double towels, etc. bed was very comfortable and English television. The bar is not personal but staff friendly. Breakfast is a nice affair, a good spread but not over the top withplenty of staff to assist. Its located about 5 minutes walk from the main town so a good location,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
