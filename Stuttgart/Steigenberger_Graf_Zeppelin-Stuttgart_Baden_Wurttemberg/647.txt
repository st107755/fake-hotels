This hotel is a great location to be near the train station and also near the downtown area.  Easy walking distance to the old city with all it's charm and ambiance.  You can grab a bite to eat in the train station or easily walk to the many sidewalk cafes in the city center.    The staff is friendly and parking is available in the hotel.  Rooms are good and fair priced.  Clean and up to date.  Quiet rooms with well insulated windows to keep out the street noise.    Road construction nearby gave the GPS fits in the rental car but that just makes the trip more exciting.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 23, 2014Dear Bob,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share your feedback and experience about the stay with us.
