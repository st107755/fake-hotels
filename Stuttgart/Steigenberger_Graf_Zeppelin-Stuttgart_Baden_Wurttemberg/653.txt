Stayed here last weekend and after looking forward so much to staying here I was quite disappointed. It's overpriced for what you get. The rooms are good but small with no extras like good quality toiletries. The shower gel is in a dispenser! The staff were very good but on one occasion I overheard a complaint at the bar were a bottle of water was €9 and in the train station across the road it cost €2. That's twenty foot away. I don't mind paying for quality but I do mind paying for an over rated, over priced hotel. It needs refurbishment it's dated. The carpets are worn very badly. It's a three star maybe four at a push nowhere near a five. To finish the location makes the hotels attractive very central.
