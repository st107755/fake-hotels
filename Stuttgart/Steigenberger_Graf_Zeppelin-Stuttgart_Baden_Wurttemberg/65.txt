We organised a road show at this hotel and the entire banqueting and FnB team exceeded our expectations. The hotel and the banqueting spaces are stunning, with brilliant lighting and state of the art amenities. We had asked for a menu with Indian accents and it was perfectly delivered. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to organise events in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 12, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you so much for your outstanding feedback and kind recommendation!
