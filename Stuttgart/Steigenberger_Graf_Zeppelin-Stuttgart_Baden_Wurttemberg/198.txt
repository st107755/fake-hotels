The location of the hotel is excellent, just infront of the central train station, and within a short walking distance you can find many shops and restaurants. The spa area and indoor pool was very nice and the breakfast was good.  The only negative points are that the connected rooms I booked were different from each other, one looked renovated and more bright and the other one was older and dark. Also the wifi connection was very poor, and finally as a 5 star hotel there should be tea and coffee facilities in the room!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Aug 28, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
