The location of this hotel is great. Right across from the main train station and very central. The staff were amazing, very friendly, and the Spa facilities were good. The room was a good size and had everything I needed. Expensive for food (for the quality of it) but overall I would recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
