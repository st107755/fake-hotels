My husband and I stayed for 2 nights. Our second trip to Stuttgart and it was a truly lovely time at this hotel. The hotel is a very high standard in every sense. The staff are exceptional particularly Julia who was an absolute delight to deal with. Nothing was too much trouble for her and she is an asset to the hotel. The pool area was luxurious and our room (404) was spacious and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The hotel is directly across from the main train station so very convenient for arrival/departure and close to shops and restaurants, easy walking distance. Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.
