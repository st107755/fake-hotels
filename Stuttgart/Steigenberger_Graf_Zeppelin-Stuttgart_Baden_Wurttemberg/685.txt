I stayed more than once in this hotel and Always had a pleasant experience. In the past I had better rooms. This time the single room was tiny and thus a bit overrated for the night rate. One thing to praise for this hotel is the superb noise insulation. All the rooms are very quiet. Breakfast is also outstanding. The hotel is very well located for the main train station and all local public tranport, and the city centre-pedestrian area is just round the corner.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 24, 2014Dear Roberta R.,  Thank you very much for your honest feedback and the kind compliment for our hotel.
