They mention it as 5 star city property but i feel there is scope for it to add more facilities / services. The location is good as very close to the main station as well as to the nearby shopping main area. There is a good in house spa too which you can make use of. The bathroom sizes are big which is an added advantage. The room size were decent and the decor ok. There was some issue with the internet but got solved within a days time. The breakfast is good and has a lot of varied options. If it had been a 4 star property would have rated it very good but since it was a 5 star property felt it didnt match. Overall a decent good stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 16, 2018Dear Sanay S, thank you for having taken the time to review your stay with us.
