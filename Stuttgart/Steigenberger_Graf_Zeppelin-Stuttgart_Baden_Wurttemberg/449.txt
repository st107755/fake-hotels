We picked up a new Mercedes and had one night free at the Graf Zeppelin. We stayed two extra nights. It was not in a good location for the Mercedes European delivery program because of the local road and train station construction during our time there. The traffic was extremely difficult in the afternoon to the hotel and we had a very hard time getting out of Stuttgart in the morning. I would stay at a different hotel outside of Stuttgart and take the S-bahn.  Getting back to the to the hotel:  The rooms were nice but breakfast was a budget killer. We booked a room that included breakfast through Mercedes but it was not a great deal. You can get a better rate through other sites.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Jill,  Thank you very much for your good feedback and the positive evaluation of our hotel.

We are already looking forward to welcome you back to our hotel soon.  With best regards,  Spiridon Sarantopoulos General Manager Read more
