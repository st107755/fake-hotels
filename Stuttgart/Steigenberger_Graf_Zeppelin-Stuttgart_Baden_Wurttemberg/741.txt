We visited the hotel this past weekend and we given an "upgraded" room,  the hotel is hot, the temps were 90+ degrees, the room air conditioner was told it was working, but nothing nothing cold came out. -  we contacted the front desk many times but were told they could do nothing.  Finally we asked for them to open the windows, the windows had no handles, which they did, but then were told the a/c would stop working!!  What a joke!

We are very surprised to see your comments. We did have trouble with the air condition (71 degrees) and we did apologize for it. We also offered a free room upgrade to a suite that we knew the A/C was working perfectly but you refused. Our front desk staff spoke to you several times and did try their very best to help you.  We are sad to read, that you did not give us the chance to recover the service during your stay and we are not sure what we can do now to make the situation feel better for you.   We will surely speak to all members of staff again and retrain everybody on service recovery to make sure our members of staff are dealing with unforseen situations appropriately. We will also retrain our maintenance staff on how to operate the A/C units.  Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience during your stay and we hope that we will have the opportunity to welcoming you again to the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin in Stuttgart.  With best regards,   Spiridon Sarantopoulos  General ManagerRead more
