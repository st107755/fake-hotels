This was the first time that I´d been back to the Steigenberger Zeppelin since the rebuild and I was quite impressed. Upgraded for the only reason that I arrived almost at midnight, I had the chance to try out one of their suites, which are around twice the size of a normal room. Whether they´re worth the sticker price, I could say, but the space is definitely something I could get used, despite only having a short time to enjoy it. The entire hotel has been refreshed and brought gently into the 21st century, something that it decidely needed, if it wanted to retain a five star feeling.  The breakfast room is very much similar to before, with the quiet and gracious service, and broad selection of foods to start the day with.
