The hotel is located in front of Stuttgart’s main train station und easy to access by public transport. The room is very comfortable and although the hotel is in a rather noisy area, it is really quiet at night. Moreover staff were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay at Steigenberger Graf von Zeppelin very much.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 4, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your nice feedback and the evaluation of our hotel.
