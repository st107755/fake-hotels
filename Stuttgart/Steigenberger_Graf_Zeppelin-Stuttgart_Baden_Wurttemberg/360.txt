Absolutely outstanding.  Very large room that looked brand new, with complete list of services.  Great location near central station, restaurants and walking shopping street.  One of the finest hotels I've experienced in recent years.  Staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
