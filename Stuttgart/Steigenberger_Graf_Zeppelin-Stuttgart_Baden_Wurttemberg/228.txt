Highly recommend this hotel having recently returned from a weekend visit with my son to take in the Mercedes and Porsche museums.  Firstly, the service is fantastic with friendly, welcoming staff who were very kind to my young son.  Secondly, the hotel is literally across the road from the main station which made getting around nice and easy for us.  It is a lovely hotel and befitting of its 5 star status.  The initial reason for choosing this hotel was because my son wanted one with a pool and this didn't disappoint. Having stayed in a number of city centre hotels with 'pools', I've become somewhat cynical however this one is great.  My only negative came when I took my son up for a swim one evening to find 2 naked men in the pool together. Would be good to supervise the poolâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Richard,  Thank you very much for your great fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
