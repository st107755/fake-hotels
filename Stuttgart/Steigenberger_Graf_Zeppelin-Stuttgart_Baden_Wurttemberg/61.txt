A very good hotel. Very poor breakfast for a 5 star hotel. Few possibilities in the bar of the ground floor. Good location. Good service. Parking should be free of charge for the clients of the hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Mar 13, 2019Dear esteemed guest, thank you for your good evaluation. We are glad to hear you enjoyed your overall time with us and especially liked our service and central location. We commiserate not having been able to delight you with our breakfast or the Zeppelin Bar. It would have been helpful for us to get to know any details according to your dissatisfaction as we do offer a substantial breakfast buffet with all kind of options. Unfortunately, the parking next to our hotel is a public garage so we do not have any influence on the prices. We hope to welcoming you back for a future occasion to positively surprise you and remain in the meantime with best regards Melanie Domin Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinRead more
