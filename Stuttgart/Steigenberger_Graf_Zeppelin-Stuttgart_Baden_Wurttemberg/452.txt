I use this hotel due to its central location and ease of access to and from the main railway station which is just across the road. Room are spacious and very well maintained. I do not use the hotel for breakfast as I find the price excessive and it is easy to walk out into the centre and relax in summer in the main street. Highly recommend the hotel for anyone on business or pleasureRead moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your great feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
