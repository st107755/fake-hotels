The Hotel is in a very good place, the service is very good and the room is amazing. The main problem in fact are two: NONE speaks in spanish and not only that, when we arrive the girl who attended us ask for the passport; we said an Identity Document but she insisted on passport. Maybe she or the Gerency doesn't know that the european union citizens only must wear some Identity Card from their own countries. That was what they asked us after Stuttgart in Munich, Ljubliana, Venice, Marseille and Andorra. I strongly recommend to a 5 stars hotel not misconsider people from some countries that way....Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
