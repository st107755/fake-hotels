A very nice hotel in the heart of Stuttgart. Transport is great the trams are a nice change. Close to so much. Plenty of great  shopping. Lots of places of interest to visit and very close to the railway station.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
