We stayed at the Graf Zeppelin one night before we picked up our car at Mercedes-Benz.  We arrived early Sunday morning after our flight from the US.  Our room was ready and we were able to rest a few hours before stepping out to see the sights of Stuttgart.    The hotel staff were excellent with recommendations, etc.  The location of the hotel is great as we were able to walk to the mall area and see the sights.    The room was spacious and most comfortable.  We had dinner Sunday evening at Zeppelino's at the hotel and it was excellent.  Monday morning breakfast was also an excellent buffet with a wide selection of delicious food.    Overall we were delighted and will plan to stay at the Graf Zeppellin when we return to Germany.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Nov 30, 2014Dear Andy,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to review your stay at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin.
