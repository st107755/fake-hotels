We are delighted to hear that you spent a memorable time at our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin and liked all of our facilities and services.  We regret that you could not get the room before 3pm. The regular check in time is 3pm and due to our capacity it is not always possible for guests to check in earlier.

Please rest assured that we will do our utmost to positively surprise you if considering our hotel again during your next visit to Stuttgart.  Yours sincerely,  Spiridon Sarantopoulos General Manager Read more
