We enjoyed this hotel for its quiet rooms and proximity to the Christmas market and downtown tourist offerings.   The staff - from front desk to maids and bartenders - were all about smiling service.   The rooms were comfortable, but a little small. Bathrooms were immaculate with nice showers.   There’s a parking garage under the hotel and  alot is within walking distance - although mass transit is across the street.   They offer a very good, but expensive breakfast buffet. Seems to be geared more toward business travelers.
