My wife and I had a two day stay here at the end of a vacation. The location right next to the train station and city center are great for doing everything by foot. The room was very nice and clean. The highlights have to be the steam room, sauna and top floor pool that are open till 11. They provided a much need recharge spot. The pool was only inhabited by adults (different then a typical American hotel pool). Staff was helpful as well.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 3, 2017Dear Doug F.,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
