Arrived at 12:45 pm and, although told my room was available, the extra charge for access 2.25 hours early was €50. Room rate was €240 for reference. After a long flight from the US and a train ride, this was not very hospitable, especially since I had a meeting across the street before the official check in time of 3:00 pm. When I complained (this has happened now three times in the past year at this property), the clerk kept repeating that “these are the rules and I have no authority to override them.” When I declined the €50 “offer” the clerk miraculously was able to lower the extra charge to €30.

We are truly sorry and highly commiserate the misscommunication and inconveniences during your arrival. If we have rooms available before our official check in time we do apply an early check in fee of 60.-€ until 1 pm and 30.- € until 3 pm. Needless to say that these apply for all of our guests. As an alternative we offer our Zeppelin Day Spa for our early arriving guests. According to insurance, a usage fee of 30.- € has to be charged as you are not yet a guest of our house. In your case we assume that the receptionist tried to offer you to change in the spa area free of charge but phrased it ambiguous. Please rest assured that we already discussed the issue internally and will train our team accordingly especially in terms of communication. It would be a pleasure if you still consider our hotel again for a future occasion and let us positively surprise you. With best regards Melanie Domin Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinRead more
