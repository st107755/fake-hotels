We stayed here for 3 days. The personnel was polite and helpful. Breakfast was very good. The hotel is near subway station so it is very easy to get from the airport. We had a deluxe room but the decoration was old. On the other hand we had good sleep. Hotel is very closed to the main shopping street.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to review your stay with us.
