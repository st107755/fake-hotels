This hotel is right across from the main train station in Stuttgart, making it very easy to get around.  The rooms were spacious, and the noise level was pretty decent.  The hotel has a ton of restaurants near and around it.  The staff was very, very helpful, and offered us many tips on the Christmas markets, etc.  Great location.  Shopping is right there at your fingertips.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback and the fabulous evaluation of our hotel.
