As I did not know what to expect I was positively surprised in all aspects. It started with a ver friendly and warm welcome, lovely room that was very large, cosy, and warm. A nice welcome treat was already set up. The bed was ver very comfortable with a great selection of pillows in various sizes. Amazing how sound proof the windows are.
