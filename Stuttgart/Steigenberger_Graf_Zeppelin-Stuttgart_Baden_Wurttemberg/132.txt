Very clean, well-appointed hotel that with traditional, high standard customer service.  Front desk staff was helpful and accommodating.

The hotel restaurant is also worth a visit for dinner.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 8, 2018Dear esteemed guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experiences with us and to review your stay at Hotel Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin Stuttgart.
