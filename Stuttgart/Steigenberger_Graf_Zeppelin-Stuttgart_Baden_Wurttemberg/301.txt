The hotel is well located.  Many of the staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant, from the gentleman at the front desk to the delightful waitress.  Our room was comfortable with perfect down pilllows.  Two areas of improvement could be some actual pastries to go with tea in the sitting area in the area to the front of the lobby.  The only choice was a mousse and a sweet cupcake.. a So the entire hotel aside from our room smelled of smoke.  Not pleasant.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 26, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
