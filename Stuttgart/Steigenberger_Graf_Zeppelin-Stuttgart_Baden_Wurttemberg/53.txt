I loved this hotel. Located directly across from the Hauptbahnhof, the hotel is ultra modern and elegant.  I stayed in a deluxe room which was more of a suite really with an additional seating area with work desk, & a walk-in closet with safe. Flat-screen TV, Stereo/CD player & mini bar in the seating area, & another Flat-screen TV in the bedroom area. Lovely comfortable bed, & the bathroom was also very nice. But what amazed me the most was the sound-proofing from the traffic; the hotel is on a junction of several 8 lane roads, and I absolutely couldn't hear a thing. I wished I was there for a while longer but sadly I was only there for 2 nights. Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Leiter Ã–ffentlichkeitsarbeit at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Apr 5, 2019Dear Bubbles73uk, Thank you very much for this great response and for your stay.
