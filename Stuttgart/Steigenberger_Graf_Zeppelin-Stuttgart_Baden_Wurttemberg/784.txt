Location: Location of hotel was just opposite the central station of Stuttgart. In addition, the main shopping street is located at a street beside the hotel. This made it easier to off load some of our stuff when we did our shopping.   Hotel: The hotel was clean and the staff was helpful to recommend us some eating places near the hotels. Overall a pleasant stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to everyone who is going to Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
