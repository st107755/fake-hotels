Nice location, pretty close to the Stuttgart Christmas Market and to the City Bus Tour (hop-on/hop-off) and directly across the street from the Central Train Station. Nice bar in lobby. Elevators were pretty quick. Room was clean and quite spacious! Bathroom was like a spa! Double sinks, fantastic shower and very nice bath products. Flat screen TV (though not much English-speaking TV, other than Sports & News. A "home" or "HGTV"-type channel would be nice. We really, however, didn't watch much TV anyhow, we were out & about in nice Stuttgart!), pretty and good room-darkening window treatments. A very nice stay. We would stay again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 21, 2017Dear guest, Thank you very much for your great feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
