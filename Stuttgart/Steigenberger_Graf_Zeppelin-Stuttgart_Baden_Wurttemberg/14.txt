Am normally a bit sceptical to inner city upper class hotels as they tend to be a bit formal and unpersonal. So was Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin as well. But the proximity to the main station made the decision for me. The hotel provides what you expect and has a decent spa where one can unwind after a busy day - unfortunately the pool was closed during my stay though.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 25, 2019Dear Magnus, first of all we want to thank you for your stay with us and also for the invested time sharing your valuable opinion.
