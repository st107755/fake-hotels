This is one of two hotels that Porsche puts customers picking up new Porches. We stayed in the other one last visit and this hotel this visit and I can see why, both are excellent!  The staff is friendly and the rooms are huge with all of the amenities. Our teens were in a huge room with twin beds and we were in an adjoining room with a queen bed. Huge walk in showers and bathrooms. Bathrobes, slippers, etc. it is right next to the main shopping area. I highly recommend this hotel. Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
