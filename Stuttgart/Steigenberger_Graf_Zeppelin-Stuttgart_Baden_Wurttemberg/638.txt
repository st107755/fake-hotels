Hotel was great, staff very friendly. Rooms were excellent - large, well equipped (but no tea/coffee!) and the restaurant for breakfast pricey but first class. Also ate in the stube - good food, well presented, service exemplary. Highly recommended. Stuttgart is worth a visit - Landes museum in the centre is a weekend all on its own. Art gallery amazing - collection of PreRaphaelite Burne-Jones paintings outstanding. Christmas market huge and very gemuchtlich (?) even if we did not have snow. Mercedes museum also worth a visit. Reading comments from some other visitors - I despair of the human race. ENJOY LIFE - this is not a dress rehearsal!Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jan 4, 2015Dear Clive,  Thank you very much for sharing your feedback and impressions of your stay with us.
