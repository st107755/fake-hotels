We only stayed at the hotel for one night, but we loved it. Don't let the exterior fool you. This is a VERY nice hotel. The entry lobby was bright and beautiful. The front desk staff greeted us in a warm and friendly manner. They told us they had upgraded us to a junior suite. The room was large and very modern complete with a separate sitting area and huge bathroom with both a tub and a glass shower with rain shower head. The hotel is convenient to the train station, literally across the street. We were also able to walk to see many historic sites.  If we make it back to Stuttgart, I have no doubt the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin would be a hotel of choice for us.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 18, 2017Dear Mr. David,  thank you very much for your great feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
