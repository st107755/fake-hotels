Everything about this hotel was top of the line with the exception the A/C didn't work. Other than that, I would have rated this hotel with 5 Stars. The hotel staff (especially the valet) were exceptional. It was a lovely hotel close to anything and everything one would wish to do in Stuttgart.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 16, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the evaluation of your stay with us.
