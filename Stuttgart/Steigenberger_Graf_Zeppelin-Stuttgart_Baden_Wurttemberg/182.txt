A gathering of friends from around the world for a 'Special' Birthday. Treatment by the friendly and polite staff was brilliant. Our suite was just perfect - great views, comfortable, spacious and well stocked mini bar. Easy access to the train station, especially for the Bier Festival. Easy access to shops and delightful restaurants. Lovely City - Will definitely stay again next year.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Oct 24, 2017Dear Marie-Louise,  Thank you very much for your fantastic feedback and the excellent evaluation of our hotel.
