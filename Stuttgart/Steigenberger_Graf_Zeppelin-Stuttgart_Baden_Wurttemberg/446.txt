Friendly and efficient check staff. Hotel reception looked fantastic. Room was spacious clean and very comfortable. The hotel had bars restaurants and a spar none of which I tried due to short duration of stay. I will stay here again if I visit Stuttgart. Conveniently located in City Centre directly opposite the train station, right next to underground , just a 20 minute tube ride from airport.
