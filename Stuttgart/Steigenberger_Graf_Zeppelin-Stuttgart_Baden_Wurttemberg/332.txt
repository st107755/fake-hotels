Hotel is in a great location, only good thing about it. Room we were given was very poor, room service staff were abysmal, shower room flooded every time we had a shower and we had to use towels to mop up, never yet did service staff replace towels on bed turn down, of the two nights we were there they didn't even turn down on the second night and I had to approach reception staff for clean towels. Wash-hand  basin in shower room was damaged. Reception staff were excellent. Seating areas for guests very poor and badly lit, not a pleasant place to relax after a hard day sight-seeing.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Dec 29, 2016Dear Thomas,  Thank you very much for your feedback.
