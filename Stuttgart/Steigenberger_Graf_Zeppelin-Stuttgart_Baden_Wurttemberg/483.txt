Stayed at the Steigenberger overnight on my way to Paris from the black forest! The hotel is very conveniently located near the city center and provides easy access to international transport as well due to its close proximity to the railway station. A nice boutique hotel which provides all the facilities associated with a 5 star resort albeit in a much smarter setting. All in all, makes for a great stay and provides excellent value for money, not to mention that it is probably the best property in Stuttgart, a city largely devoid of good hotels barring a few.
