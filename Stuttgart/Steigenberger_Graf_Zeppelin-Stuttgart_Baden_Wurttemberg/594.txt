The hotel is across the railway station. So the location is perfect for train travellers. Our room was facing the station but it was very quiet.

The only drawback was the free wireless internet. The speed was so slow that surfing was a pain.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear Daniel,  Thank you very much for your visit at our Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin.
