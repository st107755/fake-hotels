Stayed at the hotel for a week for a conference at the Stuttgart Messe and it was great. Centrally located for shopping, food and transport with central station directly across the road. Breakfast in the hotel was good but a littl expensive. Great place for breakfast is down the road at Manufactum Brot and Butter.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Manager at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Sep 20, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback and the evaluation of your stay with us.
