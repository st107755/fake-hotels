We stayed here for just one night while visiting the Christmas market but we would recommend this hotel and definitely stay here again. We arrived early but checked in and the porter stored our luggage. The staff were all friendly and efficient. The room was luxurious, nicely if plainly decorated, with a large bed and well appointed bathroom with good shower. The towels could have been softer but may be the Germans like hard towels. In the morning we wanted a coffee in the bar but couldn't find anyone so went to the station which is just opposite. At other times there were efficient waiting staff in the bar area. The pool was good for a relaxing swim. This is a centrally located hotel for the shops or Christmas market and we enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from Graf_Zeppelin, Geschäftsführer at Steigenberger Graf ZeppelinResponded Feb 19, 2014Dear traveler  Thank you for your feedback and for taking the time to pass on some valuable feedback following your stay with us.
