Located conveniently opposite the main train station, this is a perfect base for touring the city known for their cars.  Just outside the hotel is the underground station which will bring you to the Mercedes Benz (MB)museum, Porsche museum and BMW museum. The MB museum is the best, a well designed masterpiece by UN Studio, a Dutch architecture firm. Definitely a must visit place  A 5 minute walk and you will be along the main shopping strip, Königstraße   The room is extremely well designed and functional. The wardrobe and luggage rack is tucked away from the room, giving you ample space to move around.   Check in is efficient and the reception staff very knowledgeable about the city. They double up as concierge staff.
