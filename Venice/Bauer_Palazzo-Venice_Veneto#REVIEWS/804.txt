This hotel has a great location, where you can just walk right out of the lobby and your in front of the main shopping area and square. The hotel is also in the grand canal which makes the breakfast and dining area an excellent place to sit and enjoy the view. The staff are very very friendly and helpful. My only negative points about the room we stayed in was the smell. It has a weird smell to the room as soon as you entered, it wasn't too much of a bother though. Also, expect to hear loud noises of people walking through the corridors at night and even outside through the window you can hear everything going on outside.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 24, 2016Dear Guest, we thank you to have chosen Bauer Palazzo as residence during your recent visit in Venice.
