An amazing location with great service.  We went to the Bauer patio in the late evening for a quiet drink and moment of reprieve from the heat and crowds of the day.  Was told we couldn't sit in the restaurant portion of the patio due to dress code regulations (I was wearing shorts).  I have to say, I appreciate the adherence to the code versus collecting another buck...very refreshing.  We were seated at an equally lovely table at the more casual bar area.    Fantastic views and very relaxing time.
