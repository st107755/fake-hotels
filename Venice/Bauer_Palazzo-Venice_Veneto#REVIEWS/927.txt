What a lovely hotel! We booked 3 nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and on arrival we were given a drink and the news that they has decided to upgrade us to a junior suite. Not only this but they also gave us a complimentary bottle of quality prosecco and a lovely gift. Our rooms were exceptional with views in two directions onto the grand canal. The service and attitude of the staff was wonderful and helped to make our weekend fantastic. From booking taxis to advising on activities everything was done with a smile. In many years of travelling all over the world this has to be one of the very best hotel stays we have ever experienced. Many thanks to all at the Bauer Il Palazzo..Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 25, 2015Dear Guest, 25th Anniversary in Venice is something that cannot be left unprepared!
