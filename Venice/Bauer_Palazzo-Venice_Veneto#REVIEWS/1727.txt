We loved the Bauer Hotel.  The room and bathroom were huge (we requested and got an accessible room).  However, after staying at the Palazzo on a previous occasion, I could understand why the Palazzo is so much more expensive.  The beds and pillows at the Bauer are like concrete!  Too bad. However, the service, as always, was superb.  I recommend that any person with disabilities request that the vaporetto leave you at the Palazzo pier since it is much more secure than the Bauer pier.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 11, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank for you review of your visit at The Bauer Hotel.
