Our 35 th wedding anniversary was celebrated at this beautiful hotel, thanks to very special friends! Would we have spent that amount of money? A beautiful hotel very close to the main sites and attractions. Staff very attentive, from helping us out of our taxi, with luggage, directing us to the front desk etc. The  rooms  were lovely renaissance style rooms,no windows however, with spacious bathrooms , but unusual showers? A wonderful ambience and comfortable beds. We decided to have dinner  at the hotel  with menus with no price for the women and the price listed on the men's menus. In this day and age  is this necessary? We opted for the special fish plate for 4 which they apologized, due to the  darkness could not be as well deboned as they would have liked?  A nice dinnerâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 24, 2014Dear Guests,  Thank you for complementing our hotel and service.
