Wonderful that the boat can take you right in front of the hotel apparently. This didn't happen to us though as the boat we rented dropped us off on the wrong side so we had to lug our luggage down the street. After our check-in we were escorted to our suite. I asked where the gym and spa was so we decided to go and see the workout room and spa. Now starts the misses. We learned from the lady there who happened to be the spa Manager that gym use is extra and reception issues a key. So it was weird that we were not given the keys to access the fitness facilities from the Guest Service who I just asked about the gym use and our booking definitely allowed us access. I had booked a couple of services and normally you receive upon check-in a list from the spa of your bookings.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 1, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was good.
