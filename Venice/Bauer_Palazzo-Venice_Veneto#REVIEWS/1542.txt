We stayed at the Bauer Hotel in late September 2012 for 2 nights. We enjoyed the terrace bar overlooking the grand canal, as well as the spa at the Palladio across the canal. We had a milk and rose bath, followed by a massage - sublime! The drinks were generously poured and the size of the (food) servings also generous. Breakfast was included in the rate and was well catered. Although this is a very luxurious hotel, it was very accessible price wise as well as in terms of the service. It was a thrill to arrive here by water taxi; so beautiful! Great shops and the main square are on your doorstep.
