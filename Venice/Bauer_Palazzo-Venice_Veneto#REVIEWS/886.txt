The hotel is stunning! The design of the hotel just like a palace! The suites are stunning, the service we received in this hotel is the best service we have ever hotel (thanks to Elena!) Breakfast really varied, there is a large selection of breads, pastries and cheeses and of course the most delicious cappuccino in Venice!
