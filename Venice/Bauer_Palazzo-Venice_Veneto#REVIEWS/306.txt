All staff we encountered were helpful and professional. This includes waitstaff, bartenders, bellmen, maid service, and front desk.  Our room (333) was clean, comfortable, spacious, elegant, and quiet. It was the perfect refuge after time out among the rest of us tourists.  Hotel location is at the center of the most spectacular district. The included breakfast can be taken inside or on the patio with glorious views of the canal.  Complaining about fog or dampness in Venice is like visiting Jackson Hole Wyoming in January and complaining about snow. Itâ€™s the nature of the location.  I am unhesitatingly recommending the Bauer Palazzo.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 28, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
