My husband and I stayed 5 days at Bauer Hotel. The room was neat and spacious. The staff were kind and polite. Concierges always gave helpful answers to our questions.

They ended in our gorgeous bathroom, where the water in shower flowed with delightful force. It was very comfortable for our tired bodies after a long day walking around Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 23, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
