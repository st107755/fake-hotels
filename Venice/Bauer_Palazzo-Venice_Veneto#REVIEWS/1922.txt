Amazing, amazing, amazing.  The Bauer is located on the Grnad Canal steps away from San Marco.  The front desk staff is great and the breakfast terraces are breathtaking.   Venice is a city w/o comparison and the Bauer only adds to it.  We had a beautiful room, with a window on the side canal where we could hear gondoliers singing - how wonderful.  The food on the terrace is expensive but the views are dynamite.  A must do!!
