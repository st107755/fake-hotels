We loved this hotel and our family suite with two bathrooms - a real bonus. Loads of room. Kids catered for well with dvd's as no English TV. Whilst we didn't have a view, the hotel us so well located we didn't mind. Concierges were outstanding and gave amazing advise every time. Breakfast - can't beat the location. Will return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 27, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for leaving such a raving review of your stay.
