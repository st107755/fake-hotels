We always travel 5 star and we know Venice can be a bit noisy but this hotel,as many others have said,was not up to it by any standard except that the staff actually did try to find us,without success,a quiet room.The front desk is good and professional but the owners have clearly not slept on the rock like beds or pillows.The main extractor for the kitchen goes up through the open centre of the hotel and works from 6am to midnight.To the east in the alley alongside the hotel is a laundry which starts banging and shouting at 6 am. The worst disappointment of all was our E250 anniversary dinner which was garbage although served on the beautiful grand canal.
