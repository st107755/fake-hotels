This hotel is gorgeous. We arrived by water taxi and were enchanted by its incredible location and presentation. It is a show-stopper. The service was warm and welcoming. The room was comfortable and spacious although there was sometimes a musty scent upon opening the door. Nothing too bothersome. Breakfast on the terrace was magical. Lots of choice and lovely service. It was wonderful to spend our time in Venice in this charming location.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 3, 2018Dear Hodgyhouse,  We would like to thank for your kind and detailed feedback and for your preference for Bauer Palazzo for your stay in Venice.
