First time to Venice, wanted to make it memorable. Booked Bauer for its location and because previous reviewers talked about the views from the breakfast terrace. The hotel is just a few minutes stroll from Piazza San Marco. Staff were great. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal will be a lasting memory - fantastic. Downstairs areas furnished in Art Deco style which we loved. Our room was really comfortable with a nice view of the square to the front of the hotel. When booking I had explained we were celebrating an anniversary and we were delighted to find a bottle of Prosecco on ice when we got into our room - very kind gesture. We loved the place and would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 13, 2015Dear Guests,  it is a great pleasure for us to read your review about the Bauer Hotel.
