As soon as you walk into the Bauer lobby you feel like you are at an upscale hotel. The staff are all nice and seem happy to be working there. The concierge was so nice, funny and helpful.

Our room opened to a canal that had gondola's going by all the time, but when the windows were closed, you could not hear them.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 12, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel to spend your holidays in Venice.
