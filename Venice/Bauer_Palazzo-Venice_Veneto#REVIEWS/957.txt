This hotel is everything a 5 star hotel should be but what makes it even more memorable and special is the genuinely warm service and welcome from the staff. It doesn't have that stuffy cold atmosphere many 5 star hotels have, it's really personal and without exception every member of staff we experienced were incredibly warm and friendly.    The roof top breakfast restaurant is also probably one of the best views in any city in the world. It is spectacular.    What a stay. Can't wait to return.  !Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 27, 2015Dear Guests,   we are extremely glad you enjoyed your stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo Hotel.
