We spent a couple of days in Venice recently and stayed in the Bauer Palazzo.  It helped make our stay that much more enjoyable.  It's location is ideal and very central.  The best memory I have is the outdoor terrace for breakfast occupying a corner position with the Canal Grande on one side and a smaller canal on the other.  Dinner was superb and the table we had at the front of the external dining area must be a contender for the best table in Venice!  I'll be going again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 19, 2018Dear ArryAwk,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo: our entire Team is enthusiast to read that your stay in our Hotel has exceeded your expectations, as we always strive to provide the most unforgettable Venetian experience to our valued guests!
