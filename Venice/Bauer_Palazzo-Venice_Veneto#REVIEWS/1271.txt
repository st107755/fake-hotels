The Bauer is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World Association. It is an excellent hotel, in service and location. Notwithstanding it's amenities need some maintenance and modernization. Its bathrooms are well bedecked with beautiful Travertine marble but use fixtures that need to be changed/ up-dated. It also needs to improve its Wi-Fi. Otherwise, it remains a symbol of Venice, adjacent to San Marco's square and the upmarket shopping district as well as icons such as Harry's Bar.
