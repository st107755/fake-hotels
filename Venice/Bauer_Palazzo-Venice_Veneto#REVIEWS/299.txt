Stayed here for 2 nights recent trip to Venice. Lovely hotel right on the canal. Enjoyed sunset view while having cocktails and appetizers on outdoor patio overlooking canal. Amazing breakfast buffet with same wonderful view. Room was large clean with comfortable king size bed. Lobby beautiful and staff accommodating and helpful. 5 Star hotel. Would highly recommend to stay at this property if you get the chance to visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 9, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
