This gorgeous hotel is right on the water. The rooms are sumptuous, the service is fantastic, and the breakfast buffet is significant. You can definitely plan to be pampered at the Bauer.   The hotel is in the middle of a small square with a gondola station on the side and Prada across the street. It is very close to St. Mark's Square and not far from the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Guest, I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at Bauer Il Palazzo.
