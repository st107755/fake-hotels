While this hotel is listed as 5 star and was in a great location, it was a great disappointment.  We reserved a higher priced room with a viiew. We were shown two different rooms and told that these were all that were available.  One was on the side canal and very noisy (the gondola drivers shouting at each other along with noisy tourists.  The second had a view of the interior air space.  Hotel needs a remodel!  Very dated and not in a quaint way.  Fitness/Spa is a boat ride away - not convenient.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 2, 2017DearGuest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was not up to your expectation.
