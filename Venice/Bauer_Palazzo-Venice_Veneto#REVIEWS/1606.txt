Our 3-night stay at the Bauer Il Pallazo was almost excellent. First of all, the location is perfect, right in front of the Grand Canal, and at a 5-minute walk to San Marco Square, this is the perfect location to explore Venice, mainly if it is a first time. The room, a deluxe suite, was very nice with as "Ã©poque" decoration, spacious and confortable, although a little bit oldie. The breakfast, on the roof terrace (this is the tallest building in Venice), was excellent. The service was average (for a plus 500 euro/night hotel) and the restaurant (De Pisis) was a disappointment. The overall experience of staying at a Palace in central Venice was fully achieved, but there is room for improvementsRead moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Il Palazzo.
