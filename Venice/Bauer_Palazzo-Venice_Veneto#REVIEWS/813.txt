We stayed in the main hotel building, from the very moment we arrived to the moment we left, it was a pure pleasure. We arrived just before Christmas late in the afternoon, check-in was fast and our cases taken to our room. The breakfast buffet was extensive and catered for everyone, the staff ensured everything that was running out was replenished. The location of the hotel is fantastic, 2 minutes from St Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 18, 2016Dear Guest, we are honored that you rated the Bauer Palazzo the best Hotel you've ever stayed!!
