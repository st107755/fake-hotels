Stayed three nights in one of the old Palazzo rooms. Very elegant with wonderful Murano glass lights and mirrors. Stunning views across the grand canal.  The buffet breakfast on the rooftop terrace was excellent and the views from there over the city were stunning. Dinner on the terrace by the Grand canal was also superb. All the staff were very attentive. Great position only a few minutes walk from St Marks Square. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a special stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 15, 2018Dear Bruenuna,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
