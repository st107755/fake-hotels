We stayed here for a couple of days and were absolutely delighted with our room, staff and the restaurant “DE PISIS”. We found that Bauer Palazzo has by far the best location in Venice - right off the square and surrounded by high end shopping. We enjoyed both a lovely dinner at the restaurant and a great late afternoon cocktail overlooking the Grand Canal. We were treated to great enchanting serenades from the Gondola's passing by in the West canal one after the other all day long!!! We will come back for sure.
