Hubby and I had an overnight stay in the Bauer 11 Palazzo hotel, Venice.  Excellent staff and concierge. Beautiful room which did not have a view over the water, but as we were only staying one night, it didn't matter.  We had dinner on the terrace which was brilliant.  The only slight problem was the pigeons but the hotel supply a 'pigeon zapper'.  I hope it wont be too long before I return there.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 27, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
