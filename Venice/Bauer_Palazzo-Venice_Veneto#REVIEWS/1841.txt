We spent 5 magical nights in this hotel for our honeymoon ...Location is just PERFECT (3 minutes from San Marc, in the heart of the luxury shopping center)...Room is typically in venician style, spacious, very confortable with AMAZING view (huge terrace over the grand Canal and Chiesa del Salute) ...
