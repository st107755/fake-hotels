A girlfriend of mine and I stayed here for two nights on a weeklong trip to Italy and we were pretty disappointed by the experience. The location was excellent but the overall value of the stay was poor. We were shocked to learn that you have to pay for the gym (something that was not mentioned at the time of booking or anywhere on the website) and that wifi was also excluded. Further, the staff was not friendly or helpful when it came to arranging for a water taxi to the airport. Given the cost, we felt the hotel fell short on multiple fronts. Probably wouldn't recommend it to others although the location was convenient.
