We really enjoyed an excellent time during our stay at Bauer. The location of the hotel is perfect... near the sea and St. Mark's square. The hotel staff are very helpful and courteous. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the view from the breakfast room was amazing. I would stay at this hotel again during my next visit to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 20, 2015Dear Guests,   we are extremely delighted you enjoyed your stay with us at the Bauer Hotel and my staff and I wish to have you back very soon.
