We recently returned from our wonderful trip to Italy. After visiting four locations in Italy the only complaint I have is staying at the Bauer Hotel.  We stayed at 3 different 5 star hotels during our travel and the only hotel that charges for wi-fi was the Bauer Hotel.  Also we were sticker shocked when we ordered 2 drinks ($24.00 each) and a snack while we waited for our room to be ready and the surprising bill was  $64.00          WOW that was not a good start to our stay at the Bauer :(Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015We recently returned from our wonderful trip to Italy.
