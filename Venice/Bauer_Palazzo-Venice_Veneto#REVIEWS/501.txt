We so very much enjoyed our stay at the Bauer. The hotel is perfectly located and the staff is lovely. Absolutely would recommend it and would want to stay there again for a next visit. The concierge had very good recommendations, both for food and things to visit. The breakfast is superb and the room was most excellent/ Loved it, all the way.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 20, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
