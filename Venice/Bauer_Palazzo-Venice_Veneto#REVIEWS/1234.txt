Truly an anachronistic throwback to another era of attentive, professional and formal service. Michele was indicative of a fantastic staff that made one feel pampered and cared for. While it isn't inexpensive, as none of Venice is, the Bauer delivers in every way making dinner reservations and organizing magnificent tours. It all allows one to feel transported to another time in this Medieval city that seems to remain enchantingly trapped in the 16th century. The hotel even sent staff to the train station for us to change our train tickets for another time.  We wholeheartedly recommend this property to anybody looking to fall in love with this city and anxiously await our next visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 28, 2014Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a beautiful review of your stay.
