I booked the Bauer after reading all of the great reviews, but honestly don't see why it gets so many great reviews. From the outside it looks like a newer property, and I paid extra to get a room the higher-end side of the property. The room itself was comparable to a standard room in many older hotels, including the age of the furniture and wear on the carpet. Still, I cant call it a bad room, just not what I thought I was going to get. The breakfast buffet itself was disappointing, but provides a very nice view. If you care more about location and view than the hotel itself, this should be a fine place to stay. If you want a nice room and luxurious hotel, you might want to keep looking. Overall, I would call it slightly above average.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 30, 2013Dear Guest We would like to thank you for taking the time to review the standards of service and hotel facilities after your recent visit.
