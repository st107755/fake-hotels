The Bauer Il Palazzo met and even exceeded my expectations. While not inexpensive, this lovely hotel is well worth the money. The location is excellent, just a short walk from Piazza San Marco.

As a solo female traveller, I really appreciated the attentive service.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  we thank you for taking time to review our hotel on Tripadvisor with your comments, and we are delighted to read that you really enojoyed your stay in our structure.
