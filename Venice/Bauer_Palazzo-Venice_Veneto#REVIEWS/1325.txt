Wonderful hotel.  We stayed here after a 12 day cruise which ended in Venice.  The location was fantastic.  Breakfast was searched on a terrace where we had a view across the Grand Canal.  Our room was spacious - very spacious for Europe in my view with a small "foyer" area in the room that could be closed off from the bedroom.  That seemed left from another age to allow privacy to the lady in the room if the hotel staff came to provide service or drop off/pick up bags.  Full length mirrors were also nice to have and not always available so those were welcome.  The room was clean, comfortable and we both had a good night's sleep for our first stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 24, 2014Dear Guest, Thank you for your feedback on our hotel.
