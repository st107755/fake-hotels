Had a great time at this hotel. Excellent location in an upscale area opposite the grand canal and near St. Marcs square. Very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable staff. Very nice breakfast area on the canal. Would definitely recommend it for people looking for a quiet classical hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
