Had one night here post cruise. Hotel is right on the Grand Canal only a couple of hundred yards from St Marks Sq.  Old hotel with lots of character. All staff could not have been more helpful. We had dinner and breakfast outside on the side of the canal and watched the world go by. Adequate size bedroom with separate sitting room. Got a bit of a shock at price of G & T but it is a long time since I bought one in London's West End so probably comparable. Excellent dinner too. Would return here if back in Venice. Water taxi was a bit hair raising to airport as we did it in 25 minutes I think 45 is more the norm.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 17, 2016Dear Guest, we are honored that you rated the Bauer Palazzo the best Hotel you've ever stayed!!
