We stayed at this hotel in December, it was a lovely stay.  On checking in we were given a room that was next to the lift shaft, this w loud and quite small so I complained and the following hour we were upgraded to a beautiful suite, with 1 bedroom, living area and two bathrooms.  The hotel was in a fabulous location, however this was my 6th trip to Venice following living there in there in 06' and I found it quite busy and do prefer to stayin the more secluded areas.  This was a lovely trip and the hotel was more than accommodating, I would happily stay again!Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 22, 2012We would like to thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and pleased to note your satisfaction with your accommodation and the service.
