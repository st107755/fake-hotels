august 2005,stayed at the il palazzo for a long weekend for our wedding anniversary, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we could not fault our treatment. We booked a king canal view room,which was very clean and had just been recarpeted, the room was lovely with great views of the grand canal., We cannot praise the hotel and the staff enough, we did not experience any rude staff in the hotel but plenty outside of it when we went out for a meal,if you really want to relax and spoil youselves this is the hotel ,breakfast served in your room is a luxury and experience not to be missed. All in all an unforgetable experience in an unforgetable place.
