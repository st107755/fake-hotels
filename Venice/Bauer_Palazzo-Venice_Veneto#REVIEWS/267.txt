The Bauer is a beautifully appointed and superbly located hotel--perhaps the best place you can be in Venice. The hotel has its own berth on the Grand Canal, and it is next door to San Marco and the best stores and boutiques. Its outdoor cafe provides a wonderful place to eat, and its indoor bar has great ambience and great food.     The service is outstanding--from getting a massage to setting tours and getting train tickets. It is not cheap, but it is worth every penny, pfenig or Euro. We would recommend it to anyone who comes to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 2, 2018Dear Guest Michael W,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience on this portal.
