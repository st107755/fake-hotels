The hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location. It’s only a 5 minute walk to San Marco. The hotel staff is extremely professional. The room was amazing. Very large King bed and a sitting area with a huge bathroom. The B BAR on the roof is very expensive ($40 for 2 drinks) but the view is worth it for one drink. The hotel is located right on the Grand Canal and the rooftop view overlooks the beautiful La Salute Church. The room comes with a terrific breakfast as well. You can’t go wrong with this hotel choice!Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 8, 2019Dear Ndlaw89,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo.
