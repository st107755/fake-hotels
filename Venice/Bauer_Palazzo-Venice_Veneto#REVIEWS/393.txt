Venice was our first landing point for our Italian vacation so we wanted to treat ourselves. What a treat this hotel provided. Great service, fantastic restaurant  and staff not to mention our beautiful suite which was huge. Our own entrance, sitting room, two bathrooms, large bedroom and walk in robe. Compared to other places we stayed at on Italy this was by far our favourite.  Also they have an amazing roof top bar for guests with some of the best views of Venice. Highly recommend a stay at this hotel.
