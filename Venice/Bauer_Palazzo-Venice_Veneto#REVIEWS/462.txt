Hotel Bauer is almost an institution in Venice. Modern building close to San Marco. I stayed there for an event during the Biennale opening. Perfect style, food is also great and professional service. The terrace on the laguna with a stunning view on Punta della Dogana is a great plus.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
