We stayed here for 4 days and had a truly wonderful time. From the service at Reception on checking -in, the view from the bedroom, to the cheerfulness of the Housekeeping, the great service for breakfast and lastly for the fantastic views from the terrace at breakfast/dinner and the roof-top bar at night, our stay was delightful. To add to the pleasure the weather was lovely as well. Will definitely be back.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 1, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
