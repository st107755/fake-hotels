This is a high quality hotel. It is a large hotel so the boutique service provided at smaller hotels is not evident. I enjoyed our 4 nights at this hotel. The breakfasts are good. There are many people at breakfast time and I think there is room for improvement to ensure a high class service is provided. Perhaps the breakfast buffet should be spread over more tables so that less people are concentrated in a small area. It is clean and well serviced. Loved Venice and the location of this hotel is superb!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 4, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
