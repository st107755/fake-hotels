For many months prior to our vacation we tried getting in touch with the hotel to no avail no one ever responded to anything we sent.  Our stay was nice the staff wonderful but again trying to get a refund on a gondola tour we paid for but didn't take we are getting silence once again.  Not very pleased wi this hotel at all. And the first night we stayed there the maid knocked on our door at 9 pm we told her we didn't need service that evening so she came back at 10 pm and walked right in our room, that wasn't good either.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015Dear Guest, we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with the TA readers, we were happy to have you at the Bauer Hotel and we hope to have you back in the future. I did investigate about your feedback and I involved both booking and concierge departments. I found correspondence on the same day between you and the concierge about possible transportation solution. For what concern the gondola ride, nothing has been charged according to our record; in case of request prior arrival (booked via our website or via e.mail) we require guests to reconfirm it once at the Hotel in order to fix the time as well. For the inconvenience of the turndown service, please accept our apologies, I could think of a misunderstand with our maid; I passed the information to the department concerned in order to avoid future similar situation. We remain at disposal for any futher information. Best regards Piero MagrinoRead more
