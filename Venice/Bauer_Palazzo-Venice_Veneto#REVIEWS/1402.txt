This hotel has it all…glamour, style, location, quality, serviceability. Must admit I have seen many good hotels and this is one of best I’ve been to.  Perfectly located, footsteps away from Pza. St. Marco, Harry's Bar and on the Grand Canal. Rooms are huge and well decorated.  The rumor has it that Tom Ripley spends his time here, when in Venice. Hope to come again soon!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
