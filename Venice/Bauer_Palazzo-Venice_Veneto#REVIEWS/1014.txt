Upon check in we received an upgrade to a canal view suite. A fantastic room with a small balcony that looked out over the main canal and the properties dining areas. Very well appointed room and bathroom, with twice daily service. The front desk and greeting personal especially Roberto were very nice and a great help as it was our first time in Venice. The adjoining property across the canal is worth going to as it has a large garden area and is very peaceful to sit outside at there restaurant area. Would definitely stay again! Great breakfast on the top deck of hotel. Main restaurant has dining right on the water with great food and very attentive staff.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 5, 2015Dear Guests,    We would like to thank you for taking the time to share your comments on your stay at the Hotel Bauer Il Palazzo.
