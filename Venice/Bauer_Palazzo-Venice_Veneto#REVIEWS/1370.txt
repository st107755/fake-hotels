This hotel is located not far from Piazza San Marcos and a lot of shops and restaurants. Our room and bathroom were fairly large with a balcony overlooking a smaller canal. The decor was a little old fashioned. It was fun watching the gondolas come and go up and down the canal. The hotel staff was very helpful and polite. The breakfast had an ok selection and we enjoyed eating lunch on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
