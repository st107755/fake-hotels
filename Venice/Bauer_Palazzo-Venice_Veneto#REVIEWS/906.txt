We spent just one night at this charming hotel overlooking the Canal Grande. We were granted an upgrade and stayed in a beautiful room with partial view of the Canal, lots of space, a very large marble bathroom equipped with both bath and shower, very quiet, no smell despite silk tapestry on the wall and full carpet. And the toiletries were very good, too. Do go and ask for a room in the old part of the hotel - the Palazzo. Do not miss a visit to Assouline, the lovely bookshop opened in the hall of the Bauer hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 11, 2015Dear Guest, despite your short visit we are happy to know that the overall experience has been succesful and that the style of the Hotel met your taste. At the Bauer Palazzo we have several categories of rooms, divided in Hotel Wing and Palazzo Wing. Different styles to be able to meet different taste and expectations. Toiletries are unique and manufactured especially for Bauer Palazzo: another interesting story to tell to our guests. Looking forward to welcome you back at the Bauer Palazzo.
