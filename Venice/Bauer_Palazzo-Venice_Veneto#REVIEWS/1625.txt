So when they say Casanova, it isn't the nicer of the buildings.  I didn't know it was a separate building at all.  I did feel a little bit of a pariah going to the adult's hotel for breakfast buffet but man, was the buffet amazing.  Even if they aren't the friendliest of the bunch, the hotel is very well designed, the rooms are beautiful and the location is unbeatable.  Wifi for the entire trip is only 20 Euro.  Not per day.  Plus they have free wifi in the lobby.  Its a beautiful hotel and maybe nicer than the Ritz Carlton.  I just wished they were a little more friendlyRead moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 19, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your review of The Bauer Casa Nova.
