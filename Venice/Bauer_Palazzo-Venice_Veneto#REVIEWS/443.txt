Just visited the Bauer for three nights with my wife and two college age children.  Had a beautiful suite with a king bed in one room and two twins in the other connected room.  The room was on the corner of the building with a canal view and view of the church next door.   Directly across from us were the Feragamo, Prada etc.   with gondolas right out the front door.  The Bauer has its own dock so made our arrival from the train so easy and comfortable, no dragging your luggage through town.  Breakfast everyday was on the terrace which fronts the Grand Canal.  Great food and beautiful views.  Staff are all pleasant and attentive without being pretentious.   Do not miss this hotel my favorite in Venice.  Will definitely stay there again next time in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 4, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
