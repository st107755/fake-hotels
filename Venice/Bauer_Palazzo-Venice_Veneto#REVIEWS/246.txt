Toured Crotia and ended it in Venice. The tour company selected zThe Bauer Palazzo. There are 2 Bauer hotels in Venice. With one just 1/4 mile fro St Mark square. The hotel chosen for us was the 2nd hotel across the canal from the mb ain island. At first I was disappointed but after seeing the rooms and surrounding grounds,  I was more than happy. The Bauer has it's own boat to shuttle people between the 2 hotels. So we had the advantage of space with close prox6to all the f as mouse spots on the island.  Service was wonderful and food great. Rooms were charming and comfortable.  Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 28, 2018Dear Michael L,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay in our property in Giudecca Island, Bauer Palladio Hotel & SPA.
