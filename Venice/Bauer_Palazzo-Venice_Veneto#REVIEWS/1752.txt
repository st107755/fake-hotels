I did ot have an upgraded room, but still had partial canal view and city view.  Brocade and other luxururious fabrics on beds and chairs.  Could have stayed in the bathroom forever.  While sitting in a sitting room, a party from the middle east came in, all in traditional dress, very Chic sheik!!  Loved the view over the canal at breakfast.  A true splurge for me.Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 9, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
