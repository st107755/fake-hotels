Our Casa Nova annex is generally praised by our guests for its privilege location, quiet environment and proximity to St. Mark's Square. In your particular case, your reservation for a Casa Nova Double Room was also upgraded to a Casa Nova Suite prior your arrival, and we are truly sorry you didn't enjoyed your room as much as we wished. Our staff offered to show you a different room further your request, but never got a feedback from you later during your stay.   We apologize for the inconvenience occured in the bathroom, but we need to inform you that the water flooding around the Hotel is a natural phenomenon called "high tide", or "acqua alta", for which we unfortunately have no control over.  We truly hope we will have the privilege to welcoming you back to our property and that we will have the change your feelings towards this first experience.   Kind regards,  Martina Carlon Guest Relation Coordinator Read more
