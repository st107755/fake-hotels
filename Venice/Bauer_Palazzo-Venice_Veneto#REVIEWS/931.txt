This was my 2rd stay at the hotel...beautiful, relaxing and a great location. Views from our room of the Grand Canel couldn't be beat! The staff was very acccommodating and and always available to assistant. The breakfast offered on the 7th floor terrace was a nice touch to start the day. We would not hesitate to return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 25, 2015Dear Guest, we are very happy and proud that the Bauer Palazzo will be again your residence in Venice during your future trip.
