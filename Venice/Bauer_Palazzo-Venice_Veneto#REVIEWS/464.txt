Our trip to Italy was very busy and hectic until we arrived in Venice. We were finally able to relax and sleep in at this beautiful hotel! What a wonderful place to stay. Top notch rooms, views and service. The richest experience I have ever received. The bathroom in our room was all marble with heated towel racks. The view from our room was spectacular as well as a wonderful breakfast wit a roof top breathtaking view of Venice. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. An experience we will never forget!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 13, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
