Although we have visited Venice before it was our first stay at the Bauer. It's a wonderful hotel. The staff are all very professional. We visited with our son and daughter in law. They loved the hotel especially breakfasting on the terrace. Breakfast choice was amazing. We had wonderful rooms on the second floor. The shower was the best ever. Most definitely will stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear Guests,   We thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
