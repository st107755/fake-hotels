The Bauer has a great location on the Grand Hotel. Loved being able to take a boat right to the lobby. Having breakfast out on the beautiful terrace overlooking the water was awesome. They also have a fabulous rooftop bar for hotel guests only, expensive but worth it. On the other hand, the rooms were dated and not in the condition I would expect at a hotel on that level. The rugs were stained, there were large rust stains on the marble tub and a rip in the bathroom curtain. The public spaces were beautiful but the rooms could use a little TLC.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 10, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
