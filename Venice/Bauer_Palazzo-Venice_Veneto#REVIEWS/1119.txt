We really enjoyed our stay in Venice. The Hotel was perfectly located only 2 minutes from St Mark's Square and the hotel terrace overlooking the grand canal. The staff were polite and very helpful, breakfast was excellent. We did not have a view from our room but we did book when on offer so no complaint. There is also a sister hotel where you can dine or relax in their peaceful gardens it is on island the other side of canal with free hotel water taxi usually every 30 minutes. We shall definitely stay here again.
