We stayed in Room 334, on the 3rd floor, with partial views out on to the square and canal below.  Built in the 1700s, this lovely hotel is about 5 minutesâ€™ walk from St Marcs Square.  Our superior suite was spacious and comfortable: roomier than what we have experienced in other European hotels.  The room was beautifully  clean, although the carpet is somewhat tired.   The staff are friendly and professional.  Water taxis are available from the door of the hotel.   Breakfast on the gorgeous canal water side terrace is a must, with views out onto the splendid Venetian shoreline.  Charming potted plants soften the bright stone courtyard, which has bright red umbrellas to shade from the sun.   We truly recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 9, 2019Dear Susan,   We wish to thank you for your kind and extensive feedback on your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo.
