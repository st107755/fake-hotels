From ck in to ck out, our weekend in Venice at The Bauer Palazzo was AMAZING! The staff is super attentive, the accommodations are so upscale and beautiful. I was speechless. (I have been to Venice before and all over Europe, this was old world at its best!)   We were just steps from Piazza San Marco, and it was very convenient to go back to the room to nap, change or drop off packages. The vaperetto (taxi/water bus) is also steps away. And the most amazing part is their BREAKFAST, Right on the CANAL! I had to pinch myself!
