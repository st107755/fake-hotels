After a memorable trip to the Bauer in 2010, we returned in 2011 and enjoyed another four wonderful nights at this elegant Venetian grande dame!    I cannot think of enough good things to say about this Hotel and can barely think of any negatives.  Gorgeous rooms (at a price), impeccable staff, fabulous food and a wonderful location - the epitome of Venetian style and charm.   Roll on 2012!Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 12, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kinds words about your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
