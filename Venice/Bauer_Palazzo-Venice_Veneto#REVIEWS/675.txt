We searched many Hotels in Venice for our Anniversary stay and so glad that we have decided to stay in Bauer . Perfect location for any route you would like to take in Venice, very convenient for the water taxi too . The rooms are beautiful with amazing views ( ask for the Canal view rooms ) , service excellent , very attentive and helpful. They have access to the best Restaurant booking even those that require advanced booking. I thought it was more for just couples but after staying at Bauer we decided to bring our kids on our next trip to Venice and stay in this Hotel.
