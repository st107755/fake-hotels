We stayed at the Bauer to be close to the Teatro La Fenice as we attended the New Year’s Concert.  Wonderful rooms in the historic part of the hotel, overlooking the Canal Grande. Well equipped and a nice bathroom.  The staff is very pleasant and the concierges are champions. Despite e-mail communication problems, Jean-Pierre organized our transfer from Marco Polo Airport to the Hotel perfectly, and what a great way it is to arrive by private boat. Unfortunately, the New Year’s Eve Buffet was a big disappointment for us. The room is not really adapted for a festive occasion and the buffet and quality of preparation did  not live up to the importance of the event.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 4, 2019Dear Jeanpierref879,  Thank you for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo!
