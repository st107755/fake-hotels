From the moment we walked in our room you wanted to cry because the view was so incredible. Our view was of the Grand Canal and a small canal that connect to other sites.

The hotel is so beautiful and close to Saint Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: May 2007HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Il Palazzo to spend your holidays in Venice.
