From the moment we were dropped off by water taxi directly into the lobby to the time we left the staff were professional, attentive, helpful ... what more can I say. We checked in and were shown to the room booked by our travel agent.  Sadly it did not have the view we had anticipated (and specified) but this was not the fault of the hotel and they were quick to accommodate us on the 7th floor in a luxurious room with a terrace, sun loungers and a view of the Grand Canal.  There was an additional charge for all this extra enjoyment, but that was as expected.  Early check in/ late check out and great service from the Housekeeping staff.  Our stay was entirely satisfactory.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
