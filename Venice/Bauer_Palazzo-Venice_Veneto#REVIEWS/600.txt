Wow, fantastic location within easy walking distance of St. Mark's Square.  Get a room facing the Grand Canal such as room 307.  What a view, and the window opens so you can here the sounds of the gondola singers as they go by.  First class all the way.  There are actually a couple of hotels in one. We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo to get the Canal facing room.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 15, 2016Dear Stephen, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
