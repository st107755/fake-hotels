Wonderful hotel. Expensive and worth every penny. Great service from all staff. Wonderful breakfast with excellent service and incredible views and ambiance, sitting on the Grand Canal.  The hotel is an easy walk or taxi ride everywhere. If you want your clothes ironed, bring your own travel iron or steamer. The hotel does not provide for them in bedrooms and insists that pressing must be done through the valet.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 28, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel, and we are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay here and that we having been able to meet your expectations.
