You couldn't find a better hotel in Venice: great location close to  St Marks Square (2 minutes) & overlooking the Grand Canal. There are actually 2 Bauer's - a 1940's hotel accessed from the street, which backs onto the 18c Palazzo, which is accessed from the Grand Canal. The Palazzo is magnificent. The reception staff are lovely, welcoming & extremely helpful. The "trek" to our room was a tad disappointing; we didn't mind the distance, nor the separate lifts (it's an old building, after all), but the corridors are unattractive & boring; but our room was beyond description. We had a corner duel aspect room, overlooking the Grand Canal with a wrap around balcony & the views were perfect. We have no hesitation in recommending the Palazzo for a romantic trip to Venice - it's worldâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 5, 2015Dear Guests,    we thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us.
