Great location near St Mark's Square. Room was wonderful, everything you need and more. Marble bath had window in shower overlooking grand canal along with views from every window. Expensive but worth the service amenities. Meals were outrageously expensive and not worth it except for convenience. Early morning flight out was no problem. Desk arranged everything.  Wonderful and would stay again.
