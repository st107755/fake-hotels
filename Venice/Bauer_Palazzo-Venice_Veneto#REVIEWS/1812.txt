We stayed in Bauer for 4 nights including the New Years. The stay was a perfect Venetian vacation. The place has a sense of a genuine palazzo without being rusty.  Location is hard to beat.  Right on the Grand Canal with St Marco Sq only a couple of blocks away.  The staff was very attentive and constantly delivered as expected and more. The room was clean and just right size to be very cozy, but luxurious at the same time.  We asked for a room with the Grand Canal view and it was well worth it.  Simply spectacular!!! Perhaps the only thing which they could improve is the brekfast menu, which was somewhat boring and with a limited selection. Otherwise, I would strongly recommend the place.Read moreDate of stay: January 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Il Palazzo.
