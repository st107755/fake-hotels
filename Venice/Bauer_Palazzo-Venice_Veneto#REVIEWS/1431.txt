To be frank, I don't agree with most of the reviews on here and perhaps it's a personal thing but I thought I would voice my opinion.  We stayed at the Bauer for 4 nights in the summer and what I can say that if you want a typical Venice experience then feel free to stay here and I'm sure you'll have a good time.  However, when we stayed we payed around 800 a night for our rooms and I have to say I've stayed in 3 star hotels that the service was better in. I'm not sure how most people are on holiday but when I am away I'm not in 'showing off' mode (here's a drink to you, 10 bob millionaires) but the staff seem to think you should be. So excuse me for not donning a Prada miniskirt and Gucci Blazer, you see I'm not entirely comfortable in 40 degree heat and would rather wear…Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 22, 2013Dear Guest I am sorry that your say at IL PALAZZO did not live up to your expectations. I imagine that your dissatisfaction is motivated by our Restaurant’s dinner dress code, which some guests – during the hot summer months – find restrictive. Thanks to our guest’s feedback we have now changed our policy and - while long slacks and closed shoes are still a requirement -  a jacket is not. We have also trained our staff to communicate our policy with utmost care and consideration in order not to upset our guests’ sensitivity. What I would like to underline, however, is that at IL PALAZZO we do not express any judgment on our guest’s personal taste or style. Everyone is welcome here and made feel welcome. This said, I hope you will give us an opportunity in the future of regaining your faith in the high level of hospitality we strive to offer to our guests.  Best Regards, Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
