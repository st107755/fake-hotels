I guess we were in the main building and it was amazing. Very modern and so beautifully decorated.  they came in once to clean room then at night came in again and turned down the outside shade and made bed - great service. Buffet breakfast was delicious.  Only complaint 5 euros for bottle water in refig when down the walk a small restaurant charge 1 euro for same water to go -  Great shuttle across canal every 30 min. - Fabulous grounds - truly amazing.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 28, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
