The Bauer hotel gets a bit of an unfair review in most travel books - often referred to as a modern monstrosity; however, that's more than a bit unfair.  Yes, it's modern but it doesn't encroach on its space and is fairly unpretentious from the outside.  Its location is second to none - overlooking the Grande Canal and a small side canal, and just 5 mins walk from the Piazzo San Marco.  Drinks/breakfast/dinner can be enjoyed on the terrace with the most spectacular view.  Yes, like most hotels of this rating - its expensive to stay, eat and drink but for a special occasion then absolutely worth it, although we didn't eat dinner there, so I can't vouch for that.  Make sure you opt for bed and breakfast as the breakfast is superb and costs Euro50 plus per person if you payâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 11, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind words.
