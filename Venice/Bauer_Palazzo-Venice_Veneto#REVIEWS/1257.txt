The only place that was nice about this Hotel was where the breakfast and dinner was served, overlooking the water and the location was good. However my room was old, smelled moldy, bathroom was dull so if a female needed extra lighting for hair and make-up, forget it. My view was of a very high wall and it was about 8 feet from the window which made it look like it was late in the afternoon, even in the mornings. Room service was terrible, I phoned and phoned for a wake up call at 5.45am, no one answered, finally had to go to reception myself, then the wake-up call came at 6.55am, phoned room service, again no answer!! The breakfast and dinner staff were pleasant. One bar staff was not pleasant. Air-conditioning was noisy and it would not turn off.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
