This was one of my favorite hotels during my trip to Italy.  The staff was helpful and welcoming.  The room was an  adequate size for my friend and I, we appreciated the nightly turndown service.  Good breakfast with a variety of selections. The hotel is the perfect location to explore Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 27, 2018Dear SoCal16,  We would like to thank you for your kind and detailed feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
