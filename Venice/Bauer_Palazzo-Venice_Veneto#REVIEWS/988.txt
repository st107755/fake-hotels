I have just spent three night at this superb hotel! The location is excellent right at Canal Grande - and the terrace is a wonderful place to sit and relax and enjoy the view. The kitchen is top notch and we really enjoyed the splendid dinner and delicious breakfast. We had to pay for WiFi and use of gym - should be free of charge (and would have received 5 stars if included) Hopefully we will be back ;-)Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2015Dear Guests,   We thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
