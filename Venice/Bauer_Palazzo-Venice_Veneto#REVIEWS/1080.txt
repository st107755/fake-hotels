The hotel is so expensive, and not up to the standard of five stars hotels.  Rooms are very small; I paid 1000 Euro per night in the period from 05/05/2015 to 08/05/2015.  Breakfast is so limited. If you need you to have another type of egg, you have to pay.  Rooms are do not have noise reduction windows, however, they provide you with ear plug!!!!!   Staff are not friendly.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Guests,   Our hotel is located in the heart of Venice, it is just at five minutes walking from St Mark’s square, the main entrance is on Campo San Moisé with its wonderful church, The Grand Canal Bar and the restaurant “De Pisis” offer a view overlooking the Grand Canal, San Giorgio’s island, Punta della Dogana and the Chiesa della Salute.
