Prior to a cruise, Seabourn put us up at The Bauer Il Palazzo.  Wish we would have stayed longer - the room was breathtaking with ceiling frescos and Murano chandeliers.  We had a late breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal which transformed us immediately from the long trip to total relaxation.  Good food, good service, great room.  We will definitely go back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
