We booked the Bauer based on TA reviews, they were spot on. Our rooms were in the Cassanova section,and we were pleased. The only thing is no view, but we were not in our rooms long enough to worry. The room was neat, very cozy, the staff were all very friendly,and their English was perfect. The breakfast buffet was also a pleasant surprise. The bar was a cozy little corner to relax, and the outside terrace had incredible views. A two minute walk brought us to St Marks square. Plenty of shopping and the gondola rides were right out front.
