Superb location is within short walking distance of San Marco square and faces the water.  We arrived by gondola "curbside" to the hotel.  Breakfast room also faces the water.  Downer for me was that my room had windows out to a several story high atrium of sorts...not at all an attractive view. The room itself was very nice and hotel service quite good.  I stayed there in April, 2014.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 31, 2015Dear Guests,   we thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay at the Bauer Hotel and we appreciate your useful comments which help us to improve and satisfy all our guests.
