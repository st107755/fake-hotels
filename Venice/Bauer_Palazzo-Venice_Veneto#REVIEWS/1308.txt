My wife and I had dinner at their terrace dining room last week and agreed the food was really bad.  I had the fish tempura which was actually not as good as the frozen fish fillets available from my local super market in the USA. My wife had a different fish selection and said it also was terrible. We shared an appetizer between us and had a bottle of grossly overpriced white wine.  The tab (service not included) was 174 euros, (no coffee, no dessert because we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible). If you want to have a better dining experience and are willing to pay these prices I suggest you go a few doors down to either the Europa and Regina or Gritti Palace.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
