This hotel is excellent. The whole ambience is luxury. The decor the staff and the dining terrace make this something special. This high class hotel has a lovely family feel. The food is stunning. Visiting Venice try this hotel. The Sister hotel the Palazzo across the water is a world apart. Lunch in the garden was peaceful and the staff there were as welcoming and the food as good.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 12, 2018Dear Stevo2010,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Bauer Palazzo.
