A beautiful hotel in the heart of Venice.  Fabulous marble, linens and silk wallpaper. Wonderful location to St. Marks and our favorite restaurant Vino, Vino Wine bar near the theater. Breakfast and lunch right on the Grand Canal.  Rooftop bar in the evening to get away from the crowds. Tip, take a shared water taxi from the airport, book on viatour in advance and have some Euros with you to tip.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 3, 2018Dear Mbolotte,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
