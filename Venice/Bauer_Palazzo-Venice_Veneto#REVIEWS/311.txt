The Bauer Palazzo is a five star hotel, but just barely.  It has a great location, large rooms for the money and a professional, helpful staff.  But it is dated with old, plain furnishings in poorly laid out rooms.   Like it probably was 30-40 years ago. For example, no room key cards, actual keys.  No safe with push-button combinations, but with actual keys (which you must then hide). Small TV's with poor reception. Our spacious room had a shower that wasn't much bigger than a phone booth.  The breakfast buffet was sub-par, although sitting outside on the canal made up for it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 21, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
