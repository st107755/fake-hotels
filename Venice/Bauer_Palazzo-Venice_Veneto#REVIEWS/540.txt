We went to the second hotel, outside the palazzo (access through a side door), but the breakfast (for instance) was inside the palazzo, with a great view of the basilica.

Nothing to regret, only to enjoy.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 22, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
