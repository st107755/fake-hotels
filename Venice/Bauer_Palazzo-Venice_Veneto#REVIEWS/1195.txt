Hotel Bauer is a great place to stay if your main goal is to explore the City of Venice. It’s a short walk to St. Mark’s Square, Teatro la Fenice as well as other city highlights. The bar and restaurant also offer great views of San Giorgio Maggiore and Basilica di Santa Maria. Right outside the front entrance there is a gondola station that takes you on a 30 minute cruise in the little canals as well as the Grand Canal. We had dinner out on the town but lunch at the hotel was superb. My only aversions with Hotel Bauer is its attitude and wi-fi. It seems like a hotel that is trying too hard to be up scale and I was not pleased to pay 20+ Euros for a shotty, at-best, wi-fi connection.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 23, 2014Dear Guest, We are delighted to read so many positive comments and are grateful for your annotations which will be kept in high consideration, helping us to improve our standards.
