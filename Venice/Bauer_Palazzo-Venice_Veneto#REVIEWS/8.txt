My partner and I spent three nights at Bauer Palazzo. The hotel is in a great location, and we loved spending the mornings on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. The concierge, Paulo, was incredibly knowledgable. We loved listening to his stories, and his help making restaurant bookings made our trip absolutely carefree. The entire staff is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend staying here!Read moreDate of stay: August 2020HelpfulShare Response from Bauer Palazzo, Servizi per gli ospiti/front office at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2020Dear Alanna,  We would like to thank you for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
