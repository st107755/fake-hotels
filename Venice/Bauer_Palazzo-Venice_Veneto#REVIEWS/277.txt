This is the second time we stayed here, overall great location, amazing service.  Rooms: traditional old style.  Try to stay in the palazzo building.  It has a small lobby and better access to the water taxi.  Also great concierge service.  Location: great location, walking distance to everything.  Service: top notch  Very romantic place.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 22, 2018Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for reviewing your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
