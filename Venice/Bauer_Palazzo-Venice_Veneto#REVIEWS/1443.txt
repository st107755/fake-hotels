I think this historical palace deserves the wow factor in venice,.. Yes the lobby is not big enough to relax but I liked the antique touches in the library..  We have stayed in a junior suite canal view, it was so spacious,charming,luxurious with stunning canal view through the surrounded large windows. I liked the gold plated touches in the bathroom with its huge jaccuzi ..  I didn't try the hotel's restaurant but I had the breakfast in the roof of the hotel , the buffet was kept in a narrow corner with limited passage area and I think there should be more food varieties in the buffet to meet the 5 stars hotel standards..  The staff of the hotel were very friendly and polite..  My overall experience in this hotel was great..Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 2, 2013Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
