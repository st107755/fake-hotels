We stayed two nights at the Bauer and were very pleased with our experience. The hotel is well situated near San Marco square and fabulous shops to browse. We had a nice, but small room (ok, it's Venice) overlooking a canal. Our room was well apportioned and comfortable. We visited during a hot weekend, and the room was adequately cool throughout our stay. Our reception and concierge experiences were very favorable. We actually previewed a number of rooms before selecting one, which is always nice. For dinner reservations and entertainment recommendations, concierge staff were attentive and helpful. Breakfast each morning on the terrace was lovely. The buffet is very nice and the view fantastic. We would highly recommend a stay at this property when visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel, we are delighted to learn that you had the most amazing time at our hotel as this is exactly the type of experience we endeavour to achieve for each and every guest.
