Stayed there 4 nights (we had 2 rooms) during our Grand Tour.  The concierges went above and beyond the call of duty--needed a dr. prescription and the concierge arranged for an MD to visit my room in less than an hour!  They also made last-minute dinner reservations at some very exclusive restaurants.  Rooms luxurious--our views could've been better but we at least could see some water off in the distance. Breakfast buffet was excellent.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 22, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
