I visited during my honeymoon and was very disappointed.  We were in a deluxe suite room and there were stains on the couch, the glass on the front of the TV stand was broken and the room smelled musty.  It was difficult getting the guy at the front desk to move us to a new room but eventually he did.  The next room was better but the whole situation was unfortunate and not at all what I would have expected of a hotel of this caliber.  The service (other than the initial guy at the front desk) and location were very good.  Unfortunately, I will not stay again on my next visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 19, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
