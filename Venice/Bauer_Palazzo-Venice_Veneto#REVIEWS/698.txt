From the moment we arrived we were glad we chose Bauer Palazzo. We were dropped right to the entrance at the grand canal..  Our rooms have a partial view of the Grand Canal. The terrace and rooftop have great views. We can walk anywhere in Venice and find our way back.  The amenities are fabulous. The rooms are a little tired but that is part of their charm. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Bauer Palace.
