Hotel Bauer upgraded us to a very beautiful, modern suite overlooking a gondola filled side canal.  Staff was friendly, location fantastic, and the patio on the Grand Canal was a very beautiful spot for an evening cocktail!   The wireless internet connection was slightly slow in the lobby, but a very minor detail in an otherwise relaxing, enjoyable 3 day stay.  We found the hotel very quiet and within a few steps away from hundreds of  local Italian eateries and shops.  You could watch the Gondolas for hours just a few feet outside the lobby windows!     Would definitely return!Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 4, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
