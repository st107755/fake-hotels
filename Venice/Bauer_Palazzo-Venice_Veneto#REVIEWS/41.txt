I am Very disappointed of what I ve found after 5 years. It was used to be an exclusive, perfect hotel. From the quality of breakfast nowadays you already understand the level where it is now. Everything was very cheap and tasteless. Where are the good italian patisserie or the good cheese and prosciutto???? Itâ€™ s time for a restyling in every single way.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 29, 2019Dear Globetrotter Gourmet,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
