Beautiful and very elegant hotel.Magnificent lobby. Terrace with a beatiful view of the Canal. Excellent transportation to and from airport and train station and to all the main sights in Venice (private, public). The staff and the concierge were extremely helpful. We experienced a "high tide" and the hotel acted in the most professional and perfect way. The rooms are rather small and basic. Frankly, I expected much more elegance from such an expensive 5 star hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 14, 2015Dear Guests,  we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
