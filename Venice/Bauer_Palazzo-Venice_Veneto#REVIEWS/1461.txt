We had a great 2 night stay in Il Palazzo.  We had two connecting rooms, which always adds to the enjoyment on a family holiday.  The service at the hotel was charming and gracious, and the location was superb.  We enjoyed drinks on the terrace looking out on the grand hotel.  The rooms were very nice -- period rooms but not worn.  The bathrooms were large.  The blinds darkened the room completely.  We stayed at similarly classed, 5 star hotels, in Florence and Rome, but this was by far the best.  Our only regret was not staying longer.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
