Had three nights here, returning after a stay many years ago. The Bauer continues to delight! The hotel exudes old fashioned elegance and grandeur. Located just along from St. Marks, with Grand Canal frontage and direct access by water taxi.  The welcome from the staff starts as you step off the boat and continues everywhere. Concierge team will make all the recommendations for visits, lunches and dinner you need, and will book them all for you! Rooms are grand, stylish with lovely bathrooms, comfy big beds.....and evening turn down service. Breakfast by the Grand Canal is both delicious and a visual treat. Cannot recommend this hotel high enough and thanks to all the team who made it a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 3, 2013Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
