I stayed in this small charming hotel with my sister and my mother. Initially we ordered a superior room but at arrival hotel has upgraded our room to a junior suite for free. Hospitality is high, we were treated so good. Hotel personnel is very polite, smiling and we felt comfortable. Room was so elegant and this hotel is the only that has a terrace restaurant. The view is crazy beautiful. Breakfast, elegant room, personnel, everything was great. Hotel is in the center and easy to get all interesting places of Venice on foot. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone whether you travel alone, with your lover or a family.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 23, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
