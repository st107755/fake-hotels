I get it, the location is good.. Its right near all the high end brands, but I don't get the reviews. The hotel looks like and is setup like it was out of the middle ages. Its right in the dead center of the worst tourist trap imaginable, the rooms are old.. I mean like medieval looking old and smell moldy. Due to the location and quality of staff I could see paying US $400 maybe, but for $1000 a night I expected to be blown away... Far from it. So glad I didn't book extra days here. This is a good value at a couple hundred a night, at $1000.00 you will feel cheated.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 24, 2014Dear guest,  I regret we did not fulfill your expectations on occasion of your recent visit at IL PALAZZO.  Built as a hotel in 1860, our property was modeled after the ancient Venetian Palaces flanking the Grand Canal and in the eyes of many of our affectionate clients this is our beauty and charm. I do appreciate the fact, however, that not all guests’ desires and expectations are the same. On occasion of your next visit to Venice I would like to recommend our sister property the PALLADIO Resort, located on the Giudecca – away from the ‘tourist madness’, an oasis of peace – accessible, yet secluded. We hope to have the pleasure of your return visit at BAUER hotels again in the future. Should this be the case, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.  Yours sincerely  Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
