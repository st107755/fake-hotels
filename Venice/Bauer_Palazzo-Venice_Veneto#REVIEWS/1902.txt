Everything about our hotel stay was perfect.  The room was ready when we arrived early.  We received an upgrade at check-in.  The bed was so comfortable, and the room so dark, we slept 10 hours the first night.  The breakfast buffet was nice.  The concierge was very helpful, including his recommendation for dinner (Olive Nero - which was outstanding).  The staff was super friendly (check-in, concierge, bell-men, B-Bar and breakfast).  The robe and slippers were plush.  The room was very clean.  Finally, the location was great.  I would definitely stay here again and would for sure recommend to my friends.
