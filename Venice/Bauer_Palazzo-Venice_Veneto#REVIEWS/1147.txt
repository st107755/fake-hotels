Well where to start ? We ordered a suite which was perfect after flying in from the U.S.  Then the knock on the door, after we were unpacked, to tell us we had to move out ???  To entice us we were given the top floor penthouse apartment!!  My wife got the white marble bathroom and I got the black marvel bathroom .. ?  To say they were sorry for the inconvenience there were two dozen long stem white roses sitting in a crystal vase in the middle of the huge living room ( which overlooked the grand channel) Never knew what happens but they sure know how to solve it! Great start to a magical week in Venice.
