Had a 4 night stay at the end of April. Lovely hotel situated just a few minutes from St Marks square. The hotel is art deco in style and has a lovely terrace overlooking the Grand Canal where breakfast is taken.  Rooms are clean and comfortable and bed linen and towels changed each day.  All staff at the hotel were polite and helpful. Would definately stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 20, 2013Dear Guest   Thank you for your lovely review on Tripadvisor.
