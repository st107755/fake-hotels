When you arrive at Reception, directly off the motor launch from the airport, it's an absolute wow!!  The hotel is obviously high end luxury and the service is impeccable.  The bedrooms, though, are very average really, lacking many mod cons that you would expect of a luxury hotel.  No free water to drink, no tea/coffee making facilities, but nice and airy spaces.  Overall a great place to stay and would definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 3, 2018Dear Dicko188,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for letting us know what you truly enjoyed about your stay in our property.
