Due to a strike of Alitalia, our 3 day/2 night trip was shortened by one day. We checked with the airline and could move our tickets to a future date. A good idea, only the hotel would not agree to changing our reservation to a future date.  As we had booked 2 double rooms for 2 nights, we were very disappointed at the less than elegant response of the hotel.  Even our suggestion of a complimentary gesture to make up for the lost night (2 rooms including breakfast), the hotel was unwilling to even consider a friendly gesture. A good hotel, but we will not recommend it to fellow travelers.  Bauer is indeed a 5 star hotel, but their customer friendliness is far below 5 star standard.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 23, 2014Dear Guests,   I am sorry to read you had a bad experience with our Staff. Unfortunately, your reservation was prepaid through a “wholesaler” which means that we are unable to refund or change the dates. The only possibility to change your reservation or get a refund is through your Travel Agent, who is the only one who can authorize this change.   Of course when the booking is made directly with the hotel or is not pre-paid, changes are generally possible.   Please do not hesitate to contact me directly at prusconi@bauervenezia.it, should you require more information or should you wish to discuss further this issue.  We thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay at the Casa Nova Hotel.  Best regards,   Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
