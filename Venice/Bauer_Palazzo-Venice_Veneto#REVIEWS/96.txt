We arrived by boat to the back end of the hotel - interesting experience. The rooms were all beautifully decorated and very comfortable (we had 3). The location is very central to walking anywhere. Easy access to St. Mark's Square and shopping areas. Also close to getting boats to visit Murano/Burano. The breakfase is good, not outstanding. The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. Umbrellas always handy. Do recommend a stay here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 8, 2019Dear 24lorraineS,  We would like to thank you for choosing the Bauer Palazzo and for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay.
