We had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Bauer during a recent trip to Italy. It was our last stop in a 2 week tour across 5 cities. All I can say is WOW! The best was saved to last. Perfect location just off San Marco square.   Our hotel room was cleaned so well by the cleaning staff and breakfast had plenty of variety to choose from. Our flight got delayed and they provided us with a later check out. They also gave us access to their gym to clean up late in the evening before our very late departure left Venice.   Wifi was down a few times during our stay but other then that, perfecto!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind comments and for highlighting the positive features of the hotel.
