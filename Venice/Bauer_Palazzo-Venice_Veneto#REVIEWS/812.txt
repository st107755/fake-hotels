Our first visit to this hotel was ten years ago to celebrate my birthday, we come to Venice almost every year and stay in a variety of hotels and apartments but push the boat out to stay at the Bauer on special occasions. This is a superb hotel, the staff are great, the rooms are beautiful and the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is the largest in Venice with a fantastic view. St Marks Square is 2 minutes away and Harry's Bar is just around the corner. Our recent Bauer stay was wonderful, we particularly enjoyed the Jazz concert in the cocktail bar and the breakfasts.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 18, 2016Dear Guest, we are honored that you rated the Bauer Palazzo the best Hotel you've ever stayed!!
