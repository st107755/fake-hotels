Very good classic Venetian Hotel in a great location on the grand canal ideal for all locations .  I would advise that when you book be 100% sure of what you are booking , it is better to splash out a little and get a room in the old part of the hotel with a view it's very much worth the extra .

Wifi very good , breakfast adequate  Staff very friendly  Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 11, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
