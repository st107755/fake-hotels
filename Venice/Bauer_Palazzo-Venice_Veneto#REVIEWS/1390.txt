Excellent location for a hotel right on the Grand Canal overlooking the lagoon as well as near Piazza San Marco.  Starting the day on the 7th floor terrace for breakfast was wonderful.  Panoramic view while eating delicious food!  Staff at the hotel were most gracious at all times:  starting with the front desk, dining staff for all meals, room staff.  Antique furnishings in the large rooms, comfortable bedding, well-appointed bathrooms, bottled water in the rooms.....what more can you ask for to help you enjoy and explore a magical city like Venice.  Stayed for six days enjoying meals on the terraces.  View out of room was limited but other spaces in the hotel made up for it!  Expensive but well-worth it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
