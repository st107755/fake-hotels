The Bauer is in a magnificent location just a minute walk from piazza San Marco.  Our room was a bit dated, the bed was quite comfortable, however, for a 5* you would expect something more.  The service is really good and everyone is helpful. The breakfast is good and the view from the restaurant on the grand canal is unique.  Overall a good experience even though there is something missing for a 5*.   7/10Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 4, 2019Dear Rensan23,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
