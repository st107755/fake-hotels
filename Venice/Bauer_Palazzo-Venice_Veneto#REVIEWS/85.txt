We had another hotel booked until 2 weeks before our departure to Venice.  The hotel had a fire and wouldn't be open in time.  So I quickly scrambled to find another hotel.  We ended up spending $1800 more due to the close proximity of our arrival but found a hidden jewel with the Bauer.  The location is great - right on the Grande Canal near San Marco.  Loved all the high end shoppes right near the front door.  The hotel staff was friendly and efficient.  The breakfast was OK, lots of items to select from and the coffee was great.  Did not have the WOW factor of the hotel we originally booked but I liked the location, and the staff.  We would return for sure.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 10, 2019Dear Shupemom,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for your kind, positive feedback.
