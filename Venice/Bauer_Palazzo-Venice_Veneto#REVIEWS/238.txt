Get room 156! You won't believe this but it's true: there is a door near the reception desk, by the elevators - you open the door and simply see a staircase which leads to one door - room 156. It's your personal staircase, personal door, personal room. It has two bathrooms, a sitting room, and the sleeping quarters down the end of the hall, with a separate closet. We thought it was fabulously fun. About the hotel: the breakfast is great, the outdoor areas are great, concierge is helpful, and the location can't be beat. The gym is fine, too, though often hot.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 15, 2018Dear NancyCarolLifton1995,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
