The Bauer is a wonderful place to stay in Venice. Luxury and location all rolled up into one. Breakfast served on paio overlooking the Grand Canal where you can watch the gondolas go by. I would recommend this property highly and will stay here again, should I return to Venice. The room and bed was very comfortable, not up to five star US standards but very nice and very clean.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for having chosen Bauer Hotel during your visit in Venice, we are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay.
