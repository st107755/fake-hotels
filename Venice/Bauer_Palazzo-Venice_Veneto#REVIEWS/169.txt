Its a nice hotel with nice staff but i didnt quite feel it was 5 start super luxury, they just want you to pay silly prices for everything..   Beer 15 euro ( bottle ) Malibu and coke - 18 euro Cheese toastie - 22 euro  Tea is free with breakfast so we ask if we can have some in the room in the morning to look out over the canal.. 30 euro to bring to the room..  We had a meal which was average and a few drinks and it cost 320 euro.. i dont care how much money you have but 10 euro for water is just a rip off  Anyway its a nice hotel , very basic rooms with very limited soap, shampoos , no iron or hair dryer, but they will iron your undies for 20 euro each pair amd send a hairdresser to dry your hair lol... maybe stay ther yourself and see if i have a point..
