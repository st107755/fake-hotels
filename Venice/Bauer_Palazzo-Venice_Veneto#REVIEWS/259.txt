I stayed here with my girlfriend over Easter , booked for a romantic long weekend and we couldnt have chosen better. We booked a room in the Palazzo part of the hotel, its got a new and old part, the palazzo overlooks the Grand Canal. We chose a room with Canal View which was awesome. The room although small was great. When you stay in the Palazzo you get to have breakfast on the 7th floor roof top terrace, you must do this, the views are amazing and the service really friendly along with resident seagulls watching your every mouthful!Concierge are great, they helped us book a couple of tours and we had lunch on the front terrace watching the world go by which was a fun way to end our trip. Good food, great friendly and helpful staff, top location a stones throw from St Marksâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 3, 2018Dear SteveOnT0ur,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo, and thank you for choosing us on the occasion of the last Easter holidays.
