Just returned from Venice and stayed at the Bauer, we wanted somewhere close to St Marco and this hotel didn't disappoint, only a couple of minutes walk, passing Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton,etc and you are in the square. The decor in our suite was more traditional than we would have usually chosen but was very Italian and comfortable and clean and we had no complaints. The staff that we encountered were all extremely helpful but not intrusive. The terrace where breakfast was served was amazing but the best thing for us was the rooftop terrace on the 7th floor, the views were awesome, the staff phenomenal and a great place to chill after days exploring Venice, so glad we visited on our first night and looked forward to returning every night during our stay, great views, wine,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 2, 2019Dear JaneyL121,  Thank you very much for your wonderful review and for your preference for the Bauer Palazzo on the occasion of your recent stay in Venice.
