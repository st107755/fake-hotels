Room was really small, services was bad⋯⋯ I was decided a place to have my birthday dinner, as the services was just too bad, I went to the opposite hotel and dinner at Westin. I don't understand why we need to pay for the hot water bottle. I don't understand why the hotel say no or need extra money on everything I requested.  Instead of services, I enjoyed the view outside of my room(river facing) and I enjoyed the breakfast place and the food provided by the hotel. Just , if they can improve the services a bit, everything will be better.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
