We have stayed here before and the quality is consistent. The location is excellent with the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. The staff are all very friendly and professional, the decor is beautifully art deco and very clean. We were presented with a bottle of Prosecco on arrival which was lovely. Our bedroom was well equipped though as usual the lighting was ambient so not helpful for make-up or hairdrying. Other than that I can't fault the room. Breakfast was good but lacked fresh fruit salad which was disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 26, 2015Dear Guests,   we are extremely glad you enjoyed your stay with us at The Bauer Hotel and we thank you for taking the time to express your useful comments about our hotel.
