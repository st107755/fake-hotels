The Bauer Hotel is less than 5 minutes walk from San Marco so is very central.  Most things were in walking distance and the nearest water bus stop is just a block away.  The hotel is wonderful, very luxurious.  We had a lovely room with a very big bathroom.  We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as men are required to wear a jacket and it seemed very expensive.  We did drink in the hotel bar which was very nice, but again very expensive.  I would definitely stay in this hotel again.
