be carefull when booking this hotel whose main building is very nice greatly placed in venice near piazza san marco on the canal grande and just a stroll from all the great places . insist that your room is on the main building and not at the nearby casa vechia that belongs to bauer but is by far inferior place.so check prices and take a room there even with 50 euros less. our room n24 was small with no view but what was unacceptable was the noise from the room above as the floor has no insulation and could hear people even just talking. for the rest stuff is very polite and helpful breakfast full veranda to eat and drink right on the canal with great viewsRead moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
