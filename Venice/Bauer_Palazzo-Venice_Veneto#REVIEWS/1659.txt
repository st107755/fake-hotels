Stayed at the Bauer for 4 nights in September. The hotel has a great location near the San Marco square. Staff were not so friendly. The suite we booked was clean but looked outdated. I did not try the room service.   Overall this hotel is average, over priced but has great location.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel for your holiday in Venice.
