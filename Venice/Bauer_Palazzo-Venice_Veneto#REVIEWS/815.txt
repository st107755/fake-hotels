Not much to add to all the other reviews as it's been pretty well covered.   Service: excellent as you would expect Food: very good Location: about as good as it gets for Venice Rooms:Very nice and beautifully done.  Perhaps showing a little wear but nothing significant.  Certainly the best room of any we had on the whole trip.  Very quiet. Views from the dining deck are perfect.  View from rooms will be limited unless you pay for the grand canal side.  Would I stay there again?  Certainly. I'm not sure there is a better place in Venice! Try to find a low rate on these rooms with the trip advisor site.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 18, 2016Dear Guest, we thank you to have chosen Bauer Palazzo as residence during your recent visit in Venice.
