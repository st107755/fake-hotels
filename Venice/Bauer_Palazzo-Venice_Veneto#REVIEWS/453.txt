Great hotel. Great location. Friendly, accommodating staff. HEADS UP...AVOID ROOM 236 and adjacent rooms! Room 236 is an excellent room with a large balcony over looking the canal. We loved the room until the live band began playing in the bar, directly below our room. When we called the front desk at 11pm and found out this was going to go on until around 2am, they offered to move us to another room. We weren't interested in packing everything up to change rooms at midnight when we were leaving early the next morning. We appreciate that they at least offered a solution. I'm guessing the other rooms on that floor on that end of the hotel would be similar. We'd stay here again but NOT in room 236!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 9, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
