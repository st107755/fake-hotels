Excellent staff, particularly Marco, who is on reception.  We had a small problem with our room on the first night.  The next morning I spoke with Marco and he happily and politely offered us another room. Everything was good from then. This is about our fifth visit to either the Bauer, the Bauer Casanova and this time the Bauer Palazzo.  Every visit has been exceptional.  The breakfasts are fabulous, everything you could want. Coffee good and hot. It was very warm in Venice on this trip and the problem with all city hotels is the air conditioning units which make a noise. A small price to pay for such a fabulous place.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 10, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
