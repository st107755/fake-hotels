 We just stayed at the Bauer Plazzo in Vince Italy. We feel very fortunate to have stayed at this wonderful Hotel on the canal! The hotel itself is clean, beautiful, and the staff very accommodating. It is centrally located which is very convenient for touring the beautiful city of Venice. The rooms are beautiful, clean and stocked with lovely soaps and lotions.The beds are firm and comfortable. TV service is limited and the picture is somewhat fuzzy. Internet service is a little slow, but this is probably the case in most hotels.    Carlos is a wonderful concierge! he helped us with our tour to Murano, where we toured the glass factory. We then caught the water taxi to Burono. All excursions done with Carlos' recommendations.    I would definitely return.
