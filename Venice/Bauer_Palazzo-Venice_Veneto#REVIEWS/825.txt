When I asked my travel agent for a hotel in Venice, she replied "there is only one choice - and that's the Bauer". Upon arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a suite in the "Ill Palazzo" section which entitled us to the exclusive rooftop breakfast area which has the most spectacular views of the city and waterways. The staff and service though, make or break a 5 star rating - from smiley Manuela and her staff at breakfast, who do their job out of passion not duty, to the concierge staff who are genuinely eager to please any request. They are the ambassadors of the hotel that make the experiences of travellers memorable. So when I am asked where to stay in Venice, I say "there is only one choice - and that's the Bauer".Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 2, 2016Dear Guest, we are delighted to have received such a great feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
