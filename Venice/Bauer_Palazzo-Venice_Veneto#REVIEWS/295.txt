Perfect location with at only short walks´ distance from all the sights. Beautiful old building with an equally beautiful more modern extension, everything furnished and decorated in excellent taste. Friendly, courteous staff - unfortunately my husband fell ill for a while during our stay but we got all the help we could wish for from the staff, calling a doctor etc etc. The breakfast buffé is lavish and the dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was delicious. Highly recommended (And do take the water taxi straight from the airport to the hotel quay - it´s an amazing experience to approach Venice from the sea!)Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
