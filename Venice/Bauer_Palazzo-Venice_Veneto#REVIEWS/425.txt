Location & Room - i can't imagine any hotel having a better location. Sitting out in the terrace restaurant/bar watching the world go by on the Grand Canal is worth every cent that we paid. Two blocks from San Marco Square. Perfect. In our case we were upgraded to a suite. A huge living room, two washrooms, two walk in closets and a king bed. Beautifully appointed. Cleanliness - maid service and turndown service - excellent Food - we ate one night at the hotel restaurant. Very good food with beautiful ambiance overlooking the Grand Canal Breakfast - included. Ample choice Bottom line - this place isn't cheap but, in our case, worth every cent. A great hotel in a great cityRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 30, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
