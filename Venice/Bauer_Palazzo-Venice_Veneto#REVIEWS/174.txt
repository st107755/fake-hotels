After a long flight to Italy, I was elated to arrive at the Bauer Palazzo with its many charms! The hotel has a private dock, which made it easy to get to directly from the airport. The room we were assigned was stunning- high ceilings, ornate details, huge bathroom (all marble and included a bidet) and the linens and towels were all in pristine shape. The roof-top breakfast (included) with stunning morning views of the canals was breathtaking, and I will definitely book again the next time I am in Italy!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 3, 2018Dera Cynthiat544,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo: our entire Team is enthusiast to read that your stay in our Hotel has exceeded your expectations, as we always strive to provide the most unforgettable Venetian experience to our valued guests!
