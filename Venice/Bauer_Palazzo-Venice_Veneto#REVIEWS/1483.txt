We stayed here pre and post a cruise. The first night was 10th May and the second was 22nd May. On both occasions a buffet breakfast was provided. The 10th May breakfast was after 08.00h, no problems with this breakfast at all, the breakfast on 22nd May was required before  08.00h. This was appalling. Scrambled egg was undercooked, bacon burnt and shrivelled, and all 'hot' items were luke warm to cold. This was very disappointing after the lovely breakfast on the 10th May.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel for your holiday in Venice.
