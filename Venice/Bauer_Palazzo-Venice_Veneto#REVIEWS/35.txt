Our room looked out over The Grand Canal towards a large cathedral with a dome. Beautiful every day. Its only a block from St. Mark's Square. Located on an upscale shopping street. Our room was very quiet as the hallways are divided up to avoid long spans. Its pretty cool taking a water taxi right to the hotel's door. Will go back again someday.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 12, 2019Dear Csfuller56,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo and for your wonderful feedback.
