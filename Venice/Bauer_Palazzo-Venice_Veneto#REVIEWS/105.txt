Hotel consists of two parts - an older part that is on the Grand Canal and a newer part that was not designed to fit in with the rest of the buildings or the other buildings beside it. Service, including the concierge, was very good. Toiletries provided by the hotel were excellent. A good bed. The only negative was that the room had carpeting that needed cleaning.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 6, 2019Dear Paulel315IK,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent experience in our property and for your kind feedback.
