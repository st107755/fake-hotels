We enjoyed Breakfast and afternoon Tea time every day. The view by sitting at the Terrace Restaurant was magnificent and so relaxing. The hotel location is at center of Venice and surrounded by brandname shops. Surprisingly, we booked 3 rooms and all 3 rooms were different designs & decorations . Rooms are beautiful classic and spacious. Highly Recommend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 8, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience after your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
