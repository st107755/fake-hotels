I don't write hotel reviews very often but, having just returned from our stay at the Bauer hotel in Venice, I wanted to share how great the experience was.  From our first moments in the hotel, the service was impeccable (particularly Francesca on the front desk). The staff are incredibly helpful and the hotel itself is beautiful. The common areas are immaculate. The restaurant and bar areas have some of the best views in Venice.   The room we had was very spacious (although I think we were upgraded) and we were fortunate enough to have a canal view, which was an unexpected bonus and made our stay even more memorable.  Thanks Bauer for a wonderful experience I can't wait to return to Venice and stay at one of the Bauer Hotels again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 19, 2014Dear Guest, We appreciate you taking the time to write a review following your recent visit with us.
