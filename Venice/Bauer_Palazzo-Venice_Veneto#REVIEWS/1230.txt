The location is superb!  We had a Jr Suite overlooking the Grand Canal with a small balcony for 2.  The view was fabulous.  The hotel concierge had pre-arranged a private water-taxi for pick up from the airport. The arrival was so memorable and the check-in effortless.  We took breakfast every morning on the 7th floor with stunning views of Venice...this breakfast is only for the guests of Il Palazzo not the lager Bauer Hotel which is adjacent albeit a beautiful hotel as well. The room was elegantly furnished in period decor and with a large bathroom.  Remember...it's an 18th century Palazzo...not the W South Beach.  We dined in their signature restaurant - not to be missed.  We will definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
