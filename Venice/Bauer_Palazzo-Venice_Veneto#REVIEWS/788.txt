I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on the 29th April.  The rome was nice.  Very authentic which i like but not amazing for a 5 star hotel.  2 of the 3 sockets on the walls didn't work, so my partner and i had to power everything from a bathroom. The mini bar was crazy prices 8 euro's for a water, we had no hair dryer and no ironing board and iron in the room.  There was an ironing service, the reception told me the hotel could not put irons in the room for fire regulations... Thats completely fine, although it would have been nice to have been told the service price.  3 shirts ironed costs me 40 euros!!! Absolutly shocked when I had to check out.
