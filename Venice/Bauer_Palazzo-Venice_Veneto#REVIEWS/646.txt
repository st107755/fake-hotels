The Bauer Hotel is in the most magnificent location in all of Venice! It's right on the water front and on the canal on one entire side! It is also just around the corner from San Marco Square! All of the best Designer shops are right out the front door! It is also right where the gondoliers pick up and drop off passengers, we had a fabulous corner room double suite with two balconies, over looking the canals and the shops, we woke every morning to the lovely sounds of the singing gondoliers! Like something out of a movie! A fabulously luxurious hotel and wonderful food with a patron facing the full open water front!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 29, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments!!
