The Bauer is in a perfect position on the Grand Canal .The staff are wonderful -really helpful, friendly and available.The only slightly disappointing element is the restaurant which although providing an excellent breakfast provided a rather mediocre evening meal which is not cheap. Overall we very much enjoyed out stay here and will return.
