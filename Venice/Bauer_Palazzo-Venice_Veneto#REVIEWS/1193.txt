We stayed in a Superior room with city view earlier this month and although rather small the room was airy with lots of windows (all opening) and great views over the red tiled rooftops. The best thing about this hotel is breakfast which is served on a wide terrace on the grand canal. It's also the first place I've been where you can drink champagne for breakfast! The bottle's cooling on ice if you want it. Unfortunately the croissants were stale and there was nowhere to toast the bread. It must be noted the hotel is a sponge for any funds you may have. On top of the room price where you're looking at around a £1,000 for 2 nights, there is the constant tipping (€5 here €10 there) as everyone you encounter is more than happy to take your money and lingers until you do.

I am pleased to read that you liked the room and breakfast served on our Grand Canal Terrace. I have informed our Food and Beverage Manager, however, about your remarks on the croissants which will be sourced from a new supplier from now onwards. We do provide a toaster in the breakfast lounge, I am sorry it was not pointed out to you.  As per the tipping, I regret that our staff gave you this impression. Service is included in Italy and it is not required by law, as in other countries. This said, I would appreciate any additional information you could give me regarding this unacceptable behavior which should be reprimanded. I would appreciate it if you could write to me directly at : prusconi@bauervenezia.com  My renewed thanks for complimenting the Concierge, Reception, housekeeping Staff. I will be sure to pass on your compliments to them.  Yours sincerely,  Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
