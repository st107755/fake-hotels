we stayed at Bauer for a few days and loved it. the beds/rooms were real comfortable, Views to the grand canal, and staff were very courteous. The lunch and breakfast was generous, and the ambiance at the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal was spectacular. Its minutes from St. Marks Piazza/so a perfect location. for those looking for a few drinks late in the evening its one of the few places still open. Really enjoyed the stay and will do it again. Very convenient for water Taxi use..   One has to pay for use of Gym which is the only concern I had for a top hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 2, 2014Thank you for taking the time to write a review following your recent visit.
