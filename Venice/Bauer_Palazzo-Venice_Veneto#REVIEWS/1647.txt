We stayed on the 7th floor and looked out over the roofs of Venice to the Grand Canal.  The views are spectacular and unexpected.  We loved the beautiful fabrics on the walls and the large, luxurious bathrooms.  We ate quite good buffet breakfast on the 7th floor patio, complete with a seagull watching us.  We had lunch twice at De Pisis, once outside and once inside.  The food was excellent.  The staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and reservations.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your kind and detailed review of the Bauer Il Palazzo.
