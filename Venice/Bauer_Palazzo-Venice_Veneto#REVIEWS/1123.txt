Our 15 day excursion to Italy included 4 days in Venice. We stayed at the Bauer and for the price we paid, expected a great location and top level service, which we received.  The decor is not our style, but most of the locations in Venice are much the same as this place.  Felt like staying in a very cold, old, lonely castle. We had a room located on high floor and overlooking the Grand Canal.  A great view.  The room however just felt 'unfriendly' and 'cold.'  Everything was red.  The silk wall coverings, floor, bed linens, etc.  Just not our style.  The furniture looked as though it was from 1521, but is was not supposed to be.  Just old broken and beaten furniture. As with most European hotels, next to no shelf space in bathroom.  And what is the deal with showers in Europe?â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
