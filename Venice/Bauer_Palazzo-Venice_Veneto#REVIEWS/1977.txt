My husband and I stayed at the Il Palazzo Bauer in June, 2004.  I wanted to make our trip to Venice as memorable as possible, so I figured we would splurge on our hotel in Venice.  It was well worth it.  The Hotel is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and eager to please.  The location is great, as it was only a short walk to the Rialto Bridge and to St. Marks Square, which has to be one of the most beautiful and romantics spots in the World.  The hotel room was very nicely furnished and we had a huge bathroom.  Breakfast, which is served on a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, was great and offered a large breakfast selection.
