My partner and I just completed a 3-night stay, and have nothing but praise for this hotel. The room was stylishly decorated, with a large and tasteful artwork mounted above the bed, and a great view of a canal. The bathroom was spacious with its own outside view, and an excellent shower. Staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful, and the situation of the hotel, 2 minutes from Saint Mark's square, with a restaurant and terrace on the Grand Canal, has to be one of the best in the city. It also has the finest gym I've ever seen in a hotel, with a good selection of cardio and weights machines, together with free weights. The Bauer is expensive but we came away feeling we'd had great value for money.
