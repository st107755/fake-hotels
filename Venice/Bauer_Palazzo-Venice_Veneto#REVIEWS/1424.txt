This is a beautiful and lovely spooky old hotel. It is vintage Venice – like everything in Venice. When I was walking through the halls to my room, I kept expecting to see a child’s ghost appear. You can certainly tell that the hotel was converted from an old school. It still has that Catholic dormitory feel to it.  The lobby, lounge, and patio are beautiful; no dormitory feel at all LOL. It is a treat to sit and enjoy breakfast on the verandah; the exterior building is a work of art onto itself. The staff is warm and very professional. The location is great for strolling around San Marco, catching tea at the Caffe Florian or viewing the lovely waterways of Venice. I truly romantic experience.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 1, 2013Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
