We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo for three nights and although we were updated to a "suite" it was relatively small and very "classic". We had a small terrace on the side of the building and although it had a view over the entrance of the Grand Canal it was very tight . The room itself was very ornate in its design but many electric wall sockets did not work and the fixed shower in the bath could not have any angle adjustment which made showering difficult. On the plus side the location is lovely and the staff are very good and friendly. The head concierge Marco is extremely nice and very helpful. My first visit to Venice and it was a good experience except for being robbed just outside the customs area at Venice airport! Travellers beware!
