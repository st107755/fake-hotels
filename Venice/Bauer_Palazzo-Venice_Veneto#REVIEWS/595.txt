We visited this Hotel and had a delightful time.  It was a special occasion for my wife. Drinks on the Roof terrace were a delight with spectacular views.  We decided to have dinner on the terrace. It was a truly delightful experience enhanced by the waiter Matteo.  In actual fact the food ambiance and  the waiter Matteo made it a very enjoyable experience the second evening as well.  Our room was beautiful and we also had a terrace to sit out on to.  Breakfast was also a high standard.  Please be careful that the carrier you chose does not suggest the new part of the hotel the 'Casa Nova suites' it is not new. But separate to the hotel and does share the quality or ambiance the hotel so richly enjoys. Please be warned otherwise you will end up being very upset with your carrierâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 15, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
