It took me forever to book a hotel in Venice... there was just so many amazing offers during the week I was there. After reading the reviews of the Bauer I decided to book. Best decision. The hotel is perfectly situated, near the Piazza San Marco and near a vaporetta, and if needed a gondola stop.A Leading Hotels of the World, it lives up to that. We were on the 4th floor, super quiet with views of the Moise Church. Stunning. It's on a fab street full of designer shops, if thats your thing. The staff were professional and friendly always. And yes, beautiful terrace where breakfast is served. Had dinner there first night, and it was satisfying with beautiful views and food. Our room was spacious and all comfortable, modern bathrooms, and like all Italian  hotels, VERY CLEAN!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
