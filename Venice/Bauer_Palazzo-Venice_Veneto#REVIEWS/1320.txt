What an outstanding place to stay! Our first time in Venice and we were upgraded into a room with a view that was breath-taking! The best service I have had in a hotel EVER! Clean, beautiful, historical, fantastic location, and romantic as anyone could ever ask for! The breakfast (fresh fruit, cheeses, meats, breads, yogart, hot potatoes, eggs, sausage, and more) was outstanding with a terrace for enjoying the gorgeous view. The formal dining restaurant was outrageously expensive but good, not sure it was worth the prices though. The rooms were spacious and decorated with beautiful draperies, marble tile floors, antique furniture, and linen sheets on the beds! Not one detail is missed when providing the best for their patrons in this hotel. The concierge service was impeccable!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
