stayed for 4 nights and can say that the location is great - not on san marco but within a minute walk, transport links excellent as can get the airport alilaguna shuttle and the vaporetto within 2 minutes, the square has a beautiful church and many designer shops, can watch the gondolas go by as hotel next to a canal (which does mean you can hear the gondoliers starting work in the morning but it is not too early so did not bother us at all)  the hotel is welcoming and reception staff very helpful, the rooms are clean, comfortable and fairly spacious (compared to the usual tiny cells that you can get in italian cities), did not try the breakfast as could not justify paying 50 euros for it,   would definitely recommend this hotel and also would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 8, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your experience at the Bauer Hotel.
