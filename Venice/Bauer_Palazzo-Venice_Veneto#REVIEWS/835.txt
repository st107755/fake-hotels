We loved Venice on our first visit but I think everyone does!  This Hotel was ideally located and location does seem to be everything in Venice. We did't plan like we should have done prior to landing at the Airport and because of the time we found ourselves on the Allaguna (sp?) which is essentially their water-taxis.  In hindsight this was a mistake as it took over an hour to get to St Marks Square but the bonus was how cheap this was (if you can afford a water taxi do your research and book one!).  I can't add much to what has already been said; the Hotel is lovely, the location is absolutely superb, Venice is a fantastic place and if this Hotel sits within your budget there is absolutely no reason why I wouldn't recommend it. You would do very well to find better.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 27, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your review on your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
