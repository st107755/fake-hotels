Good hotel. Lots of marble and gold taps. No tea or coffee in rooms and have to pay extra for use of wifi costing Â£20 for 3 nights. Wi fi is slower than dial up. Better to use the wifi in the various eateries around Venice. The restaurant and views are good, but as always, lots of licking for the end of stay tips!Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
