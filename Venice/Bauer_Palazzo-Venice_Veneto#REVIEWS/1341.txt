Our last stop in Italy for New Year's eve. Decided it was worth the EUR65 for a water taxi from the train station. We were upgraded to a suite for our 2 night stay, 6th floor with views over the Grand Canal. Perfect location, near to St Marks Square. Staff were very helpful & nothing was too much trouble. Great breakfast on 7th floor, with awesome views - no better way to end our trip. We do hope to return one day!Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 17, 2014Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
