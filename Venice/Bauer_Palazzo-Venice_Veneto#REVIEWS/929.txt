My husband & I stayed at 3 nights in early Sept of this year. When we booked this hotel, we were under the impression that we will be staying in a luxury 5 star hotel.

We received very good feedback from other valued guests from all over the world most likely because the Online Travel Agents utilized were specifying properly the information of Casa Nova and because their expectation were aligned with the product they bought.  There are available different ranges of 5* and luxurious Hotels, in this case in Venice, within different ranges of prices and interior design that’s why our booking department is always available in order to provide all information about our properties and ready to propose the right product to the right customer: I normally recommend to everyone to choose the proper channel to process bookings in order not to have regret afterwards. We do agree that take a public transportation is a bit complicated especially if you travel with several bags. We remain at your disposal for future information. Sincerely, Piero MagrinoRead more
