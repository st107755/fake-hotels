We enjoyed an outstanding dinner on 7th August. It was spoilt by only one thing. The menu clearly states that the prices "include service and vat". However when presenting the bill our waiter said that service was NOT included and a tip was expected. I queried this with the duty manager who tried to tell me that although service is included it went to the hotel and not the staff. A clearly most unacceptable situation and I await a comment from the General Manager.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
