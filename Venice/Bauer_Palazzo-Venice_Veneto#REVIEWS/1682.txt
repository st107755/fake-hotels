The Bauer Hotel is a beautiful hotel in Venice overlooking the Grand Canal. It's location is great, the rooms are old-world gorgeous, and the staff is amazing. The general manager greeted us to ask if we needed anything anytime he saw us, and the front desk and concierge staff was so helpful and accomodating.  We loved absolutely everything about this hotel and would recommend it to anyone going to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
