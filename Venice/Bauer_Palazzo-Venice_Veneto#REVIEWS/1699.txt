This was the first stop on our honeymoon, which was in 2004, but the site would only let me go back to 2010.  The room was absolutely gorgeous. We had a large room with a lagoon view.  The bathroom was wonderfully large, the room was very large and spacious.  The staff could not have been nicer.  We loved everything about it.  Would definitely recommend the Palazzo area of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kinds words about your stay at The Bauer Il Palazzo during your honeymoon.
