No, it's not as famous as the other 5 star places but you feel more like a Venetian insider staying here. The service at this wonderful palace is really exceptional particularly the concierges who are among the best I've ever used. Your day starts with breakfast overlooking the grand canal and you are just a few steps from San Marco and a day of getting lost. Go for cocktails at the Gritti but considering staying here and if you do, splurge for a room with a view. Also, if you've got an Amex platinum card in addition to a possible upgrade you get a really wonderful lunch for free which you need to help cover all the water taxis.
