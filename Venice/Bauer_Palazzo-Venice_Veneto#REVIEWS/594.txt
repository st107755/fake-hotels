My husband and I have stayed at the Bauer before but not in Il Palazzo. The rooms was terrific, very large with a view of the side canal and grand canal. The bathroom was huge! It was really a wonderful experience to be woken up each morning by the gondoliers singing on the side canal. Breakfast was free and eaten outdoors on the canal which was fabulous! The hotel location is near everything. Worth the money to stay in this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 15, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
