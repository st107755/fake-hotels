We were booked at another hotel who, on arrival, told us they were ovbooked and tried to put us in a much inferior hotel. We were taken in by Lucia at the Bauer who was wonderful. She made us very welcome, was courteous and very professional. We cannot praise her enough. All the team we met during our three night stay at the Bauer were excelleent. We had a suite in the Bauer Casanova which was very nice indeed.
