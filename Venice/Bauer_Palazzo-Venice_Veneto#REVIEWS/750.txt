The Bauer Hotel and the Bauer II Palazzo are connected and really one hotel. It's a bit less expensive to stay in the Bauer Hotel and you can enjoy the same restaurants directly on the Grand Canal. It's a 5 minute walk to San Marco Square. There is also a free shuttle boat that goes to the Bauer Palladio Hotel and Spa. I thought the Bauer Palazzo Hotel on the Venice side was nicer and more convenient than the one with the spa. The unique thing about the spa is the one way mirror in the relaxation room overlooking the Grand Canal. The Bauer Hotel is a great 5 star hotel in the best location in Venice at an affordable price for a 5 start hotel. It's not cheap but a good value for a luxury hotel in the center of Venice. The service is excellent too.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Guest, I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at Bauer Il Palazzo.
