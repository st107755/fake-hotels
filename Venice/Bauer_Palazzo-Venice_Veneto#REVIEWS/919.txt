Several years ago I stayed at the Bauer.  Today on a one day trip from Florence to Venice traveling with three friends I go lost and went to the Bauer.  The girl at the front desk was so sweet offering the WiFi and phone.  I decided to wait in the bar and Roberto was amazing!  I had wine and snacks.  I think it is the best place in the world to be lost.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 30, 2015Dear Guest, delighted to read your message, happy that you found the way to come your second home away from your home...
