We stayed in the Bauer Palazzo for two nights.  We were greeted very warmly and as a wonderful surprise given a room upgrade.  We were shown to our room by the receptionist who checked us in and was a lovely touch.  The hotel is in the heart of Venice with a very short walk to the Piazza San Marco.  The room was large and well appointed.  We had a lovely city view.  All the staff were friendly and very courteous.  Breakfast also offered many choices.  We would love to stay here again if we get back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 23, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
