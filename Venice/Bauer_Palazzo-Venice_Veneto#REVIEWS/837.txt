Must admit we thought we had gone to the wrong hotel as it looked so plush.   Its been a long time since I stayed at a hotel with a proper 24 hour concierge.   The bar is painfully expensive (10 Euros for a small beer).  The hotel is in a fantastic position really close to St Marks Square.  The staff were incredibly friendly and the room excellent and remarkably quiet.   I hope we can return again one day.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 27, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
