We stayed for 3 nights and loved every minute. Breakfast on the 7th floor terrace is a treat. Rooms were spacious (junior Suite) and beds were great. Clean and comfortable - makes you want to stay in your room a bit longer.  Very friendly and helpful Service. Excellent location for every Kind of activity in Venice.  Looking forward to our Next stay hopefully soon.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your review of The Bauer Il Palazzo.
