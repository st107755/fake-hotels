A Beautifull hotel, which is central to most things. Staff here are very courteous & friendly. Loved our spacious room, almost looking over the Grand Canal, the furnishings all co-ordinating. Lovely comfortable bed. Breakfast was great, couldn't have been nicer. Soya Milk included, which pleased my husband. As this was our first visit to Venice , we did a lot of sightseeing,, but would have loved To have had a bit more chill out time in the Baeur. Allways next time !!!  We reality loved our stay here, and will be back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 11, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
