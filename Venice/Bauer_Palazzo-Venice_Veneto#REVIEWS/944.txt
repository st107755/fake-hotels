Stayed one night before Mediterranean cruise. Great location. Concierge helpful for recommending good local restaurants. Rooms large. Need to make water taxi arrangements to get to location. Hotel has its own dock.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for your review about your short stay at the Bauer Hotel. We agree that the location is unique, short walking distance from all the major attraction.  We are sorry that you perceived our property "little stuffy", as you noticed Venice is unique and everything is done in order to maintain it. Our public areas are large, rooms are available from a minimum standard of size for this category up to the largest suites with view on the Grand Canal.  We hope to welcome you back at the Bauer Hotel, in that occasion we will make sure that your opinion will change. Best regards Piero MagrinoRead more
