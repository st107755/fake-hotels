Our stay was lovely but titling this under "Bauer Il Palazzo" is a bit misleading. Booking through an alternate site, we were presented with a voucher that stated we would be staying in Bauer Il Palazzo. However, we were placed instead in a sister property. It was still a beautiful facility, with a very large room (by European standards) and a spotlessly maintained bathroom. Arriving as we did after an 8 1/2 hour overnight flight, endless trudge from the terminal to the water taxi station, and into 85 degree heat with 80% humidity, I was not in any mood to argue the situation but I am curious about a seeming "bait and switch".
