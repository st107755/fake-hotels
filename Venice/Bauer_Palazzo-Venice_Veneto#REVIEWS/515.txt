This is our first visit to Venice and we will be returning to both the hotel and the city again. The room was very spacious clean and plenty of space for our clothes. There is a lovely bar over looking the canal. And it has its own private jetty to get your Gondola and water taxi. We simply didn't stay long enough. Can't wait till our next visit.
