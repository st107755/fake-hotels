We stayed two nights for New Years eve and New Years Day.  Well located on Grand Canal and next to S, Marco square. Our room was in the apartments next door to the main hotel - which was not a problem being so close by.  There are two breakfast rooms, the room closest to the grand canal side seemed to be better. The bar was convenient for pre-dinner drinks and also food - which was of good standard.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 9, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
