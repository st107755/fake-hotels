This was my second visit to the Bauer Il Pallazo, and interestingly enough, I had basically the same room, only 2 floors up.  The one thing that I absolutely love love love is their breakfast buffet service on the rooftop.  It is delicious and has the most awesome view of the Grand Canal.  The service there is a hundred times better than the service anywhere else in the hotel.  On my first visit, I thought that maybe it was just the Venetian attitude that was borderline rude, but now that I have been to Venice twice, I realize that it is really the Bauer that has generally a rude front desk staff and the Canal-front restaurant has an extremely rude staff as well.  The location is breathtaking, but if you enjoy being treated like a second-class citizen, don't bother...Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
