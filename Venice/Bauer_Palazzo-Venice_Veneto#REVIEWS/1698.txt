We went to Venice as part of our planned 3 week Europe trip with our tween daughter.  The location of this hotel was good, as it was close to St. Mark's Square, but that was the only plus. We booked a room with a separate area for her to sleep, which this room had.Our room was not clean. It smelled. The bed and the pull out for my daughter were uncomfortable. It did not resemble any of the photos on their website in any way. It overlooked what I will call an abandoned patio area, at close to ground level. The tile floors in the bathrooms were spotted and disgusting. The shower was unclean. We had planned to stay for several nights but left after just one, not wanting to spend any more money on this place. They were abrupt at the desk, which is not too surprising.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for taking the time to write your detailed review and thoughts about your holiday in Venice and your stay at the Bauer Hotel, they are important to improve the quality of service and to enhance our reputation.
