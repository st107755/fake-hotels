Stayed one night in two deluxe suites prior to a cruise. Hotel is not cheap (as one would expect in a five star property in the center of Venice during high season) but good value for money. Beautiful, spacious rooms exactly as advertised and booked via Agoda. Fantastic location in the heart of Venice. Excellent, friendly service throughout, late checkout request accommodated despite hotel being quite busy. Beautiful terrace for breakfast with an amazing view.Read moreDate of stay: June 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 8, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
