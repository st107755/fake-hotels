Our room was large as well as the beautiful marble bathroom.. The bed was very comfortable and you were given a generous amount of towels and toiletries.  The breakfast buffet was fair.  The first two complimentary boat trips across the canal were fun.  After that, it become a bother to have to take the boat across the main canal.  I'd have preferred to stay in the heart of Venice.  For me, I felt isolated and not where a tourist should be located.  Some people may like the solitude and isolation from the main sites.  The front desk wasn't helpful with restaurants and gave us incorrect directions to the bus station. Needless to say, we weren't happy retracing our route with heavy luggage.Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 9, 2018Dear Odyssey809582,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palladio, and for your kind feedback regarding most of the aspects of your experience.
