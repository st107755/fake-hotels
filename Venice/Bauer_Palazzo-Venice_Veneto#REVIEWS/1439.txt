The Hotel Bauer is a really nice hotel in a great location in Venice. Beautiful views across the water while you eat breakfast, gondolas right outside your window. Fancy shopping all around.  The rooms are very nice - traditional, not modern. But not outdated. And the service was very good. Breakfast was just ok, but the service and the views were great.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
