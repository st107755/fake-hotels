My boyfriend (now fiance as he proposed whilst their) and I stayed here last weekend 13.12 - 15.12 and I have to say what a stunning hotel. We arrived by water taxi which was 110 euros you can get the public transport which is 15 euros per person but does take longer to get there.The Christmas trees in the foyer are amazing and the staff are really friendly and helpful, especially Marco the concierge who knows a lot about the area and can direct you in the right direction whether it be sightseeing or a nice dinner. The gondola's can pick you up from right outside the door and take you on a wonderful tour of the rivers. The hotel itself is a stunning work of art and decorated both modern and Venetian so you get the best of both worlds. The rooms are great with tall high ceilingsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 23, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a raving review of your stay.
