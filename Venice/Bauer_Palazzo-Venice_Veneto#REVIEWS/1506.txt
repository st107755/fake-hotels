Wonderful staff, wonderful position, wonderful rooms, just wonderful. We have travelled to many, places and stayed in many hotels but the Bauer had it all, the rooms were lovely with a very nice bathroom, the staff were very friendly and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. The location of the hotel could not have been any more central. Will definately return.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience at the Bauer Hotel, and thank you very much for your detailed comment about your stay here.
