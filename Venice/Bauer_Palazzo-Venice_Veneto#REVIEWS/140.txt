We have been impressed with the location, the amenities, the public areas and the breakfast. It has also been very quiet during our stay which is a big plus for me. There is maid service twice daily and hotel is spotless. We arrived by water taxi from the airport and were let out at the canal entrance of the lobby where our luggage was off-loaded and taken promptly to our room. There are several seating grouping in the lobby which afford a closeup view of the gondolas passing in the canal. It is literally a few steps to the Piazza San Marco. And the breakfast... excellent coffee, fresh fruit, various juices, hot items, meats and cheeses and wonderful croissants and breads. We loved everything about our stay and highly recommend the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 23, 2018Dear 901PaulL,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
