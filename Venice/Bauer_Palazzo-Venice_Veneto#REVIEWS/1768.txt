The room was okay, the decor was quite old fashioned. The air conditioner in the room was too cold, there was no in-between switch. So, we decided to just turn it off. We did call the front desk about it and they said the same thing, leave it on or turn it off. hmmm ... Really? Yep, really. No view from the bedroom. Breakfast was good, the view was there. We joined a walking tour & gondola ride. Rode the gondola with 6 people, I suggest to ride with another couple so it's easier to take pics of each other.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 8, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your comment about the stay at the Bauer Hotel.
