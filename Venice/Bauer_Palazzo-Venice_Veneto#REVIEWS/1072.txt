The Bauer hotel is in two parts - the part on the Grand Canal is known as the Bauer Palazzo and is an old Venetian palace, the modern part is behind it.  Both are 5 star, but the Palazzo has more charm and views of the Grand Canal.  My room was perfect, just on a side canal,  large with frescos, and a balcony with a view of Grand Canal without the attendant noise.  Breakfasts for the Palazzo are on the spectacular roof - the highest in Venice.  The staff are charming and hugely helpful. The Modern part is very convenient for sightseeing and shopping.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 6, 2015Dear Guests,   I'm extremely glad to read that you appreciated the beauty of our location, our wonderful "Palazzo" with its services and staff.
