Our two day stay at the Bauer Hotel (preceeding a cruise) was a joy in every way.  Located on the Grand Canal, this old-world hotel provided 5 star service in every way.  We were happy to receive an upgrade to a suite.  The suite was warm and comfortable, with two bathrooms and a walk-in closet.  Every morning, breakfast was served on the outdoor patio facing the Grand Canal.  The art-deco decor was lovely and the service was totally professional.  This isn't 21st century glitz...this is old world charm and elegance.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your feedback on your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
