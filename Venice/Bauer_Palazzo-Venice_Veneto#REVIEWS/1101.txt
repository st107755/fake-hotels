Probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Certainly earned it's five star rating. It was beautiful, open, friendly, and just everything we wanted from a hotel on our honeymoon. The breakfast buffet was amazing- definitely get that. There is a beautiful bathtub which I spent quite a while relaxing in.. we honestly didn't want to leave the hotel room, that's how comfortable it was. What set this hotel apart is that they took special care of us on our honeymoon- they upgraded us to a balcony room, they left prosecco and spring water for us in the room, and the housekeeper who came in twice daily to clean left us a heart on our bed made with fresh rose petals as well as writing a love poem on our bathroom mirror with a dry erase marker.
