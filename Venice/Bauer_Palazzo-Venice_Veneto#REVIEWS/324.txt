It was important for us to choose a hotel that was conveniently located near San Marco because we were only spending 2 nights in Venice.  Everything went better than expected..for starters, they provided us with a complimentary upgrade to a suite overlooking the Grand Canal!  The bed was very comfortable, the room spacious and the bathroom was very large (tub and separate shower).  We utilized the concierge on a number of occasions to coordinate dinner reservations (outside of the hotel), a gondola excursion for 6 people (complete with champagne) and a departing water taxi to the train station.  The bar service and the breakfast service were exceptional - as was the hostess at the 7th-floor lounge!  We would not hesitate to stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 2, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
