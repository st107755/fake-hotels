Our visit was a birthday treat and the Bauer lived up to expectations.  The concierge was brilliant, assisting us with tickets to concerts and generally pointing us in the right direction each day.  Our room was lovely and the setting for breakfast on the sun drenched terrace overlooking the grand canal was sublime.  Best of all though is the combination of setting and location - so close to everything are combined.  Loved all the 30s furniture and fittings too.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,   we thank you for your positive review.
