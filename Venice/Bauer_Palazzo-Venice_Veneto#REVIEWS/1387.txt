Two day stay after a cruise in the Med.  Everything from check in, baggage delivery, lobby reception, bar & restaurant, and breakfast was 5 Star.  Extremely congenial and helpful staff.  The setting of the bar and top quality restaurant on the Grand Canal cannot be beat.  And breakfast outside on the Grand Canal is a great memory.  Room was clean, roomy, and staff attention second to none.  Arrival and departure by water taxi is an added treat.  One of the best bonus items is that the Bauer is only a 5 minute walk to San Marco square and associated historic sites. Hotel staff can provide ample info and help as needed.  Best hotel and location!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 9, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a raving review of your stay.
