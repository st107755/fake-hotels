I found our stay at the Bauer very pleasant indeed, rooms were kept immaculate, and all staff were friendly and helpful, location is 10/10,for shops and restaurant's, and you must have a cocktail or  two on the roof bar,the view is beautiful,drinks are little bit pricey even for a 5star hotel,but worth it for the view, only small complaint  is our room was listed as having an iron to press your clothes,there was none in the room.I will be staying there again.
