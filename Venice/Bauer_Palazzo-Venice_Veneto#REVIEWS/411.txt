We wanted a romantic meal by the grand canal on the final night of our honeymoon and this place didn't dissapoint. The food was just wonderful and the views absolutley beautiful. The staff were fantastic, even if slightly mortified that I put my handbag on the floor and not on the table hanger but they rectified that quite quickly! Really beautiful location, will definately go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 11, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
