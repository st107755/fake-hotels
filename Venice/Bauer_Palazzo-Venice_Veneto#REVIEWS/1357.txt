The hotel website shows wonderful photos from the reception to the rooms making us believe that all rooms are perfect. But we stayed at Casa Nova Room and disappointedly it is not located in the Bauers hotel main building. So we had to stay in a building apart from de hotel, without the nice view of the Grand Canal, which is the main hotel marketing. Besides that, to have internet Wifi, you have to extra 20 euro/day!! For the "Grand Finalle" they charged me and my wife more 21 EURO for the "City Tax"!! By the way, if you need to use PUBLIC BATHROOMS in the city you have to pay for that, too!! Well... Venice is a wonderful city but Venezians are Tourist Explorers. Be careful when you go there!Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 9, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property.
