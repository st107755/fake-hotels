Huge entrance, very good reception staff. Room very comfortable with massive double bed. Bathroom had everything one could ever want. Cleaned twice a day. Fantastic breakfast sitting right by the grand canal watching the gondelors. Amazing bar on floor 7. With view over the canal. Only downside was price of the drinks on floor 7. They were ridiculously expensive but the view was phenomenal.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 25, 2018Dear Hagarmiltonkeynes,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
