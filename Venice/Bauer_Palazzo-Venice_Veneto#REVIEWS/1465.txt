I stayed at the Bauer Hotel in June 2013. Hotel is centrally located in the San Marco part of Venice. The Hotel is in a fantastic old building. When I was having trouble obtaining wifi access in my room, the hotel was gracious enough to move me to a higher floor. Hotel staff is very helpful and accommodating, a highly recommended place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to write such a lovely detailed review of your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
