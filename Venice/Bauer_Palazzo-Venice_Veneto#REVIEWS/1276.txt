We arrived by Water Taxi from the airport with a great ride through the canals.  Complimentary water taxi to Murano is available if you request from the concierge. The breakfast is great but the view of the canal is incredible.  The hotel is right next to St. Marks square and is a short 2 minute walk.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 13, 2014Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
