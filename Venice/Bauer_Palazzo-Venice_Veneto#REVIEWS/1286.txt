Great location. Water taxi took us directly to the hotel from the airport. Service was excellent and the rooms were lovely and relatively large. Nice area for walking. Drinks or breakfast outdoors watching the gondolas go past. Lovely and very relaxing.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
