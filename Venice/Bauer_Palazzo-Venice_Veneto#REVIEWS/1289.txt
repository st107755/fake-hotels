An excellent hotel. Perfect location on the canal half block from San Marco.  Relatively modern for Venice. Courteous and helpful staff. We book a room in Casanova, the main hotel annex across the side street. Newly renovated spacious room. Two large windows and a lot of light.  Large marble bathroom with a tub, a separate shower, and a bidet.  Luggage were brought to the room. We have full access to the main hotel.  Significantly exceeded our expectations.  Breakfast on the terrace on the Grand Canal is a memorable experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 24, 2014Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
