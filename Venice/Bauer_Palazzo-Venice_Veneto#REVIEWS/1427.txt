The Bauer Hotel in Vensie is beautiful, we had a very big suit with a nice view from our small balcony for two, very romantic. The service was very good, the concierge helped us in choosing all the nice places to visit and good restaurants to eat in. but the breakfast area is a bit poor and the hotel has a vintage old feel, maybe for an older generation than ours (in the 50s). It was an amazing pampering expereince but maybe next time we ll go for younger.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 28, 2015Dear Guest,   we thank you for your positive review and for your compliments.
