Excellent hotel. Breakfast buffet is superb. Rooms are good sized, and comfy. We stayed in one of their annexes, which was outfitted in Italian Renaissance style. Highly recommended. Not as pricy as some, a little more than others. Near the Plaza San Marco. You’ll need a water taxi to get there from the airport or the train station. the local vaporetto is inexpensive but perhaps daunting for a trip to the hotel. Great for sightseeing, tho. We don’t recommend dragging luggage over cobblestone streets!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 5, 2014Dear Guest, Thank you for your feedback on our hotel.
