The Doge Palace and St. Mark's Square and Basillica are a must see.  The shopping is all around you.  The Gondolas are next to the hotel and the restaurants around the hotel are very good. The water taxis are very fun and we went to Murano and Burano Islands that are for the glass and Burano is for lace.  Burano Island is very colorful.  Every building is a different color and both islands are walkable and can be done in either a whole or half day. You might want a guide to go there to explain everything.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 22, 2018Dear LaDina E,  We would like to thank you for choosing Bauer Palazzo and for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay.
