Absolutely perfect location - just off San Marcos square and on the Grand canal. Easy to access by cost effective local transport - water bus 7 Euros per person. Wonderful staff and amazing setting. All the "singing" Gondolas come passed while sitting on the outside balcony and picture perfect setting. Lovely posh room with a gorgeous bathroom, dressing room and comfortable bed. We loved it. A perfect piece of our honeymoon in Italy. Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
