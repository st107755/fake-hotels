We were only in Venice for two nights and chose the Bauer because of it's close proximity to St. Marks square.  We had two rooms for two nights.  Upon our arrival we were upgraded to two suites (they offered and of course we said yes).  I had already reserved two double rooms but I was happy to accept the upgrade at no extra charge.  Our rooms were huge with two bathrooms.  One bathroom had the jacuzzi tub while the other had the shower. All of the staff with the exception of the bartender were very friendly and helpful.  The bartender was very rude so I didn't go back to the bar area any more.  The room's were huge, very clean but could use a little furniture updating but was definitely worth what we paid.  The gondolas are right next to this hotel which was very convenient. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 20041 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 31, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for having chosen Bauer Hotel during your visit in Venice, we are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay, the room and the location.
