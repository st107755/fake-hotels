The Bauer Palazzo looks beautiful on their sketchy website. It seems to be ideally situated on the Grand Canal near St Mark's Square. BUT: 1) the location is hectic and noisy, swarmed by cruise ship day-trippers and tour groups 2) the rooms are old and dilapidated 3) the staff, particualrly the front desk and concierges, tend to be haughty, arrogant types who ignore the concept of customer service 4) we were promised a suite with a courtyward view. It ended up opening onto a noisy, dark narrow alley with no courtyard at all. 5) the place is super expensive, very poor value for what you get 6) bedding was stiff and old.
