This hotel is so beautiful and special. We arrived via a water taxi straight to the hotels landing stage. We were early as we had early flights, but the staff took care of our cases and checked us all in before we went off to explore. We decided to have lunch in the hotel which was excellent and the staff were most attentive. We went off to explore Venice and found the hotel to be very close to St Marks square and numerous shops and restaurants. Also the concierge gave us a map of Venice and drew on where the best museums were, the best gelato in Venice (it was), where to get a gondola and where to go to get to the old town etc. he was so helpful. After exploring we returned to the hotel to get our room. We had a suite in the annex, which is just next door to the actual hotel.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 19, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
