We stayed 3 nights in the Casanova Superior Suite and was an amazing experience. Very good conditions, cleaned room and facilities. Every night someone opened our bed and put some slippers on the floor for us. Amazing breakfast, a lot of choices and the most amazing view to the canal. Recomended for everyone.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Amoma.comDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 27, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
