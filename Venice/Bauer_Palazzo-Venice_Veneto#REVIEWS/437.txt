The most horrendous hotel I have stayed in my LIFE! We were in the suite room but our bathrooms were outdated .The less said about the service the better.The staff had a very bad attitude and was totally unfriendly and unhelpful .I gave never come across a more horrible hotel.I even saw other guests facing the same problem at the reception.For the amount of money they charge versus what they offer ...its a thumbs down!Would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone!
