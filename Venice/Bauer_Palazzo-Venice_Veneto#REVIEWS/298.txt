For some reason, my wife and I were upgraded to a suite on the canal side of the hotel. It was in some sort of VIP section separated from the regular rooms, with a separate elevator, so I guess we just got lucky. Anyhow, we loved our stay in this delightful old-but-charming property. Breakfasts on the patio overlooking the canal were wonderful, as were dinners at the canal-side restaurant. Would stay here again, especially if we got the upgrade!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 10, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
