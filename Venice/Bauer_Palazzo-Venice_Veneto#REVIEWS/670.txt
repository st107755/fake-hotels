Our family of 5 stayed just 1 night at the Bauer at the end of a cruise so we could enjoy a 2nd day in Venice. Wish we had booked another night in retrospect. Hotel is in a great location - very short walk from St Marks square, gondola station right outside and water taxi drops you off right in front of hotel, which is very helpful when you have a lot of luggage. Hotel is also beautiful and very spacious - we had two connecting rooms for our party. The best part was we arranged the 7th heaven breakfast for our day of departure - you sit on a rooftop patio on 7th floor and have a phenomenal view of the Grand Canal. A tremendous experience all around and I'd highly recommend staying here.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 7, 2016Dear Zahid, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
