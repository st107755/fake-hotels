Me and my friend stayed in the Bauer hotel in Venice and it was lovely. Location is amaizing next to all brand shops, and to saint marco square, as well as to churches where concerts are taking place. We have stayed at the suite which was nice but could be better: bathroom was small and some decorations need to be renovated. Excellent service and variety of food for breakfast. Overall was very nice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 18, 2014Dear Guest  We appreciate your comments regarding your stay at the BAUER.
