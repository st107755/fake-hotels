I 've just come back from a stay of a few days at the Bauer and it was perfect ! I had a deluxe room with city view but I didn't expect such a gorgeous room. When I entered the building, I already had a "wow" feeling. Check in went smoothly with very kind Lucia who showed me my room and what a room ! Absolutely gorgeous : very chic art deco, lovely bed, deep bath, great amenities, and a huge terrass with an amazing view. Breakfast offered a large choice and also a magnificent view on the Salute. Staff was very courteous at all times. Hope to be back soon !Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 7, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for your feedback on your stay at the Bauer Hotel during your recent visit in Venice.
