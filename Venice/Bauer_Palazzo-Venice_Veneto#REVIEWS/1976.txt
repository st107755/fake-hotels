Stayed at the Il Palazzo from October 10 -14. It is a formal service oriented experience. We booked a standard (Some how standard room at a list price of 600 euros doesn't quite work) at a discount of 350. Prices are cheaper in Aug. & Oct. The room was huge with a fresco on the ceiling. Bath was super. Great location near San Marcos square. The private (Il Palazzo guests only) breakfast room on the 7th floor is beautiful with great views and great food. Only problem is the price of 42 euros per person.  That's Venice, all the Starwood hotels charge similar prices for the buffet. We heard complaints that the standard rooms in the adjacent Bauer were very small. We only paid 15 euros per night more for the Il Palazzo, that was a bargain.
