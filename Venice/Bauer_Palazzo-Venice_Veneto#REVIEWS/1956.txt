The lobby is beautiful but the room I had at the Bauer is equivelant to a low 4 star U.S. hotel.  Since you stay in a room and not the lobbey, I don't consider it a 5 star by far.  The hotel is in a great location.  Steps from a vaporetto stop (lines 82 and 4) and San Marco.  The breakfast is pretty good and the outside dining area is on the water with a great view.  The staff is very helpful.
