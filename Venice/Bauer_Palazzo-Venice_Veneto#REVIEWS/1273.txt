My husband and I stayed here with our 4 year old son for four nights last February hoping to avoid as many tourists as possible. Upon arrival, we were greeted and escorted to our room and our hostess was lovely and covered our every need. We enjoyed breakfast every morning on the upper level and the ladies who attended breakfast were exceptional.  The only service personel that were lacking were the concierges. Every one we encountered seems bothered by questions and not one out 3 were remotely friendly.  Pity.  The room itself was divine: two balconies, powder blue and gold silks and very large. We would look forward to returning and staying longer.   Oh, the food in the bar was horrible and so were the drinks.  The bartender was really nice and gave great, but  don't eat there.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 23, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your review of our hotel.
