Beautifully done hotel in the old sumptuous Venetian style. Great service, and the most astonishing rooftop restaurant to have breakfast in EVER.  The location is so amazing-- around the corner from everything important.  And again, the service-- wonderful.  We checked into our room, and five minutes later we realized that we were next door to two screaming children-- we called and another from was found-- even better.  It's big and sprawling-- which can sometimes give you the feeling of The Shining as you walk down the hallways:) but we absolutely loved it-- would go back in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 16, 2015Dear Guests,   we are honored you spent a great stay with us and you appreciated the beauty of our hotel above all our FABULOUS terrace at the seventh floor (the highest one in Venice) exclusively reserved for our guests for breakfast......the best way to start the day!
