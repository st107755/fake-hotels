Location is probably the best in Venice. Rooms are excellent. Staff extremely helpful. Venice is not easy to navigate but the Bauer is ideally located for water taxi to the door or ferry within 5 minutes walk.. Located beside St. Marks square and other attractions within a walk.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 7, 2019Dear Fischerdiana026,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience in our Hotel and for your wonderful feedback.
