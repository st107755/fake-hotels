We went to a party on the beautiful terrace of the hotel. The bartender was so professional and meticulous and made fantastic cocktails.  The downside was that the party at some point became so crowded that it felt like being in a market. People was just skipping the queue and pushing to the bar. Also the tables were absolutely unsafe: the glass of our table got knocked several times by people passing by and because it's not attached to the structure of the table, we had to keep holding it and sliding it back to place. A couple of times nearly fell completely and could have easily hurt someone. I would like to go back again, providing it's not crowded and they have fixed the tables.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 5, 2016Dear Guest, we are honored that you rated the Bauer Palazzo the best Hotel you've ever stayed!!
