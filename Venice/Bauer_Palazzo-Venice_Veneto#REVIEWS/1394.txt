A perfect location, friendly staff, superb room and great breakfast made this a super place to stay. We booked through ba.com and got a great deal on flights and 4 nights stay. London City Airport was so effecient and easy compared to the other London airports. I checked out previous reviews but some of the negative ones must have stayed elsewhere ! The room was clean and quiet and we had 4 excellent nights sleep ! Breakfast was superb and everything was there, overlooking the Grand Canal and all it's traffic and we watched a cruise liner arrive on the last day. Just a tip : share a taxi to the airport both ways and save a fortune ! You will find somebody going to the airport more than willing to share the cost. If you are going to Venice, try the Bauer.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 1, 2013Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
