The Bauer Palazzo is Ideally situated on the Grand Canal and within a few minutes walk of St Marks Square and all the major attractions of Venice. Our bedroom was very comfortable with a super size bathroom. Hotel itself is very grand with a great terrace on the Grand Canal where you take breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like most hotels of this standard it is expensive but then you are in a prime location in Venice. Great to sit on the terrace with a glass of wine and just watch life on the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 1, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
