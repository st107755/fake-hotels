Nice hotel, just 4 minutes away from the S Marco. Good service, nice rooms and wel decorated. Get used tot the Venitian prices but a Gin Tonic for â‚¬ 30 in the bas was just a little bit to much... Great atmosphere in the hotel and good breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 30, 2013Dear guest Thank you for your feedback on our hotel.
