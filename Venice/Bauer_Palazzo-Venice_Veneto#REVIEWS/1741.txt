Excellent location, the hotel is right next to a place where you can hire Gondolas and within walking distance of all prime shopping boutiques. Transfer from airport to hotel was smooth. It has a beautiful church right outside it. Feels very historic with an impressive reception (especially the Murano glass centrepiece).  Staff efficient and friendly. View, not much really, was overlooking a tailor shop and the elevators only hold four people at a time, but since I was not in the room much that was not an issue.   Loved waking up in the morning to the sounds of the city .Most of all enjoyed having breakfast -It was served on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal with very friendly waiting staff.  Will come back here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 10, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for having chosen Bauer Hotel during your visit in Venice, we are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay and we are so proud having exceeded all of your expectations on all aspects: from the suite with amenities to the magic location of the hotel and to our staff.
