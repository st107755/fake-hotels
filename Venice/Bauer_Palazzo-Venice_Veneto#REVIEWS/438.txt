We stayed here one night after our cruise. Great location for sightseeing and shopping. Wonderful staff and delicious breakfast in the morning. Weather was great so was able to enjoy sitting outside on their terrace overlooking the canal both for before dinner drinks and breakfast. Since hotel was on a canal was able to take a private water taxi right from the hotel to airport.
