The room we were given on our tour was looking out onto a central core of nothing. Room extremely dark. Hallways really lovely all marble tiled and very very wide. There were lovely pieces of furniture here and there. Others in our group upgraded to rooms with a bit of light but they still werenâ€™t that impressed. The breakfast served right on the grand canal was ok not super grand. The best thing was the position. We watched the boats roaring around whilst sipping on great coffee.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 3, 2018Dear Christine F,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo, and for your kind feedback regarding most of the aspects of your experience.
