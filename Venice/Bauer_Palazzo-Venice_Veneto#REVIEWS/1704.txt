We stayed here for four nights last week, whem the place was overrun with the art world. Parties went on nightly outside our room until 0300 hrs. And the concierge and restaurant staff were quite  rude at times...until one tamed them with large tips to give some service.  We have stayed here before a couple of times and always swore that we wouldnt return, but come the opening of the huge  art exhibition one doesn't have much choice in Venice.  Also how can a five star hotel not offer high speed internet in the rooms?Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your review of The Bauer Il Palazzo.
