Prior to my going to Venice for my proposal, I carefully researched the different hotels including the Starwood properties,  I ended up choosing the Bauer Il Palazzo.    I could not have made a better choice.  My stay was a wonderful experience.  We had a balcony overlooking the canal which included their delicious breakfast buffet.  In addition, the staff was exceptional and set us up with a very nice upgraded room.  I would highly recommend this hotel and it will always have a special place in my heart.    PS My proposal was accepted and we now have a beautiful baby girl.
