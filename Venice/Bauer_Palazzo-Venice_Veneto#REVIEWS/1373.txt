Check in was friendly and professional and the room rate very competitive by Venetian standards. We were in the annexe , although not directly connected, it was fine. a really nice luxurious room and a great bathroom in white marble with large bath and separate shower. Fresh linen and a comfortable bed.  Breakfast was excellent on the terrace. To be honest, if your budget is 2-300 euros per night - this is probably the best bet in Venice.  I gave it a v good rating- it just lacks that little bit of magic to get an excellent rating. Maybe a little soulless.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
