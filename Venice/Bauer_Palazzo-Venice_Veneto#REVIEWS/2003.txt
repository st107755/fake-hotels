We stayed at Il Palazzo - Bauer for  4 days in April. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we were treated like kings. Our room was upgraded proatively. We booked a standard room with no view and were very generously given a large deluxe room with a spectacular view of the Grand Canal, that could be seen from the tastefully appointed canopy bed. The bathroom was huge and done all in marble with a jacuzzi and a seperate shower. The concierge could not have been more helpful or friendly. This was easily the grandest and most well appointed hotel that we've ever stayed at anywhere in the world. Highly recommended!Read more1 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 31, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for having chosen Bauer Il Palazzo during your visit in Venice, we are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay.
