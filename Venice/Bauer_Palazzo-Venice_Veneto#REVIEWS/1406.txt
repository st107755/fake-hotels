Our family spent three of the most amazing weeks imaginable in the Mediterranean. From Barcelona all the way to Istanbul and finishing back in Venice. We then ended our vacation for two nights at the Hotel Bauer in Venice. What a fantastic hotel!!!!!!! Our room was beautiful with a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room. Our room looked out at a canal with gondolears paddling their beautiful sleek boats beneath us. What a sight!!!!!! What a hotel... right in the centre of the action. Beautiful breakfast while sitting on the terrace. Thank you Hotel Bauer  We will be back!!!!!!
