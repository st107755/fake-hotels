Long weekend in Venice. Bauer hotel organized everything for us, from private airport transfer as well as a private city tour guide. Location of hotel just a few steps from San Marco square is great. The room we booked was not up to what we expected. It was quite big, but totally dark and looking into a very strange very small and dark inner court yard. After a few discussions with front desk we were given another smaller but very bright room with a nice view. This was great. The roof-top terrace and bar of the Bauer is an oasis of tranquility and great views. Not to be missed.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 10, 2019Dear 4FunTravelsince1999,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback on your experience at the Bauer Palazzo.
