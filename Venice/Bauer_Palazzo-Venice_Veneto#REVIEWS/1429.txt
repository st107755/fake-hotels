This hotel is located opposite all of the designer shops and right next to the gondola point. We arrived by water taxi and had the most amazing stay. It was for our 10th wedding anniversary. My husband arranged a night time gondala with champagne, diamonds and the violinist who usually played outside of the Prada shop of a night was on our gondola as we were escorted through all of the waters...it was the most magical experience! The hotel assisted in the organisation and were most willing to please. The fine dining restaurant was amazing, wonderful memories!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 28, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
