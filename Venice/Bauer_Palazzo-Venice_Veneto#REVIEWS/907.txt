This hotel is very centrally located in Venice, only a couple minutes to St Mark's Square.  We stayed in a second floor room along the side canal, with a generous size balcony.  We could hear the gondolas when there was singing.  It stops relatively early, so it was not a bother.  The room had a large updated bathroom with a tub/shower.  Plenty of closet space and storage for luggage.  It had a nice sitting area and desk.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They had a large buffet breakfast with many choices.  The wi-fi was excellent.  Would definitely stay here again whenever in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 11, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for sharing your feedback on TA about your recent stay at the Bauer Hotel.
