Our two day stay at the Bauer was great.  The location is right next to St. Mark's Square. We did not have a balcony or canal view but the room was good and plenty big enough.  The hotel staff were very helpful. We also enjoyed the breakfast which was included. The only problem we had was departing to the train station we had to pay extra for a water taxis because the water buses were on strike for four hours that day.
