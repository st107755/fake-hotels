We stayed at the Bauer Hotel before Christmas.  It was fantastic.  The location is excellent.  Check-in was efficient and friendly. Our suite overlooked the main canal, and was very spacious.  The jacuzzi was relaxing and warmed you up after a day outside in the cold, especially during this time of the year.  The champagne on arrival was a nice touch.  The concierge provided excellent suggestions for dinner locations, and tours in and around Venice.  The breakfast setting is lovely.  Overall, a very enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 8, 2014Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
