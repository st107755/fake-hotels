This was our second stay at the hotel, and even though the stay was very short (one night only) it lived up to its previous high standard. Marco is brilliant and all the staff really helpful. The room we had was right on the Grand Canal and gorgeous. This is not a modern hotel and those wanting such a place should find somewhere else to stay. The decoration is grand and palacial like a palace from days gone by. We had an early departure so could have breakfast on the top storey but have on out previous stay and it is a great place to start the day, watching the cruise ships come in. If wanting to spend time in Venice in a central location this is the place.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 17, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
