Our travel agent was able to book this hotel for us at a great rate. When we arrived they said they were also gonna upgrade us to a suite! It was unexpected and an awesome treat. The morning breakfast that was included with the room was awesome! They had a great buffet of hot and cold breakfast foods. Plus they also had tables outside on the patio where you can watch the Grand Canal traffic. We also got help from the front desk setting up a water taxi to the airport. Very nice staff and great location, close to St. Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Guest,   we thank you for your positive review and for your compliments.
