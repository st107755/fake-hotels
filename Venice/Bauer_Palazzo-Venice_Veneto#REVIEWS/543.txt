Location of Hotel its good, direct in Venise centre, long time ago this hotel muss be very good and stay in high standart. They still hange 4-5 star for the prices, but very low quality. Room equpiment too old and damaged. Bathroom very dirty, but they act after I complain, taht mind lot other room dirty similar. Think about it when you must spen 300-400e per night in such small dirty roomRead moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 10, 2016Dear Guests,   Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property.
