Service was not good from the minute we arrived. They know the location is great and so who cares about the rest.  Rooms were old. I was pleased to see others say "The Shining".  Staff treated us like poorly UNTIL we complained and spoke with the manager.  Immediately moved to the Bauer Il Palladio, where we were SUPPOSED to be originally. Things got better instantly.  Manager was VERY helpful.  Its a very different experience on the Il Palladio side from the Hotel Bauer side of the house.  Thank you Elena for turning our Venice trip around. Will post a great review on the IlPalladio site.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
