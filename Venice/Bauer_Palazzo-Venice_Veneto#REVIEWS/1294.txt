We stayed in the Bauer Il Palazzo for 2 weeks.  We had a room on the top level with the most amazing view (pics attached)  Breakfast daily on the roof top was a great start to the day watching all the cruise ships coming into dock.  The staff could not be more helpful, rooms are not modern, however they are typical Venetian Style.  There is a complimentary boat at the Bauer to take you to the Bauer Villa F and the Cipriani hotel.  Not a cheap hotel by any means and we paid around EUR850 per night, but it was a trip that i will remember forever.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 4, 2014Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
