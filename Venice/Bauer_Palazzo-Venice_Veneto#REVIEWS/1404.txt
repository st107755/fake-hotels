This is the kind of place you go to treat yourself on your birthday, like I did. It's impeccable, elegant, and great service. Our room was stunning with a splendid view of the Canal. Their breakfast was served at the terrace and it has a breathtaking view. This was my second time in Venice and the first time I stayed in Lido island so the next time I have to stay in a place that would be as interesting as this great hotel or maybe more. I would let you know.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 19, 2013Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
