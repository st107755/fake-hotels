From the moment you arrive by water taxi to this Grand Dame of a luxury hotel at the mouth of the Grand Canal, you are greeted by a staff that lives up to the highest definition of the word "service."  This is a very warm and welcoming hotel that goes out of its way to accommodate every guest's every request. The rooms are wonderfully appointed and luxurious. The hotel is actually attached to its sister property, the Bauer Hotel, and the two properties share the outdoor patio and restaurant.  The difference between booking the Bauer and the Bauer il Palazzo really comes down to the view of the Grand Canal.  We paid for the view and didn't regret it.  For travelers who want access to the view but want to spend a little less, I am sure that the sister Bauer property would do fine.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 19, 2015Dear Guests,   we thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay with us and we thank your for praising our professional and helpful staff.
