This is a fantastic establishment in Venice, right in the middle of town, facing the grand canal and a 2 min walk to the Piazza San Marco.  Lucky this was on business and paid for my the company as a single room night costs over Eur400!!  You get what you expect- nice rooms, good service, great location. All important for a short stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 25, 2015Dear Guest,  we thank you for taking time to review our hotel on Tripadvisor with your comments, and we are delighted to read that you really enojoyed your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
