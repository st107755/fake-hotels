Very Italianate interiors, perhaps not to everyone's liking but very smart hotel. Exceptionally friendly and polite staff. Reasonable breakfast but no atmosphere in the bars despite plenty of staff working there. I recommend that they reduce their prices. When you can pop out the front door to a nice bar practically next door and the price is about one third of the cost then is it surprising that no one drinks in the hotel. If they dropped their prices they would get more business and create some real atmosphere. That said. Good hotel and great location and good base for visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 23, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
