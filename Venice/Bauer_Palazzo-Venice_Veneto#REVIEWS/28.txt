The Bauer is old world elegance and in a great location!  It is old world Venice with one of the best locations and views on the Grand Canal.  I was there for the Venice Biennale and loved our room!  We had a suite that overlooked the small canal on the side of the hotel.  The city flooded several times while we were there but the hotel went about taking care of its guests and maintaining its amazing degree of service! The lobby has  the air of an old Grand Dame with a few memories under her belt and the the restuarant, patio, and bar are one of my favorite places to sit and people watch!   Thank you Bauer!  Keep it up!Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 10, 2019Dear TWilliamson07,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo: our entire Team is enthusiast to read that your stay in our Hotel has exceeded your expectations, as we always strive to provide the most unforgettable Venetian experience to our valued guests!
