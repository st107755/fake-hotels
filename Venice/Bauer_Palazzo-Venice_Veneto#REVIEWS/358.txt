After several trips to Venice and experiencing a variety of top hotels, our agent suggested the Bauer. Location great, room large and beautiful but I have never left a hotel without tipping the housekeeping staff-this is a first!  My none smoking room had cigarettes behind a chest of drawers that they had to move and last nite they left 1/2 old glass of water on my bed stand and did not replace clean glasses in one bath. Sorry no tip from me!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
