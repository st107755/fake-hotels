We were celebrating a big birthday and got a gift of a 3 night stay at the Bauer . Our flight to Venice was diverted to Milan due to a strike so we were exhausted when we arrived.  We were checked in  by Risella who was very efficient and friendly . We really enjoyed our 3 days and found the staff excellent .....compliments to Renato in the dining room lovely manner and could not ask for better service. The breakfast was excellent wonderful fresh food. The location was close to everything and we loved the magnificent foyer of the hotel. Our room was spotless and wonderfully warm and comfortable. We had a flawless experience . grazieRead moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
