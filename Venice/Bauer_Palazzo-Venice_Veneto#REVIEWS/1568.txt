Great Hotel, the best location, great service from arrival to departure. Great dinning on the grand canal in the evening, the food and service 100% perfect.  Our room was  very nice with 6 windows looking at the canals, very nice bathroom, great bar for evening drinks.  The only comment is the breakfast was very poor, we had two great dinners and a poor breakfast, even the bread was not fresh, the juice is not fresh and a fired egg is 6 euros extra, no fresh fruit apart from whole orange and grapes every other fruit were tinned.  Great free internet service.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 25, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel, and we are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay here and that we having been able to meet your expectations.
