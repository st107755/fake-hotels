The hotel is beautiful and the location is great! It's literally two minutes away from St. Mark's square.  We booked a canal view room, when we got to there we were informed that we got a upgrade and we have a room that has the grand canal view.  The view is simply amazing.  We had a great experience, the service was wonderful and the staffs were extremely friendly and helpful!  The only thing I didn't like was the bed.  We had a king size bed, but it's one of those that seem to be put together by two small twin beds.  I don't know if that's just the way in Italy, but we had the same bed in our hotel in Rome.
