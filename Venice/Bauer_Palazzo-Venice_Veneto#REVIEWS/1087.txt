This hotel is a beautiful hotel right next to San Marcos Square.  The room we had did not offer a view of any kind, but the terrace where they serve breakfast overlooks the Grand Canal and has the most amazing view. The staff are very polite and helpful. Our room was a good size, very clean, with a nice size bathroom.  Will definitely refer this hotel to others.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 26, 2015Dear Guests,   We would like to thank you for taking the time to share your comments on your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
