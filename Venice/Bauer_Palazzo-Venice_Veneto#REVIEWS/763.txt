The Venice Biennale is an exceptional, celebratory event which has prompted us to create some nightly entertainment for the pleasure of our guests. We regret that this was a source of disturbance.  As you have certainly witnessed, all the Palazzi on the Grand Canal are festively lit and populated with large crowds of people. Many of the local and neighbourhood bars and night clubs host large parties with music into the early hours of the morning.   With our renewed regret for the incident, we appreciate your patience and understanding for this exceptional circumstance.  Yours very sincerely,  Stefano Noviello Resident ManagerRead more
