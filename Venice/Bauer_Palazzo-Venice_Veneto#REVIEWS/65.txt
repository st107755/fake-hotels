This hotel is simply wonderful. Everything about this place is just perfect. It is probably the best location in Venice for a hotel. The staff are all wonderful.  There is just an amazing atmosphere and feeling about this place.  Every morning we had breakfast outside looking across at Santa Maria della Salute. If you are considering going to Venice, please trust me, this is the place to stay.
