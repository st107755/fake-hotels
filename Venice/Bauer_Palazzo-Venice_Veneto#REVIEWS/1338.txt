We staid at the Bauer Palazzo over the New Year. It is actually two hôtels in one. The Palazzo on the Canal side and the Bauer on the Camp San Moise. The Palazzo is supposed to be a 18th century building but only the facade is. The hotel was supposedly refitted in 1999. It does not show. It feels like a 1950s hotel with long dreary corridors and no soul. During our stay only one bar was open. The gastronomy restaurant is ecellent and we had a gread dinner one the 31st. All in all not what you would expect from a venetian palaceRead moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind feedback which allows us to look at our services and facilities from the guest’s perspective and to review and update our standards where necessary.  Your stay coincided with the low season in Venice and for this reason one of our bars was closed. I am delighted to read, however, that you thoroughly enjoyed your meal at the De Pisis Restaurant on the night of the 31st.  I am very sorry that overall the experience did not meet with your satisfaction and would be most grateful if you would contact me at prusconi@bauervenezia.it to explain with more detail the reasons for your unsatisfaction. Not only would this help us improve the areas which were found lacking but it would also give me the chance to make amends.  Yours very sincerely,  Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
