My wife and I spent five days at the Bauer Palazzo. There is actually another wing that just goes by the Bauer hotel, so when you take a water taxi there, you need to mention either the Bauer Hotel or the Bauer Palazzo. There are two different entrances to the hotel. The Palazzo entrance is on the Grand Canal. Old hotel that has been kept up very nicely. We were on third floor overlooking the Grand Canal with a great view of La Salute across the canal and San Maggiore across the Guidecca Canal. Staff was great and we dined there one night and food was excellent. Great spot and centrally located in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 15, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
