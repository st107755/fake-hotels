We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Everything was over-the-top, which is perfect when you are on your honeymoon. The staff was very friendly. It's has a great location. The breakfast room had a great view and the ladies there were so kind!!   My only gripe is the concierges. They didn't seem to know as much as they should. They gave us conflicting info. A couple of them weren't so nice. BUT, there was one nice lady and we enjoyed our interaction with her.   We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
