Upon arrival we were welcomed and informed our rooms has been upgraded to suites and been given late check out. The check in staff were very warm and friendly and personally escorted us from the small check in at the front of the hotel that leads to the boat dock to our suites.  Given the location of this hotel, I wasn't expecting the suites not to be very big, but these were huge! with very well appointed living room, entry way, full bathroom with spa bath! and very large bedroom. These were situated in the old part of the building which is decorated in the traditional venetian style.  Bauer Palazzo is an elegantly designed hotel with true 5 star service, including staff there to hand you umbrellas if its raining without having to ask, to providing shoe covers for the flooding.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 16, 2018Dear Linzbh1,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo and for your positive and detailed feedback.
