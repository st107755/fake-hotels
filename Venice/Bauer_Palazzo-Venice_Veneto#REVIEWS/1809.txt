We stayed at Bauer Hotel last year. It is really a very beautiful hotel in the best location in Venice. The room was fantastic and very clean. We didn't have view but it was Ok because we were out all day. It was quiet. The people working there are polite and serve you well. Beside a canal (you think you live in a dream with all those gondolas around...). Lovely pieces of art in all hotel areas. A stylish hotel. The only think i didn't like was the poor and not really tasty breakfast. But the coffee is fine....The breakfast is served in a fantastic room, you don't want to leave when finished.... I wish some day i could go there again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 4, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for reviewing your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
