Great hotel and great location. Staff were excellent as was the food. When they say breakfast finishes at 10.30 a.m. they mean it so don't arrive at 10.25!!!!  Check out the painting behind the reception, really cool.  If you want to buy decent Murano glass take out a mortgage before you travel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind comments and for highlighting the positive features of the hotel.
