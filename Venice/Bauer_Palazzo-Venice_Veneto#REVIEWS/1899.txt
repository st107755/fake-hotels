We booked a four night holiday in venice in early february and decided to stay at the bauer. The hotel was fantastic! The hotel gave us a free upgrade to a junior suite where we had a marble bathroom with a jucuzzi bath and a fantastic view of the small canale and the campo san moise. After returning from a day out they had layed out slippers by our bed and a bathrobe was waiting for us along with complimentary toiletries. The staff are incredibly polite and always happy to help. The hotel has an amazing terrace with views of the lagoon the rio san moise. The american breakfast was fantastic a huge range of food to choose from. We would definatly recommend staying at the Bauer hotel, much nicer than the Danielli in our opinion. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer.
