Our booking was for the Bauer Palazzo yet we were placed into the inferior "hotel" side.  This should have been made clear in our booking.  We are disappointed in the small room (#646)(approximately 12x12) with a depressing view of a tiny interior shaft and views into other rooms' windows.  On the plus side, the location is very near Piazza San Marco; the bed is very comfortable; and the terrace restaurant directly on the Grand Canal is lovely.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear Elizabeth, thank you for your feedback.
