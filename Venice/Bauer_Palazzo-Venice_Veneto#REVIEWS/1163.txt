The room 630 overlooking the laguna was a plus during new years eve commemorations - the accomodations are superb as well the service. The Rececpion & Concierge teams are always at your service with a nice smile and very efficient The breakfast at the 5th floor is a  very good experience and special for the view it offers. The only remark, besides an instable wifi: THE BAUER SHOULD NOT RECOMMEND RESTAURANTS NOT CHECKED BY ITS TEAM, AS THE CASE OF  TRATORIA DA FORNO. we requested a recommendation to  Mr Andrea and he gladly offered the suggestion and unfortunately we accepted, and that cost our year end party, as my wife got sick and we had to cancell it. Such restaurant should not be in the partners list of a hotel like  the Bauer.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 16, 2015Dear Guests,   We are delighted that you enjoyed the beauty of our UNIQUE location, the  SUPERB room and our EFFICIENT staff.
