My wife and I were on our yearly October getaway.  First time to Venice and we chose the Bauer.  This is a wonderful property!  Very close to San Marco!  Room was very nice, staff was great, breakfast good.  The restaurant overlooks the Grand Canal!  The hotel is also on a side canal and you can pick up a gondola just out the front door.  The best part... we were there for my birthday and the hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne.  We had to shorten our stay due to Hurricane Matthew bearing down on our home in Charleston, SC.  Highly recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 15, 2016Dear Jeff, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
