A beautiful hotel where you are made a to feel as though they really want you there.  On arrival the room didn't have the view we had hoped for so we asked for a different one we was made available very quickly with a minimum of fuss and were made to feel that it was their fault rather than ours - rare to say the least -.  Breakfast was a'la carte with  many delicious choices. The restaurant was rather expensive but well worth it.  We did eat out a many various restaurants, as there are some really great ones right on the canals.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 25, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
