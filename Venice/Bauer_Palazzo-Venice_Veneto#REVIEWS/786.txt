This hotel is wonderful!  We stayed on 5/3 and 5/4/2016.  The staff were very helpful and the location was great.  Could not have asked for a better location.  The room was very spacious and comfortable by any standards.  We did not have a view from our window but could hear the church bells each morning and evening.  The bar at the hotel offers Great views of the grand canal and was wonderful just to sit and have a glass of wine and relax and watch the traffic on the canal.  The breakfast came with the room for our stay and it was great as well.  It had a nice variety and the hours of service were very convenient.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 14, 2016Dear Guest,  We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience at The Bauer Palazzo and for your advices, they are important to improve the quality of service and to enhance our reputation.
