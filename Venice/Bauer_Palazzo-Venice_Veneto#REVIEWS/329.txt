We recently stayed at this Hotel and we enjoyed our first experience of Venice. It was located in a perfect position facing the Grand Canal on one side with access to the Gondolas on another side and access to luxury shops at another. We were so close to San Marcos Square and the Doges Palace a 5 min walk was all it took. The Hotel has a boat that takes you across and  to Giudecca Island and then takes you back at set times during the day. We found the staff very polite and helpful and the breakfast on the terrace facing the Grand Canal was amazing - so much choice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 23, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
