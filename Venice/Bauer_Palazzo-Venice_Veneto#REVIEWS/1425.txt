Spent the last 4 days at the Bauer Hotel, Venice. Possibly one of the best hotels ever......excellent location, great breakfast (on the terrace overlooking the Grande canal), lovely friendly helpful staff, good rooms, and gondola's on tap. If you can afford it I would recommend this hotel as a brilliant place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 1, 2013Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
