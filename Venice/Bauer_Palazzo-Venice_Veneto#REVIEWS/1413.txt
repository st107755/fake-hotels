There are two Bauer Hotels in Venice; ours was the one on St. Moises (Moses) square.  Our room was lovely, blue and gold damask on the walls, very large marble bathroom, and a window onto the square.  We stared right into the sculptures on the St. Moises church facade, had a view of the San Marco bell tower and could hear it chime.  Our travel agent had arranged a special farewell to Venice meal in the hotel dining room and it was delicious and seemed lavish.  When we return to Venice (some day!) we will stay at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 28, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your review of The Bauer Hotel.
