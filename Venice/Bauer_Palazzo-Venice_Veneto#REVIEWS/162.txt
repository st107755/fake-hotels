The best thing about the Bauer is the location.  We had a suite with 3 kids occupying the sitting room on fold-aways.  The room was comfortable with good strong showers and the towels were replenished twice a day.  I mention this only because summer in Venice involves a lot of walking in hot sunshine and that means sweat... lots of sweat.  So to be able to return to the room from time to time to refreshen with a cool shower was simply... lurvvv-lee.  Breakfast on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal is superb.  Breakfast itself was standard buffet style - don't expect fabulous.     We hired the rooftop jacuzzi and that was a cool experience... they serve you Prosecco and strawberries too and the views over the rooftops is Wow !!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 15, 2018Dear Will K,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your family stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
