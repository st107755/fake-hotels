What a wonderful surprise.  Words don't do it justice.  Part of the Hotel is Hotel Bauer.  The Bauer Palazzo part of the hotel seems to be a bit more exclusive and the part of the hotel right on the Canal.  The views are breathtaking.  The decor of the rooms makes you feel like you're in Venice at the height of its importance.  The service is great.  The breakfast is wonderful and so is the place it's served.  You're a short walk from the vaporetto stop and St. Mark's Square. You're a ten-minute walk to the Rialto Bridge.  We would DEFINITELY return. See you another time, Room 746!Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 22, 2018Dear Jcookrtiz,  Thank you for reviewing your experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for your kind comment.
