We really enjoyed staying here. The hotel is typical old-style italian with lots of marble. We had a lovely suite decorated in gold, with a small terrace overlooking the grand canal but not at all noisy. In fact the hotel was pretty quiet given its proximity to St Mark's Square. The concierge desk was particularly helpful, offering 3 suggestions for every dining recommendation we requested. The hotel's own restaurant was good with an interesting Asian-Italian twist but with few diners while we were there, was a little lacking in ambience. We particularly enjoyed the live jazz one evening in one of the function rooms with an aperitif.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 21, 2015Dear Guest, we appreciate you taking the time to post a review on TA, delighted to know that you enjoyed your stay and that the Team satisfied your requests.
