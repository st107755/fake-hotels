The hotel corridors are exactly like the ones from "The Shining!" Super creepy. The prices are WAY overpriced. I think a cup of tea was 12 euros. The room was I think 600 euros for a basic room. The elevators are a joke! I would only recommend this hotel to suckers!Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property; We are sorry to read that we did not live up to your expectations.
