Stunning hotel which is idealy stituated. We stay in a suite in the anex which I wouldn't do again. I'd stay in the hotel itself. The room was very clean, with fresh bedding and towels every day but very dark and noisy early in the morning as it was directly above the delivery area of the hotel. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. The  choice for breakfast was excellent. 2 different rooms for breakfast, one facing the canal. I would stay again but in the main hotel.ðŸ˜ŠRead moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 5, 2016Dear Guest, thank you to have shared your experience on your stay at the Bauer Casa Nova.
