I would not recommend staying at The Bauer in Venice.  While we loved Vencie, this hotel was our least favorite - by far - of all that we stayed in during our two week Italian vacation.  The hotel was old and run down - even though it had apparently been renovated fairly recently.  The staff were not helpful at all and quite frankly indifferent at best.  When we checked in - after waiting for 30 minutes or so - we were shown to a room that was small and dark with broken furniture (chair as well as bed).  When we complained the reluctantly showed us another room that was of the same size but with furniture in working order.  We complained again, but got no response.  We had booked through a travel agent/company and had paid for a certain level room which we were not given. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2007HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
