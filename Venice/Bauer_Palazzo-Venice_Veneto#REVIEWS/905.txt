We are glad that you liked it: you did describe it properly, being an annex less than a minute walk from the exit of Bauer with all the main services (reception, concierge, restaurant, bar and so on) located at the Bauer, really looks like a private building and the experience is very close to the style of the venetian people.

We look forward to have you back at the Bauer Casa Nova, we remain at disposal for future needs. Best regards Piero MagrinoRead more
