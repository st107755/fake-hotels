Was fun to be dropped off at our hotel by boat. Nice hotel by overpriced. Nice breakfast buffet was included with our stay buy we were going to eat lunch here, but was way too expensive. Lunch was like $26 and didn't even care for the menu. We enjoyed staying at Hotel Rialto better. We were there with two other couples and we especially liked the rooftop terrace overlooking the canal at the Rialto.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 27, 2015Dear Guests,   we thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay with us.
