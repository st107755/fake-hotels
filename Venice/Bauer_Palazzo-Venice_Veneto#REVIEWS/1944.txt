We booked our room at Bauer based on reviews from this website, as well as, their website.  The pictures are misleading.  This hotel had to be top class in the 70s, but it needs some serious updating.  Although everything was still in nice condition, it was just extremely dated - mirrored corridors, wood paneling that was just a bad wood species and stain, dated colored marbles, etc....  To our surprise, however, our room had been updated and was exceptionally nice, except for the bathroom.  Still in decent shape, it was just covered in that yucky wood paneling.  I probably wouldn't stay here again just because it made me feel kind of creepy staying in a place that hadn't felt the need to renovate their public spaces in 30 years - yuck.
