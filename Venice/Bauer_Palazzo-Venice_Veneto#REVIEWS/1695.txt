Hotel Bauer has a service problem. I saw many heated arguments between staff and guest. In one such incident, a lady asked a waiter to clean a table at which she wished to sit. He refused, saying that he was cleaning another table, and she should be happy sitting there instead. In another, a staff member actually kicked out a family of four while they were waiting for the shuttle boat to the other side. They protested, saying they were trying to get to their hotel room at the Palladio. He refused to let them wait. Unreal. See for yourself. Go to the front desk at reception and just wait. They are understaffed, untrained, and don't care. We will never stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel, we greatly value your comments and observations.
