We stayed at Bauer when came to visit the Biennale Arcitecture exposition last year. And I never had to regret the choice! The hotel manages to keep and trasmit the genuine antique Vanetian atmosphere and to combine it with top-class modern levels of comfort and service! If you want to get a full immersion into the spirit of this wonderful city and to be sure that every your request would be satisfied by the hotel's staff, then this is defenitely a hotel for you! And yes, the "B bar" downsairs is one of places more "in" for having a drink in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind comments and for highlighting the positive features of The Bauer Il Palazzo.
