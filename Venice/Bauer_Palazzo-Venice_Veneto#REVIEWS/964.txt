Bauer is the right place with the design and decoration of the 1940s and 1950s. The reception gives you the feeling of Venice-stay as the "taxi drops you" on the stairs emerging from the water canal. The breakfast in alfresco style is great with the best possible view of the Grand Canal. Rooms are cozy, classy, stylish, and nicely furnished with antiques. The walls are covered with romantic fabric. The staff at the reception treatments gives you the pleasure and the feeling expected in a uniquely Venetian 5 star!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 20, 2015Dear guest,  We are delighted to hear that you have enjoyed your stay with us at The Bauer Hotel.
