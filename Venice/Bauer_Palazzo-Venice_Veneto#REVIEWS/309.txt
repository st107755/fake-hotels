We spent 8 nights in suite 630. We choosed it for its quietness (no direct view on the canal and less noise). Spacious and well equiped. Large, confortable (double) bed. Noticable: The TV is too far from the bed to be looked at confortably. Some hair conditionner in the bathroom would be welcome.  Restaurant: Try the risotto, it is a must.  What we appreciated the most was the quality of service. All Concierges we had to deal with were attentive, dedicated to their job and paying a real attention to the clients. Their advises were very supportive.  Important to know for management > they have a team work spirit and clients feel it and appreciated it a lot.  Mrs Lucia and her Team at breakfast floor (7th) are high professionals. Very friendly and helpfull.
