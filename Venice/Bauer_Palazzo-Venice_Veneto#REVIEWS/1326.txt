Perfect hotel! 3 minutes by walk to San Marco square. 2 minutes from Vaporetto stop (including Marco Polo airport destination) There is a nice view to Grand Canale from the hotel. Our room was made in Venetian style, including murano glass. The hotel staff is very friendly.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 21, 2014Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
