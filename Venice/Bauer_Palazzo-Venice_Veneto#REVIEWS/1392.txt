Friends, husband and I stayed before joining a cruise ship in July. What a fantastic couple of days! Our room on 3rd floor was gorgeous and staff were extremely helpful, especially at Reception. Having breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal was just wonderful...... The hotel and indeed Venice in general helped to make our Silver Weddings even more special! It is so central for everything!Friends have since stayed at the hotel and enjoyed the same experiences so keep doing what you're doing - it works!!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 1, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a raving review of your stay.
