I visited the Bauer with my husband and two children in December 2013, my mother who is 87 wanted a special visit to Venice with me, so the two of us went to the Bauer in December 2015.  At first we were slightly disappointed because we were allocated the annex which on our request the manager changed for us to the main hotel.  We had cocktails in the bar on a couple of occasions, which was very enjoyable and the breakfast overlooking the waterway was amazing.  lovely antique furniture, wonderful food and great service.  Mum and i are planning another break to Venice and the Bauer this December.  Venice is magical and the Bauer enables you to enjoy the city in style.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Feb 4, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your loyalty towards Bauer Palazzo.
