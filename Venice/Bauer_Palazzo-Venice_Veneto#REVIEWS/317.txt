This hotel is perfectly located near all the shops and Piazza San Marco. The decor of the property is beautiful and preserved. You may find it strange but in the interest of maintaining a contemporary ambiance, even the room keys are ancient looking. No electronic key cards provided. My only gripes if I could name one is that the bathtubs are too small and too raised off the floor. Also, 55 inch plus flat screens wouldn't hurt. That aside, concierge and staff are fantastic and the service is spectacular. Great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 20, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
