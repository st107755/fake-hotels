Gorgeous place right on the Grand Canal. Great restaurant De Pesis too. Great location. Short walk to everything. And if you are an architectural fan you will be in heaven. Lovely interiors! View from the Il Palazzo out to the Grand Canal is stunning. Staff was wonderful. The gold and red of Il Palazzo is so Venice. We loved our room.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 16, 2015Dear Guests,   we are extremely glad you spent a GREAT stay with us at the Bauer Il Palazzo Hotel.
