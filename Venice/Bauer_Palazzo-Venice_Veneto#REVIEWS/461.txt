Stayed at Bauer Palazzo for two nights, a very traditional hotel but looking very tired, certainly not five star. Location central and very good, probably it's best point. Buffet breakfast rather poor, they had cold hard boiled eggs and scrambled eggs being kept warm under heated lights. I asked for a single fried egg which duly came at an extra over cost of 12 euros. What a rip off, who do these people think they are. Safety standards poor and in fact dangerous, overall not recommended.
