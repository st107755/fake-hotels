We stayed for three nights at the Bauer Casa Nova, which is a separate building from the main hotel. We need to use our cards to get into the building, so it felt like we had our own private apartment in venice! The room was clean and the decorations was typical venetian, very romantic. Breakfast was served on the main building overlooking the grand canal and the Santa Maria della Salute. Location was perfect.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience at the Bauer Casa Nova, and thank you very much for your comment about your stay here.
