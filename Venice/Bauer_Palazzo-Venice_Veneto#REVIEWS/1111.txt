You talked to the management about the room service and as we already told you it’s a shame you didn’t tell us at once so we could inquiry and find a solution immediately. You forgot to write in your review that we didn’t charge you at all for the room service because our aim is to satisfy all our guests.   I’m sad when I read that you wouldn’t recommend our hotel because I remember that upon your departure you appreciated the solution we found for the room service and you promised to come back to the Bauer.     If you would like to further discuss your concerns, please feel free to contact me at adimaso@bauervenezia.com.   Warmest regards  Andrea Di Maso Resident ManagerRead more
