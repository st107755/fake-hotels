I had a great time at the Bauer hotel but my 4-day stay sadly ended with 40 euros being stolen from my wallet in my room. The thief did not take my entire wallet and he/she must have thought that I would not notice 'just a bit' of money to go missing. An inside job? I think so. The hotel manager did not offer me more than the advice to go and file a report at the local police station and a drink at the bar. Not very well handled in my view. And before you ask: No, my in-room safe was not functioning during my stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 30, 2014Dear Mr Van Antwerpen,  In reference to your review and the most unpleasant event described here under, I would like to inform you that a proper investigation has been carried out in order to shed some light on the events which took place on that day.
