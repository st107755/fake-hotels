After a cruise, we stayed here for 5 nights.  The room was lovely, but the view from our room (223) was terrible.  We faced a window & a wall of the building next door.  The room was large, clean, comfortable, & nicely furnished.  The staff was always pleasant & helpful.  The breakfast buffet was very good.  I don’t think the location could have been better.  As nice & comfortable as the Bauer is, I found it a bit pretentious.  We have stayed at other hotels in Venice that maybe were not quite as “top shelf” but were very comfortable.  If you are looking for a 5 star hotel with a 5 star price, the Bauer is the place for you.  I am just more comfortable in a slightly lesser hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 29, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
