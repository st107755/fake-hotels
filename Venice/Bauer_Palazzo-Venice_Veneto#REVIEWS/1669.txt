This was my third time at the Il Palazzo, I was with my 19 year old Grandaughter. We were on a cruise ship and I saw it was overnighting in Venice.

The service, the private check in, the bedding, everything was incredible (once again).Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  we thank you for taking time to review our hotel on Tripadvisor with your comments, and we are delighted to read that you really enojoyed your stay at The Bauer Il Palazzo.
