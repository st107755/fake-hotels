We stayed here originally because of the location.  We will always stay here now though.  The staff were incredibly professional! Some reviews say "stuffy" and "arrogant", but they obviously do not know first class professionals when they meet them!  They were extremely helpful! The location was perfect and right on the canals. The rooms were clean, classy and comfortable! The restaurant was fabulous (a bit pricey, but wonderful). I can't say enough great things. This was definitely one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in!  It was a royal experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 2, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind words of praise.
