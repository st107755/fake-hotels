We had a superb meal at the restaurant. Outstanding service with an attent and outspoken maitre d and sommelier. The amuse was maybe not at the level of the rst of the diner.

The adjacent bar is also a very nice to have.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 6, 2015Dear Guest, thank you very much for your super review!! we are glad that you enjoyed your meal with us and that the quality and the enviroment were up to your expectations.
