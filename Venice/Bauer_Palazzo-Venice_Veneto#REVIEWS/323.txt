Arrived by water taxi, straight to hotel entrance, was a very central area for shops and waterfront and gondolas were right outside , breakfast was continental style, fresh and plentiful, staff helpful and friendly, outdoor breakfast is a battle with pigeons and gulls so BEWARE.  We had a suite was comfortable and a good size with lovely toiletries and fluffy towels, our room was right outside the church with a bell that ding  dinged early morning , so no quiet lie in.  Would stay again, but is expensive.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 8, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
