For our 20 year wedding anniversary, I had  carefully selected the Bauer. One of the best locations just nearby the San Marco place.  We have picked the Junior Suite with Great Canale View. A magical room with lovely red tapestry on the walls, a canopied bed and a breathtaking view directly on the Dogana!  The champagne was waiting for us in the room.  We would like to thank the Concierge Team and especially Roberto and Marco.  Yes, this hotel is a Palazzo and deserves its rank. This is really one of the best we have experienced . And gives you a unique entry door to Veniceâ€™s magic.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 3, 2020Dear Laurentm553,  We would like to thank you for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
