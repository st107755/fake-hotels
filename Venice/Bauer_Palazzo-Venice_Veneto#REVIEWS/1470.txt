This small, boutique hotel has the feel of an old manor house and is beautifully decorated in the old Venician style.  The entrance is directly off the Grand Canal and the water taxi ride was breathtaking from the airport.  We got an upgrade on our room and could not have been happier with our suite.  It had a modern bathroom and was very clean all round with a friendly and helpful staff.  The breakfast was included and very good with one of the best views of Venice that we encountered.  I would recommend the Bauer Palazzo and would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
