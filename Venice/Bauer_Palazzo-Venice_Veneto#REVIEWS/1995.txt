We recently stayed in Il Palazzo with our two kids. The personalized service was excellent! We were upgraded to a suite, which allowed a lot more space for the kids.

We will not stay anywhere else if we go back to Venice!Read more1 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 31, 2015Dear Guest,  we are delighted to read your comments about your stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo.
