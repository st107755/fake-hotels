The Bauer is a very nice, elegant hotel in an excellent location. Our room was lovely and roomy and the bathroom well appointed. That being said, it just felt like something was "missing"...and I can't quite put my finger on it.  I think the staff, while very professional and polite, lacked the friendliness that can make a hotel stay so much more enjoyable. Perhaps that is due to the size of the hotel. I don't know...it just didn't "feel" like I wanted it to and I probably would try a different, smaller, homier place if I were to go back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 10, 2015Dear Guest,  We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and for your advices, they are important to improve the quality of service and to enhance our reputation.
