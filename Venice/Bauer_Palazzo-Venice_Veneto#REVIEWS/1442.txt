This hotel is has a great deal going for it. It is a beautiful old building, in a fantastic location in Venice, and it is well run and friendly. Breakfasts were our only meals taken in the hotel and these were delicious. A gondola ride is just a few steps from the front door -- be sure to do that! We had a very enjoyable and comfortable stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your feedback on your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
