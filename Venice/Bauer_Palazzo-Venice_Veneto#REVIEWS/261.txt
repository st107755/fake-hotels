I actually stayed at this hotel a few years ago but have to say it was everything I had hoped for. Service and Staff was incredibly accommodating and treated us royally. Location was great. Food was great. Close to Saint Marks and shopping! The ambience was "Venice" at it's greatest. Old world elegance! At night we would sit on the terrace and listen to the music of Venice! Romance...Romance... I LOVE VENICE! Great Boutique Hotel.  #travelDivaDayna Dayna PappalardoRead moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 27, 2018Dear Dayna,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Bauer Palazzo, and for your extensive, detailed feedback.
