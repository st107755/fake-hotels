A 3 minute walk to San Marco square and close to gondolas and ferry etc. Free taxi to Murano and Burano. Breakfast out on the alfresco is lovely but don't expect much from the eggs and bacon!! Otherwise a perfect hotel and very comfortable stay. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear Guests,   we are honored you enjoyed our unique location, the beauty of our historical hotel and our friendly staff.
