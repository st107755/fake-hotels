We stayed here in June of 2003. It was incredible. The service was the best we had in all of Italy. We stayed in 5 stars throughout and this was the best by far. The rooms are maginificant and the location cannot be beat. The breakfast area was incredible. It is right on the grand canal. I highly recomend this hotel.Read more1 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 31, 2015Dear Guest,   we thank you for your positive review.
