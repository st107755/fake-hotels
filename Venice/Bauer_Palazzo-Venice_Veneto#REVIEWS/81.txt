I took my daughter and my mother for a few days and we had a great time at the Bauer Palazzo. A fabulous location on the Grand Canal and so central for all the places we wanted to visit. Lunch on the terrace and breakfast on the roof top restaurant was just amazing. The rooms are spacious but old fashioned but still very comfortable. It is worth getting a room overlooking the Grand Canal.   Superb and long serving staff were so warm and welcoming. I had not stayed there for 15 years and it exceeded all my expectations.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 21, 2019Dear ESOA13,  We wish to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for choosing our property on the occasion of your stay in Venice.
