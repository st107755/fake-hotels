The Bauer hotel is about 5 minutes away from San Marco. Noise is never an issue in Venice as the whole town is pretty much deserted at night. We had a huge corner room and the bathroom was as big as the entire room. It was massive, with a tub and marble everywhere! The decor is typical elegant and ornate (not my style but pretty nonetheless). Our room didn't have much of a view, rooftop of neighboring buildings, but I didn't mind. Breakfast was typical hotel fare, with perfect cappuccino, cold cuts, breads and pastries. The service was non-intrusive and friendly.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 4, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review The Bauer Il Palazzo, we always appreciate feedback from our guests to enable us to improve upon the standard of service we offer.
