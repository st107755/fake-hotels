The hotel is absolutely beautiful and is located right off of San Marco Square, the most desirable area, but the thing that makes this hotel stand out, is the staff. The people at The Bauer really care about their hotel. From the front desk staff to the bellman to the housekeepers, everyone was hard working, proud and always gracious and helpful. We love this hotel, would recommend it to anyone and will always look to it first for our annual visit.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 2, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your feedback on your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
