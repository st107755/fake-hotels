Our two night stay at the Bauer was memorable and we will definitely return. Wonderful welcome, rooms clean and cool and quiet (although overlooking a side canal and gondola station).  Perfectly located. Leave the windows open and hear the gondoliers singing or occasionally arguing.  Magical!  Friendly breakfast service overlooking the Grand Canal.  Highly recommended.
