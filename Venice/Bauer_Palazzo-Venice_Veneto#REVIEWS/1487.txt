Understated, elegant and opulent little gem! Everyone is super friendly, honest and helpful. Breakfast on the 7th floor is exclusive to guests of the palace, food whilst buffet style exceeded expectations, it has gorgeous uninterrupted view of Venice. Access by foot is through a narrow back lane but the hotel is only two minutes from San Marco square. Best way to get to the palazzo is through a water taxi. The palazzo offers complimentary private taxi to Murano and back. Concierge were extremely helpful and friendly. We can not wait to go back. We were in room 315, a deluxe room with a small view over the roof tops towards San Marco. Highly recommend the Bauer. We went to the Grittier for some cocktails, whilst it seemed very grand the atmosphere seemed stuffy.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 10, 2013Dear Guest We would like to thank you for taking the time of writing your impressions on your stay at IL PALAZZO.
