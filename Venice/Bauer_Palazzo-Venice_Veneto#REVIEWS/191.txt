I loved this hotel! It was centrally located to everything we wanted to see & do in Venice. The reception / concierge desk employees were the greatest - with all sorts of help on how to get around, where to eat, etc. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning and LOVED going out on the terrace each evening for a happy hour - spectacular canal views! (just watch out for the crazy pigeons that want your snacks! ðŸ˜‰) Our room was huge and so very comfortable!Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 7, 2018Dear Laura J,  We would like to thank you for your kind and detailed feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
