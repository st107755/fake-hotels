we stayed here last month for a special birthday. arriving by water taxi right to the front door started the trip on the right footing. what a room, the staff were incredibly helpful and the views from the rooftop are breathtaking. breakfast is excellent and the choice and freshness of the fruit are terrific too. dinner in da pisis on the saturday was equally breathtaking. sitting at the waters edge watching life pass you by. the food was exquisite if pricy for the amount you get. a treat that we would hope to repeat at some time. highly recommended.
