This is one of the best hotels in Venice and its easy to see why. Its opulent and luxurious, the rooms are huge with marble bathrooms and a sense of old world elegance. But for me its the location that makes it fab, right in the centre of Venice, 2 mins walk from San Marco. The restaurant is great, service and food is very good as it should be in this calibre of hotel. What it lacks though are the small touches, like chocolates on the bed, a bowl of fruit or bottles of water free of charge in the rooms but if none of the hotels in Venice does this because they don't have to, then why would they? Lovely place to stay although pricey.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for your feedback about your stay at the Bauer Hotel, is always important to know when things are done right, but is important as well to get input in order to get better.
