I joined LHW before I went on my recent trip and was treated like royalty at this hotel, and the others from the same listing. My room was absolutely beautiful, with a terrace. This hotel is directly on the Grand Canal with a dock for the water taxi to drop you right there. It's so close to Piazza San Marco and getting around to the other sights.  I would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
