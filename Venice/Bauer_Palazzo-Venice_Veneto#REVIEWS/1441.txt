We stayed in this Great Hotel for two night 12/7.We had just arrived from London on the Orient Express. On checking in we were up graded to a suite. Wonderful with a balcony overlooking the side canal. The staff were very friendly .The position of the Hotel great right in the shopping area. Some very good restaurant recommendations from the concierge. We loved the Style of the Building. A great stay thank you to the BAUER!!!!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
