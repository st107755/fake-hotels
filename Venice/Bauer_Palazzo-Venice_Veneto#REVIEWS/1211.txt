We stayed in the Bauer hotel, in a suite during our recent trip to Venice. Although the building is very well located and is a grand old beautiful building, despite us staying in a suite, it felt like a jail as it had no real windows we can open to have fresh air or a view. We could not really stay in our beautiful large room unless we were sleeping  as it felt airless and stuffy. We stayed in the Grand  Canal last time and this was a toss between this hotel and the Baglioni. The breakfast area was wonderful, the food was wonderful, service was good overall, but had No wifi in the room despite it costing 20 euros which they did not end up charging us for.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 22, 2014Dear Guest  Thank you for your kind feedback which allows us to look at our services and facilities from the guestâ€™s perspective and to review and update our standards where necessary.  Regarding your description of the room, I would like to point out that at the hotel we have several types of suite with different kind of views. As a matter of fact we have plenty suites with Grand Canal views, some of which even boasts balconies or terraces.
