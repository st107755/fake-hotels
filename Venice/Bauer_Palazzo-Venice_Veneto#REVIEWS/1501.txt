Stayed there for a family weekend (2 adults & 2 children 6&9) from the 16th to the 18th March 2013 in a suite, as this was the only way to accommodate the whole family. Alternatively would have been two double rooms, but the hotel could not guarantee that the rooms would be adjacent! Hotel is kept in the old style but very clean and with great service from arrival to departure. Breakfast was very good and international, and the service in the breakfast room was extremely attentive, and very friendly to the children. The suite was nice and quite large with two bathrooms, and the children slept in the sitting room on a sofa which converted into a bed. However, there was no view at all, which is rather disappointing if you have booked a suite! Drinks in the bar are very expensive,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 3, 2013Dear Guest,  We thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel.
