Our first stay at this hotel in Venice. We were really disappointed ......rooms with old and smelly furniture, not so clean bathrooms, average breakfast.......such a pity ......the position of the hotel made us to choose it, but we deeply regret staying at this hotel. I don't recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2015Dear Madame,   I’ve been inquiring about your reservation and you were staying at the Casa Nova while your friends were staying at the Bauer Hotel.  They are two different properties: they are both located in the heart of Ven-ice, at five minutes walking from St Mark’s square.    Both the properties offer to all our guests, warm hospitality, excellent service and luxurious atmosphere. All our rooms retain charm with beautiful furnishings and all comforts to satisfy all our guests.  We thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay. It's a shame you didn't share your comments while you were here at the hotel, I'm sure we could check together and find a better solution for you. If you would like to further discuss your concerns, please feel free to contact me at adimaso@bauervenezia.com.   Warmest regards Andrea Di Maso – Resident ManagerRead more
