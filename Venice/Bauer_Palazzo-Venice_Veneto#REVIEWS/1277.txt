We stayed here for just one night in June 2014.  We had an upgraded room from AMEX with a free dinner and free breakfast.  Our room was a suite with a living room, bedroom and luxurious bathroom.  The service was excellent.  We did not have a view and I was disappointed because for the price (over 800 Euros) I did expect a view!  The service was excellent and the food was really wonderful.  The location is the key!!! This hotel is right on the water and you cannot get a better location.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 13, 2014Dear Guest  Thank you for your kind compliments which I will pass on to all the members of staff.
