Loved this hotel. The location was right by San Marco Square. There's a gorgeous church and bridge in front of the entrance as well as gondola rides. The breakfast and dinner terrace is spectacularly located on the best part of the Grand Canal. There's an incredible spa at their sister hotel across the canal and they have a free shuttle back and forth. I loved that we could take a water taxi directly from the hotel to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 20, 2015Dear Guests,   We would like to thank you for taking the time to share your comments on your stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo Hotel.
