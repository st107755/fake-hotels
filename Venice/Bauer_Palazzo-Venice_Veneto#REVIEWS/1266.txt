We stayed here for 2 nights with our children at the end of June.  We had two connecting rooms which were very nice and large. We arrived early and our rooms were ready which was a very pleasant surprise. The staff was excellent and the concierge was very helpful. The hotel is in a great location just 2-3 minutes from San Marcos square and very close to a water bus stop. We somehow missed the breakfast on the outdoor balcony so make sure you ask about it. Overall a wonderful hotel and I highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 3, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for leaving such a raving review of your stay.
