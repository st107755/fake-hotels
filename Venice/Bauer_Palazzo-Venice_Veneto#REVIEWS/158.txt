We spend 5 days at Bauer Palazzo. The best location in Venice with less than 2 min. walk to Piazza San Marco.  Very nice breakfast enjoyed at the terrace by the Grand Canal.  A special thanks to Marcello and his colleaques at the Bauer office - their recommendation and help regarding the booking process was perfect. We will come back for sure.
