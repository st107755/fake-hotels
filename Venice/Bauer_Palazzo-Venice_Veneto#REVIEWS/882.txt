Myself and my husband chose this hotel as a special treat for my fiftieth birthday and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right choice. The lobby is stunning, huge with marble floors and beautiful furniture and very tastefully decorated.The room was equally as impressive,a large comfortable bed,fabulous wallcoverings and a large marble bathroom with lovely handmade bath products.
