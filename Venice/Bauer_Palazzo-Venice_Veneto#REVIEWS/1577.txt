We picked up this hotel on a super discount site so we knew going in that we'd get the worst rooms which weren't that bad.  They had tall ceilings, a new bathroom and AC that worked well.  The only issue was a goofy shower that got water all over the floor.  This hotel was marketed as 5* but I'd really only give it 4*.  My only complaint was that the Internet is a bit spotty.   The breakfast on the deck outside overlooking the Grand Canal is worth the price alone and the location is excellent just a minute walk to Plaza San Marco.  I'm happy with the hotel for what we paid but would I pay full freight for this hotel...I don't think so.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 25, 2015Dear Guest,  We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience at The Bauer Hotel and for your advices, they are important to improve the quality of service and to enhance our reputation.
