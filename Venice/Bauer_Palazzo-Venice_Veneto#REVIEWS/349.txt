I absolutely loved this place.The Hospitality of the employees was incredible. The room was very nice, very old fashion but also up-to-date. I love the turndown service at night. We stayed here after we got off a cruise and I couldn't believe how close it was to san Marco Square. It was really close to all the stores. Plenty of food places to eat at. And the gondolas were right outside the front door. I did have one complaint, I felt that the restaurant was a little overpriced. I understand this is a five-star hotel but one beer was like $15 and a cuppa tea was $12 I think that's a little overpriced. I definitely would stay here again though!
