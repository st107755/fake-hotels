We were upgraded to a suite on our arrival at the Bauer Hotel. This was our first visit to Venice and this hotel surpassed all our expectations.  Everything was exceptionally Clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever had in a hotel and the turn down each night was special. All the staff were friendly and efficient.The hotel was very close to St Mark's Square with its own dock for taxis and gondolas.

This was the start of a fantastic trip to VeniceRead moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Feb 11, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo.
