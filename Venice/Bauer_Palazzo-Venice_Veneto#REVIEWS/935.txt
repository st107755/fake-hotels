This was our first time to Venice and what a great location for a stay.  The hotel sits on the grand canal and a walking block from St. Mark's Square.  Our room was lovely, the staff so helpful, and the rooftop breakfast was the best way to start a day!  The view from our breakfast table was priceless.  We received great recommendations for dinners, tours and shopping tips from the concierge.  The public rooms were so beautiful, we arranged a tour of the glass factory that did the chandeliers throughout the hotel.  What a treat!!!!   This is not  an inexpensive place to stay, but for a first time or a once in a lifetime visit, I can't imagine a better experience!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015Dear Guest,  we are delighted that your first time in Venice has been succesful and that the Bauer Hotel and its Team were able to make it possible.
