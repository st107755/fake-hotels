We absolutely loved this hotel. The room was very tastefully decorated. The staff were helpful. The rooftop views were amazing! To eat your breakfast looking down on the Grand Canal in Venice, who could ask for more?? Location is excellent, right on the main shopping street and a short walk from San Marco's square. Transport to airport was offered but we were easily able to access public transport from there. We would love to return to Venice even if just to stay in this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 10, 2016Dear Guest, thank you to have chosen Bauer Palazzo as residence during your stay in Venice.
