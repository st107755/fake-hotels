This is a very luxurious hotel in Venice.  Water taxis and gondolas at the side door.  Wonderful breakfast and the only place I found in 11 days that had real american coffee.  It's in a great location.  The only negative I could think of was to walk around the area we had to first walk past Gucci , Prada and Ferragamo along with a bunch of other high end stores that my wife wanted to stop at.  The other negative is that my wife wants to redo our bathrooms so they are as nice at the ones at the Bauer. This is a terrific place with a wonderful, patient and helpful staff.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind comments and for highlighting the positive features of the Hotel Bauer.
