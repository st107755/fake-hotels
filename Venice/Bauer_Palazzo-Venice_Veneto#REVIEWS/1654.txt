Stayed here for three nights in September, bed and breakfast.. Arrived via water taxi. Wonderful location overlooking Grand Canal and close to St Marks Square. Breakfast on the Terrace was amazing as were drinks in the evening, despite being expensive,   Staff very helpful, however on check in there was a long queue which took half an hour to serve - more staff required,  as it took longer than the water taxi from the airport!  Concierge very helpful.  A wonderful Hotel to retire to when you have had a busy and exhausting day exploring the City - peaceful, calm, luxurious.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
