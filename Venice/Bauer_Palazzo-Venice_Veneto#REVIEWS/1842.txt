i stayed at Bauer for Carnival.  The Hotel itself is ok, nothing to write home about. I think you can find very easily much more better 5stars hotels in Venice.  On Saturady 2nd there was a party at BB, the hotel's lounge bar; police everywhere, people screaming everywhere in the lobby, someone at the door checked who i was after a long queue.  The hotel lobby seemed to be a train station lobby. Is this a 5stars hotel?Read moreDate of stay: February 2008HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 3, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property; We are sorry to read that we did not live up to your expectations.
