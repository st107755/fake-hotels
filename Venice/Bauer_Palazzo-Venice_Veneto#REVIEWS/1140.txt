The Bauer in Venice is one standing hotel for courtesy, elegance, clean, position. the rooms are super elegant, most with a view, especially on higher floors you can see all the roofs of venice. this is a special place compare to the hundreds of ugly small stinky hotels in venice, price wise is very well balanced. Breakfast amazing, terrace on canal grande absolutely gorgeous. this is the place in venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
