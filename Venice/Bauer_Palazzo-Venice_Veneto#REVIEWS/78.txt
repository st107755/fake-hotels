Spent two nights at this worn down facility. First experience was the staff dropping a suitcase of ours in the river. Staff said it was ok and dry, but surely most of the clothes was soaking wet. After some hassle they agreed to wash the clothes only to demand a full payment of 330 euros by check out. The staff wouldnâ€™t let our party leave without payment, so we had a hard time reaching our airplane. Quite unbelievable.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 29, 2019Dear Guest,  Greetings from the Bauer Palazzo.  We regret reading that the experience in our property did not live up to your expectations, but we wish to clarify that the incident described in your review does not match with our record.   Unfortunately we are not responsible for third party actions that may have caused you the inconvenience. Our staff handles our guests luggage and belongings with utmost care and we never experienced any problem in the past. Further to the incident, we promptly sent the luggage to the laundry service and it was delivered to the room shortly after. We also took care of cleaning your suitcase from the salty water, and this was not added to the express laundry service bill.   We normally handle arrival and departure transfers and we make sure similar problems do not occur to our valued guests under any circumstance. Unfortunately, we have no control over services that are not directly organized by our Team.  We remain at your disposal for any additional information.  Kind Regards,  Martina Carlon Guest Relations CoordinatorRead more
