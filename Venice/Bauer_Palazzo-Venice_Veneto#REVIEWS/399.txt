This hotel is well located if you want to be near San Marco Square and the Doges Plaza.  They serve a lovely breakfast overlooking the grand canal, with very friendly and accommodating staff.  But it is very expensive and not worth the splurge.  This is not a five star hotel.  Rooms are tiny, beds are mediocre and overall you feel like you are getting ripped off.  It is in the middle of expensive restaurants and luxury boutiques (Chanel, LV, etc) Recommend staying away from the square ... as far away as possible.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 22, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments even if the experience was not up to your expectation.
