Beautiful hotel very well located. Rooms are very well appointed.  Staff is not very friendly for the most part. Shockingly the concierge had no information on group tours even though there is a tourist office with numerous offerings a few blocks away. Restaurant service was slow although food was good..  For a luxury hotel could do better.

We are absolutely pleased to read that the room we assigned for your stay lived up to your expectations and that you loved our privileged location, a few steps away from St. Mark's Square.   Further to your comment, we would like to explain that we generally tend to organize tailor-made tours for our valued guests, that normally include private guided visits and that are built around specific preferences. These tours are available on request, but our colleagues at the Concierge Desk are always delighted to provide information regarding independent visits and transportation in Venice, including alternative itineraries. We regret reading that you were not satisfied with the information provided, and we would like also to explain that group tours are organized and managed by third part companies.  We sincerely hope that this experience will not permanently affect your faith in our Hotel, which we will be delighted to restore, and that we will have an opportunity to welcoming you back in the future.   Should you need further clarification on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at our direct e-mail address: guestrelation@bauervenezia.it  Kind Regards,  Martina Carlon  Guest Relation Coordinator Read more
