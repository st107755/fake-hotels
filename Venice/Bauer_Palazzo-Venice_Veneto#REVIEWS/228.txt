My family stayed at this beautiful hotel last week (formerly a Venetian palace), and we loved it! The staff were professional, friendly, spoke excellent English and were very patient with our limited Italian vocabulary :)  A special grazie mille to Iralia for all her help during check-in and with recommending some great local restaurants. We stayed in adjacent rooms (202 and 203) that very comfortably accommodated the 5 of us - 2 adults and 3 teens. Room 202 had a terrace and both rooms looked out on the Grand Canal and Santa Maria della Salute. The hotel is located near many attractions in a very nice neighborhood, and it's an easy walk from the hotel to Piazza San Marco, the Rialto bridge and numerous restaurants. I recommend this hotel and we'll definitely stay here againâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 3, 2018Dear Joe M,  We would like to thank you for sharing your experience at the Bauer Palazzo, and for your detailed and positive feedback.
