It is hard to beat the location of the Bauer Hotel in Venice.  It is a short walk to St. Mark's Square and right off the Grand Canal.  You can have a wonderful breakfast while watching boats and gondolas sail by.  In the lobby, you can look out of the panoramic windows and watch the gondoliers  load and unload passengers, which was endlessly entertaining for our children.  The hotel rooms were comfortable, well-appointed and convenient.  The concierge staff was very helpful and friendly.  We would definitely return to the Bauer--in fact, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
