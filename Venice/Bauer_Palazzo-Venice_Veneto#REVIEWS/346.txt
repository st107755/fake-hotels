The turn of the century elegance of the Bauer is around every corner you walk.  The lobby and restaurant are beautifully decorated, and the rooms are wonderfully designed with expertly crafted moldings, furniture, and wall coverings.  The restaurant was also delicious, and the location was perfect.  Our biggest issue with the Bauer was the electronic dance party which started at 10:30 PM and went on until 5-6 AM (or until dawn).  The music was awfully loud to the extent that the bass rattled the beds.  This made it nearly impossible to sleep in the rooms that we had booked on the third floor.

We wish to express my apologies for the disruption to your sleep.  The International Film Festival is an exceptional, celebratory event which has prompted us to create some nightly entertainment for the pleasure of our guests. We regret that this was a source of disturbance.  As you have certainly witnessed, all the Palazzi on the Grand Canal are festively lit and populated with large crowds of people. Many of the local and neighbourhood bars and night clubs host large parties with music into the early hours of the morning.   With our renewed regret for the incident, we appreciate your patience and understanding for this exceptional circumstance  and  hope to see you again here in BAUER PALAZZO   Yours very sincerely, Stefano Noviello Resident ManagerRead more
