We recently stayed at the Bauer Palazzo in Venice for 3 nights. We had not been to Venice for 15 years. The hotel was wonderful and included a breakfast buffet. The rooms were lovely and we were lucky to have 2 rooms on the 5th floor with a rather large terrace. The service was 5 star and the best part of the hotel was the location which was 2 minutes from St Mark's square but wonderfully quiet. The concierge Marco was very helpful with directions and suggestions. Venice is very crowded so the peacefulness of the hotel was an oasis. We took their boat to their other hotel and had lunch there which was lovely. I highly recommend the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 30, 2018Dear Ellen K,  We would like to thank you for your wonderful review regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
