Great location, 2 mins walk from St Marks & backs onto the water. Very friendly staff. Did not get a room with a view which was a little disappointing for the price paid so would specify this with any agent you are booking the hotel with if not booking direct. However, as we were out and about almost all the time not a major issue. Water taxi from airport pulls into side entrance of hotel which was great.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 20, 2015Dear Guests,   we thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback regarding your stay.
