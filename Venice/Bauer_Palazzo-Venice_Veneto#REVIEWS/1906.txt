This is a great hotel in a great location however it is 'attached' to  the rather more standard Bauer Hotel. Ensure you want to pay more money for that 'historic feel' before booking here or alternatively the Bauer offers the same location. The rooms are small (welcome to Venice!) but nicely decorated. Bathrooms are superb. The 7th floor breakfast room and terrace are wonderful only pity is they stand empty without any use for the rest of the day. They really should use the space as a tearoom or bar in the evenings - stunning views. Hotel is lacking a lounge or bar! The restaurant is overarted I believe. Food is not bad but far too 'handled'. Good produce should mean less fuss.
