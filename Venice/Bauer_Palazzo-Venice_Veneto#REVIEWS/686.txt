We stay only 2 nights at the hotel. However the location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic, right on the grand canal and 5 minutes walk to St.Mark's Square. The staff were very friendly. The conciarge were packed with full information about venice. The room was spacious with two bathroom. The buffet breakfast is good but few choices for warm food compare to bread, pastry. However we sit outside at the terrase, enjoy our breakfast with the view of the grand canal. The view on the executive terrace on the 7th floor are the breathtaking!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
