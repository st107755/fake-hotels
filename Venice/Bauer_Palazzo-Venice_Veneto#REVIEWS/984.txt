Our family celebrated the wedding of my daughter Victoria and her husband Carlo on 21st August. Everything about the hotel was simply perfect:- location, comfort, service, food & drink. Not so much a hotel more a bucket list experience for all of our party. We will remember our time at the Bauer forever not just because of the occasion. We look forward to our return to Venice and this fantastic hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2015Dear Guests,   we are honored you have chosen the Bauer Hotel for your daughter's wedding.
