We stayed for four days at the Bauer Palazzo. What a beautiful hotel to stay. Perfectly situated within Venice opposite S Maria and two minute walk to Piazza S. Marco.   We took the complementary water boat from the hotel to the glass making island of Milano which is worth a visit.   Will be back soon.
