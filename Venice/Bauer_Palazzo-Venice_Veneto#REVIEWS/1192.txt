Our room was a little older but the view from our balcony overlooking the grand canal was pretty wonderful.  This is a great location since you can get anywhere from the hotel.  It's close to St. Marks Square, the staff is helpful and friendly and and the cleaning people do a great job.  One of the most interesting things about the hotel is the roof terrace for breakfast.  The view is worth the price of the hotel.  We couldn't understand, however, why it wasn't open in the evening.  There are many very interesting restaurants around the hotel so finding great pasta and pizza is not a problem.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear guest,  Thank you for your comments of praise.
