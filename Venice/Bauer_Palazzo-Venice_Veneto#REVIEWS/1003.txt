The location is good, the room was clean and comfortable but the price is too high.  If you pay this money for 4 nights, you can stay better quality hotels with views.

But the front desk staff are not so friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear Guests,   we thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
