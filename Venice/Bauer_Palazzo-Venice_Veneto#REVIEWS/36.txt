We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo 15 years ago, and booked to come for my 60th birthday. The hotel kindly upgraded our Deluxe Palazzo room to one with a spectacular view of the Grand Canal, and also left us a bottle of Prosecco on ice: both unexpected treats for which we were very grateful. The staff at the Bauer are friendly and helpful, and always available to answer questions or lend umbrellas. We drank in the bar most evenings and were always well looked after. Our room was scrupulously cleaned each day, and itâ€™s with sadness we had to leave.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 10, 2019Dear Igloo124,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo and for your heartfelt and detailed feedback.
