Amazing facilities, friendly staff, boutique decor and even a complimentary pigeon stick! Our rooms were comfortable, clean and nicely furnished and the view from the main cafe out onto the lagoon was absolutely stunning. Breakfast was a bit hit and miss (by bacon they really mean Parma ham, as it turns out) and there was a brief misunderstanding with the bill, but these were very minor blips in an otherwise enjoyable stay at what is surely a top class establishment. Would definitely come again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 25, 2019Dear James,  We would like to thank you for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
