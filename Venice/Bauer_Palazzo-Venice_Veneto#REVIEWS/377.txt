Bauer Hotel is 3 min walking distance from San Marco, and 10 mins from Rialto Market, making it strategically placed to visit Venice from.  The highlight for us, was the breakfast and that you can catch a water taxi (from the door step of hotel) to airport. You can also take catch a Gondola from just outside the hotel.  :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 6, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
