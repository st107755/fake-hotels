A lovely hotel with a fabulous position. We were upgraded on arrival to a junior suite which was a much appreciated gesture. The hotel is minutes from St Mark's Square and opposite the wonderful Basilica Santa Maria Della Salute. One of the highlights of the hotel is enjoying a drink on the outside terrace, watching the Gondolas float past towards the Grand Canal. Attentive, friendly staff. Would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 4, 2019Dear BerniceW,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for choosing our property on the occasion of your stay in Venice.
