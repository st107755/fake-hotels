Excellent location, staff and overall fabulous! Love this place. We will return! We arrived in September to find upgrade to canal view. OVERALL EVERYTHING OUTSTANDING! The concierge's were so helpful - tRoberto and hey even drew maps! Recommended fabulous walking guided tour. Gorgeous room, bar, restaurant - everything. Can walk everywhere. We came for Biennialle and we have art & design business and our home is great but I want to live in this hotel! Perfect bathrooms, bedding all exquisite taste! The rooftop fab too! I have stayed around the world and this is standout on service and style! Thanks - See you soon I hope!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
