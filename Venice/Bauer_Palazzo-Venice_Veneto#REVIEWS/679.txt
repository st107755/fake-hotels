The Bauer il Palazzo is the perfect mix of old and new. The hotel is beautifully decorated in Venetian style, but the amenities are all modern. We happened into the rear entrance, which is the new part of the hotel. The desk staff there hand delivered us to the correct lobby of il Palazzo. There we were treated to an upgraded room with a view across the grand canal. The room was gorgeous and the bathroom decadent. I especially loved the nightly turn down service with the slippers placed next to the bed. The concierge were super helpful, and the breakfast staff were extremely pleasant. It was not inexpensive, but it was worth every penny. Perfect location just a few minutes from St. Marks square.
