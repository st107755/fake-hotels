The hotel has an excellent location but the room assignment was very poor. We got a room that overlooked the stairwell and was very dark. The concierge staff was very helpful and kind, but I would not stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for taking the time to share your experience at the Hotel Bauer. We are happy that you enjoyed the location of the Hotel and the services provided by our Concierge Team, on the other hand we are disappointed that the room you booked was not up to your expectation.  Being a large Hotel we do have 12 categories of rooms that can cater for all different needs and expectations; we would reccomend to get in touch with our reservation department in order to discover all differencies among the rooms. Venice is a special city and the majority of the buildings, especially the older one, have particular features and are designed in different manner compared to new properties.  We hope to welcome you back at the Bauer Hotel, please do not hesitate to contact us. Best regards Piero MagrinoRead more
