Very satisfactory for what we wanted although whole area was shrouded in fog.  As everyone knows Venice is crowded with tourists like us !  We have been to Venice several times before so we were not actually deterred by all the people. We arrived by pre-booked water taxi from the airport and both our bags were delivered pronto to our comfortable room.  Excellent breakfast overlooking Grand Canal but still shrouded in mis.  Recommendation previous night by concierge of a dining place was not as good as it might have been.  Went to interesting exhibition on Vivaldi called 'Viva Vivaldi'.  Very good continuous show lasting as long as suits you costing about 12Euros each.  well worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 28, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
