We only stayed at the Bauer for one evening before we left on our cruise but the location was perfect. The room was large and very clean. They also have a computer and free internet service in their lobby for guests. Take advantage of their water taxi service if coming from the airport. It was extremely reasonable.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 5, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience after your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
