Restaurant for dinner and breakfast overlooks the canal so really good in terms of situation and choices. Breakfast all inclusive and menu was wide and varied. Lunch and dinner expensive ; there are better places to eat .  Room ( de-luxe and number 229 ) was spacious but slightly old fashioned . That said the beds were comfortable and it was clean. The biggest issue was the early morning noise- must be situated over the kitchen area as first thing, the bins were clearly emptied and the staff were really noisy as they chatted away - not great at 6 am . location overall was amazing - walking distance of everywhere .Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 9, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team.
