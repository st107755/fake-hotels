Having booked 3 rooms for our twin daughters 21st Birthday, we thought that upon arrival the staff would have offered us a welcome drink, as seems to be the norm for other guests. After reading other reviews we expected the breakfast to be outstanding, but it was very average and served on side plates, which seems rather mean. Yes the view up there is spectacular, and the staff are very attentive, but after 4 nights there could have been some variation in the food served. The location of the hotel is very good, but not sure that it is worth so much more than its sister hotel the Bauer. Having said this we had a lovely time, and hope to return to Venice in the near future.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 5, 2014Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your stay at Bauer IL PALAZZO.
