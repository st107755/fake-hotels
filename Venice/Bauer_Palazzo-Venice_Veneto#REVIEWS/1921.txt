We have just returned from an eight-night stay at The Bauer Hotel in Venice.  We could not have been more pleased with the hotel.  The Bauer is in such a convenient location.  The staff is friendly, attentive, and they speak English.  The hotel is a short distance from St. Mark Square and Accademia Bridge.  The Terrace Restaurant is right on the Grand Canal with breathtaking views at every table.
