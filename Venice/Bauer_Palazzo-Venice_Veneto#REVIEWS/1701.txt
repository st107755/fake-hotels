I spent 3 nights there last May. The service wasn't outstanding, but good. The only flaw I found was that they had only one computer with a printer that wasn't working and the staff wasn't very helpful. It took me more than one hour to finally get my boarding pass printed. Unacceptable for a hotel of this level. The location is excellent and the breakfast on the terrace of the hotel was like being in a movie...except for the bread.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Il Palazzo.
