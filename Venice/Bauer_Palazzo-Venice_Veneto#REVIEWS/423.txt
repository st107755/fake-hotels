Stayed for three nights as part of our golden wedding celebration.The hotel was in an ideal central position two minutes walk from St Marks Square The hotel itself was perfect they looked after us like Royalty always going the extra mile.Meals on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal were a real joy with service to die for..The extras they provided free because of our anniversary were both generous and unexpected.If you are looking for areal treat with someone you love you coudnt do better.Thankyou so much for a wonderful time.Ken and Jackie HarburnRead moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 30, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
