This wonderful hotel was recommended to me by friends who had stayed there...beautiful centrally located property 1 minute away from St. Marks Square.  We stayed there after arriving via cruise ship.  The ship delivered our luggage and we had a great stay for three days.  The hotel arranged a water taxi to deliver us to the airport and things couldn't have gone more smoothly.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 27, 2016Dear Guest, we are thrilled to know that your stay at the Bauer Palazzo and the transfer have gone smoothly.
