this hotel is in a fantastic location walking distance to the grand palazzo, grand canal and many shops and restaurants.  when we arrived, we had an easy check in and were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  the hotel is old, but that is the charm of it.  it is decorated in classical venetian style.  the layout of the room, while large, was a little strange because of the authenticity of the hotel style.  the breakfast on the roof is amazing.  there is no better view to start your day!  we used this hotel for only 1 night before departing on a cruise, although I am not sure I would want to stay in venice for more than 1 night now that i have seen it.  the concierge was helpful for finding a quaint local restaurant nearby for dinner and the service in general is wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 12, 2014Dear guest,  We are delighted to hear that you have enjoyed your  holiday with us at The Bauer il Palazzo.
