We Arrived here after a Wow trip on the Orient Express. Great rooms and breakfast ideal for St Marks Square and the various sights just two minute from the water bus stop. Ideal for private Gondola trips they stop just by the side door so no queuing. We were sorry to leave although we were going on a ten day cruise. Thank you Bauer we wl be back.
