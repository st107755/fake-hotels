I stayed at Bauer a couple of times, last one being during the film festival, and once again my experience was extraordinary. I have to mention the location, it just couldn't be better. The service on arrival, concierge availability and helpfulness, service and room service are totally first class.  I had a couple of lunches there and a dinner on the terrace, all of them were impressive in terms of food, service and place, right by the water on the Grand Canal in the most romantic spot of Venice.  They also had a special film festival boat taking you to Lido which was very useful. My room was great too, it had nice side view, was quite big, tastefully decorated and soo clean!! All in all, must be one of the best hotels I stayed at and def worth every dollar.Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your feedback on your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
