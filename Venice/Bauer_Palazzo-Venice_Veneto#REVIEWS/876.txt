The Bauer Hotel truly was perfect! I got an amazing price for a beautiful suite and breakfast every morning of our stay, which I must say was fantastic. Great buffet food and great service! The restaurant area over looks the Canal and Santa Maria Della Salute and at our first Breakfast on the first day a couldn't believe my eyes. It was the perfect view of Venice. I took my girlfriend for a surprise Birthday weekend and it was made perfect by the Hotel. Brilliantly situated. 5 seconds from San Marco Square. Everything is so easy to access from there, including Gondola service right from the front door step! With so many options and places to choose from a couldn't believe my luck with choosing this place. The perfect Venetian experience!
