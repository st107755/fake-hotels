We stayed at the Bauer Palazzo for three nights and loved the hotel. It's not inexpensive, but it was extremely convenient in terms of location and the service was first rate. The room was also huge and easily fit our party of three people. We cannot imagine staying anywhere else when we return to Venice. The outdoor bar is also fantastic and a great way to end the evening with a view of the Grand Canal and the Cathedral.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 16, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
