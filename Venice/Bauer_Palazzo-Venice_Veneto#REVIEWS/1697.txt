The hotel was very nice, we were upgraded to a room with a fantastic view.  The staff was gracious and helpful.  My only complaint is that it is very confusing finding your way around the hotel.  It is quite large, and to make things more confusing it is linked to the sister hotel (which seems more modern).  There are no signs that I noticed to help you find your way.Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for the kind words, it was an absolute pleasure to lern that you really enjoyed your stay at The Bauer Il Palazzo.
