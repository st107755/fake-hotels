We actually stayed in another building and not in the main hotel so I can't comment on the rooms in the main hotel.  The building we stayed at was right by the main building.  The rooms are dated and the decor almost looks like it belongs in a museum but everything was very nice.  Wifi was very spotty at best.    The Bauer is located in a great location.  Its right by the Piazza San Marco.  Its quiet noisy at times due to all the tourist traffic around.  Small price to pay for the prime location.  You can walk to anywhere in Venice.    The concierge offered excellent suggestions for dinner and provided us with directions and what to do in Murano and Burano.  Breakfast was served every morning out on the terrace overlooking the canals.
