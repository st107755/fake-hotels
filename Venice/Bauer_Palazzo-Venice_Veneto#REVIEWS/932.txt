Just checked into Bauer today. Found out they are in the business of selling drinking water. This is my third 5 star hotel in this Italy trip and first one that does not offer on-suite bottled drinking water. When asking, they simply said mini bar is my best choice at €8/500ml. Perhaps it shouldn't make a difference when you pay €500+/night, but something doesn't feel right. I am against hotels pushing bottled water as a revenue center.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for your post sharing your opinion about your stay.
