Venice is one of the best cities in the world and choosing the right hotel makes all the difference; the Bauer Palazzo is perfect in every sense.  Outstanding old building beautifully decorated, spacious rooms, terrace overlooking the canal -near a gondolas' station- where tens of gondolas cram the water alley with beauty and love songs and a professional warm staff.  The hotel is a two minutes walk from San Marco square, the most famous and exquisite venue in Venice, the restaurants and the shopping area.  Go for it!Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 5, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
