Stayed here for three nights to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday,couldnt have picked a better place. We arrived early but it was no problem and they checked us in at once with an upgrade(free) to a beautiful suite over looking the square and the side canal and gondala station. The room was beautifuly decorated,and spotlesly clean and was kept that way for the entire stay.Great bathroom fluffy new towels ect. The breakfasts on the terrace were exellent and with the great weather awonderful start to the day .The location is ideal ,only a couple of minutes away from  st marks ect, and very easy to acess from the water buses /taxis ect. Would highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to write this amazing review on The Bauer Hotel.
