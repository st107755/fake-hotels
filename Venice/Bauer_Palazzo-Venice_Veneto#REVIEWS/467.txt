This hotel is one of the nicest hotels in Venice. Located right off the Grand canal and near St Marks square, it was a perfect location. The concierge was so helpful; arranging tours, taxis, anything we needed.  The rooms were beautiful. We loved the free breakfast in the morning. We will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 6, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
