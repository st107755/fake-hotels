When booking, be aware that the accommodation in Bauer Casanove is in the four star annexe to the main five star hotel which is a separate building. This means you have to walk outside, between buildings, to breakfast in the main hotel. We already knew this on booking, having read other reviews. Other than that, the service, the room, housekeeping, breakfast, bar, facilities etc are of five star standards. Outstanding accommodation and location. Staff were very helpful and looked after us well. Would love to return.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Jet2holidaysDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Feb 17, 2018Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your experience in our property Bauer Casa Nova.
