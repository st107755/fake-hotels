My wife and I stayed here two nights as part of an Insight Luxury Gold Ultimate Italy tour. The hotel is beautiful and the room while small, not by European standards though, was very nice and we had a view of the canal where you enter the hotel from the water. The location could not have been more perfect for Venice, we were less than a five minute walk from St Mark's Square and Doge's Palace.  Again, it is a beautiful grand hotel and the breakfasts were very good. I most certainly recommend a stay here and there are gondola rides right outside the hotel.  While we did not use this particular gondola ride, we do highly recommend doing a gondola ride with music and singing, so special. Venice is amazing!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 11, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
