What a hotel ! It is a beautiful old classic style hotel - pure luxury. From the gorgeous marble bathrooms to the gorgeous view of the Canal we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Breakfast was on the rooftop and you have uninterrupted gorgeous views of Venice (watch out for the seagulls who try to steal your food!). Wait staff were so lovely and friendly, checking in and out was nice and easy and we also had a on the house boat trip to the Glass Factory which is offered to guests. Our room was tended to twice a day where the staff would lower the outside shutters and prepare our bed. Five star service. Excellent place!
