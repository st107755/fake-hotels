We were picked up at the train station and transported by private boat to the Bauer Hotel..what a fun experience!  The Bauer hotel is in a great location to San Marco square, restaurants and high end shopping. This Hotel is large in comparison to others I've been in Venice, it was clean with a friendly staff. Our room was clean and well appointed. Overall our experience at the Bauer was excellent.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 26, 2019Dear Jbary50,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo and for your kind, detailed feedback.
