I stayed at the Bauer hotel for work . The structure -even if it's an eyesore in the heart of Venice- it is wide, clean , central . But the services are very bad . Starting with the reception where rude people work and distracted . My experience was very bad . And the price definitely exaggerated since the mid facilities are of equal quality but at least polite people that make the stay pleasant .Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 22, 2015Dear Guest,   we thank you for taking the time and express your comments about your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
