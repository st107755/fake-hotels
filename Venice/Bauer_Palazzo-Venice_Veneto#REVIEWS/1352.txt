Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Bauer II Palazzo for 3 nights in December. The room was spacious, nicely furnished and very clean. the location 5 mins from the St.Marco Square was ideal for our trip. Staff was very friendly and helpful. we only ate breakfast at the hotel but that one was fine, located at the 7th floor with a nice view of the city. - we would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 30, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a raving review of your stay.
