Our stay was very enjoyable. I enjoyed their breakfast buffet with plenty of options. The staff of the breakfast was wonderful and I enjoyed hearing the story of the seagulls Sophia and Gina lifting items from the dining terrace. The bar staff was great and did not encourage us to leave when we were the last customers. The concierge was very helpful and courteous. The room had a wonderful view and terrace. The bathroom was spacious and I enjoyed the quality of the locally made toiletries. My least favorite aspect was the lobby design. It felt cold and under decorated with too much brass. Unfortunately I ran out of time to try the spa.
