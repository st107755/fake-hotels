We booked two days at the Bauer Palazzo and the check in process went badly awry, but once that was sorted the hotel people were friendly and helpful. The Palazzo is more 'typical Venetian' than the main Bauer, though effectively they are the same hotel. Be aware that at least some of the Palazzo rooms are tiny. Facilities are generally OK but not more than that. Pigeons are everywhere in Venice but we were surprised that the staff didn't try to shoo them away, even letting them peck at breakfast tables. Location a few minutes from San Marco is excellent.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments, even if the check in was not perfect.
