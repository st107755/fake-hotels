Great location for walking the city, visiting Doges Palace or that moseven just taking a gondola ride- literally steps from the lobby. Right on the Grand Canal, have breakfast with excellent views! Only a very short walk to Doges Palace. Room was just perfect and inviting, very comfortable beds. Staff very friendly. I loved that we had a real key! It seems that most hotels now have electronic keys. Highly recommend....Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 23, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
