A wonderful experience....Amazing location with views and experiences all to our own! Great breakfast. Great late afternoon wine overlooking the Grand Canal. Great enchanting serenades from the Gondola's passing by in the West canal one after the other,,,,morning to night! Great location right off of the square and surrounded by high end shopping. The staff was fantastic, the concierge was extremely helpful, and the room maids were amazing! If I had only one wish, it would have been to experience the rooftop bar/terrace. For some reason they said it was closed due to weather.....but it was beautiful both days we were there?Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 18, 2018Dear Jwusa2018,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
