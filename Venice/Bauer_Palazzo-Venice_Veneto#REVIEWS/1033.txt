We stayed for a few nights back in April. We paid a bit more for an upgraded room but ended up with a small closet with a view of a brick wall. The bathroom was ok but overall this hotel could do with a refresh and update. However, the location was perfect. So close to St Mark's square and lots of good shopping. The hotel concierge staff were so helpful and friendly. They couldn't have done any more for us. Truly impressed by them, shame the accommodation let the hotel down a bit.
