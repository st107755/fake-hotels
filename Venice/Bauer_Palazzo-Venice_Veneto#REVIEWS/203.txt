There are two Bauer hotels on opposite sides of Venice and we stayed at the one near St Marco Square but there is a shuttle to the one on the other side which is worth visiting.  The rooms were very nice and the bed comfortable.  We had a bit of an issue because the maid closed the external blind and it took us 24 hours to work out how to open it - in case it happens to you there is an unmarked switch next to the bed, saves keeping the light on.  The food at night was really good but the breakfast buffet left quite a bit to be desired.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 27, 2018Dear Jennifer L,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
