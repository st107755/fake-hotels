Most of the people that I have talk to, argue that the best hotel in Venice is the Danieli. I cannot agree with them. The location, service, rooms of the Bauer are magnificent.

The only problem is the price which is above what I was expecting, but worth every cent.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for taking the time to write this amazing review on The Bauer Hotel.
