We had a wonderful stay at Bauer Palazzo with wonderful views of the Grand Canal and so close to San Marco. The buffet breakfast was 1st class and the room we stayed in was fantastic. All the staff were very friendly and helpful which made for a truly  memorable trip in Venice. If you want to treat someone special this is the place to come.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 15, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
