Great location, very close to St. Marks Square.  Close to all the restaurants with a stunning view of Venetian waters.  Service was top-rate, what you'd expect from a 5-star property.  My favorite moment was having breakfast on the terrace, glimpsing the water and watching the world go by in front of the hotel.  Rooms were nicely appointed and the beds were particularly comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
