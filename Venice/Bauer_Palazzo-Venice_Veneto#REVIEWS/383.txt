What an outstanding hotel, the decor is out of this world. Classic marble all over the hotel with old style wood furniture in the rooms. It's felt like I was in old Italy. The rooms were big and spacious with blackout curtains,the bathrooms were fully marble and great facilities. The eating area outside has an unreal view, watching the boats going while having your breakfast. I like to be left alone while away and this hotel doesn't bother you or try and pamper you, some people enjoy that but I like to do my own thing but staff were always helpful when needed.
