Given that this was early January and quite a few places were not open, we were very happy to visit the Bee Bar at the Bauer Hotel on two evenings.  The first occasion (Friday) was just for fun and they had a really good cabaret, the second, Saturday, just a DJ - we were a  bit desperate as the restaurant we had gone to was closed, but the Bee Bar came up with a really good chicken sandwich, we were very grateful! Just a word! Beware of the nut nibbles provided with drinks - seriously hard!Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 19, 2014Thank you for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Hotel .
