I purposely selected this hotel for its ratings and location. It did not disappoint.  It is a two minute walk from St Marks square. It is situated right at the end of the grand canal. We went bed and breakfast. We stayed only 2 nights. We were placed in the annex which was across from the main hotel. I would recommend to select for a river view if you can afford it. The breakfast was excellent and service the same. There are loads to see around Venice and all within walking distance from the hotel. We dined out every night with so much selection. It was my wife's 50th Birthday surprise. I did notify the hotel in advance but sadly nothing special was put on. Disappointing from the hotels welcome pack.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 16, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for addressing this issue which is most important in today’s world when more and more people purchase their holiday on the internet, without the expert advice of a Travel Agent. A hotel’s room inventory is generally sold directly to the consumer or, in many cases, through intermediaries such as Travel Agents and wholesalers who – in turn – sell the hotel to the final client. Our business has contracts in place regulating this sale: we demand that all of our properties be accurately described with relevant information and photography. When this does not happen – such as in your case – we have the authority to terminate our agreement. In this situation you should contact your travel agent immediately and demand that terms of sale be respected. Another word of advice: when next making a hotel reservation call or write to the hotel, asking information on the type of room booked. Unlucky during your stay we was fully booked and the only room at disposal was our Gran Canal Suite. Yours very sincerely,  Stefano Noviello Resident ManagerRead more
