No where near a 5 star hotel. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and feel compelled to tell all exactly what you're going to get. I can only assume the people giving the good reviews have come from the suites.  The deluxe room was shabby, the bathroom was mediocre and the mattresses were rock hard! The photos on the website are not what we got! Please don't be suckered in to going here! There is no kettle and tea bags are 10â‚¬ each! Never have I before been to a hotel where there is no kettle and you have to pay for tea bags???  We checked out on the first night and went and stayed at Ai cavelieri which was up to standard and is in a very good location.   Do not go to this hotel!

As we wrote by email, We suggest to speak with your travel agency about your reservation. In any case, when you was arrival, we confidmed the twin bed as your request.  Immediatly you asked to change the set up, but we changed the set up of your bed during the afternoon and not before, because we gave you a free of charge early check-in. In a 5 Star Hotel we do our best to serve Our Guests.  When we wrong, we offer a compensation, but not under threats.  Best Regards Resident ManagerRead more
