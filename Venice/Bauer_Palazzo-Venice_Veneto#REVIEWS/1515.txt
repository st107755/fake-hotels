I had an amazing time in Venice for my Birthday. We booked this hotel because it was 5 stars and we wanted a "Superior" double. We were put into room 248. A nice enough room but not superior. The room was very small and the bathroom sink was/is broken with a bad repair job. Unlike a lot of reviews on here the service we received was outstanding. Yes the hotel is very expensive but you expect that from a five star hotel in a city that charges 120 euros for 1hr on a gondola!  One other negative - beside the room was breakfast.

Regarding the room, our base category is called Superior. Perhaps the name is deceiving. Your comments will be held in serious consideration when possibly discussing new names to identify our accommodations.  As per our breakfast, we have only two properties in the San Marco Area: IL PALAZZO and L’HOTEL (and its annex, the Casa Nova). Both are five star hotels.  IL PALAZZO has a beautiful panoramic lounge on the 7th floor of the building, while L’HOTEL an equally beautiful breakfast room with terrace on the Grand Canal.   I regret that a member of staff provided misleading information relating to the superior value of one setting versus the other.  I would welcome the opportunity of regaining your trust on occasion of a future visit to Venice when it will be my pleasure to show you that we can really do better.  Yours sincerely,  Giovanni Cellerino  Resident ManagerRead more
