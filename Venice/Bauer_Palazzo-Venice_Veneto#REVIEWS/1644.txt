There's certainly no place like Venice! For a first time visitor, the Bauer Palazzo staff can make all the difference for a seamless experience. As it is unique, arrival in Venice can be tricky to negotiate. One doesn't just drive up to the Hotel Check In!  The CONCIERGES at the Bauer all speak good English.  We called the hotel for our reservations. As we were returning guests, we remembered our first experience driving into Venice. The confusing arrival can be eliminated with the help of the Concierge. They made the reservation for PARKING OUR CAR, as one gets off the Autostrada. A PORTER met us at the PARKING GARAGE and took our bags, for the not too short walk to the WATER TAXI STATION. Alternately, one can struggle to find parking in this very congested area, and just pray!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for you recommendation and for highlighting the positive features of the Bauer Il Palazzo.
