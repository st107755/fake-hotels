We had the (in)opportunity to arrive in Venice with all of George and Amal Clooney's celebrity wedding guests in September 2014. It was a zoo.  Once we arrived at the Bauer, we were in heaven.  The outdoor terrace was a fabulous place to have a drink and watch the paparazzi swarm the celebrities down the canal--if nothing else, it provided amusement.  The hotel is 2 minutes from St. Marks square and other things.  The room was large and very tastefully done.  The service was good.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 27, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to share your experience in Venice, in particular at the Bauer Palazzo.
