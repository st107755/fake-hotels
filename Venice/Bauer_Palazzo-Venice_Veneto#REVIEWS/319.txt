The receptionist was so rude when we checked and no personal service whatsoever for paying over €800 per night When I came back to the receptionist after telling them they gave me the wrong key for the security box in my room she argued with me for over five minutes telling me she had the right key when I actually had used the one she gave me for a different lock box in the room. The concierge staff was equally rude when I went to ask them a simple question where something was in reference to the city map they gave me.  go someplace else your money will be better spent!!!  Giving them a 1 rating is more than they deserve!!!
