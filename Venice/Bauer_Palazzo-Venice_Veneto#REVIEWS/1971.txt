Good things first.  I can't rave enough about how fantastic the location of this hotel is.  St. Mark's square is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away.  Great shopping is right out the door.  Harry's bar is just around the corner and right next to a vaporetto stop.  The gondoliers at one of the major gondola stops could double as hotel doormen because they are so close.  And, the hotel sits along a wonderfully quaint side canal in addition to fronting the busy and dramatic Grand Canal.  But, then there's the not-so-good.  The hotel is way too stuck on itself and for no real reason.  Yes, there's marble.  Yes, there are fine woods.  And, yes, gilded items abound.  But, it's just not THAT nice to have the attitude that emanates from the front desk and the interior of the rooms. â€¦Read more1 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 31, 2015Dear Guest,  We are grateful for your comments and for having expressed your sentiments.
