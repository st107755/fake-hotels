Our three day stay was perfect from beginning to end. We arrived a little before usual check in but the staff fast tracked our room so after a cool drink it was ready. Our room was in the older part of the hotel with a view of an adjacent canal and the Grand Canal and was in the old Venetian style with high ceilings and antique furniture, magnificent. The staff were excellent including the concierge who were all very helpful. A unexpected bonus was the complimentary water taxi to Murano and Burano islands. Breakfasts on the balcony overlooking the Grand Canal were excellent. Drinks and a light meal on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal were very enjoyable and the staff were friendly and efficient. All in all a great stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 5, 2019Dear AnthonyPJ,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for your wonderful feedback.
