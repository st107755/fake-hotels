I am pleased that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us as this is always the priority for the entire Team.  Regarding the beds, our new mattresses have a padded zipper in the center (which means you can’t feel a thing!) but we also have regular king-size mattresses or mattress toppers (I personally love those!). Should you come back to Venice and to the Bauers, please let me know what you would like and it will be my pleasure to accommodate your request.  Yours sincerely  Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
