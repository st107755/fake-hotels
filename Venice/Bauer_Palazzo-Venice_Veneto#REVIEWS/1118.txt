You can't beat the location. This is literally 2 minutes walk from St. Mark's Square and right by the water! My husband and I were in Venice for our honeymoon. We emailed them ahead of time to request for a higher floor for our room and letting them know that this is our honeymoon trip and they're very prompt and friendly at replying to our email. Once we arrived there, to our surprise, our room was upgraded to Junior Suite! The service was so amazing and it couldn't get any better. Definitely recommend this hotel to everyone!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 27, 2015Dear Guests,  we thank you for taking the time to write a review about your visit at the Bauer Hotel.
