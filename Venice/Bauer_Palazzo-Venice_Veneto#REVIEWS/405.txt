Before writing this review I read the last 3 reviews.  As a reader you are trying to get a consensus of opinions. Count me as another Bauer fan.  Yes, this is 5-star hotel and you shall be paying 5-star hotel prices but if it is within your budget go for it.  Excellent location, just minutes from St. Mark Square. Excellent service.  Beautiful property with a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  The standard room is adequate, especially for a European hotel.  Most importantly is that the air conditioning works extremely well during the hot Venice summers.  If you can take a water taxi and get dropped off on the canal and take 2 steps into the hotel.  Very cool.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 16, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
