My wife and I stayed at the Bauer hotel in Venice in Sept, we were very pleased with our decision, superb location 700 feets from San Marco square and the main designer shops.  We had a room in the Casa nova section room 45 with an amazing little balcony to feel like a Venetian. we had a view on San Marco tower from the balcony.  Great room size and the most important is it was so quiet. We had the breakfast included it was very completed and excellent but on top of that we had breakfast every morning near the canal superb view on the gondoliers  don't look anywhere else.....location, location, locationRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 6, 2014Dear guest, We are delighted you enjoyed our location, the room, the breakfast and your overall experience at the Bauer Casa Nova.
