This is a really nice 5 star hotel. The location is from my point of view the best in Venice, just as the Grand Canal opens up. The restaurant is towards the channel, and they have a really nice outdoor bar just below. The restauarnt is expensive, women gets menues without prices !!! Starters 30 euro, main course 50 euro. The food is as good as the prices are high, perfect cooked and innovative. The wines though were quite reasenable.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 25, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to share your experience had at the Bauer Hotel recently.
