We couldn't have been happier with the Bauer Hotel.  The staff was most helpful in arranging a trip to Murano and transportation to our cruise ship.  Sitting outside for breakfast on the Grand Canal was a perfect setting.  We inadvertently left something of great value in the hotel room and the staff found it and have made arrangements for it to be returned to us.  This was after at least a week had elapsed.  We would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 5, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your visit to The Bauer Hotel.
