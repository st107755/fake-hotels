Good location right next to St. Mark's Square, room was alright, a bit worn down already but much better than the rooms we were shown after we complained about the twin bed.   Bathroom was clean, the carpet had some stains. Breakfast was acceptable, especially nice is the view on the Grand Canale. Another breakfast room is on the 7th floor with a nice view over Venice.  A bit strange is that the hotel is split into Bauer Rio and Il Palazzo, which has a gym while Bauer Rio does not.  Overall, the price we paid was far too high for this place, but this might have been because it's the Easter weekend.  If you get a good price, I would definitely recommend this place.
