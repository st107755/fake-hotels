Beautiful and historic hotel ideally situated for sightseeing and designer shopping.  Faces right onto the Grand Canal and is no more that 5mins from St Mark's Square and on a direct route to Rialto.  Has own Vaporetto stop and there is a gondola pick up point just outside.  The hotel is beautifully appointed,  there is a good bar and a good (if expensive) restuarant that serves an excellent range of venetian and italian food and also has a good wine and craft beer list. Self serve buffet breakfast was very good - with the bonus of Proscecco!   Staff in the hotel were faultless - nothing was too much trouble for them and they were always polite, friendly and interested in the guests.   Our room was large,  well appointed and very comfortable.
