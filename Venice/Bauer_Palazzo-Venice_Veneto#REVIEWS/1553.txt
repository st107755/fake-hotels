Had the experience of staying at this wonderful hotel about 3 weeks ago. Arriving by water taxi from the airport and stepping into the lobby where we were greeted by a very professional staff. The room was very warm and inviting.We had breakfast each morning overlooking the grand canal as the traffic increase by the minute. What a circus! As for assistance in eating and touring we found the concierge to be excellent. Recommend this fine hotel to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for the kind words, it was an absolute pleasure to lern that you really enjoyed your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
