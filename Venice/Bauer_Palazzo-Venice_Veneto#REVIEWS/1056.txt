Very nice place to stay with great location. Staff is very friendly & helpful. Deluxe Rooms were fully equipped, comfortable in size & clean. TV stations were limited & mostly Italian. Very small elevators that barely fit 4 adults in one time. Breakfast was good with nice view at the sea but eating on the outside tables is little uncomfortable due to the birds intrusion. The complementary Internet is also good in the room & the lobby area. Overall, I recommend this hotel for a family stay for a short stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 27, 2015Dear Guests,   we are very thankful for the time you have dedicated to reviewing our hotel.
