Grandiose, elegant, a real five star Hotel in Venice. The rooms are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms a real surprise with all the shining marble and glistening taps. The breakfast is served in the main restaurant overlooking the grand canal. The reception staff, Massimo checked us in, is very courteous and they will go out of their way to accommodate any request. This Hotel will meet all your expectations, do bear in mind that the prices are also five star.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2012Thank you for your kind remarks.
