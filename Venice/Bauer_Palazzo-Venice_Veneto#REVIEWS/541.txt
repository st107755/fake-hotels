The hotel is very well located, Near almost everithing to see in Venice. Easy to find and to arrive at. The rooms are OK, needing some work to modernise a bit. But everithing works well and the dimensions are good. The hotel is beautiful, and the breakfast room is very nice with a great view. The service is good and the personnel very attentive. I reccomend it.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 19, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
