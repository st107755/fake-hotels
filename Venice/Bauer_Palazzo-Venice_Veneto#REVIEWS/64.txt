Very nice hotel, Exquisite architecture of the reception and very grand. The location is 20 mins from the train station in a water-taxi but it has its private Gandola station and very close to St. Mark's square..!! The staff is quite helpful, especially people on the concierge desk, if I remember - Marco was fantastic. The stay was quite an experience. The most memorable moment was the breakfast when a seagull stole a bacon from our plate...!!! :) my son was awed..!!  If there is few things that they can enhance, would be great.  1 - In room-dining options are not great 2- The restaurant can be open till 11Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 24, 2019Dear Anirudhe,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for your positive feedback.
