What can I say but that this is one of my favorite places in Venice ! The staff is wonderful , our suite was huge and extremely elegant . Two huge bathrooms, a great living room and spacious bedroom .  Wonderful view of the canal and just a hop from all the wonderful boutiques and restaurants .  Breakfast was majestic with so many choices I can't imagine anyone not feeling catered to . We will definitely be back .
