The Bauer Palazzo has a great location, a very good staff and mostly good (not great) dining but the facilities are from another era.  The rooms are nice enough if a bit stuffy but the wardrobe and furnishings are from the 50s as are the elevators.  The overall feel of the place is that the owners do not have the means to keep up the hotel. A place like the Bauer with its great location in one of the great cities of the world ought to offer much, much more.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Guests,   Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property.
