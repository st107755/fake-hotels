Part of out Insight Gold, Playgrounds of Europe tour. Very nice grand old hotel, right on the canal, few minutes away from St. Mark's square. Close to stores, restaurants, attractions, water taxis, museums. Older, but elegant, just don't try fitting more than 2 people with suitcases at time in the elevator. Restaurant overlooks canal, very romantic. Buffet breakfast included cereals cheese cold cuts but there were scrambled eggs, pancakes (albeit not great). Service very good. Coming from Swiss Diamond Lugano, quite a smaller room and bathroom. Still, adequate closet space, drawers, in room safe. Love the power window shades in bedroom.

Didn't have time to use anyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 4, 2013Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
