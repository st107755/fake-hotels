Stayed three nights for my 50th at end of August. Hotel was fantastic with excellent service. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the grand canal was something I will remember for ever. Also enjoyed drinks in the roof top terrace bar which provided spectacular views. Staff couldnâ€™t have been more helpful. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.
