The Bauer was the crown jewel of our Italian adventure. While we stayed at other five star hotel throughout Italy, there is something so special about the Bauer. Thsi summer was our thrid time there, and we are alreday planning a fourth trip for next year. While the Bauer is  not inexpensive by any means, it is clearly worth it. Our suite was decorated with tasteful luxury. Everything from the golden fabric walls to the fine bed linens was perfect. The closet space was more than copius. The best part, however, was our view of Camp San Moise. The location of the Bauer is perfect and the concierge service was impecable. The excursion he planned for us to Murano was truely memorable. We cannot wait until our next visit!
