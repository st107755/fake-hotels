The views from our spacious room were lovely - canals, churches, shops.  The breakfast was delicious with seating outside to enjoy the Grand Canal.

It offers everything a guest could need.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
