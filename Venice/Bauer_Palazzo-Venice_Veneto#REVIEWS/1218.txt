After trying several different hotels in Venice, we decided for this one. Breakfast is quite good, but the rooms are very, very nice for the price, good space for 3.

We will keep on returning.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
