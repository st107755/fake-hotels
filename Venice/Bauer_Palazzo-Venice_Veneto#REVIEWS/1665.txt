Stayed here for 2 nights(Sept 9th 2011-Sept 11th 2011) after a very enjoyable cruise with Crystal Cruises. The Hotel must go  out of their way to find the most miserable staff in Venice. The room was poorly cleaned and the view consited of a slate roof. The Porters were non existant it took an hour to receive our bags, the man said nothing just held his hand out for a tip.  Buffet Breakfast included, if you like gallons of canned fruit and one cup of coffee OK otherwise it was very very poor no selection. In summery we were treated with contempt 3 star at best.Will stay elsewhere next time.
