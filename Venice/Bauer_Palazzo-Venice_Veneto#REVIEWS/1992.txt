We just returned from a stay at the hotel Bauer. It was costly but then, that is Venice! If you can swing it the junior suite it is fantastic. Our room was just above where tourists pick up a gondola and if you open up the window you are serenaded all night by the singing gondolier. The concierge was so helpful and one of the nights we were there they has a three piece jazz band playing in the lounge. The manager sent up an orchid arrangement and fluffy white robes and even a fruit tray. If your interested ask the concierge to arrange transport (free) to the Island of Murano. They will take you on a back door tour and you can see artists blow glass. The location is premium the staff was wonderful and my expreience was magic!Read more1 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 31, 2015Dear Guest,  we thank you for taking time to review our hotel on Tripadvisor with your comments, and we are delighted to read that you really enojoyed your stay in our structure.
