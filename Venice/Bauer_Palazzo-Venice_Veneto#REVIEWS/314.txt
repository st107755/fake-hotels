Ok I wouldnâ€™t say that ole blue eyes would approve of the Stevie Wonder and Sting selections, but jazz is all about interpretation and these pieces were well arranged for the keyboard, Jazz bass and drummer and quite excellent and lovely vocalist Rita Bincoletto so yes, we will call it Jazz. Great artists performing during the week, first door in left when you enter but stroll the Palazzo it is exquisite and view on the Canal beautiful. 9 euro cover plus a drink, good bar, fun crowd, great time. Sinatra musta loved it!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 21, 2017Dear Guest, we are very happy about your kindly comment on your experience in BBAR.
