A beautiful, peaceful hotel with very nice staff right on the Grand Canal.  Great breakfasts, splendid bar, and a terrace right on the canal.  A nice fitness center too!  The hotel has turn down service which was very welcome.  Room was nice, clean and quiet.  Would stay here again certainly!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
