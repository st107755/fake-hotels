Such a gorgeous hotel just steps away from St Mark's Square.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!  The room was truly beautiful.  We were in Italy for roughly 2 weeks & stayed in comparable hotels- the bed at the Bauer Palazzo was the most comfortable bed we slept in the whole time. In addition, delicious breakfast every morning & incredibly helpful concierge & staff.  Highly recommend this hotel!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 7, 2015Dear Guest,  the entire Team was so happy to have you at the Bauer Palazzo!! we are delighted that you ejnoyed in full your stay with us, Bauer Palazzo is one of the historic Hotels in Venice, the art and decors are original and protected by the city authority.
