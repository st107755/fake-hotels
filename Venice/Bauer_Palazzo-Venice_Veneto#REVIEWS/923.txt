We have stayed at a couple of other Venice hotel previous and found Bauer to be exceptional. We found the hotel was perfectly located near St Marks Square, near the brand shops on the grand canal and easy to find with may dining options surrounding. The rooms are generous and very comfortable compared to the average Venice hotel, breakfast was amazing on the grand canal and the staff couldn't do enough for us. A special mention to Carlos and Sarah at the Concierge Dept who went above and beyond. We will definitely return to this hotel! Loved every minute of our stay. Many thanks to all the staff!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 25, 2015Dear Guest, thank you for the feedback of your stay, we are delighted that your had great time with us and that you finally found the Hotel that match your needs and expectations in Venice.
