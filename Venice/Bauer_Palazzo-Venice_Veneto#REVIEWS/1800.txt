We arrived in Venice on the Orient Express and wondered how our hotel would top that.  It certainly did! Our first suite (room 115) was on the Piano Nobile and very grand, with silk walls and huge Murano chandeliers, but it looked onto a brick wall.  The next morning, as soon as I mentioned that "a view would be nice" we were shown two other suites and chose room 163.  This room was less grand but it had beautiful views of the Dogana.  The bathroom is exquisite (dark marble and Murano glass everywhere). An added delight was sitting on the canal-front verandah one afternoon when Prince Charles arrived.  He and the Duchess of Cornwall were also staying there one night.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience following your stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo.
