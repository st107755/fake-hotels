We stayed here's for 3 nights on our trip through Italy. This Art Deco styled hotel is a wonderful place to stay - cleanliness and staff attitude are simply exemplary. The outlook from the restaurant and the hotels roof top bar are just wonderful. Only a few problems - no tea making facilities in rooms, no iron in rooms - and wouldn't deliver one, simply saying to use the (expensive) laundry service and the safe in our room didn't work. I'd have no hesitation in staying here on my next trip to Venice.
