We were staying in the sister hotel on the Guidecca island.  The courtesy water boat took us between the two.  This was the first evening all out group of people were together, with people arriving at different times.  The food is actually very good value for money.  We did laugh at the end of the meal, as when we arrived, none of us wanted a started, however the waiter was very clever in getting us to have one!  Service was amazing and it was a great place for people watching.  Overall, out meal for 8 came in at around 750 euros, including drinks and deserts.  Would definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 1, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
