Stayed here for one night. Location of the hotel was perfect. Many great shops very near by and only a 2 minute walk to San Marco.  Rooms were nice and clean although a little bit dated. The only problem we had was the internet where the signal was very weak. We had to stand by the door to use the wifi as it did not really reach other areas of the room.  Staff very welcoming and attentive.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
