This hotel is EXPENSIVE, but the location is great, front desk staff and concierge were wonderful, and room was quite large. When we went to the rooftop bar for a drink one evening, however, they wouldn't let me in because of my shoes!! Mind you they were leather wedge-heeled thong sandals, not rubber flip flops. All this attitude at hundreds of euros per night, on a really hot evening.  I probably should have asked for a manager and made an issue, but we just went downstairs for a drink. Caveat emptor.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 3, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
