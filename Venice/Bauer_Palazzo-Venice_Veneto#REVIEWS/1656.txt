Stayed at the Bauer L'Hotel for 2 nights in September.  What a magnificant place. Right on the Grand Canal and next to San Marco square.  Rooms were great, staff were fantastic, breakfast awesome. This hotel deserves it's five star rating.  Concierge was more than helpful and sorted out last minute tickest to the opera and a complimentary tour through San Marco.  Scored a great deal through Otel.com.  This hotel combined with the romance of Venice made for a fantastic and memorable trip.  We will be back!Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind comments and for highlighting the positive features of the Hotel Bauer.
