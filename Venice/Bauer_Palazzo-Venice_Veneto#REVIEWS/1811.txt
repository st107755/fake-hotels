We stayed at the Bauer the last three days of our honeymoon and it was a perfect end to a fantastictrip throughout Italy. We arrived by boat - taxi and we were astounded by the lobby. It is overwhelming and luxurius. Our room was very nice and it overlooked the canal by the side of the hotel. The only problem was that it was right above the hotel entrance and it was a bit noisy as there was a gondola station. Breakfast was o.k. but the breakfast room was amazing with a view of the "canale grande". The staff was very helpfull and they offered to organize a boat trip to the murano islands for us. Overall it was an amazing honeymoon through some of Italy's most beautiful cities.Read moreDate of stay: December 2007HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 4, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your review of the Bauer Hotel.
