We recently stayed at the Bauer Hotel.  I had paid for two rooms.  Room numbers were consecutive but one was down stairs from the elevator and the other was upstairs from the elevator.  This was not very convenient!  Only thing bad about the room was the mattresses-very,very hard and the pillows were just as bad.  Very good location on the Canal.  Breakfast had a very good selection.  View from patio was amazing!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 19, 2013Dear Guest Thank you for reviewing our property.  We are pleased that you were impressed with our location, breakfast and with our views.

This said, we hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you again in the future in order to offer you an entirely satisfactory stay. Yours very sincerely, Giovanni Cellerino Resident ManagerRead more
