This delightful hotel is adjacent to the Bauer hotel. We were upgraded to a siute through our America express platinum card. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable with a view of Venice that could not be matched. We could clearly see the Grand canal, St. Mark's cathedral and Basillica. The service was spectacular with every detail taken care of. I doubt there could be e better place to stay in Venice. It is very expensive but if this is not an issue would highly recomend itRead moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for sharing your review of The Bauer Il Palazzo.
