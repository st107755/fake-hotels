Location is great, Breakfast is still good but it was better years before. Fitness and Sauna a quite small and overprized. Rooms, cleanliness and Service are like expected in a 5* Hotel. It was our 4th time in Hotel Bauer and we would like to stay there again, but we would never pay the full Price for breakfast. Make sure that it is included in your room.
