I spent a week at this hotel. I then flew from Venice to Vienna to stay @ my go to Hotel Sacher. All I could talk about when I arrived was how brilliant their current General Manager is. I had the pleasure of meeting a very active, charming and I suspect one of the best in the game. Hard game!  It was a perfect stay. I was acknowledged... looked after like a Queen. Beautiful, comfortable room. The staff you won’t fault. Position perfect.  Breakfast generous. Room service... 15 euros for delivery... no, no, no.  Having stayed in Venice many a time.
