An outstanding stay from start to finish. The location is superb, just of St Marks Square, with stunning views over the grand canal from the terraces. The staff were professional, friendly and helpful, and the check in flawless.  Our room was large and comfortable with a large well equipped bathroom and a very comfortable bed. We had breakfast on the roof top terrace, which has incredible views over the grand canal.  It is difficult to imagine a better place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 22, 2018Dear Simon T,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo and for your kind and positive feedback.
