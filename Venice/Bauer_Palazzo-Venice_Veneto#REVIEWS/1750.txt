We stayed at the Hotel Bauer on our Italy trip with Gate 1 Travel as the "A" upgrade thinking this would be a first-class hotel.  There was nothing first class about the service received or room itself.  Even though it was the off season and nobody was at the hotel, they gave us a room facing a brick wall literally just a few feet away.  Might as well have put us in a tomb.  More disturbing was the service.  As with all the hotels using Gate 1 Travel, we had paid for a buffet breakfast.  However, nobody at the Hotel Bauer seemed to know what was included even though obviously many other travelers using Gate 1 had stayed there.  In any case, when we checked in the snotty people at the front desk told us breakfast was not part of our reservation and wanted us to pay $30 Euros eachâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 9, 2015Dear guest,  Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property; We are sorry to read that we did not live up to your expectations.
