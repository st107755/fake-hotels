Stayed for a couple of nights following an Adriatic cruise. Lovely setting next to St Marks square. Nice room, although no view, with fantastic bathroom (more a ballroom!), good breakfast with attentive staff.  Great location and an easy walk to the main sites. Being December very quiet, which suited us as it was easy to get into the Basilica and plenty of restaurant offers.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 2, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
