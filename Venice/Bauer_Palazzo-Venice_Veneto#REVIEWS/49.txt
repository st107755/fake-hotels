 I booked the Bauer Palazzo because I wanted to be as close to San Marco as possible. I also wanted a nice romantic setting with fantastic views and service. This hotel exceeded my expectations and delivered on every level of what a great Hotel should be. The Room was a bit old and need to have more outlets so that one could plug in a cell phone. But otherwise that hotel was perfect. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone going to Venice!!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 3, 2019Dear Tomsalda,  We wish to thank you for choosing Bauer Palazzo and for your kind feedback regarding your stay.
