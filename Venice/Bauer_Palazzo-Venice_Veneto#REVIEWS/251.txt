We have been to Venice several time and picked the hotel as we just want to relax and soak in Venice.  The terrace on the Grand Canal with cushy couches was perfect.  The location is perfect, the service is perfect, breakfast was delicious.  And the terrace was absolute perfection for us.  Oh yeah and the room was stunning.  One night we pulled the cub chairs up to the windows and just gazed outside enjoying the view.  It was also fun to take their boat over to their other hotel, such a different feeling with the large lovely gardens.  Very relaxing.  Oh and for a little fun there is the B Bar with great jazz and then a DJ.  So much fun!  We absolutely would return.Read moreDate of stay: April 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 14, 2018Dear Golfergal,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo and for your kind feedback.
