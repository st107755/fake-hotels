This is a classic hotel.  Great breakfast out on the grand canal with a wonderful outdoor patio which turns into a nice bar in the afternoon.  The rooms are big and comfortable as are the bathrooms.  The location is perfect.  I would highly suggest taking the private water taxi from the airport directly to the hotel as they will drop you off literally at the side door.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 24, 2017DearGuest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
