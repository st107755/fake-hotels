The Bauer has merged Palazzo & the Bauer and now has a special suites program.  This change occurred after we booked & we were told nothing until we arrived.  The program clearly enhanced our experience.  We were upgraded to very quiet suite and the service was superb.  The breakfasts on the roof continue to a be feature and when the weather cooperates there is no better view for breakfast in town.  The merger of the two properties gives you the convenience of the larger front lobby and the suites program makes for a very special stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 14, 2016Dear Guest, we are honored that you rated the Bauer Palazzo the best Hotel you've ever stayed!!
