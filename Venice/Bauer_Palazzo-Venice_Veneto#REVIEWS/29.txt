The Bauer is old elegance in Venice with amazing views of the canal and great service.  We had a jr suite and it was a huge room(s) with a living room and 2 separate all marble bathrooms.  The Bauer is one of my favorite hotels in Venice and the location cannot be beaten!  Service is impeccable!  The included breakfast is tops as well and I love sitting in the bar and people watching! There are only a couple of items where the hotel could improve.  More luxe sheets and towels and definitely better amenities in the bathrooms.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 7, 2019Dear toddwK3693EG,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
