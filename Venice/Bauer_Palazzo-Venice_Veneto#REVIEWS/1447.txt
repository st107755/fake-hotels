Fabulous!  Amazing time..  We recommend this to any person who loves lavish care.  We just loved the breakfast buffet overlooking the Grand Canal and we especially loved their fantastic restaurant literally on the grand canal.  The food was superb as was the service.  We will definitely go there again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
