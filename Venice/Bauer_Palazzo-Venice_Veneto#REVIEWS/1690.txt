A tour I was on wrapped up in Venice and our last stay was at the Hotel Bauer for two nights.  It was a lovely hotel very close to St. Mark's Cathedral and Piazza and many many boutiques as well.  The service staff was excellent as well as the desk staff and our stay was most comfortable.  The breakfast is probably one of the most generous of any of our hotels along the way.  It was very good, very opulent, and very filling.  No lunch required after that breakfast!  I'd stay there again if I were in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel, your feedback is highly valued and appreciated as this is the best way for us to improve our service offering.
