The room was fantastic, and loved the incredible view. Amazing staff, esp. during the time of the aqua alta. Was a dream first birthday present for my husband (and me). Loved being in a palazzo room. Thank you for an amazing visit.Read moreDate of stay: December 201852 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 20, 2019Dear Celina,  Thank you very much for sharing feedback regarding your experience at the Bauer Palazzo.
