This is the finest hotel we visited in Italy. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The bath was decorated in marble. The tub was large (quite unusual for Italy!) and the water pressure was perfect.   The WiFi worked well. The breakfast which was included was delicious.  the service was impeccable. The concierge arranged water taxi gondola ride and dinner reservations. We were steps to San Marco Square in a perfect location We will recommend to our friend and canâ€™t wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 17, 2019Dear Linda,   We would like to thank you for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
