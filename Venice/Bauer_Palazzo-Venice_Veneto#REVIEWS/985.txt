Beautiful hotel with fantastic, attentive staff, especially the breakfast waitress and waiters who made every morning particularly pleasant. The only thing that could be suggested is that the add on charge to use the gym and sauna facilities is removed. We paid a lot of money to stay here, yet my partner had to pay 25 euros a day to use the gym and if he wanted to use the gym, sauna and steam room it was 45 euros a day.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2015Dear Guests,   we thank you for sharing your comments about your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
