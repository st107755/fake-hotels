We stayed for the weekend in January, what a great time to come bright sunny days and crisp and cold with no crowds of summer. We arrived by water taxi from the airport, the only way to do it surely,check in was seamless and the two rooms we had were both lovely we took my mother in law. The rooms both had great views and the staff at breakfast were very attentive and professional. Breakfast was lovely. Great position to explore venice. Highly recommended.
