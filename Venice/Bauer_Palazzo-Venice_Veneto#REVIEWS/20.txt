The hotel is in an excellent location, a 3 minute walk to San Marco square and close to water transport links. The room was spotless and the buffet breakfast was a high standard.

The view of the Grand Canal from the patio is amazing!Read moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Guest Relations at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 24, 2020Dear Paul_London165,  We wish to thank you for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo.
