The location of the Bauer is perfect for a trip to Venice. It has its own small square to the front of the hotel, it has tremendous views of the Grand Canal at the rear, and is only a 5 minute walk from St. Marks Square. We had a fantastic stay - the room was immaculate, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful from our check-in to when we left. The best recommendation for any hotel is "would you return?
