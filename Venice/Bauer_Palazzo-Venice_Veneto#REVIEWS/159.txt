We stayed 3 nights at the Bauer Palazzo after a cruise.  The staff was great and the location couldn't be better.  With a view of the Grand Canal and serenading gondoliers outside my windows, what more could I want for my first time in Venice?  The concierge was super helpful in arranging all our taxis and giving us ideas for day trips.  Loved it!Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 19, 2018Dear SoCalJule,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
