We had lunch on the beautiful terrace overlooking the Canale Grande. From the outside, Hotel Bauer is an ugly building - this architectural catastrophe should never have been built. However, the terrace is a small oasis of quietness in the midst of the lively streets of Venice where you can relax after sightseeing and shopping. Staff is friendly although it took them too long to appear (we sat on the bar-side, not the restaurant-side). Prices are relatively high.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 10, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
