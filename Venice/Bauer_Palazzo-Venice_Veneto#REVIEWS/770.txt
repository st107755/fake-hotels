The Bauer Hotel is in a good location near a side canal and not far from St. Mark's Square.  It is an easy walk from the San Marco Giardinetti vaporetto stop with only 1 bridge to cross.  The air conditioning was very good and the bathroom was spacious.  Our superior room did not have any view.  The windows were shuttered against a brick wall, so it felt claustrophobic not to be able to see the sky or the weather for the day. The best part was the wonderful breakfast and seating outside on a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 1, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
