The Bauer Hotel was simply wonderful! We travelled from the airport in a water taxi directly to the hotel which commands an impressive position on the Grand Canal.Location was perfect for us as being on the waterfront you are away from the crowds. 5 to 10 min walk to San Marc's Square.The staff was very helpful and our room was very large with a view of the canal.  The terrace of the hotel fronts the Grand Canal and is opposite San Salute church. This has to be the best terrace in all of VeniceRead moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
