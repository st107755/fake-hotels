The Bauer Palladio is in the same stable as the Palazzo, located directly opposite on Giudecca. A world away from San Marco in ambience, 5 minutes by regular complimentary shuttle. The gardens are beautiful, rooms luxurious, and the breakfast on the patio sumptuous. In room coffee facility the only suggestion for improvement. Hotel and shuttle staff very friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 25, 2018Dear Rob B,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palladio.
