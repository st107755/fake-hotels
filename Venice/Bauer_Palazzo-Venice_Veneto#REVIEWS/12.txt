What.a.hotel.  What.a.location. We arrived by water taxi - straight up to the hotel entrance - that was special Breakfast is literally on the Grand Canal - what an experience - a memory to last for ever. Rooms are beautiful - we did get an upgrade - probably something to do with being on honeymoon - the room overlooked one of the canals. The hotel is very well presented and would definately fall under the description of 'grand'  Location is brilliant - it's a few steps St Mark's Square and Harry's Bar etc. Would definately return to this hotelRead moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 7, 2020Dear TimC2723,  Thank you for having shared your opinion with us.
