We spent two evenings at Bauer this summer. We found excellent service at the bar, thank you Alessandro, Niky, Giorgio, for your gracious treatment. And the last evening we had dinner the staff made sure we had a super nice table for our family.  Sergio, Matia and Eric made our evening very, very nice. And the dishes that were served were absolutely excellent. An evening to remember for a very long time. It was our second visit to Bauer and we will certainly come back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2020HelpfulShare Response from Bauer Palazzo, Servizi per gli ospiti/front office at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 14, 2020Dear MaurizioBricco,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo: our entire Team is enthusiast to read that your stay in our Hotel has exceeded your expectations, as we always strive to provide the most unforgettable Venetian experience to our valued guests!
