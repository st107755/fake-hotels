I recently booked the Bauer Hotel through a third party agency but on arrival was told the booking was for their next door property the Casa Nova. I was not impressed as this was located on a quiet and deserted laneway with no staff located  in the reception of the building. As a solo female traveller I was nervous arriving in to the building.  Breakfast was served in the main hotel, and while the staff were nice, the issue with the pigeons landing on tables and helping themselves to breakfast was like a scene from Hitchcock’s The Birds. I’d suggest setting up some of the tables inside to provide an alternative.   I would say the room in the Casa Nova wasn’t anything special and I wouldn’t have rated it as five star accommodation.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 15, 2018Dear DoreenK96,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your stay in our Bauer Casa Nova, and we regret reading that in some aspects the experience did not meet your expectations.
