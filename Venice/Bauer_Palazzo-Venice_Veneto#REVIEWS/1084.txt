I stayed here before and was equally satisfied with my recent stay. Great hotel staff, room service was quick. The breakfast buffet is excellent and you can sit outside and watch the boats go by or dine inside. Good location and they have their own boat dock making water taxi service easy. Will stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 30, 2015Dear Guests,   we are glad you spent a fabulous stay with us at the Bauer Hotel.
