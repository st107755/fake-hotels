This is the kind of hotel every hotel should aspire to emulate. My family had stayed there 15 years ago, and just returned from our second trip.  It's older, classic, and the rooms aren't shiny and new, but we love the old world style style, and the service is peerless. The concierges are awe inspiring,  with recommendations, restaurant reservations, and coordinating anything you can think of. We left the hotel at 5:15 AM this morning, and our water taxi  was ready and waiting to take us to the airport, with the staff standing nearby, coordinating it all. It's not cheap, and it's not brand-new and shiny, but it's as great an old world five star hotel as you could ask for in this day and age.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 20, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
