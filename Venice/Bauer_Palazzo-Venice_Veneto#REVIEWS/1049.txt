Had a little rough start at the beginning, as our room was not ready, they usually are not until 3 pm, so we left and came back with no problem. When we arrived back, our luggage was in our room which was great. Yes, our room was a little dated, but we were not in our room much, so it was fine. Service was outstanding. We had lunch on the canal also, very nice. Staff was outstanding. Bellman, older man, short, receding hairline, Fantastic! Wish I got his name. He made sure we were ok all of the time. Front desk manager I believe Juliano may have been his name was great. We would have no problem whatsoever staying here again. Private water taxi was great, thumbs up for the Bauer. One regret, which they had an accessible suite! Food for thought. Bravo to staff again........
