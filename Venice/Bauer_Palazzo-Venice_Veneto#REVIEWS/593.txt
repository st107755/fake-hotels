This classic hotel remains one of the top choices in Venice, and the reviews on here is one of the reason we chose it.   Very spacious and well appointed rooms. Sound proof walls give you peace from other travelers.   The all marble bathrooms are large with marble tub, and a marble shower. It's everywhere.   The desk staff is stellar. If you have a problem with anything regarding your stay they will be like a honey badger until your result is achieved.   We had missing train tickets, and they stayed on the agent until they showed up.   Impeccable food and wait staff. Centrally located right on the lagoon. Simply beautiful. You arrive right to the door via water taxi.
