This hotel is truly luxurious from the entrance to the marble in the bathrooms absolutely stunning. Staff was friendly and the rooms were a generous size. There is a nightclub on the first floor which we did not get a chance to visit but the music spilling into the lobby at night was wonderful! We would sit at the rooftop bar at night which also had softer non-clubish music with a one of a kind view. The rooftop brunch was also spectacular but be sure not to leave your plate unattended the birds are feisty! The concierge also recommended some amazing local restaurants I would absolutely stay here again honestly heaven on earth.
