I stayed here for a weekend and must say I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. The hotel is situated in the perfect location, 5 minutes walk away from Piazza San Marco, it boasts stunning rooftop views with rooms which are ornate and extremely elegant. Breakfast is served on the terrace at the waters edge looking out onto Santa Maria Della, with a very large selection of different and very tasty foods to choose from. The staff were very friendly here and also very helpful. I would definitely return and enjoy more amazing memories of Venice by accompanying my visit with a return to stay at The Bauer Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel, we are delighted to learn that you had the most amazing time at our hotel as this is exactly the type of experience we endeavour to achieve for each and every guest.
