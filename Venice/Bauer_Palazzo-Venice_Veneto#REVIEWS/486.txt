WOW...historic beauty full of old world charm and grace. Elegant pleasure that can only bring you back. We travelled as a family...luxuriously appointed suite good enough for royal occupancy.

Having this experience complimented by the Bauer is like the bubbles in a lovely French champagne...tingling to say the least.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 16, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
