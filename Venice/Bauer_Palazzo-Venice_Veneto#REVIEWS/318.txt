We recently stayed for  a long weekend at this beautiful hotel. The hotel location is excellent being right on the Grand canal and 2 minutes walk from St Marks square, there is also a Gondola stop right beside the front door. Breakfast choices are varied and plentiful and the staff are friendly and accommodating. The only 2 cons We found were that 1 the beds were very, very firm ( to the point myself and my husband had severe back ache) and 2 the prices were extortionate! ( 16 euros for 2 lemonades) well I guess it is Venice and a 5 star hotel, but still a little overly priced. Saying that we would def stay again when visiting for breakfast and location alone.
