We arrived before check-in: no problem to leave bags (full hotel the night before, so no early check-in), and water, OJ or prosecco offered to us (and are available to guests for free during the day - though I could only see water by early evening).

Regarding the room, you were staying in a double deluxe with view on the 7th floor which, although a bit smaller than other rooms in the same category on other floor, boasts a magnificent terrace with sun loungers overlooking Santa Maria della Salute. As you mention, breakfast at IL PALAZZO is served on a beautiful panoramic terrace, while at the BAUER on an equally beautiful terrace flanking the Grand Canal.  This said, both properties are truly magnificent and unique and I hope you will have the opportunity of experiencing BAUER L’HOTEL on occasion of a next visit to Venice. Should this be the case, please do not hesitate to contact me directly. Yours sincerely,  Pietro Rusconi Resident ManagerRead more
