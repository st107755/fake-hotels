Stayed here for a couple of days before joining a cruise and it was really top quality.  The location is ideal, being only a short walk away from St Marks Square. The building is old but very well modernised and the staff were extremely helpful.  The restaurant was right on the canal and excellent.  The room was very well appointed and  comfortable.  Our room was a standard one, without a view, so I imagine the more luxurious rooms are amazing.  You can also take advantage of the sister hotel which is a short boat ride away on the other side of the Grand Canal, using the hotel's own shuttle service.  At the sister hotel there is an outdoor swimming pool and you seem a world away from the crowds of Venice itself.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 11, 2016Dear Neil, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
