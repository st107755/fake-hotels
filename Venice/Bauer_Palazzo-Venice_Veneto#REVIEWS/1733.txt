I only stayed here because the 6 star hotel I tried to get a 2nd night in was full for Venice FIlm Festival! Another guest had written don't stay here try Palazzo it's nicer and you'll be treated like someone special even if you aren't! They were so right! From the moment we got out of the water taxi we were treated superbly by the wonderfully trained staff, our room was the best ever in any hotel, bathroom and toiletries probably best ever; the surroundings were gorgeous -magnificent chandaliers, beautiful antiques. Being able to have a drink on the main canal and breakfast overlooking all the scenic highlights -what more could you want. Highly recommended. Forgot to mention fantastic location - handy to all the must see's and do's.Read moreDate of stay: September 20101 SaveHelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Il Palazzo, and we are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay here and that we having been able to meet your expectations, in particular for what concernig our luxury rooms and service you received.
