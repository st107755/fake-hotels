We stayed here for 1 week and were truly amazed at this beautiful hotel. From the moment the water taxi docks in front of the hotel, the warm friendly staff of the Bauers is there for every need. We had two joining rooms overlooking the smaller canal. We could watch Gondoliers sign and paddle just below us. The breakfast was fabulous day after day with things like bacon, eggs, sausage and toast for us westerners... And also a great cheese selection, fine meats, fruits, cereals and enough pastries and croissants to feed a small army. The coffee and espresso was always made prompt and fresh just to your liking. The views from the deck were unbelievable. Get out the before sunrise for the best pics. As far as location- it can't be beat. Only a few minutes from anything in Veniceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 25, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your excellent feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
