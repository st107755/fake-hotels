Lovely hotel, spacious, comfortable and elegant. Right on the Grande Canal with open breakfast terrace up to the water's edge, worth every penny for that alone. Staff were great. I would go back. Good location. Be sure to arrive in style by water taxi, you will not forget it.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 8, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
