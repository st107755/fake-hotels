I stayed here on 20-22nd March 2016 for my husband's birthday. Our room was in Casa Nova and was lovely, typically Venetian. The location was perfect, a stones throw from St Mark's Square. The hotel put a bottle of prosecco in our room on my husband's birthday, such a nice touch. Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend!
