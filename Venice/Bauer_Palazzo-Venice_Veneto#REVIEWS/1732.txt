We stayed a couple of nights at the Bauer - it's definitely time for a re-fresh of the rooms, lobby and exterior.  First impressions being what they are, the carpet on the floor of the revolving door is worn, noticed a torn and flapping awning when next door at the Feragamo store and the room was clean but dated - water leaked from the shower.  Excellent concierge with Marco, great restaurant recommendations and very helpful with guidance.  Very clean rooms and great water pressure! Excellent location for everything Venice has to offer.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 10, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel, and we are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay here and that we having been able to meet your expectations.
