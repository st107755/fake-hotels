We have been 2 times in this Palazzo for the Carnival. We had a room with view on the canal which is magic. The room is spacious decorate with fine fabric in a perfect Venetian opulent style (exactly what we are looking for in Venice). The service is a service of a Luxury Italian Palace, the best you can find. The restaurant is very good. You have to go thought the other hotel (not as nice) corridor to get to the room, not the greatest experience however the rest is such a great experience that you should closed your eyes on that.
