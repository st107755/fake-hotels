We we lucky enough to come back to the Bauer. They now have great jazz performances on Friday and Saturday nights. Roberto Manca is an excellent concierge who advised us on restaurants, booked reservations and arranged for a water taxi to the train station. Very attentive and friendly. The breakfast here is wonderful and the decor is not to be missed. Great outdoor patio for drinks, lunch, etc. Incredible view of the grand canal. Gondolas are right out the front door. The boats with singing gondoliers travel down along the side of the outdoor patio to the grand canal. Special and fun.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 6, 2018Dear Jack B,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
