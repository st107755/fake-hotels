When in Venice even if you are not staying at this lovely Hotel you simply must have a delicious meal in the restaurant, sitting on the veranda in the shade overlooking the magnificent Grand Canal!!! Our food and the service were outstanding as always!!! Freshly made pasta was superb, the organic pizza delicious, the tiny delicate cookies with the espresso simply mouthwatering!!! And the pigeon fighting device most helpful. When in Venice please make time to enjoy and treat yourself to a few hours in Bauer Palazzo Heaven!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 30, 2019Dear Petra263PA  Thank you for taking the time to provide your wonderful feedback.
