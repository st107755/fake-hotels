This is one very expensive hotel, the most expensive one of a group in Venice. We paid to stay in this hotel to have a view of Santa Maria della Salute and to paint it. We could have done what we did last year and sat on the terrace of the adjoining restaurant and had a coffee and painted. The price we paid gave us a very large room with a terrace from where you could see a side canal and some top of the range shops five floors below. If you want to have a view of the Grand Canal in this hotel, either be prepared to pay a lot, lot more or have a long breakfast in the superbly placed dining room or have a coffee on either  of the two terraces. We would not pay for any other meals and breakfast was included in the price.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 5, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
