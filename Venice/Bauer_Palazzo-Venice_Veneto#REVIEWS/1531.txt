Hotel looking good, but costumer services are TERRIBLE!! You also pay for wireless internet and pray to works because 90% of the hotel doesn't . I tried to make a collect call after 11PM, and was not operator in the hotel!! And nobody knew how to do it!! Have to change the room because the gave us one just bellow the bells of the church!  Front desk and bellmen are rude! We will not come back at all!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, General Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2012Please accept our apologies for the unkind behavior of some of our team members at the reception desk and bell staff.
