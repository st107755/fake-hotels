My family and I visited from Miami.  Multiple friends recommended we stay at this property.  It is not a modern hotel (I'm not sure a modern hotel exists in Venice).  But the rooms were super quiet and comfortable. The concierge and front desk were all super helpful.  I'd definitely stay at the property again and have no qualms recommending it.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 30, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
