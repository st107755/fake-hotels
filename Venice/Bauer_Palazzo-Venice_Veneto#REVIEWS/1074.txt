This hotel is great!  It is attached to the Hotel Bauer Palazzo and hence is located right on the Grand Canal, just down a short bit from the Piazza San Marco!  Their breakfast buffet, which was included in our stay was plentiful and the food was excellent.  And to top it all off, the breakfast included Champagne or mamosas right at the buffet table.  We got a table literally only a few feet from the Canal!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 6, 2015Dear Guests,  we are delighted to hear that you have enjoyed your stay with us at The Hotel Bauer.
