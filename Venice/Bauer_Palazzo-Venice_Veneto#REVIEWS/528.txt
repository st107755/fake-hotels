Our family stayed at this hotel for a night. The Location is very good, very close to San Marco and brandname streets (for those who love them). The decoration is stylish but the room is quite old. Breakfast is average and there is Wifi available. The worst thing for this hotel was that there were someone knocking your door randomly which hotel staff told us that they have checked every room regularly which I think it 's not suitable to check the room which guest not check-out yet. One of my family member lost her big amount of money after she went down for breakfast and the hotel could not do anything with this.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
