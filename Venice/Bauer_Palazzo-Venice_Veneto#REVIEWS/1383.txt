Superb location for walking about high points of Venice or catching gondola (right out front door) or water taxi/bus to go elsewhere.  Staff very attentive and helpful. Lobby beautiful. Breakfast buffet average for hotel at this level. Our room (#343), however, was small and needed some attention. Bed sagged big time (worst bed I slept in during my RTW trip) and bathroom was a tight fit.  Towels thread bare. All in all, a bit of a disconnect in what they aspire to be and what they actually achieve.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest We would like to thank you for taking the time to review the standards of service and hotel facilities after your recent visit at BAUER Lâ€™HOTEL.
