This is a world class hotel in the perfect location. Breakfast on the outdoor terrace is a wonderful relaxing experience. The hotel is well run - staff are attentive and efficient. Thats all one can ask for. If you wish to reduce the cost of your stay - then have a room in the Casa Nova annexe, just around the corner. The rooms are large, classy bathrooms, very nicely furnished, and you still have access to all the main hotel facilities.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
