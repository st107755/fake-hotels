We (me and my girlfriend) stayed at the Bauer from Dec/31 to Jan/4. The hotel was impressive and in the hear of San Marco. Here is my review:  Check in: Excellent - Fast and with a really nice staff. The hotel employee explained to us the hotel facilities and services.  Room: Really nice room and relatively big (especially for venice standards). The cleaning services were awesome and we could count with an in0bed breakfast without extra-charge. The bathroom was really clean and new, but it could be bigger. Since I'm really tall (+190 cm), the shower and the tub were not adequate to me.  Hotel: The hotel in beautiful and fulfilled with art objects. The bar was probably the best in the hotel - really close to the grand canal, with and incredible view and an amaizing wine menu. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 4, 2020Dear R4717MXpedrop,  We would like to thank you for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
