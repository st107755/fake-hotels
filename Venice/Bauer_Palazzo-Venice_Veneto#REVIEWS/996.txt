They are two different proprieties. Upon your arrival you decided not to stay at Casa Nova and we proposed a room at the Bauer Hotel.   I invite you to pay more attention when you make a reservation, if you had a doubt you could contact us and we were going to explain you the differences between the Bauer proprieties.   Casa Nova is a townhouse and the checkin and check out process, breakfast and all the other services are arranged at the Bauer Hotel.   If you would like to further discuss your concerns, please feel free to contact me at adimaso@bauervenezia.com.   Yours faithfully Andrea Di Maso - Resident ManagerRead more
