The overall experience of the hotel is quite good. But soon you feel it a bit being out of time. The equipment of the room leaves a lot to be desired, especially at this price class.  Not enough power sockets, no conditioner, no replacement of used toiletries and no coffee making equipment clearly leave this place behind many middle class hotel chains. A spa at the other side of the canal, although a shuttle service is provided, underlines the fact that this hotel is not for the modern Traveller. The internet connection needs to be reset every time you have left the hotel. Breakfast is nice though Italian style. A drink on the terrace bar is great, but watch out for the pigeons.
