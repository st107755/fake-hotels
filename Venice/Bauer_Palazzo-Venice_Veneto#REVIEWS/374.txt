Totally worth the price. Everything's excellent. Breakfast next to Grand Canal is the best thing. We stayed at the Bauer Casanova, which are one of the Bauer's accomodations nearby. Breakfast is on the terrace of the Bauer Central, many options and excellent service from waiters. Food is fresh, tasty, but having dinner at the Bauer is not affordable to everyone. Attention at reception is excellent, very respectful and willing to help and give advice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
