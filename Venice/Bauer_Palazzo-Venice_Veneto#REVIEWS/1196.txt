The stay at this lovely hotel was an early birthday gift. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. The hotel is right on the Grand Canal and the views from the terrace where we had breakfast were absolutely stunning.  The staff was cordial and helpful.  The hotel is perfectly located for walks to Piazza San Marco and the trendy upscale stores right outside the 'back door'.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 23, 2014Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a positive review of your stay.
