Our entry level room category is actually the Superior Room. Most of these rooms enjoy the silence provided by an inner court and are individually decorated and furnished with a mix of art deco and Venetian design. Italian marble bathrooms with bathtubs and handle showers, heated towel-rails. We understand that the room did not met your preferences, and as our staff is always trying to find the perfect room for your venetian stay, we wish you would have contacted us during your permanence to address your concernes and to allow us to find a different accomodation.  Regarding the charges at the moment of check out, the information bill that has been presented probably refers to the locat city tax, that is not included in the room rate, and not to a mini bar consumption.  We sincerely hope that this experience will not permanently affect your faith in our Hotel, which we will be delighted to restore, and that we will have an opportunity to welcoming you back in the future. Should you need further clarification on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at our direct e-mail address: guestrelation@bauervenezia.it  Kind Regards,  Martina Carlon Guest RelationRead more
