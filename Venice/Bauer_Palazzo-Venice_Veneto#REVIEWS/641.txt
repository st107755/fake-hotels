Every day my Team and myself work with passion and energy to welcome Guests in the best way possible, as if they were at home.  Therefore, when things go wrong we are even more upset than the Guest and eager to make up for the inconvenience caused. I can guarantee You  that we offer You, with the best intention, a free upgrading in a deluxe Suite.

I hope to give personally the welcome in Bauer Palazzo in the future. .  Yours sincerely    Stefano Noviello Resident Manager Read more
