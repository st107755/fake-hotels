A typical hotel in Venice. Size and room layout,  bathroom average European standard, so don't expect too much in that department.  Location is probably the best in Venice, with breakfast served from deck on the canal. Wonderfully view. Spend at least an hour enjoying that. Good breakfast,  with nice variety. Central to all shopping areas, from hotel you have direct access to everything you need, gondolas, water taxi's.   Opera houses, St Marco square all within meters from your hotel.  Great hotel.
