We stayed for 2 nights in April in a Deluxe room. The hotel is in a fabulous location - easy to walk to all major sites and right on the Grand Canal. The room we had was lovely (large/clean/comfortable) - with a small balcony overlooking the little square (Campo San Moise) and the side canal. The staff and concierge were great - assisting us with all of our requirements. Definitely recommend for a Venice stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 8, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
