There are more expensive hotels in Venice, but they are not the "Bauer".  Everything about this Hotel lets you know you are in one of the finest anywhere.  The location is superb both on the Grand Canal and close to St. Mark's Square.  Breakfasts are excellent.  Wish they could do something with the pigeons on the terrace.  True menaces to peaceful enjoyment of the excellent Terrace.  Our rooms were beautiful and well appointed.  Only objection was that every outlet was taken by lamps.  Surely we are not the only guests who like to charge their phones in the bedroom.  Grandson set up charging station near the floor in living room, LOL.  The water entrance is always a joy to use and the Concierge service is excellent.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 17, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
