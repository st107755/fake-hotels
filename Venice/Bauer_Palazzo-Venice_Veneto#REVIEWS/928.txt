Staying at the Bauers IL Palazzo Hotel in Venezia, Italy is truly a legendary and inspiring experience. It is distinctively heritage and Venetian crafted in architecture. The room decor is contemporary and the furnishing well maintained and clean. Lighting is warm and simply pleasant with the feel of romance in the air. It has its private dock for the water taxi to stop right in front of the hotel lobby.   A very comfortable stay with a homely experience. One can opt for an interior intimate or terrace rooftop seating restaurant that provides excellent cuisines great views of Venice and the skyline. Centrally located in the most extensive shopping district of St. Mark Square. Staying in the hotel, you get the priviledge of a complimentary water taxi to nearby Islands of Muranoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 25, 2015Dear Guest, needless to say how delighted we are to receive such an extensive and detailed positive feedback about your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
