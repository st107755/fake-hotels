This is a beautiful hotel, well appointed and luxuriously comfortable.  The concierge reception staff are very attentive and went out of their way to help.  The service staff in the Terrace restaurant deserve special praise as they ensured that the day started well, nothing was too much trouble (they were the highlight of our stay). The only problem was with the maid who serviced the room as she was hostile when asked for simple things like providing extra blankets and making sure the bath plug was in place.  All other staff were unobtrusive and carried out their functions well.  For sheer luxury, this is the hotel for you as the stay is an experience not to be forgotten.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
