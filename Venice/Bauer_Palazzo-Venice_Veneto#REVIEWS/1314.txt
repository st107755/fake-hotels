First of all i think you can't find a better location in Venice, Near san marco square, and fancy shopping street. The hotel have a very special history which can add a good experience for you , Room size is really nice, they made an upgrade for me since i had a special occasion. you can take a water taxi right from one of the hotel gates. Breakfast view is a different story which you can not miss. Staff are friendly.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 4, 2014Thank you for your feedback on our hotel.
