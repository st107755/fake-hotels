Great position by St Marks Square.  Friendly, relaxed staff who were extremely helpful.  Our very comfortable room was fantastic with an enormous roof terrace with views across the rooftops to the snow covered Dolomites in the far distance.  Breakfast was the best I have ever had in Venice with a huge buffet with just about everything you could want.  The restaurant overlooking the Grand Canal was very nice and we were sad not to have been there in better weather and to have dined on the beautiful terrace!  Highly recommend.  Not at all 'stuffy' for a five star hotel!Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Feb 14, 2013Dear Guest,  We thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel.
