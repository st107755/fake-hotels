We didn't stay at the hotel so can't give an overall score. We did however have lunch in the restaurant overlooking the grand canal.The tables were beautifully set and the waiters attentive and so we were looking forward to lunch and quite happy to pay the high prices. Having ordered a decent bottle of wine costing 42 euros we decided to have a main course of "entrec√¥te manzo" and fegato and foie gras". The portions were meagre with not a vegetable in sight!  In our opinion a rip-off for a total cost of 116 euros for one course (incl. wine) for  2 people. We definitely would not recommend this restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 8, 2019Dear 1MikeeD,  We wish to thank you for reaching out to us to provide your feedback regarding your experience at our Ristorante De Pisis.
