Hey, it's 5 star with a huge history, and within yards of St Mark's Square. Choose your room to suit you, but hotel has been careful to keep up to date and have renovations when and where needed. We had a deluxe room (no view) which was perfectly adequate and very lovely, as is bathroom. All amenities and A/C. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the canal is an absolute delight, and a life box ticker. From 6pm, take a drink on the rooftop bar (highest in Venice) and see the amazing views, although do bear in mind this luxury does come with a price - in our case the 2 most expensive drinks we have ever had! Was it worth it? Probably.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 11, 2018Dear IvanNewZeland,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your experience at the Bauer Palazzo, and for your kind, extensive feedback.
