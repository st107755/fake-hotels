I stayed in Bauer Il Palazzo for the second time and it was a wonderful holiday. I received a room with a fascinating panoramic view over Venice. The service is excellent! Breakfast is great (good products, very nice service) and located on the 7th floor (roof terrace) with an amazing view over Canal Grande. Bauer Il Palazzo is a fascinating hotel where you can feel history, without being outdated. Thank you for the wonderful stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving such a beautiful review of your stay.
