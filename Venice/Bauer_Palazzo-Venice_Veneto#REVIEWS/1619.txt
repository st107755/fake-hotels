Loved this hotel. Would anytime come back here. I was here on my honeymoon and they upgraded me to a suite with a porch/deck overlooking the water with stunning views. It's a 5 star hotel with great service, fresh smelling and in a great location.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 22, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
