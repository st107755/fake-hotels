The Bauer Il Pallazo and the Bauer il Palladio between them provide one of the best wedding vienues that one can imagine. The staff led by Altin Melica are probably the best that one can encounter. Mauro in Il Palazzo and Louis in Il Palladio are so attentive to their customers that the customers can leave all to them. We had our wedding in Il Palladio and reception in Il Palazzo. We and our guests were amazed at at the stage set result. You may have seen us there on 25 June. I know many did.
