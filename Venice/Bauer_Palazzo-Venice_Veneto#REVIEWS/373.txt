Bauer Hotel is a perfect balance between old grandness and modern service and amenities. Extremely helpful staff everywhere in the hotel to compliment the luxurious decor. Ideally positioned in Venice with everything within easy walking distance including St Marks Square. The Hotel is on the Grand Canal and the views from the breakfast terrace on the sixth floor are not to be missed.
