This was our second stay at the Bauer Palazzo in Venice and it continues to live up to every expectation. Our tip to Venice this year was in late May and weather was outstanding so we were able to enjoy the delights of the rooftop bar in the evenings as well as the elegance and style of the waterside terraces where you can enjoy breakfast in the morning or just drinks during the day away from the bustle of the city. Yes - the hotel is expensive - but so is everything else in Venice.  But its worth it in our opinion. You cant expect views like these on the cheap. A special treat in every sense of the word.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
