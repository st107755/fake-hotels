This is our third time to Venice, and the third time staying at the Bauer. We already knew what Bauer has to offer, beautiful location, 2 mins. by walk from San Marco, by the Grand Canal, excellent breakfast and great amenities. But this year they raised the bar by reserving our usual room in advance and really taking care of us. This is a beautiful luxury hotel but their excellent customer care made it even more special this year. A truly first class service.Read moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 8, 2019Dear Gergely F,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay in our property and for your wonderful feedback.
