Absolutely stunning. The Deluxe Palazzo Double room facing Grand Canal is spectacular, the views are like nothing we had ever seen! Service is top notch and the location is unbeatable. Loved the breakfast on the top floor. If you want a picture perfect memory of Venice, this is the place to stay. Experience of a lifetime worth splurging on. The old part of the hotel where we stayed has a separate reception that you enter from the Grand Canal, rather than the side canal that gets you to the big reception for the large art deco part of the hotel, just in case you take the water taxi.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
