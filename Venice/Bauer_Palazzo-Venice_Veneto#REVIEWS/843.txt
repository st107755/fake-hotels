Having brought my husband here for his birthday, the staff are lovely and incredibly helpful.... nothing is too much trouble. Our room beautiful and light.  My only complaint is the bed... two singles pushed together under a double headboard and made up as single beds ... I did not want to change rooms, but this drives me mad in hotels...it is honestly like you're sleeping in single beds, not what you want for a romantic birthday treat !...please make double beds double !!!! Other than that... would recommend.... breakfast is good too !!!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 19, 2016Dear Guest, thank you to have shared your experience had at the Bauer Palazzo, we are really delighted that you choose our Hotel to celebrate your housband's birthday.
