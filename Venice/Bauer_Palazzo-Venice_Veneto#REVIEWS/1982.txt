We splurged (for us) for our one night in Venice (Oct 2003) and booked the Hotel Bauer.  It was worth it, and we wished we had more time there. The location can't be beat, the staff was very gracious and formal, and the room was very comfortable.  The decor is Modern European with fabric covered walls, marble bath, and electric window shades.  The breakfast was almost like a Sunday champagne brunch in the US, except in a beautiful salon overlooking the Grand Canal!  One highlight was an evening "serenade" in the street below by a classical guitarist playing for pedestrians.  A moment we won't ever forget.
