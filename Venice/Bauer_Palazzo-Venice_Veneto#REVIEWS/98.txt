We just came back from a 4 nights stay at the Bauer Palazzo, traveling as a family of 4 (us and our two daughters of 7 and 5 years old). We stayed in 2 connecting rooms facing the Grand Canal in the historical part of the hotel. We had a wonderful stay and the service was exceptional. Concierge team, restaurant, breakfast team on the 7th floor under the lead of the fantastic Lucia: the details and kindness of the staff really made the difference. Worth the price in our views, even though it obviously represents a big spend. We would definitely go back at the Bauer.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 1, 2019Dear Dimitri,  Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
