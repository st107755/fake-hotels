Beautiful historic luxury hotel right on the Grand Canal with stunning views to the Salute church opposite. A stones throw from St. Mark's Square so location wise it's pretty perfect. Lovely terrace by the canal for drinks or dinner. It also has a nice roof terrace for even better views.   Excellent service though not as friendly as you'd experience in the top hotels of Asia. Wifi was free but the room had no free water or coffee making facilities. A little poor for a 5 star hotel these days. Perhaps this is standard in Venice but why not go beyond standard? 8 euro for a small bottle of water from the mini bar was a bit steep.   Overall it's a fabulous place to stay and I'd certainly return here on a future trip.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 6, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
