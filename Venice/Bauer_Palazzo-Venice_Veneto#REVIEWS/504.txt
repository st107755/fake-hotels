Bauer Palazzo is a unique and classic slice of Venice. From the architecture to the opulent rooms, reception, dining room and gardens overlooking the Grand Canal, this is a must visit if you can. The location is also spot on. Probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Would recommend to all.
