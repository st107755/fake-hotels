Great location hotel, nice concierge, little confuse check in. I made a reservation for a suit with water view, what a surprise to get there and they gave me a room with roofs view, I immediately complain about and ask for the manager to solve the problem, he never show up, just call me and I need to go dow on the lobby to talk with him and show that on my reservation was very specific about the room. After that he move me to a real suit with view and much bigger (not good welcome, right).Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your feedback.
