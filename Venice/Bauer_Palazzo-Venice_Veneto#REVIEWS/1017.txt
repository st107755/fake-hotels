We stayed at the Hotel for 3 night and went to Venice especially to see the Biennale. The Concierge Marco made us get into the Biennale and made the holiday for us amazing. Venice is a wonderful town to visit and sleeping at the Baur in the lovely decorated rooms is very nice but the rooms in the venetian building are a bit noisy. The Room Service was good but a bit to slow.  But we will come back. ;)Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 5, 2015Dear Guest,   we thank you for taking the time to express your useful comments which help us to improve our standards and better satisfy our guests.
