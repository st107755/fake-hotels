It was our next stop from our honeymoon.  We really didn't expect the magic of this old traditional hotel. Everything is very old, like a movie, it was amazing, I don't usually like old things, but this hotel was incredible, the staff and everything was WOW. Venice is a small town we stayed at the Hotel more than we went out, because it really worth it!  When we arrived they upgraded our room to the Junior suite (See pics) with a small balcony with a great canal view. The restaurant of the Hotel is a must to try for a romantic dinner. Staff were very helpful and professional. Everything was Perfect and valuable. Venice is an old town, so the hotel is. The breakfast on the roof was our BEST. We really recommend it, it's an old famous amazing Hotel right next to San Marco,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 20, 2015Dear Guests,   we are extremely honored you have chosen The Bauer Il Palazzo for your honeymoon, the best choice to enjoy the beauty of the city of LOVE.
