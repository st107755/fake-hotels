I was a little concerned before I travelled as I had read several negative reviews, but our experience was great. We took a private taxi transfer from the airport straight to the hotels private dock. We couldn't have been better greeted, all staff were very polite and we had been upgraded to a suite which was wonderful.  The hotel is definately 5star, it's a modern quite contemporary hotel. The negative is it is very expensive, we had a meal for 2, and it cost 250 Euros. The location is great too.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Bauer Hotel, and we are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay here and that we having been able to meet your expectations.
