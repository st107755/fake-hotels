We went to Italy on our honeymoon and we were so disappointed thank God we had only booked one night in this hotel.  the first from all when we arrived to the hotel they couldn't find our reservation!!! We showed them all confirmation where it is confirmed that the room is booked and paid but they wanted to leave the problem to us they told us that we should call Agentur where weâ€˜ve booked the room and resolve it ourselves. We never expect like this in a 5 star hotel plus  the room door was stuck and we couldn't open it, the room was very small, breakfast very poor, staff reluctant. only one plus the entrance hall with fresh flowers.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 1, 2019Dear Lucinakaott,  Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.  We regret learning that your stay did not live up to the expectations, but unfortunately a miscommunication from your provider may have occurred causing delays and making the check-in process not as smooth as per our standards.
