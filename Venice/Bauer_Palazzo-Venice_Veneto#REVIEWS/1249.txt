We stayed at the Bauer for 2 nights following a Med. cruise.   Arriving from the ship by water taxi was a real novelty, and the luggage followed from the ship soon afterwards.   The room was well appointed, spacious and quiet.  Breakfast is a real treat here, as other reviewers have mentioned, as you can watch the busyness of the river whilst enjoying a leisurely meal.   St Mark's Square is only minutes away as well as an abundance of restaurants.  Also the vaporetti station is just 2 minutes away.   So a great location to base yourself and to see Venice from.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Aug 10, 2014Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to share your comments on your stay at the Bauer Hotel.
