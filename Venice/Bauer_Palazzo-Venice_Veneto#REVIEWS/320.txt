The Bauer Palazzo Hotel made our trip to Venice. After arriving from an overnight flight, the staff was completely accommodating. They took care of everything and made us immediately comfortable. Every time we walked into the hotel, my friend and I were treated by name. No matter what a staff member was doing, they dropped it to see if there was anything we needed. The food was great, the room was beautiful, and the location was perfect. We highly recommend the Bauer.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 20, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
