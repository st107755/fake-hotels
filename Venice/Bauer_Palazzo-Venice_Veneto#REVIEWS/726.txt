This is a lovely hotel...expensive, but then again so are all the better appointed hotels in Venice.  Our room was large and comfortable. No view, but we didn't spend much time in the room and I prefer having the large modern bathroom. I'm sure a view would have cost hundreds more. The only issue we had was with the aggressive pigeons that harassed guests trying to have breakfast on the beautiful canal side patio. The staff provided us with sticks to wave off the pigeons but that did not deter them and they were constantly landing on uncleaned tables to help themselves to scraps. More efficient table clearing and a few cats would have helped.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 28, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
