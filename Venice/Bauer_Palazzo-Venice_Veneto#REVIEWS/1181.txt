Great location!  Advertised and rated 5 star.  NO WAY.  Our room in the Casa Nova had a plumbing leak in the ceiling.  Mildew stains showing. They knew it was a problem.   On check out I informed the desk staff.  In summary pretty much overpriced and overrated.  The breakfast was the best thing the hotel had to offer.  Concierge was very helpful.  This hotel was one of many rip offs in Venice.  Clooney can have it!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 11, 2014Dear guest, Greetings from Venice.
