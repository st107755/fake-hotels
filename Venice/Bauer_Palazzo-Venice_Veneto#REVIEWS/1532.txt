August in Venice is not what I would usually choose as a favorite time to visit. With a multi-family group and school age children, there was no choice. Muggy, very hot and full of people, Venice is still beautiful. Bauer has fantastic air-conditioned interior spaces and the Bauer Concierge, Carlo Salini, was kind, helpful, and exceptional at reading our needs. Our rooms were great, the breakfast on the Grand Canal was a high point and Carlo found us perfect restaurants at short notice-and our reception at the restaurants once we arrived was impeccable. I have stayed in Venice many times and eaten at the restaurants he recommended on other occasions, but with his referral, the restaurants we visited improved remarkably. Many, many thanks to staff at Bauer.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 30, 2012Thank you !Read more
