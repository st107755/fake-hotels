This hotel is really fantastic, the rooms are sumptuous without being stuffy. Stunning location just of the Grand Canal. We had breakfast on the terrace every morning just amazing. Will be back to Venice again but will try somewhere else but if  its a first time visit I would recommend this Hotel very highly.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Many thanks for your kind comments and for highlighting the positive features of The Bauer Il Palazzo.
