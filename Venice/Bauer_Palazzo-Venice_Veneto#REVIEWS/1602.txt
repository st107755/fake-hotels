Be careful when booking a room at this hotel.  The "Bauer" is in reality 3 different facilities. One is the "BAUER Il Palazzo", the second is the "Bauer Hotel" and the third is the "Bauer Casanova"  The Bauer Casanova is in a separate building, with only views of brick walls a few feet away, and interiors of the rooms are dark.  Thus, no view.  Also no security other than a card key to get in the door, and once inside the lobby there is no attendant.   It is a around the corner from the main hotel entrance, in a dim alley.  When you book a room they don't really differentiate which facility you are booking into.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 23, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
