The Bauer was fabulous. Room large, ultra clean, very comfortable and beautifully decorated. Bathroom also lovely with separate shower and jacuzzi bath. Buffet breakfast excellent, tables on roof terrace with great views overlooking canal (however don't leave your food unguarded if you go in for something extra or the seagulls or pigeons will have it!). Waiting staff very attentive and friendly. Hotel in perfect central location and very close to San Marco water-bus stop and San Marco itself. Photos are view of hotel from canal and view of canal from breakfast terrace.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 6, 2015Dear Guests,   we are so glad you spent a FANTASTIC stay with us and we wish to have you with us soon.
