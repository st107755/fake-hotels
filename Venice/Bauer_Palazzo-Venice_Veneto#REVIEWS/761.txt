My wife and I stayed here for three nights at the end of May. We loved it! The staff were very helpful and friendly and it's location is incredible. The bed was amazing, I haven't had as good a nights sleep in many years. The room was a little warm even with the air con on, but we asked for a fan and it was delivered within minutes. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough, and I will be back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 5, 2016Dear Guest, we are honored that you rated the Bauer Palazzo the best Hotel you've ever stayed!!
