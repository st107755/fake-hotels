We arrived by water taxi from the airport which was an amazing way to arrive at this lovely 5 star hotel.  Our suite with view to the side of the hotel overlooking the canal side entrance was large and comfortable.  We would have liked to have had tea/coffee facilities but it wasnâ€™t a major issue.  Staff were all really helpful and attended to all our requests.  Very good breakfast, all tastes catered for.  Location is excellent, less than 5 min walk to St Marks Square.  Thoroughly enjoyed our first stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 12, 2019Dear Bridgetmacg,  Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
