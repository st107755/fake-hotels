This historical hotel as a fantastic location just few meters off Piazza San Marco. Rooms are nice and big, in old venetian style, maybe they need a little refreshing but overall  are clean and cosy. The restaurant "De Pisis" is very good, for dinner and lunch in front of the Grand canal. We asked food out of the menu and the cook prepared for us fantastic dishes. There is also a bar lounge very interesting for late coctails and music lovers.... Service is very good at any level. I will come back.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 8, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your review on your recent stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
