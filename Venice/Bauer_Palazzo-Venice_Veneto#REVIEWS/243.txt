Iâ€™d like to start by saying a huge thank you to everyone who work there for making our holiday the best it could have been it was perfect. Our room was amazing with a great little veranda over looking the city and take in some sun after a day walking around the beautiful city. The housekeeping was fantastic tending to our every need day or night thank you so much. In the morning having our breakfast on the terrace looking over the canal grande was perfect the breakfast was absolutely amazing we sat one day just taking our time enjoying the ambiance for two hours it was just the best place to stay.
