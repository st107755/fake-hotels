Staying at this hotel is a special experience. It never disappoints on any level. The breakfast is served by professional waiting staff who understand the concept of hospitality and treat guests to fantastic service. The coffee was wonderful, eggs cooked to perfection. Cocktails are amazing, and a great selection of gins.  The views of The Grand Canal are in my opinion the best in Venice. This is truly a magical setting to enjoy a drink whilst watching the gondolas pass by. I will always make this my number 1 choice of hotels to stay/visit in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 31, 2018Dear Penser,  We would like to thank for your kind and detailed feedback and for your preference for Bauer Palazzo for your stays in Venice.
