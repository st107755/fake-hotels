Bauer is a beautiful hotel in a great location close to San Marco.  The service was excellent and the rooms spacious with a large bathroom. The only problem was that our room overlooked some kind of service atrium, so there was no external view at all - a pity in such a beautiful city! Other rooms were available at a price, and we'd definitely upgrade if we were to visit again.  The rooftop bar is stunning and well worth a visit - beware though, it's expensive, even by Venice standards! Some beers were almost €30! A bottle of (good!) wine however is only €40, and is nice to enjoy with stunning views of the lagoon and Grand Canal.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend the Bauer, and would certainly choose it again if we were to return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
