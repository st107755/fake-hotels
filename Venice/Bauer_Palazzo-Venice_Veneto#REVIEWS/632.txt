From check-in to departure, the Bauer was excellent in all respects. My wife and I stayed 4 nights in Aug-Sep 2016. Our superior suite was large (appx 450 sqft) with grand and side canal views, and lovely old world furnishings and fixtures. The English movie channel on the TV was a nice bonus. The views from the room, De Pisis restaurant, the outdoor B-Bar lounge and especially the roof bar are stunning. The food at the restaurant and room service was varied and delicious.  Service was professional and competent at every interaction. The concierge team assisted with dinner reservations, airport transfers and also arranged a spa day for us at the sister Palladio property, which was also excellent. The spa staff was friendly and the Palladio grounds are beautiful.
