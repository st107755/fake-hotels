Overlooking the Grand Canal and just steps away from St Mark's Plaza as well as a station of the Vaporetto (the water buses that run along the Grand Canal on a regular schedule), the Bauer is magnificently positioned to enjoy the best Venice has to offer. The rooms are large and handsomely furnished. The staff is exceedingly polite and eager to meet your every need. The restaurant offers delicious meals, the bar offers live music, the breakfast (included with our room) was a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Feb 13, 2016Dear Guest, we are delighted to receive your comments and we are extremely honored to know that your rating of the Bauer Palazzo is so grand!!
