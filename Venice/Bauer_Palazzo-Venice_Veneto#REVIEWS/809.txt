Just returned from a 4 day trip to Venice staying at the Bauer hotel;  the trip was booked through BA Holidays.  Arrived as scheduled and checked in with no problems, and told we were allocated a room in the 'Casa Nova' part of the hotel,  oooh I say!  The Casa Nova turns out to be 50 yards away outside of the main hotel in a separate building.  Room on the second floor, turns out to be quite nice, good sized bathroom with bath and shower etc. Nice comfortable bed I wonder what the view is like asks my wife!  Two windows with a view of..........  nothing!   A wall of an adjoining  property about 10 feet away!  Room nice and quiet, until 0630hrs when the kitchen staff start banging and crashing!  Main hotel is fine, we only really use it for breakfast, which is a real treat,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Apr 18, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your review on your stay at the Bauer Casa Nova.
