Really disapointed. I was expecting more for a five star hotel. The basic of basics you would expect is a kettle in your room. First you hava to ask for it to be brought to your room, but then 2 tea bags are 20 euros! Extortion when your already paying so much. Plus, booked a double room, they gave me a twin! And then offered to put the beds together because they messed up the booking. Breakfast is average as well. Really regretting chosing the Bauer over another hotel we had been looking at. Certainly not returning. Don't get swayed by the 5 star rating. It is not 5 star....Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Dec 11, 2016Dear Mrs. Esteban, thank you so much for your reviews, even if to use different account is not correct. As we wrote by email, We suggest to speak with your travel agency about your reservation. In any case, when you was arrival, we confidmed the twin bed as your request.  Immediatly you asked to change the set up, but we changed the set up of your bed during the afternoon and not before, because we gave you a free of charge early check-in. In a 5 Star Hotel we do our best to serve Our Guests.  When we wrong, we offer a compensation, but not under threats.  Best Regards Resident ManagerRead more
