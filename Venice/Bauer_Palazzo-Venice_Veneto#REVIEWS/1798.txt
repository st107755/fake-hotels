Truly Romantic, perfect honeymoon hotel overlooking the canal. We had a beautiful room with a balcony. Venetian Decor. We had Champagne in our room when we arrived! Excellent breakfast, close to St. Mark's Square and all the luxury shopping. Very nice breakfast in a room overlooking the canal. Professional and courteous staff. Canal cruise right at the doorstep. A magical experience, worth the price!Read moreDate of stay: March 2007HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 4, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay at The Bauer Hotel We are so pleased to read that you enjoyed our perfect location during your honymoon, our great breakfast and the room with balcony.
