The Bauer Hotels have a well deserved reputation for the best service in the world, and it id deserved.  We booked one of three rooms that overlook where the Grand Canal meets the lagoon.  Dinners on the Balcony overlooking the most spectacular views in Venice.  Staff that arranged a last-minute boat transfer were waiting on the dock when we arrived.  After that you just enjoy Venice.  After a long day of sightseeing or shopping we would return to the hotel and before we reached the hotel staff would meet us, take any packages to the room, and invite to to sit in the outside restaurant on the canal and relax.  There was no request that wasn't met with a cheerful "Of Course!"  My favorite hotel in the world.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Feb 15, 2015Dear Guests,   what else can we say about your comments?
