Brilliant location, excellent service, very good accommodation. Would definitely stay here again. The location could not be better, situated at the beginning of the Grand canal and about 2 minutes fro m St Mark's square, it's close to everywhere in Venice! The service standard is excellent, virtually no grumpiness and everyone extremely helpful. The rooms are pretty good although a fixed head shower over a bath is not my favourite but there was a hand held attachment over the bath as well. A bottle of fizz arrived on my daughter's birthday which was a nice touch.
