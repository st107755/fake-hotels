This is a lovely hotel with an ideal location on the Grand Canal and very  near St. Marks square. Room are fairly large and well equipped, but most don't have a view of the canal. The bar and the restaurant are located right on the canal, however, so there is plenty of opportunity to watch all of the action on the water. Drink and food prices are high (even for Venice), but the setting couldn't be better.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind feedback of the Bauer Hotel, and we are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay here and that we having been able to meet your expectations.
