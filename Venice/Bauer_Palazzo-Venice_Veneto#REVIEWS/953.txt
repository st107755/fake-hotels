We spent four days in Venice. This hotel is very well situated for walking around. It has the most stunning roof top restaurant, but you can only get breakfast otherwise it is closed despite the fact there are comfortable chairs. Similarly the canal side seating area is only available at meal times. The hotel needs updating and if you compare it to the Gritti Palace you will see what I mean.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Sep 28, 2015Dear Guest,  we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
