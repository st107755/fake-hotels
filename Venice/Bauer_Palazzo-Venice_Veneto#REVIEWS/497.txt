Stayed three nights recently in an excellent room overlooking the Bauer terrace, and the Grand Canal.  Room was decorated in a classic Venetian style – with red walls and tented poster bed, though a bit small.   Bathroom was long and spacious, though shower was immediately adjacent to the bathroom door, and somewhat difficult to access.  Room package included an excellent breakfast buffet in the top floor executive lounge, with a rooftop terrace featuring stunning views of the city, and the canal.  Location is fantastic – convenient walk to St. Marks Square, and various high end retailers.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Mar 28, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
