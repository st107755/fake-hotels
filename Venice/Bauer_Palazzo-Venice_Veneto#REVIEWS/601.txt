OMG, I love Venice, and I love the Bauer Hotel!  We stayed here as part of our Tauck tour.  We had never been to Venice before; taking the boat to pull right up to the hotel was amazing.  It was our 40th anniversary and the hotel gave us the most unbelievable room overlooking the Grand Canal!  I will never forget the room; I felt like a princess.  Over-the-top elegance with fabric on the walls.  We were in the heart of Venice, with gondolas and music right outside our window!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 10, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kindly feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
