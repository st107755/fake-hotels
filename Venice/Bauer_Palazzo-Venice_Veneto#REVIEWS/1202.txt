Late writing this review but relatively new to TripAdvisor, plus the recent celebrity wedding also prompted fond memories! Stayed with my husband as a pre cruise trip to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary last September. The whole visit was wonderful; starting with the water taxi from the airport to the hotel! Worth every penny. The hotel is stylish and sophisticated, rooms tastefully decorated. Best part was breakfast on the terrace and the wonderful waitresses who served us our tea and remembered that we liked to sit on the lower terrace for a latte once we had finished breakfast. Hope the seagulls Gina and Sophia still come to visit! This was the best part of our holiday, romantic venue, perfectly situated for easy access for all attractions. Would love to return!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Oct 5, 2014Thank you for your kind words of praise. I will be sure to share your applause with my Team, in particular waitresses at breakfast.
