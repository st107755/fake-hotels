Room comfortable but window looked on to a wall about 3ft away so very dark. Breakfast on terrace very pleasant but not great service. Had to ask twice for coffee. Very good location but have stayed in other hotels nearby with a view which are very much better value. Will not be returning, not value for money.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 20, 2017Dear Guests,   Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property.
