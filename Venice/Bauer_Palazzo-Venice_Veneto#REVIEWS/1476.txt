We originally checked in to another hotel which received better reviews, but checked out after one night.  We went to look at the II Palazzo and were much more impressed !!  The deluxe room is spectacularly grand with a small terrace overlooking a side canal with views of the grand canal and seating for two.  The room is truly amazing in every way.  When looking to make the hotel change, we looked at both The Gritti Palace and the II Palazzo.  The II Palazzo was much more beautifully decorated and larger with a spectacular bath fit for a king. We had room 202!!  The breakfast buffet is served on the seventh floor on the outdoor terrace with glorious panoramic views of Venice!!  The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful!!  Hopefully, we will return one dayâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Manager at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jun 7, 2013Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions of your visit.
