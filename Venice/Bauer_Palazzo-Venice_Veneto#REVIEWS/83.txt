From the moment my wife and I arrived we knew we were is a special place. The hotel is beautiful and the room was amazing. It is decorated in a style you would expect of a historic hotel in Venice. The staff is amazing. The hotel is well situated. The only negative item was that the view from our room was into an ally. We would stay in that room again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jul 14, 2019Dear Zimmanj,  We wish to thank you for choosing Bauer Palazzo and for your kind and extensive feedback regarding your stay.
