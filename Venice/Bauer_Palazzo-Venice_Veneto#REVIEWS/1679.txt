My wife and kids had the great fortune to stay at this hotel.  The property was perfectly located along the Grand Canal with a side canal that drops you off at the hotels front door.  Upon our arrival, we were upgraded to two suites overlooking the canal.  Needless to say, the trip started off great.  We were there only one night as we were departing on a cruise the next day.  The hotel is first class and the staff was great.  The concierge was a bit overwhelmed but his attitude did not detract from my overall stay.  Not cheap, but well worth it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 15, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
