My family and I stayed at this hotel during the month of July. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a wonderful location, so close to Saint Mark's square. It's a 5 star hotel in a 5 star location!   The rooms were very spacious and clean. Breakfast is delightful, and overlooks the magical grand canal.   However, the fact that there was no iron available was very poor. They said it was due to 'Italian safety regulations' (other hotels we have been to in Italy supplied irons). I believe this is a price gauging tactic, as they offered laundry services. For example, a shirt is Â£30. A big rip off!   Overall, this was a wonderful hotel in a great location. Just BYO iron!
