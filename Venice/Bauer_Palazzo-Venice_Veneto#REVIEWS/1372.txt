Great location, 5 minutes away from Piazza San Marcos.  Rooms were on the small side, bathroom was descent size and bed was comfortable.  We have a room with a view to the internal channel and we loved watching the gondoliers and boat passing by.  Staff was superb and concierges were extremely helpful.  The bar area was great, specially after a long walk in Venice.   We had breakfast included, and the terrace was a great place to enjoyed.  However the breakfast set up was chaotic and selection/quality was mediocre.  I am sure they can do a better job for the price you are paying in a luxury hotel like the Bauer.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Direttore at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 14, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your extensive feedback on your stay at Bauer Palazzo We highly appreciated your comments and the entire Team is delighted to know that the experience was up to your expectation.
