One of the leading Hotels in Venice - and in a sensational position fronting the Grand Canal.  With no access by road it is an adventure just to arrive..!  1 minute walk to St Marks Square, this old, but very elaborate and comfortable hotel has staff that provide wonderful service.   Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal has to be another experience not to be missed.  Only downside are the rooms - relatively small - but overcome by everything else.  Good eating in the dining room.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from BauerHotels, Responsabile reception at Bauer PalazzoResponded Nov 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kinds words about your stay at The Bauer Hotel.
