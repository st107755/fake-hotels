Our rooms were part of a package and we couldn't have been more happy. Not only was the location just amazing but the entire staff was so wonderful and helpful. Cold air-conditioning on hot August days didn't disappoint when we needed a break and the bathroom and room were very spacious. The highlight was starting each day sitting on the patio overlooking the Grand Canal for breakfast. Ending days there with a cocktail was equally as enjoyable. Will return if ever in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 7, 2019Dear H42fly,  We would like to thank you for your your kind and extensive feedback regarding your recent experience at the Bauer Palazzo and for choosing our property on the occasion of your stay in Venice.
