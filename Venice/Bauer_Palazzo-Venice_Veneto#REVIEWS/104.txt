We where greeted by the staff at boat entrance (boat taxi from airport), with smiles and excellent service. We had a superior room, 2nd floor with view to the side channel. Quiet and elegant room, old but nice and clean. Great breakfast at the terrace with very friendly and professional staff. We also tried the restaurant, and that was no disappointment. Professional staff and superb food. Not too bad prices either.   The location of the Bauer Palazzo is perfect. Two minutes walk to the Piazza San Marco, shopping and restaurant. Also recommend a boat trip with the the hotels own beautiful mahogany boat to their Palladio Hotel, on Giudecca Island, for a fantastic lunch in the back garden. Thank you for a fantastic stay and for the great service in the reception, concierge serviceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded May 7, 2019Dear CHH72,  We would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay in our property and for wonderful feedback.
