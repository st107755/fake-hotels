We absolutely loved this hotel!  The location is absolutely perfect and the staff was universally helpful and kind.  We booked an upper level Palazzo room which allowed us to have breakfast on the top floor with the most beautiful views of Venice.  We had drinks and light lunches several times in the Canal Bar and loved the quiet retreat from the busy Square with excellent food and drinks.  We had a lovely small terrace off of our room overlooking a canal with gondolas passing by.  Our room itself was extremely lovely and comfortable and housekeeping was wonderful.  We dream of returning and would recommend this hotel to anyone for a luxurious but unpretentious stay in beautiful Venice.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from BauerPalazzo, Responsabile relazioni con la clientela at Bauer PalazzoResponded Jan 4, 2019Dear Carmel02138,  We would like to thank you for your wonderfully detailed feedback regarding your stay at the Bauer Palazzo.
