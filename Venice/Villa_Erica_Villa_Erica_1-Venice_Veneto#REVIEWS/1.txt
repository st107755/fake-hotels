Villa Erica is an exceptional place to stay when you visit Venice.  The place is easy to get to with Bus 19 back and forth to Piazzale Roma and Venice.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and super clean and the bathroom is huge with all the amenities.  Lucia is a super host and she provides a great breakfast with various types of coffees.  She also gives great advise and directions to various places.    Also very convenient close to the airport.  We will return Lucia.    Thank you for your wonderful hospitality.  You are a beautiful person inside and out.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019RoomsLocationServiceHelpfulShare
