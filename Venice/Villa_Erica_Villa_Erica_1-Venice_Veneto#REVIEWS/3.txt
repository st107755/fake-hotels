Everything was wonderful! Sparkling clean, safe, free parking, quiet, wonderful breakfast, and location location location!!  The management (Lucia) was very helpful and accommodating. She was extremely communicative before we arrived and check in was super smooth! Additionally, all the information about how to navigate into venice was organized in the lobby and so easy to use! Walk outside the front door about 100ft and you take Bus 19 all the way to Venice. So simple and convenient! If you are looking for a place to stay when visiting Venice, donâ€™t hesitate to stay here. It is absolutely perfect. You wont regret it!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019Trip type: Traveled as a couple1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
