I booked this hotel because it's close to the airport.  Honestly to my surprise how nice the experience had been.  I arrived nearly midnight, and the owners still patience with my calling, and also helped booking taxi pick up for early morning for my traveling companion next day.  The hotel is freshly decorated, tastefully and quiet.  Bathroom was clean and sheets were clean. Air-conditioning worked. I love my room.  Breakfast was lovely and the landlady was beautiful and nice.   Nearby restaurants filled with local, you can take bus 19 to central Venice town in 20minus.  I am not big fan of staying in old houses and busy places, after a long day of walking, nice and quite rest will do.  Landlady prepared for your breakfast then she leaves. So lots of time I feel like living inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
