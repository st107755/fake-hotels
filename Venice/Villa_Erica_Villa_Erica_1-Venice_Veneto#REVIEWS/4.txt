We stayed at Villa Erica upon returning from a cruise which ended in Venice. What a great decision it was to stay somewhere outside of the city. We picked this location because there was easy access to Venice but also very easy access to the airport.   The rooms in the Villa were lovely, beautifully appointed, very clean, and just what we needed. The proprietor was accommodating and extremely helpful. Additionally the breakfast was quite good and a great way to start our day prior to leaving to go back to the US.  I would highly recommend this B&B as a wonderful place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018Trip type: Traveled as a couple3 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
