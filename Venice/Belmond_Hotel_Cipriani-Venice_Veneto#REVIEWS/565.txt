There are many things the hotel is justifiably proud of. They make you feel special by doing everything so well and making you feel it is their pleasure. The private shuttle is a treat. The service professional but unobtrusive.  I cannot give it an unremarked excellent, it otherwise plainly deserves. The restaurant is simply not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. Leaving aside the cackling booming Americans, the food was average at best. The desert - chocolate souffl√©, chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce symbolises all that was wrong with the meal. Fancy idea poor execution. Not the standard that the hotel and it's guests deserve. But don't let that put you off. Stay there get the shuttle to the restaurant in the Metropole!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Nov 8, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience during the recent stay at our Hotel.
