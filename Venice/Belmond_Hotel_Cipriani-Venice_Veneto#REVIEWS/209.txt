We came over for lunch and enjoyed every minute.  It is a real treat from beginning to the end.  The staff were attentive, not snooty even though we were not staying. We did once for our Silver Wedding Anniversary.   The situation is divine and the food did not let it down.  Looking forward to any future visits.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
