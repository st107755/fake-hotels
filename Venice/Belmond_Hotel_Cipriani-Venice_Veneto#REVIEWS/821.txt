The Cipriani may well be the most beautiful hotel in the most beautiful city on earth!  Beware, however, that they have become a bit snooty and decidedly not child-friendly.  We were told that our very well-behaved children--ages 8 & 10-- would not be welcome in the restaurant (fine-dining; but they say children over 8 may eat there--). There are also restrictions as to the hours in which children may use the pool, and they are not to make any noise when they swim if it is before 5-6 p.m.  We were surprised and dismayed by the treatment we received.  The rooms were adequate at best--certainly not worth the price!

And special seating times are arranged in our restaurants so that families can dine at leisure.  As I write these comments I have on my desk a letter of thanks from a family with 4 small children saying what a wonderful time that they have had while staying with us last week -  just one of many such comments from our younger guests.
