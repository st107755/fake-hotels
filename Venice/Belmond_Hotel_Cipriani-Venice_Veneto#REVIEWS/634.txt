The Hotel Cipriani is the grand hotel of Venice I had booked a lagoon view suite on the recommendation of others based on reputation not recent experience. Some of the reviews were a little mixed (especially the May issue of Conde Naste which referred the hotel being knocked into a crocked hat - whatever that means it can't be good). Was it a hotel in decline still expensive but now a little worn and trading on reputation?  Well fear not this hotel retains all of its charm and our stay was perfect.  Doubtless our stay was helped by an upgrade to one of the special suites - straight out of a story book - views and balconies to the lagoon, garden and over the pool towards St Marks. The staff especially Alessandra - were peerless in their professionalism and attention to detail.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
