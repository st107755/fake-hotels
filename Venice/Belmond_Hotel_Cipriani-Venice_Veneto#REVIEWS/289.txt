The location sets itself apart by far, just far enough away but close enough to dive back in. The size of the hotel is just about right. Any bigger and the impeccable service would be lost.  Just married, it was the perfect place to indulge in our own time and see Venice properly knowing we had the safe haven of the hotel to comeback to. The staff could not have been better. The breakfast, most wonderful in such a grand setting. We did not see any tourists boats during our stay so felt left out not to be pointed at or told that George C had got married there. a very slick team ensures your happiness.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
