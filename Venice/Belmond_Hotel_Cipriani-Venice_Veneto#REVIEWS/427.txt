Italian chic, sophistication and service! Pefect.....yes it is not inexpensive but from the welcome to the rooms the service and cuisine...why go anywhere else. I read some of the less positive reviews but treat people with respect and you will be pleased on how it is appreciated. Wonderful to go to a hotel with Nationals serving....serving with pride!! Outstanding and thank you the team at the Cipriani. The cuisine....world class in quality...in preparation and presentation.....one can appreciate prepared with love care and attention.
