After a short water taxi ride from the railway station where the Orient Express ends in Venice, you arrive at the private island and jetty of Belmond Hotel Cipriani. You are met by the porters who make certain your check in goes without a hitch. The name is well known around among the worlds top luxury hotels. The grounds are beautifully kept and the walks well lighted at night.  Your suite is comfortable most acceptably appointed, but so it should be as well. They have a complimentary launch that takes you into the centre of Venice when needed. The staff is polite, charming and well adversed in old fashioned decorum. Breakfast outside every morning an absolute pleasure. A joy! Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
