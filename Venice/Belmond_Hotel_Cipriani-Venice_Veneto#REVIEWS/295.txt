For me, this was a delight. The hotel, whilst not stepped in historic architecture harps back to a romantic time. I could not fault the service, every member of staff was well trained, polite and very attentive. My only complaint would be pigeons around the pool bar - whilst the staff's approach was to use a water pistol to scare them off, a longer term solution is needed.  Pool a delight and how nice it was to leave the hustle and bustle of tourist town, arrive back and be pampered at the pool. The boat that runs 24 hours a day between the hotel and the main island made it for me. What a lovely way to return from dinner being ferried across the harbor with the lights of Venice as a back drop. Truly magical.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
