We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, which were to be the special last nights of our 2-week Italy Vacation.  Upon arrival, we were very impressed.  The service and check in were smooth and efficient, and as I'd mentioned during the booking process we were celebrating 2 special occasions, we were given a wonderful room.  All staff we interacted with were exceptional. Nothing was too much of an ask.  I needed a doctor and usually you have to wait hours, but one was at the hotel within 45 mins.  The location is wonderful - just far enough away but so accessible with the Cipriani transfer.  The pool area is stunning.  We enjoyed a stunning day poolside, with a gorgeous lunch at the poolside restaurant.  The service is efficient but unobtrusive.  Breakfast was just lovely. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
