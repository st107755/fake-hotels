The only thing you can criticise  about this hotel are the prices. The service is great the staff all very friendly, the food is excellent in both restaurants, the gardens are a little oasis of calm , the views and settings are tremendous. We spent two nights there last week prior to our trip on the Orient Express and we loved it. We ended up in a garden suite which was as if we had the hotel to ourselves. Needless to say such quality doesn't come cheap but well worth it if you just want to splash out for a special occasion.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
