Bottom line: it's not worth the price!  (+) wonderful location (+) amazing garden (+) excellent cuisine (+) very friendly and professional concierge and transfer service  (-)(-)(-) if they change your room after your arrival and you get a simple standard although you booked a luxury room and they insist that this would be the same category & you have to pay the same price - this is not the kind of service you expect from a hotel like this! I felt betrayed. There are other 5 Stars luxury Hotels in Venice (like Londra Palace or Ca' Segredo) where you can enjoy a junior or a luxury suite for the same price and you will get a real VIP Service!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
