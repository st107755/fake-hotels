A lovely hotel in an amazing location away from the chaos of Venice. It is calm and relaxing and a great place to go with children. Ours loved the pool and the boat trips to San Marco as well as the very friendly staff, especially Roberto. Sightseeing can be hard work with small children but the Cipriani made it easy and fun.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
