Having travelled at the best hotels all over the world, I can honestly say this is way up there with my favorites. Everything was truly perfect and first class in every way. The room was magnificent facing the canal, The Concierges and front desk staff were so helpful. The food was delicious. The grounds are stunning, the gardens and pool especially. My Son loved the kid's club and their friendly staff. Heaven on earth in the most beautiful city.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
