We loved the Cipriani. Luxurious and relaxing. The sumptuous breakfast overlooking the lagoon was an experience. The staff were efficient, friendly and very helpful. The 24 hour a day boat service meant you could visit or escape the hectic bussle of Venice at will. We'd have no hesitation in recommending it and hope we can return to Venice and the Cipriani ASAP.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
