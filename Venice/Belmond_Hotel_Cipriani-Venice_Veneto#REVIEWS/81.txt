We choose this hotel because we visited Venice with our grandchildren of resp. 16 and 12 years and we're looking for some extra facilities but nevertheless stay in proximity of the main island. It was perfect from the moment we arrived till the moment we left. Moreover the shuttle service to/from the hotel to San Marco square is very efficient so if you look for an excellent place to stay in all comfort just a little bit away from the hectic centre of Venice don't hesitate to choose Hotel Cipriani.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Apr 15, 2019Dear Luc S,  Thank you very much for staying with us and for your wonderful review following your family trip with your grandchildren.
