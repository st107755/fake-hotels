Completely amazing, we stayed in the suit 100.  The staff are incredible and make your stay a priority.  A holiday I will never forget truly exceptional.  We went July 2013 when the firework display was on - said to be the largest in Europe :) it really was incredible, we got engaged that night on the banks of the canal watching the fireworks - and the staff made sure we had everything we needed.
