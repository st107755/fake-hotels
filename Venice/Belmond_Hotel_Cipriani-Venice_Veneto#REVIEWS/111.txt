Stayed here for three nights in this beautiful hotel set on an island in the lagoon in Venice. The hotel has a boat that transports you to this amazing island where first class service awaits. The junior suite was incredible with a huge bed, beautiful views of the lagoon and a  marble bathroom with double wash basins, large bath and separate shower. The staff were friendly and helpful, the concierge staff were amazing nothing too much trouble and the service first class. So near to the centre of Venice but a tranquil escape from the crowds. There are three restaurants, we only tried two.  This is an amazing hotel with wonderful service in a beautiful setting, a real treat.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 18, 2018Dear Parsnips24,  Thank you so much for your wonderful review and for taking the time to share your opinions on TripAdvisor.
