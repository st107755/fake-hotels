The experience at the hotel starts with Roberto who greets you at the pier as if he's welcoming you in his house. One night we had dinner in a restaurant in he city and, since he went to a theatre around the corner and knew that we were there, he came inside just to say hello. The rooms are nice (especially the ones that has just been refurbished last winter) and extremely quiet; you don't have the noise of being on the Grand Canal. The maitre d' at Fortuny restaurant is very professional and remembers every name. The pool is amaizing; when I went it wasn't warm outside but the pool was almost 30 degrees celcius! Swimming in Venice was priceless!Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
