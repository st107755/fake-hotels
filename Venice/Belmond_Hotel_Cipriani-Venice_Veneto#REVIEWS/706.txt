A holiday to Venice for 4 days with kids isnt the greatest idea as there is nothing for kids in venice (literally)  But if ure at Hotel Cirpriani - there is Linda - a lifesaver , an entertainer , a lovely person who will make pizzas , venetian masks , cookies , paintings with kids and also make them swim in the cute kiddie pool .  We were able to explore Venice and have some time to ourselves as we left our two kids aged 5 and 3 with Linda in the Cipriani play area .  Kudos Linda and Thanks a ton Maitreyi KandoiRead moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
