We stayed for two nights as a preclude to a trp on the Orient Xpress to Paris. Our stay at the Cip was wonderful with charming staff from the moment we stepped off our water taxi from airport. The rooms were very good, and facilities around the hotel what you wold expect. We spent some time in the piano bar one evening and this was,enjoyable, if not packed, due to the very entertaining singer/pianist.  Would really recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Venice who's budget will cater for the extraganvences of the Cip.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
