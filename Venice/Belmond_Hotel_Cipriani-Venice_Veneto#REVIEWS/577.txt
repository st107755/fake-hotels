Have just returned from  two night stay in the Cipriani.  Absolutely fabulous in every way. Don't go there though if you worry about prices. 8euros50 for a small packet of Tyrells crisps in the mini bar! The huge bedroom we had couldn't be faulted, complete with terrace. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath which was an added bonus.  All the staff were friendly and efficient and the reception staff particularly so. The private launch shuttle service just adds to the general indulgence of the place and makes it extremely difficult for other hotels to reach the same level of service.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 11, 2013Dear Guests,  I would lke to thank you for the nice comments about your recent stay of two nights at the Cipriani.
