If you are a celebrity, aspiring to become one, or want to meet one then this hotel is for you. The property is located about 20 minutes from San Marco with shuttles running every 15 minutes or so. The food is good -rather pricey and the rooms are lovely.  The staff and service are very prompt and offer to help you in any way they can.  I did not give this five stars because I do feel the food is too pricey for what it is.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
