What a gorgeous, world-class property.The concierge service was superb- great restaurant recommendations and very helpful planning our Venetian tours on the hotel boat with Fabio! With Fabio as our Captain, we were able to see many islands and spots many tourists will never enjoy. The hotel arranged a tour of the glass factory in Murano with a lovely restaurant reservation, trips to Burano with lunch reservation at Il Gato Nero, the Orto Winery on San Erasmo island, San Lazzaro for the Armenian Church, and much more! Staying here is so much quieter than the main hotels in Venice, and it was fun to ride the Cipriani boat for touring. The breakfast on the terrace is very special. This is where George Clooney and his guests stayed fro his wedding.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
