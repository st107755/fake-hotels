We weren't impressed with Hotel Cipriani. We found the atmosphere very stuffy and the staff fake and suffocating! We found much better value staying in a stunning apartment near the accademia. With so many worthy causes throwing away money on a stuffy atmosphere, where all you heard was the clanging of silverware, seems wasteful. Perhaps we weren't there at the right time of the year (September), but in all other exceptional hotels we have stayed at it hasn't mattered. Hotel Cipriani lacked life! It was dry and the best thing about it were the abundance of beautiful little sparrows. Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
