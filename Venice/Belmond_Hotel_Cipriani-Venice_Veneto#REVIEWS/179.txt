Wow, it's hard to put into words how special this hotel is. Does it have flaws? Absolutely, some the carpets have seen better days, the tv didn't really pick up many stations and was v small and of course it's expensive ... But none of this matters as the Cipriani isn't looking to be a Four Seasons (I should at that as a hotel chain I love the Four Seasons). It's the only hotel I have been to that sends you back to the days of discrete comfort, glamour, charm and really superb service. The staff are a rare combination of effortlessly professional in service and naturally friendly in nature. A final tip but try the bruschetta.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
