My wife and I have just spent a delightful few days at this hotel on our honeymoon. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated with unfailing courtesy and professionalism by every member of the staff. We ate at both the formal Oro restaurant and less formal Cips restaurants and both were excellent. Our room overlooked the lagoon and was superb with a massive well appointed bathroom, bedroom to match and a comfortable sitting room. Toiletries (Bulgari) were replaced by the  twice daily room service with ALL linen replaced daily!  I could go on but just read the other reviews to confirm our views. Yes it is expensive but as an experience of a lifetime it was worth every penny and we are planning on a return for an anniversary at some time.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
