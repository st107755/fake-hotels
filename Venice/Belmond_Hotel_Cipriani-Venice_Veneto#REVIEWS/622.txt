I would give the Cipriani more than 5 stars if I could because it is simply my favorite hotel in the world.  This was our 6th trip to the Cipriani and for me, there is no other place to stay in Venice during the warm weather season. The property is exquisite and I especially enjoy the pool to which I retreat every afternoon after a busy day of looking at art and wandering around Venice.  Our room this year was exquisite.  The service is unbeatable, with a concierge service that is available  round the clock to make restaurant and touring recommendations both before and during one's stay.  The atmosphere at the hotel is friendly and low-key.  It feels like a club and guests enjoy speaking to each other and sharing travel and dining tips.  We also enjoyed a lovely al fresco mealâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
