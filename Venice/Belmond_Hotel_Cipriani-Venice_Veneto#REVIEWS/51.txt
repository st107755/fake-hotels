Beautiful, charming, old hotel with lots of character in a stunning location. The service overall was excellent, bar a poor experience with the tennis court (needs relaying). Arriving and leaving by a boat is certainly a first and lasting memory.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 30, 2019 Dear charlestE318BZ,  I appreciate you taking a moment to write about your recent stay with us at Belmond Hotel Cipriani. It is a delight to read how much you enjoyed our exclusive location on Giudecca island and also our 'excellent' service.

With my best personal regards.  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel Cipriani Read more
