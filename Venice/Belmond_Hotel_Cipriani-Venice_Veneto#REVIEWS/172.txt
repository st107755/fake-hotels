Top class hotel, don't think it gets better anywhere in the world. Granted it is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Room had fantastic view overlooking the lagoon and dinner and breakfast both top notch. Added bonus of the swimming pool which really does come in handy on the hotter, more humid days.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
