We stayed at this hotel for ten days. Everything about this hotel was 6* except for the food in the restaurants, which were in great locations next to the sea. However the food was more 4* but at 6* prices.  This applied to all meals.  For example at Breakfast the bakery items were below par. eg; the croissants were not crisp on the outside and melting in your mouth on the inside,some lunch and dinner meat items were tough and gristly.  Consequently after the first two days we ate in Venice at two restaurants near St Marco square where the food was at a much higher standard at much lower cost!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
