Somewhat belated review...  This was the last stop on our fabulous Orient Express trip from Istanbul.  I understand that this is one of only 2 hotels in Venice to have a Swimming pool and our room with private patio and direct access to pool and dedicated loungers was fantastic..if not a little dated and tatty!  The hotels private water taxi to the square is a fantastic bonus!  Nice to be away from the madness that can be Venice but near enough to enjoy it.  A private water taxi to the airport from the hotel is a must, and worth every single penny!!...(or 100 odd pounds)..trust me..it is!Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
