This is one of the world's  finest hotels. No argument. We stayed in a beautifully appointed room overlooking the garden restaurant and the canal. Each day after the elegant breakfast, we'd take the hotel watertaxi into St Marks Square, shop for two hours, then shuttle back to the hotel for four hours swimming in the largest heated pool in Venice. Service is extraordinary but unobtrusive. Dining is amazing either in the hotels three restaurants, which are not cheap, or along the canal in any of several lovely restaurants. We will go back, hopefully again and again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
