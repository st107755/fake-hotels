Stayed at the Cipriani for 3 nights at the beginning of April, not long after it reopened for the 2019 season - probably the best hotel we've ever stayed at. The location is perfect - just a few minutes via the hotel's traditional motor launch from St Mark's square but that little distance gives an escape from the bustle of central Venice.  The hotel itself is fabulous - a room with a balcony view over the lagoon was the size of a small apartment, and so comfortable. The staff are brilliantly attentive too, taking care to notice my wife's birthday and make a cake and drinks that were very much appreciated. Just a great hotel!Read moreDate of stay: April 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Dec 19, 2019Dear britinhellas,  I would like to thank you very much for your beautiful review and comments and for defining the Belmond Hotel Cipriani 'Best place to stay while visiting Venice - just perfect'.
