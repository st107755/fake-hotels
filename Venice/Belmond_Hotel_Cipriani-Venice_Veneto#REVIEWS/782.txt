Extremely expensive but you feel like you have arrived in the middle of a James Bond Movie. Make sure you get a newly renovated room as the first room we were offered was more like a Las Vegas Honeymoon Suite from the seventies. Believe me, that is not a compliment!  The second room had a marble bathroom and the most amazing view plus it was newly furnished. We had the most amazing two days here. The staff was lovely, the food exquisite. Loved the boat trips to St. Marks Square and we felt very priviliged to be able to leave the crowds and arrive back to this peaceful haven. The salt water pool is gorgeous.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
