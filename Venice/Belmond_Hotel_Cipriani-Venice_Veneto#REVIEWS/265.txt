This hotel is dreamy. It's elegant, classy d√©cor and amazing service does not disappoint. Loved every second of my stay here - we had dinner at Cips Restaurant in the evening and the sunset view was stunning. Highly recommend if you are looking for a slice of luxury for a day or 2.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
