My husband and stayed in one of the beautiful villas for three nights recently.   The villa itself was beautiful, view was lovely of the gardens, and being a bathroom snob, the bathroom was decadent!   The staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and accomodate.  Loved staying here as it was just a five minute boat ride into Venice.  Venice, being the busy and soemtimes crowded place that it is, The Cip' was a welcome, quiet retreat in the afternoon to re-group and rest up.  I would not hesitate to stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Venice.  You can't go wrong....Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
