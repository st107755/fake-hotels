I was able to get a away for an afternoon and check out this amazing hotel. I work for a fashion company and want to  use this hotel for future business. The rooms were beautiful and kept very well. The pool and grounds are beautiful, and lunch was really nice. This hotel is in a wonderful location and gets you away from the crowds of Venice. If you are looking for something extra special this is the place to stay. If you go during the summer dont forget the bathing suit, the pool was gorgeous.Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
