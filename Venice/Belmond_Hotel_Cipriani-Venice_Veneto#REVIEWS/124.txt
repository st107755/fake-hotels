We came up from Croatia by my Yacht to stay one night at this opulent hotel. What a lovely place to stay,  room was very comfortable with great views of the lagoon, service was excellent and so was the breakfast and restaurants in the hotel. The swimming pool is huge and the sun beds are very comfortable all around. They have a lovely garden area where they grow a lot of their own vegetables for the restaurants.  A truly memorable stay and we will be back for sure.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 3, 2018Dear Barrypet,  Thank you so much for your wonderful review and for taking the time to share your experience.
