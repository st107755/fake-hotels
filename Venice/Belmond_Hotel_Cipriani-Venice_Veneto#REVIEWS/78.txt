I was expecting a lot from the Cipriani and it exceeded my expectations. We were a family group and used all the facilities from restaurants to pool to gym and everything was top notch. The rooms were fantastic - ultra comfortable beds, with all manner of luxuries provided. The staff were superb - friendly and welcoming, efficient and helpful but never overpowering. It was also wonderful to be staying in a little oasis of calm when the buzzy centre of Venice was a short hop away across the water. I will never stay anywhere else in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Apr 24, 2019Dear serriem2013,  Thank you very much for taking the time to share your  review of the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
