Our family stayed there at the end if August with  our three daughters - ages 10, 9 and 6. The hotel could not have been more welcoming. They brought panda decorated cookies and sparkling grape juice to our room on arrival and provided kid-sized bathrobes and slippers.  The woman who runs Cipkids club came up and greeted us.  In the morning at our beautful breakfast , the concierge mentioned to our girls that the box turtles in the koi pond love genoa salami. Naturally from then on they fed them every morning. We lived our stay and the girls loved the hotel and especially the pool.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
