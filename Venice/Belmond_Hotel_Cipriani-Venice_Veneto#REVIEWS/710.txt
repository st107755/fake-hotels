Spent four days at end of cruise at the Cip - and it was amazing.  Always opt for a Lagoon view with balcony and you won't be disappointed.  Beautiful room... and the POOL is AMAZING.  Flawless, attentive service and their array of tour guides are amazing - beyond belief.... Concierge was EXTRAORDINARY (sorry for shouting) - but it was...   Food - to me - was best at the poolside bar... Venice (in general) disappoints "foodwise" generally....  Did the Cipriani Island restaurant on their Riva- and it was wonderful.    Make no mistake - this is one of the "great" hotels in the world - old world -not a tad of flash - just "perfect"Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
