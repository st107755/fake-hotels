The staff at The Belmond Cipriani could not do enough to make our stay comfortable. The journey in the water taxi to the hotel was magical . Restaurant was expensive but very good. Breakfast was delicious. I will definitely go back for another stay hopefully next year in a warmer month to make use of beautiful outdoor pool.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
