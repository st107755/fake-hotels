Stayed here after a trip on the Orient express from London. A simply amazing hotel. It was our 35 th wedding anniversary and 60 th birthdays and we were upgraded to a junior suite. Thank you so much to the hotel for this kind gesture. The junior suite was simply wonderful.   The gardens were stunning and the views of the water sublime.   Supper at Cipâ€™s was lovely. I can thoroughly recommend the calves liver and polenta.  Lunch at Giudecca 10 was equally lovely.  We really enjoyed the outside heated pool and the hotel ambience.  The service everywhere was impeccable as you would expect. We have stayed in many exceptional places but this is probably the best hotel in the world   Well done to all the staff and thank you.
