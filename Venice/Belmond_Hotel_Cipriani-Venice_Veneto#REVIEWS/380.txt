Loved the location, the welcome from the doorman, the food. The rooms do need refurbishing but I believe they are planning this. Lint from bed linen sticks to your clothes so not good.   The last day of my stay, I missed breakfast as I wasn't aware of the timings but the restaurant informed me to head to the bar for food. Upon heading to the bar there was nobody there and I waited 10minutes and went back and forth trying to find someone until someone took my order. They took so long to make it then gave me the wrong order, I had no time to eat as I had to leave to catch my boat. The gents at the bar did apologise and offer to have it made and give me a take away which was a nice touch, got it just in time as I was leaving. All in all 8/10. Just wish they had a jacuzzi even if itâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
