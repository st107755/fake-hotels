stayed here for our silver wedding anniversary after arriving in the orient express, the Belmond staff & hotel staff cannot do enough for you. Oro restaurant is interesting but possibly not to everybody's taste, service was superb. Position is fantastic with balcony rooms overlooking the lagoon. Launch to St Marc's square 24 hours a day is a treat Highly recommended Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
