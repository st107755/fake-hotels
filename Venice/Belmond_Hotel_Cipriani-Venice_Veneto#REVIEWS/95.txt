The staff was nice. The hotel was nice. The food was okay. Decaf coffee was instant!! Couldn‘t drink it. The location was wrong for me. You have to use a boat to get to the centre. If you are a bit squeamish on the water, I wouldn‘t recommend it. The gardens are beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: October 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Nov 5, 2018Dear babasbeauty,  I would like to thank you for your time to share your thoughts on your personal experience with the Tripadvisor community. In this respect, I am delighted to learn that you enjoyed many aspects of your stay with us but, at the same time, I am sorry that our location on the tip Giudecca island was not suitable  for you. Most of our guests enjoy and choose our privileged position because it is just five minutes by private launch to St. Mark's square and away from the crowds but I fully respect your opinion. Thanking you once again I send you my best personal regards.  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel Cipriani  Read more
