Venice is a magical city. It's like being transported back in time. The scenes are incredible, the history compelling. The downside is the press of tourists and the ever present crowds.  The Hotel Cipriani is an oasis of peace and calm, just five minutes by complementary private launch from St Mark's Square. What a great place to stay when visiting Venice. You can retreat from the elbow-to-elbow press of tourists to a peaceful oasis. This is one of the world's best hotels, perfectly located.  However, you should prepare your bank account for a root canal. We stopped at the poolside bar for refreshments. Two half-size diet cokes and one glass of house white wine set me back forty Euros with tip. That's about $50 American money. Gulp!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
