Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Cipriani hotel and it is a truly amazing place with exceptional staff too.  Especially a warm thank you to Roberto who takes care of all your needs with his Italian flair.  He even showed me that I could zoom in with my i phone (I was unaware of that!) to make a picture of my parents while they were watching the breathtaking view of the lagoon.  We had lunch and dinner in both restaurants and loved the food and the ambiance.  Breakfast is superb at the Cipriani.  The suites were very beautifully decorated and comfortable, and so was the enormous pool area! We would highly recommend this hotel as being the best you can find in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
