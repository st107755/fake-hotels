This is certainly one of the great hotels of the world, we stayed for three days flying from Vienna and being met at the airport by Cipriani  representative. This was an exceptional start, Austrian Air had misplaced my baggage (& a third of the flight queued up to report the same - two hours later) our guide was still waiting, thank you. Bags whisked away (safely) we were driven to the boat and ensconced, headed to the Cipriani within minutes. Magical mood transformance.   On the Isola Giudecca opposite San Marco sits the Cipriani. A drink by the pool immersed us into Cip time and elegance. Our room was in the Palazzo and our two large windows opened onto an excellent view of Venice.   I found the view was better than the reality, Venice is over crowded & grubby with HUGE cruiseâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
