What a treat! A surprise trip to Venice and a stay at the Cipriani-simply brilliant. The arrival by private launch, the views, the tranquillity of the fantastic gardens, bellinis by the pool followed by delicious lunches-I could go on and on! We missed the dinner around the pool on the 21st. I am sure it was spectacluar. Would I recommend it and go again? Yes!!!  ElfinRead moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
