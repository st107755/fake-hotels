My wife and I very much enjoyed the service, courtesy and efficiency of all the staff, and the food at Cipâ€™s and Giudecca 10. The only comment on the food is that we thought the menu should have a little more variety.  The rooms were comfortable, but the chairs and sofa were somewhat impractical to sit on, as was the furniture in the terrace. For me, one of the highlights was to be able to play tennis on the beautiful tennis court, with Antonio de Benedetto, the local pro, who, in addition to being an excellent player, is also very attentive, communicative, provides instructions, and adapts his game to the guest!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jun 6, 2019Dear fbgentil,  I would like to thank you very much for your beautiful review and comments after staying with us.
