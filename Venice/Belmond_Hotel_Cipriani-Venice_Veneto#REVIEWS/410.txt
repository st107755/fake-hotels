Yes, they are yet to let us down. The Cipriani lived up to its excellent reputation and it's no wonder the likes of George Clooney enjoy this experience (unfortunately we missed him this time). If you like, as we do, some luxury away from the crowds, particularly in Venice, then the Cipriani offers that. Still, you can be in St Mark's square in 10 minutes as the hotel's lovely (wooden boat) shuttle service operates to and from every 10-15 minutes 24/7. Once again, a memorable Belmond experience, highly recommended. It's expensive, but you know that already. Lovely, extensive gardens are a bonus.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
