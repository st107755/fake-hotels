We had a wonderful time at the Cipriani, and it is now our favorite hotel in Venice. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Also, they make you feel at home, in a family style. The rooms are all very nice (canal view or garden view). The choice of restaurant is great and I would definitively recommend a diner at Chips. The pool is a big plus in the summer! We loved the breakfast on the canal and the boat shuttle to go back and forth to Pace San Marco. The garden is an oasis when you want to retire from the crowds of Venice. A must go a hotel, worth every penny of its price.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
