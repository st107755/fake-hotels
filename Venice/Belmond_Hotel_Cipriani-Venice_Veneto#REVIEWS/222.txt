Was fortunate to be a regular client (twice a year) at this most beautiful property, where service is "paramount" and management headed by Giampaolo Otazzi and his attentive assistant Adrianna.  They make sure, without ever a miss, that everything from the property, the rooms, and food are never less than perfect. If you do not stay at our favorite suite, THE PALLADIO, please request they show it to you - with it's private pool overlooking the lagoon - always a pleasure to take a dip after the walking and sightseeing all day throughout the cityRead moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
