Our Orient express trip culminated in a stay at this fabulous hotel. Our room had a lagoon view and balcony, with everything you needed Fabulous bathroom and facilities . Going to Venice in beautiful motor launches is.   a Highlight . All the staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, you always felt at home. Everything is available , It's just wonderful in every way Nd everyone should be  lucky enough to experience. Few days hereRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
