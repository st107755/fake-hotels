From the moment we were personally welcomed off the water limousine to the farewell Cipriani exuded Service, class and style. This is an experience not just a Hotel and an immaculate property.  This was the highlight of our honeymoon and have already made plans to return.  The staff, restaurants, suites and Olympic sized pool are just some if the delightful features let alone the history and intriguing buildings.
