This hotel is excellent and in keeping with the attached experience of traveling by the Orient Express to Venice. It is actually the hotel of choice of the stars on location. As with the Orient Express, it is, as expected, expensive but well worth it--- A stay and a trip of a lifetime.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
