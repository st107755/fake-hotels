This hotel is absolutely stunning.  The views are spectacular.  The gardens are perfectly manicured and the buildings are well maintained.  We enjoyed a large jr. suite, with a very impressive bathroom.  Our room was located in the main building.  It had a very large balcony that over looked the pool.  We signed up for the honeymoon package which got us a better rate for the jr. suite and included breakfast plus a lunch/dinner for two each day (worth a lot at their very high prices) and one spa treatment. There were no standard rooms available when we booked our trip.  Every morning and evening the staff would unobtrusively set up our balcony area with cushions on the lounge chairs and lay out towels.  Unfortunately, we were so busy we never got to take advantage of thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2005HelpfulShare
