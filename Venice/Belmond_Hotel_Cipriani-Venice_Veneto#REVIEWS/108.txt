From the moment we walked in, we were treated like old friends and felt like VIP's our entire stay. They got us into our room promptly after arriving early from a long international flight. The concierge was friendly and helpful in getting us all the reservations and tours we asked for. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the city but minutes by charming boat to St. Marks square. The shuttle runs often and it was easy to get back and forth. Most definitely the best place to stay in Venice, we couldn't have imagined a more perfect visit!Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 25, 2018Dear zoenicole819,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience at our hotel with the Tripadvisor community.
