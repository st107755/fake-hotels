We were hosted a lunch there as my partner is a travel agents. We were shown around the hotel first. What an amazing place. I would stay there if I could. The lunch was fantastic. The choice was ample. I had a salad to start and fish for my main course. Everything was as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff at the Fortuny were friendly and helpful. You were never rushed or overlooked by them. But they were avaiable if you needed them. The view from the terrace was amazing. It was a lovely sunny day, good food. What more could you ask for.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
