My wife and I stayed in a beautiful suite overlooking the lagoon for a 3-night stay; our second stay at this wonderful hotel. Better than our last time, mainly because the weather was better. Our only disappointments were that we didn't have enough time to try out their new ORO restaurant or the poolside restaurant as our stay was so short; still, we did enjoy the views from the less formal CIP'S restaurant, and drinks & food at the bar.  We are looking forward to our next visit . . .Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
