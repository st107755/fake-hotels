I consider myself a somewhat jaded traveller and have stayed at numerous hotels over the years. However,the Hotel Cipriani still managed to impress and I regard it as one of my all time favourite.  The location itself, on the waterfront across the Giudecca Canal from St Mark's Square and with views of the neighbouring island of San Giorgio Maggiore is pretty hard to beat. It even has its own complimentary motor launch to St Mark's Square operating every 15 minutes. The staff members are attentive and helpful.  I am not easily impressed but this property is beautiful and its gardens are magical. Yes, it is expensive but in my view, it perfectly captures the romance and fantasy that is Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
