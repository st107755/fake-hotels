I came to Venice with my friends for couple of days and we went for a dinner to Oro Belmond Cipriani. This was an amazing experience. Food was unbelievable. We tried blue lobster which blew our mind and one of the dessert was fragola. Exeptional food and service. One of the managers Enrico was so friendly and made our whole experince even better. I would recommend this place to everyone. Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
