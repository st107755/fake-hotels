We were very excited to arrive at the Cipriani as it is my beautiful wife’s “special” birthday, I have to say it does not disappoint. From the minute we arrived it felt special, top notch staff, very experienced and professional make you feel part of the Belmond family immediately. Beautiful grounds and so peaceful. The restaurants are as good as you would expect with both Venetian & International food. The best hotel we have stayed in - ever! We will be booking the Belmond in Ravello for next year.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
