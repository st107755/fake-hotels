I doubt there is a finer hotel in Venice than the Cipriani.  This was our second visit and it confirmed that we would not stay in other hotel when we visit Venice.  It has an amazing location that gives it a peaceful aura yet is 5 minutes from St Marks Square by it private launch.  The rooms are beautifully maintained and of the highest quality.  The service and attention from the staff is attentive and subtle and nothing is too difficult for them.  Breakfast is generous and if you can get a balcony overlooking the lagoon you can take it there.  Itâ€™s not cheap but incredible value.  More than 5 Star.  We love it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded May 8, 2018Dear tbuae999,  Thank you for taking a moment to review your recent experience at Belmond Hotel Cipriani and for your patronage.
