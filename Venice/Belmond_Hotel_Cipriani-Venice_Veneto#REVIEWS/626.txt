Elegant hotel sited on an island just off St Marks square - offering an unequaled vantage point of Venice and unparalleled level of service and amenities.  Our room was very chic, gardens lovely and restaurants excellent.  The vintage boats a treat and staff exceptional.  we felt completely indulged and if in a classic movie!   The resort is a premiere property (with premium pricing) yet has a warmth and is a very special way to experience magical Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
