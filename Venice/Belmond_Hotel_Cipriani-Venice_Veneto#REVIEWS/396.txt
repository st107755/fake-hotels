Fabulous food.  Wonderful service!  We enjoyed every course that we had.  My teen age daughter said that it was the best lunch of our trip.  We really did not want to go back to the hustle and bustle of Venice.  You know you are in trouble when the check arrives in a gold box!  Can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
