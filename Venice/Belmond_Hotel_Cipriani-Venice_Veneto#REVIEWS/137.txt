We decided to avail ourselves of the pool bar before our dinner reservation at Cipâ€™s restaurant. The property is exceptional, however there was a touch of Benidorm about the place? Plastic poolside loungers? Guest attire was lax at best and the staff (probably recognising is as not guests of the hotel) a little off. Not letting this deter us we spent a couple of hours before and after dinner here. The drinks were great, the cocktails awesome and cigars smokin ðŸ˜‚ If I were a guest it may have been different, I would go again but would hope their standards of service would improve! That being said on our walk back to the bar the manager stopped us and enquirer about our meal, very nice chap- he needs to get the poolside bar staff on the same page heâ€™s on.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 3, 2018Dear Andrew B,  Thank you for sharing your considerations based on your personal experience at our Seagull Bar.
