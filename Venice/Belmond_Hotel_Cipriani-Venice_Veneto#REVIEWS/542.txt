Yes, it might be expensive, but it's in a great location, the staff cannot do more if they tried!  It may be getting a bit tired in places, but this only adds to its overall charm. The food is excellent, and the hospitality and service is way beyond anywhere else I have stayed. The rooms are wonderfully decorated with plenty of room (I had one overlooking the lagoon) with plenty of technology if you need a fix....but why would you? you're in Venice!   I would highly recommend a stay if you ever get a chance.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
