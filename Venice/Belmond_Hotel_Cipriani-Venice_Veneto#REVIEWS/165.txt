We stayed in a large room right beside the large pool overlooking the lagoon.  It doesn't get much better than that.  This room needs to be booked a year in advance if you want it during high season.  We had a large room service breakfast every day - lovely.  Wonderful maid service.  Great service all around.  In particular I loved the beauty salon.  The best hairdresser in the world in my opinion.  Wonderful grounds.  A fabulous experience to take the hotel shuttle boat to and from the main island every day and it was on time and frequent.  A fabulous place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Mar 27, 2018Dear  Jackson H,  I sincerely thank you, also on behalf of our staff, for the lovely comments you have shared concerning your stay with us.
