Although outragously expensive, this is a hotel that must be satyed in once in ones life-time. It is even better under the Belmond owhership whose hotels I rate world-wide. The service is superb with exacting eye for detail. The rooms are amazing with excellent facilities. The pool is first class. The food is good but not great, I think they should invest in a Michelin star chef to head up the kitchenRead moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Mar 3, 2015Thank you very much for your nice and helpful comments.
