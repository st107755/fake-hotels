This hotel is pricey but is by far the best hotel in venice. You are greeted at the airport by the cipriani boat and taken to the hotel where check in is effortless. The hotel itself is on its own island away from the main town which adds to the charm and exclusive feel to the place. The boat is available at any time to take guests over to st marks square. The rooms were spacious and elegant and service from the staff was very efficient. Also the restaurants were very good. amazing views over the lagoon watching the sunset with a glass of champagne was one of the highlights of our stay. Great place to relax and enjoy venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
