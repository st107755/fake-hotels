Just as others have said, a classy hotel with attentive staff.  It is perfect for staying in Venice as it is a five minute regular free boat ride to/from St Mark's Square, yet the hotel is on a quiet island away from the crowds. We were moved from our first room because of flooding - a move that was done quickly and courteously.  Both rooms were excellent, as was breakfast.  We did fine dining in the new "Or" Restaurant one evening. Hideously expensive food and drink, but worth it for the experience and the excellent food. Amazingly, the hotel bar had run out of peach juice, so no Bellini was available!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
