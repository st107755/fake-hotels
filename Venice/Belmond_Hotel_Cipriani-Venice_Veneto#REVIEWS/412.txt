From our moonlit arrival at the hotel by private motor boat to walk through the jasmine scented garden, to the room upgrade on arrival, we had exceptional but unobtrusive service throughout our 3 day stay and had the most perfect time at the Cipriani.  The room, with a view over the lagoon was plush and comfortable. The dining experience at the restaurant was truly world class and seemed effortless. The air conditioning quiet and effective, and really nice touches like the chocolate birthday cake and a gift of glass sweets on departure made us feel very special guests. Can't wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
