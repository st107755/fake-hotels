My husband and I stayed at this beautiful hotel as part of our 20th anniversary trip to Italy. Venice and this hotel are very pricey but the hotel is absolutely worth every penny. The grounds are fantastic and it is perfectly located with spectacular views across the lagoon into Venice. It is quiet and tranquil in an otherwise bustling place. The rooms are lovely, the bed so comfy and the service and food wonderful as well. We loved the boat ride they offered over to St. Mark's square. it was so convenient. If you visit Venice, do not hesitate to splurge on this place! It is wonderful!Read moreDate of stay: October 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jan 10, 2019Dear mhall1967,  First of all, happy new year and thank you very much for your wonderful review.
