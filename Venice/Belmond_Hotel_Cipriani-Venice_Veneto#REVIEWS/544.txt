My partner and I spent a wonderful weekend break here at Hotel Cipriani, If you want to escape from the real world, this is the right choice!  The Hotel is located a short complimentary ride across from San Marco square which allows you to transit back and forth as you please.  As to the facilities in this five star palace, I cannot fault them. Our room had a jaccuzzi; two televisions (one facing the bed, the other round the corner adjacent to the bar) and a huge balcony overlooking the pool.  The service staff are extremely professional, kind, and go out of their way to make all guests feel welcome! I cannot wait to return and it was worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
