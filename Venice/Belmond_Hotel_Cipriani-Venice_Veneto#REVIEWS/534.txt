This is not the cheapest hotel in Venice but it does offer some compensations mainly because of its location. It is situated about a ten minute boat ride from St Marks Square on an island that is not part of the tourist scene or even downtown Venice. The result is that you can escape from the madding crowds and you have the luxury of a swimming pool and terrace to sunbathe on when you just want to chill. The complimentary hotel boat shuttle means that you can still be in the thick of things in short time whenever you want. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.
