We loved. this place is totally magical. i read a comment somewhere, if you have money to burn, this is the place to burn it. the private charter went back and forth as promised every four mins. if you are a hotel snob, hit this place up at least once. a simple lunch room service will run $70, not worth it, but worth it when you are hungry. a stade group to say the least. The pool rocked.  I was a little taken back looking at a 4000 bill, they asked me if i would like to add a tip. no thanks.  awesome place . go there you will feel like a king and queen.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
