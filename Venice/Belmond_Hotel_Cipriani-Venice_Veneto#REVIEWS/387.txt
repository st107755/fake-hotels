We Stayed for our wedding anniversary in July 2015: transfer to and from airport was seamless, all arrangements for tours, restaurant bookings etc were first class, staff were accommodating in every way - service was precise and correct at all times, pool is a fantastic amenity, and only a short 10 min boat ride to St marks which runs constantly 24 hrs. Venice is expensive and this hotel is no exception but the facilities and service are such it is well worth it. Could not recommend it more highly.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
