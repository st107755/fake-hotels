My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights on our first trip to Venice for our honeymoon. It was one of the most memorable parts of our 3 weeks away. We loved the location away from the crazy summer crowds in July. Yet just a short private boat ride from St Marks Square.   Our room was spectacular - we were upgraded to a suite which was fanatic. Which meant we had a stunning separate living space with balcony, as well as the bedroom having its own balcony. The bathroom was huge and beautiful decorated, large wardrobes and space to unpack.
