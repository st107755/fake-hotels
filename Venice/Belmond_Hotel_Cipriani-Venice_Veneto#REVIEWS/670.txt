What a wonderful classy hotel.  My boyfriend and I were visiting a 4 different cities in Italy and this was our first stop.  Such great staff that was always so friendly and attentive.  We spent a lot of time at the pool bar so we got to know the bartenders pretty well, and everyone knew us by name.  The fact that I did not know a bit of Italian was not a problem, everyone spoke English very well.  The hotel also had their own water taxi that would bring you back and forth to St Marks Square, where they also had a "Hotel Cipriani private dock, so it was very easy to get back and forth. (about a 10 min boat ride that has spectacular views!)  The room was wonderful and had a few different wall plug types, so I did not even need to take out my European plug adaptor that I brought. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
