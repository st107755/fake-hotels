Stayed at the Cipriani over the weekend and we had a wonderful time. Hotel and staff were equally nice. Boat to and from main Venice island takes 5 or so minutes by hotel shuttle boat that runs every 15mins FOC.   Had dinner in Oro and that was nice, albeit pricey at Â£300 per guest for tasting mehu incl wine.Read moreDate of stay: November 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Nov 7, 2019Dear MissTerryShopa,  I would like to thank you for your lovely review and for taking the time to share your opinions.
