I have been going to The Cipriani for the last 12 years and my dad has been going for nearly 20. In our experiences it has been extremely good although expensive you get your money's worth there are many things to do for adults and children like a world class spa and salon and a kids club with lovely staff and great facilities. All the staff are amazing especially the manager is really nice and does a great job. I would just like to add it is the only hotel in Venice with a swimming pool. I absolutely love this hotel and love how there is something new every year. I have stayed in many rooms at the hotel and loved all I them. I would recommend this hotel to anyone with the money to afford itRead moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
