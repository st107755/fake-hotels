Just as you step off the Hotel boat that picks you up from the Airport, and brings you to the front door of this Fabulous Hotel. Cipriani is the most luxurious and still down to earth type setting, you will be amazed and thrilled at the same time. This stop of the Orient Express is memorable. The staff is delightful and makes one feel at home. The resturants ( 3) on the property is worth the time. This is where the film " The Tourest " was partially shot and we were there during the filming. Never got to shake Angelena of Johnny Depps hands ( too intrusive) but the crew and bodyguards were very nice. The front door man was the most delightful member of this extraordinary staff. All were the best. Experience this one and add this to " The Bucket list" Folks!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
