This was my 10th stay at the Cipriani last week and it just gets better every time i go  -  the most fantastic service of any hotel I've ever been too and I'm fortunate to go to a lot of high end hotels. The key stand out thing about the Cipriani is that you will never meet anywhere in the world a hotel which has the most professional, helpful, charming staff  -  all who have a real 'can do' attitude and all who want to make your stay as comfortable, fun and peaceful as possible.  It goes without saying I will continue to go back every year  -  many hotels claim to be the best  -  they never are  -  the Cipriani is... GO!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear  paul h,  I would like to thank you for your wonderful review and beautiful words concerning our property.
