We stayed here for a weekend having arrived in Venice on the Orient Express ! It was perfection from the Murano Glass chandeliers, the beautiful rooms, delicious food, exquisite views and the warm, friendly staff . Customer service was superb; nothing was too much trouble. We highly recommend The Cipriani for a very special occasion .Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
