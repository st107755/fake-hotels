Second trip to this exquisite jewel.  Totally worth the cost.  Excellent staff; superb accommodation; generous upgrade.  Could not have been any better.  Improves with age like the best wine. Take advantage of a day on the Shirley boat to explore the islands and the lagoon.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Guest,  I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
