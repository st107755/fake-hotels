Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in Sept 2004. Although a little old fashioned the hotel is beautifully set on a private island away from the hustle and bustle of venice. There is a private boat service which takes you to the piazza and the great bonus is that it is away from the busy taxi queues. Its free and leaves every 5minutes.  The hotel room was wonderful with 2 huge bathrooms and a jucuzzi. Also, the food is to die for. The main evening restaurant is a must and breakfast is a wonderful feast. The latter, which you can sit outside with a view of the water-just perfect. Food at the pool is great too.  The conceirge couldnt have been any more helpful if they tried. They told us the best restaurants- offered us private boat trips around venice and to neighbouring islands.â€¦Read moreHelpfulShare
