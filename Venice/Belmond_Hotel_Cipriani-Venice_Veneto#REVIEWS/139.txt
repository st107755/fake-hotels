Well I have to say not a good start as Belmond Orient Express didnâ€™t deliver our private water transfer as booked. So I may have given the hotel a slight mark down but the service and the staff are exceptional. The food also is amazing and everything about the hotel is great so I cannot give anything less than 5 stars and yes I would recommend and yes I would return. It is pricey as others have said but you get what you pay for. Love it and we still have another night here to be pampered before our trip back to London on the Orient Express and we are very privileged to be staying in the Venice Grand Suite too!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jun 15, 2018Dear Mr  Mike C,   First of all, thank you so much for staying with us both at our hotel in Venice and on our beautiful train!
