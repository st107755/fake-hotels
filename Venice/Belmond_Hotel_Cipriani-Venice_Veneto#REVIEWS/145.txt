Took my daughter as a “significant” birthday treat. What a jewel. We loved the Cipriani and it’s stunning gardens  and pool together with wonderful staff, beautiful accommodation and delicious food. We had a lagoon view with a balcony room which was superb.  ( A coffee machine would have been appreciated). Breakfast was delicious either on the waterside terrace or as room service. Poolside bar served the original Bellini made with freshly squeezed peach juice and Cips restaurant in the evening watching the sunset over Venice served delicious food. We loved the hustle and bustle of Venice but returning in the Cipriani motor launch into the tranquility and luxury of the hotel, with it’s views over Venice was truly exceptional.
