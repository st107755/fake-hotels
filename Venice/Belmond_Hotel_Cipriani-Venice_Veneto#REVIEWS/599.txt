I was many times in this Hotel, and everytime i feel wonderful. If you want to escape from the real world, this is the right choice! Imagine, you are in Venice, and still isolated from the crowd city, having a relaxing time, swimming in the pool and have a pleasant lunch... I recomand this magnificant place to everyone who wants to feel special, who loves luxury hotels and ones who want to feel the spirit in Venice from the other side.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
