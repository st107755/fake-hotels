The location, elegant interior design, remarkable landscape design, exquisite food served in the Restaurants, warmth of front desk service, efficiency and friendliness of all guest-contact staff and Management (GM Giampaolo Ottazzi), the gigantic pool and the lavish buffet breakfast are outstanding!  No wonder the Belmond Hotel Cipriani is internationally renowned and acclaimed!  The best 3 days (22-25 July) I've spent in a 5* Hotel for years!  THE place to be when staying in Venice!  A fantastic experience!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
