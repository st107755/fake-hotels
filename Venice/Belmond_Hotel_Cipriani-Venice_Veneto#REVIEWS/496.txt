I don't know how anyone could give less than 5 stars, a beautiful hotel inside and out, friendly, helpful staff. The rooms were enormous, the bed was huge (can you tell that I don't normally stay in places like this?!) it was very special, the breakfast was very, very nice and the restaurants in the hotel were lovely. We didn't have to wait long for our boat to and from the hotel to  St marks square. I felt very special and very happy, or was a truly special experience for my first time in Venice Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
