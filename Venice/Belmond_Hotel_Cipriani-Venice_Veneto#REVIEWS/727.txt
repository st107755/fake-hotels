Forget the crowds forget the hustle and bustle of St Mark's Square and the long wait to view churches and museums just book a table for lunch at Cipriani's and sample the best of Venice.  We have visited Venice many times but this was by far the best time we have spent in Venice.  First go to the private launch that takes you to the Island from St Marco Square then on arrival go to the lounge and order a champaign cocktail until its time for lunch and then  enjoy a memorable lunch in the Fortuny restaurant. A real  romatic lunch - the food is excellent the service first class and the memory will last for ever.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
