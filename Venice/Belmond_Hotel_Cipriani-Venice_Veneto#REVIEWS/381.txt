The Hotel Cipriani has it all...a postcard perfect location, beautiful rooms, pool, grounds and public spaces, and superb staff. A world of uninterrupted peace and quiet just a short boat-ride away from glorious Venice. If you are familiar with five-star properties around the world, think of Cipriani as a six-star. A few days here are wonderful but not enough!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
