Great hotel in a beautiful location, lovely rooms and friendly reception staff. The water taxi runs regularly so its  easy to get over to St Marks Square.  The Gardens are stunning and the spa is well run.  Breakfast served in your room at no additional charge is a great service,Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
