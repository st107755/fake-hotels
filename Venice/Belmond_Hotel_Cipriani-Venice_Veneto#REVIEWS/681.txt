Forget about anything else! Prepare you wallet and stay at the best hotel in Venice, possibly the best in the world. A marvelous, elegant property, with the most extraordinary hotel swimming pool, the Cipriani is in a class of its own: The room we stayed was a marvelous suite. The restaurants Cip and Fortuna offered some of the best meal we ever had. Breakfast is a feast. The service is efficient and informal, just impeccable. You ride a boat to the Piazza San Marco in 10 minutes, and we never had to wait for it. They have a great spa, with steaming bath and sauna. They have a tennis court... What else can we say?Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
