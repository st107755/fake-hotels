Wonderful hotel. Staff is great, food is great and it is beautiful. Its like having your own private island in Venice with a water taxi waiting for you at all times.  If you are younger than 70, skip the glass and lace tour.  Definitely eat at Caps and know that shorts are not allowed at Harry's bar.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
