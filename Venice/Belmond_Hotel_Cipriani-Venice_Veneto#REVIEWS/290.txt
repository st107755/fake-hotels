Living the dream! Arriving by private water taxi is super chic. 5 minutes from St Marks Sq so it's really easy to explore all the prime tourist attractions and then retire from the heat, noise and hustle and bustle when you want some down time.  Facilities: The swimming pool is simply a-mazing. Olympic sized, perfect temperature and great poolside bar for lunch and evening drinks. Shops discreet and lovely eg high quality bed linens, elegant lingerie.  Food: Breakfast by the lagoon is just perfect - lots of choice.
