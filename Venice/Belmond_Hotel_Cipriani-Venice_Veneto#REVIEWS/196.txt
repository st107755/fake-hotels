Spent 3 nights at the Aman,Venice before moving to Cipriani. The Cipriani hotel is old, dated and the conceirge is arrogant. I can hear children screaming from their room as I write this. It is a place for families with little kids - but the rest of us suffer. There are numerous restaurants but Oro is over priced and average. The big plus for this hotel is the pool and the every 15 minute shuttle boat to St Marks square. Read moreDate of stay: July 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
