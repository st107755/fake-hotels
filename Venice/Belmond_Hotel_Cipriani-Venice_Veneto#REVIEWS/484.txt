This hotel is considered to one of the ten best in the world and I would have to agree as far as location goes. It is on a island in the lagoon looking right onto Saint Marks. Piazza. The rooms are fabulous with the bathroom bigger than most hotel bedrooms. I never left the hotel all day but spent it around the Olympic size swimming pool be served champaign and wonderful food. The only diss appointment was not being able to eat in for dinner as the restaurants were booked days ahead. It is so good that one is inclined to forget that you are in one of the greatest sightseeing destinations in the world.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
