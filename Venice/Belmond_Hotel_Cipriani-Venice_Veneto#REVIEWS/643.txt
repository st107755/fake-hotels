We traveled on the Orient Express from Venice to Stockholm and this property is owned by that company and was our starting point for our train trip.  It was located across from St Marco's Square and had their own water taxi that shuttled guests back and forth for free - it is not located on the Venice "fish" islands so not convenient to local exploring.  The hotel was very posh, the service was excellent but the food was outrageously over-priced. Lunch for 4 with 1/2 liter of wine was $375 euros = $490.  Definitely for the rich and famous which I am not.  However, the entire experience of the Orient Express trip was a once-in-a-lifetime experience so would definitely do it again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
