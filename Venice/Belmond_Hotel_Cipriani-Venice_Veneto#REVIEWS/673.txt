Located on Giudecca across from St Marks but convenient with their 24 hour boat transfers to/from hotel to Piazza San Marco.  Housekeeping is attentive and comes twice daily.  Staff are friendly, attentive, first class. Hotel and property are clean and inviting. We went for my husbands birthday and were in a junior suite with a lagoon view. It was fabulous.  Only one draw back was in the bar by the pool one evening it seemed under staffed and were enthusiastic to seat us not as energetic on serving us but it seemed everyone was getting slow service and the one waiter was just overwhelmed as it was crowded. But entire stay was so wonderful it seemed that ocassion was a mere blip.    They have blow dryers (which I didn't see on the website) and Bulgari amenities in the bath. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
