My husband and I stayed at the Belmond Cipriani to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, and it will stay as a wonderful memory for ever. Everything with this hotel is amazing, from our arrival, to the breakfast in our suite, to the beautiful hotel itself, and not to mention the great service. Our stay was made extra special thanks to Irene and Andrea. The Gabbiano Bar with the legend Walter is something like out of a movie, and the boat ride from Piazza San Marco is beautiful at any time of the day. We also travelled with our little dog, Ice, who was treated like a royal prince. Thank you for making our anniversary perfect.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 17, 2019Dear arwen_coke,  First of all, I would like to thank you for staying at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani on the special occasion of your 10th wedding anniversary and also for taking the time to review your visit.
