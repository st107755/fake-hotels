The level of service at this beautiful hotel exceeded our expectations.  We had a beautiful room and amenities.  The peace and quiet on Giudecca was a wonderful respite from the chaos of St. Mark's Square.  We loved our dinner at Cip's.  Thanks to Concierge Tommaso for his expert help and the earlier help from Mr. Picci.  Breakfasts were delicious and the setting wonderful.  The grounds of the hotel were beautiful during this spring visit with wisteria in bloom. The shuttle boat to the St. Mark's area was an essential and welcome addition to the services provided.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jun 20, 2019Dear tg22wa,  Thank you for taking the time to write your review and for your beautiful words.
