Hotel is certainly 5 star with excellent service, we were located in a garden deluxe and we were not disappointed. Staff were very polite and helpful, breakfast was slightly expensive but again excellent in choice.  The only down side with our 2 day stay was in the bar, when we asked for a night cap of Baileys liquor we were advise the price was 38 euros for 2 which quite frankly was extreme when you consider you can get the same 2 drinks in St Marks square for 24 euros.   On the plus side the hotel provide a 24/ free luxury launch to St Marks.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
