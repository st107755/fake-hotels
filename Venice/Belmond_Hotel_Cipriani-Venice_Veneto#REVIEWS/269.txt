Great place if you are willing to pay 70 € por spaghetti. Breakfast also bad and staff inattentive. The fact that the hotel is on the island of Giudecca makes it cumbersome to move around and you need to rely on the most expensive taxis in the world. Definitively does not worth the average price of 1,400 €.Read moreDate of stay: September 20164 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 23, 2016Dear Dario R.I, I wish to thank you for your review based on your recent stay at our hotel.  I am very sorry to learn that we did not meet your expectations and I would like to clarify that our pasta dishes start from Euro 30 for one dish of spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil. 10% VAT to be added. Also, our complimentary mahogany shuttle boat is available 24h a day from our hotel to St. Mark’s place and vice versa and it only takes five minutes to cross the Giudecca canal. In this respect, I would like to inform you that It is one of our most appreciated services by our guests who enjoy our beautiful and comfortable boat. With my kind regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel CiprianiRead more
