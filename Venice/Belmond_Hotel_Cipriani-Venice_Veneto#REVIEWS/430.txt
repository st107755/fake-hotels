Amazing hotel...everyone is treated the same...like royalty..nothing is too much trouble...the bedrooms are so lavish and comfortable..breakfast was what ever you want it to be there was something for everyone and the head waiter and his staff looked after you as if you were staying at their home...all the staff are so proud of what they all contribute to your stay..the standard of training is second to non other hotels in the world could learn such a lot from here ... The swimming pool was ..well...something else such an endulgence. The gardens were so pretty and well balanced and last but not least the shuttle service too and Fromm St marks square was faultless.
