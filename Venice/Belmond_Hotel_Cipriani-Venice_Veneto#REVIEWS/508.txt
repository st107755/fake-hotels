We have just returned from a short stay at the Cipriani where we had a room with a balcony facing the gardens, so peaceful.  As you would expect from a hotel of this class, nothing was too much trouble & service was superb. The swimming pool (salt water) must be one of the best we have experienced, a delight to spend time in after a day exploring the streets & canals in the city. Travelling to & from the island by the hotel's complimentary river boat just added to the whole experience. The only disappointment was the meal on the final evening, there was a spectacular storm so we were slightly compromised in terms of travelling back to the main island, we were advised to eat at 'Cip's Club' by the concierge, the staff were great but the meal was mediocre & certainly not goodâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
