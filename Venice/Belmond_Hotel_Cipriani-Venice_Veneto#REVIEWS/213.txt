I've been for 2 days for business and happy that had a chance to stay in this hotel. Pool view with terrace and bell rang from the st Marco makes an amazing feeling in the mornings and evenings. Pool with the pictures-very original idea. All restaurants are great and high-leveled. Would be happy to stay there again:)Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
