After multiple visits to Venice at multiple hotels I am still drawn to th Cipriani.  There are a handful of resort hotels in cities and this is at the top of the list.   Great staff and food.  (Room service was a little disappointing)   Delicious breakfast. Good enough fitness center. It's a good idea to book Spa appointments before you arrive as time slots book up fast.    And be very specific about your room choice and don't hesitate to see Andre before you settle on one. Junior suites overlooking the garden are lovely as are third floor room overlooking the lagoon over the restaurant.   But stay here for sure!
