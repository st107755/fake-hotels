This is a tough hotel to rate. I rarely give as poor a review as this one but at a price of 1,235 Euro at the low-end room rate, this is a "Poor" hotel and I don't mean poor in terms of lack of money. The rooms are all different but our suite was dated and reminded me of Ceasars palace in Las Vegas twenty years ago. The food was great. Most staff were very very nice but a few, as is always the case, snooty. The "High Speed" internet was non -existent in the rooms for all intents and purposes. The spa taff were great but the spa is underwhelming. Average gym equipment. In summary, this isn't a bad place to stay but not worth the money by any justification especially if you rate it primarily on the rooms.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
