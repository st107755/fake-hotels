I loved the hotel, and one of the highlights was Antonio, the tennis pro.  He is an excellent pro, nice, personable and responsible.  I didn't have a racket or balls, and he supplied both.  I highly recommend him.  And the red clay court is great.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, Direttore at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 13, 2019Dear WheelingBob7,  Thank you for the beautiful comments you shared about your experience at Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
