I spent three lovely days At Cipriani this Spring and loved every moment of it. Venice is exquisite in May as are the gardens and landscaping of this historic palace. My suite had old world charm and the service was true "old guard" Italian! i loved every second of this stay and the three minute water taxi ride to St. Marks Square was never a bore watching the myraid of boats and cruise ships coming and going.. The Cipriani is a respite in Venice from the crowds and noise. It was wonderful to sit on my patio having coffee in the mrining overlooking the gardens and Grand Canal of Venice.  The service staff are extremely professional, kind, and go out of their way to make all guests feel welcome! I cannot wait to return and it was worth every penny...Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
