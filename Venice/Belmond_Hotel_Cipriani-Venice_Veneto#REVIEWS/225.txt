it is a lovely hotel away from St Marks square. The hotel water taxi as its own stand rigth at the square and is very frequent at every 8 minutes staff and service excellent and well looked after if you continue the journey to Venice Simplon orient express  Rooms were on the smaller side beside the hefty price- we had a bay/canal view ,so could hear the sound of the boats in teh early morning/night -not good if you are a ligh sleeper! Bathroom much too small for me and right next to the bed!. Loved the breakfast in room serviceRead moreDate of stay: April 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
