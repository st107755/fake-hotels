I have had the pleasure of travelling to over 55 countries, staying in many great hotels. If I had to pick the one that tops them all, this is it. The hotel is unforgettable, but more importantly even, so are the people that work here...and that makes a truly great hotel... If only one night in your life, try to splurge here...(and if you have kids, bring them! They are so welcome, which was so nice to see...my daughter still talks about it)Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
