If you can treat yourself to staying here, you will never regret it. Brilliant position on Giudecca Island overlooking the lagoon with reliable shuttle service to Venice so you can see the beauty of Venice and escape the crowds at the same time. I appreciate the old world graciousness of their staff and the refined style of the hotel, their gardens and their various restaurants and bars. My room was stunning with a terrace overlooking the lagoon and itâ€™s marble bathroom elegant.
