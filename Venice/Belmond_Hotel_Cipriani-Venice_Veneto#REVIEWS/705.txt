Don't get me wrong, the hotel is beautiful and I am delighted I stayed here but the cost of it (as with a lot of Venice) was eye watering! 13 euros for a lemonata!! If you've paid for breakfast, that is when to fill yourself up as buffet and a la carte is all included in the price. Watch the price of the mini bar in the room.....! Food is exceptionally good quality. Service was patchy....water taxi is a complete rip off. If you can face it, take one from St Marks Square if you don't mind taking the courtesy shuttle boat with your luggage as then it is half the price (apparently). Ask for a refurbished room....Read moreDate of stay: May 20121 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
