This hotel is just what you want from a five star plus hotel. It has the very best service but is not pretentious. It clearly knows it is right up there as one of the best in Venice and the World but it is not arrogant. The staff are friendly at the same time as being very efficient and attentive. The location is magical with a view over to St Mark's Square and the beautiful St Giorgio Maggiore. It is truly a romantic jewel in the romantic setting of the Venice Lagoon. Taking their speed boat from their private pier just on the edge of St Mark's Square to the private pier at the hotel itself makes one feel like a film star. It is not cheap but it is good value and you cannot say that about all top hotels.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
