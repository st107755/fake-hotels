Venise is one of my favorite place on the planet. If you go there in summer the best place to stay is Cipriani  for 2 main reasons one is you can  profit from the almost olympic swimming pool and secondly when you have enough of the crowd you take the hotel riva and you go back on the Cipriani island.
