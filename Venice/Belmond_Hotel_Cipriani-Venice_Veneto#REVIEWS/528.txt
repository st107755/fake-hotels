Situated literally next to the Cipriani hotel on Giudecca the Belmond actually allows you a better view of Venice at a fraction of the price. Having stayed at the Cipriani which is gorgeous i can honestly say the room we stayed in is as nice as some of the ones in the Cipriani - maybe less grand but equally as stylish and with MUCH BETTER VIEWS! Our room was directly opposite St Marks Square. We had a hotel shuttle water taxi to take us across. The service at the reception was excellent. Breakfasts were fantastic - sitting outside in a beautiful garden. I would recommend room 111 - its fabulous!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
