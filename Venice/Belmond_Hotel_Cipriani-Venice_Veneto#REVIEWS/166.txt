Love this hotel!  Everything about this resort is perfect for Venice, you have a peaceful setting away from the crowds, gorgeous grounds, impeccable service, and old world charm.  We had a beautiful suite which looked over the canal to St. Marks bell tower-gorgeous.  The five minute boat ride actually adds to the experience and is not an inconvenience at all.  The pool is delightful and feels old world but in a good way.  The staff are fantastic and everyone jumps into make sure that every need is covered.  I highly recommend this classic, it deserves all of the accolades it receives.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Mar 27, 2018Dear tomjoefred,  Thank you so much for your lovely review and taking the time to share it with our TripAdvisor readers.
