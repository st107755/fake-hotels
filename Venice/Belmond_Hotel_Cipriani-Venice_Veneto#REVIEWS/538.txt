We stayed here for two nights as part of the Orient Express trip and loved the position of the hotel, along with the garden suite with terrace.  The hotel is truly sumptuous with lovely views and facilities.  All the staff were extremely helpful.  One small point is that we were half way through our cold buffet breakfast when we were asked if we wanted eggs!  We had no idea that a hot alternative was on offer as everything ws set up for the continental style.  The next morning we were brought a menu, but not on the first morning, so I think this needs to be addressed.  Other than this small issue you cannot fault this hotel - truly beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
