The Cipriani is legendary for many good reasons. Away from the hustle and bustle yet so close (<10 minutes) to San Marco. Service is attentive and friendly. The facilities are exceptional, with a  50M pool and a lovely clay court. Special mention for tennis pro Antonio di Benedetti. A great player and coach, and now a friend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jun 10, 2019Dear Panarea10,  Thank you for taking the time to write your review and for your beautiful comments.
