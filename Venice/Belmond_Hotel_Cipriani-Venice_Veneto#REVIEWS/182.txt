An excellent hotel. Our room with balcony and view to the lagoon was comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side with no bath and just one sink. At this sort of price I would normally expect somewhat more but overall the room was fine. Service is excellent whether at Cip's restaurant (which we enjoyed) at breakfast (very good) or in the bar (very pleasant). We also appreciated the location, minutes from San Marco via the excellent hotel launch service, but far way from the madding crowd... Recommend unreservedly!Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
