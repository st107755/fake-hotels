It is absolutely a grand feeling stepping of the water taxi on the private pier and grounds from the Cipriani. An extremely warm welcome by all the personal you are passing on your way to the reception desk. Rich flower arrangements everywhere you look. Spacious rooms with absolutely everything you need or even can think of. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the waters. Grand pool with salt water. Private transportation to st. Marcoâ€™s square by water-boat. Need to say more?
