We came back for a second time in a year for this phenomenal property with a great supporting cast.  All the staff from front/concierge, to housekeeping,to pool and breakfast and shuttle boat were personable, helpful,caring and efficient. The property is gorgeous and well layed out. Our room was lovely and in tip top condition. Any request was met. My favorite hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jun 1, 2018Dear  Vistrav88,  Thank you so much for your wonderful review and taking the time to share it with our TripAdvisor readers.
