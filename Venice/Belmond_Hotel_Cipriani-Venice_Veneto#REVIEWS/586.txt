This is my favourite hotel ever.  It's absolutely wonderful.  I love Venice, have been 3 times now.  Twice we have stayed at the Cipriani.   It's just the most incredibly luxurious hotel BUT it also feels welcoming at the same time.  The staff are incredibly helpful and cannot do enough for you.   The pool outside is amazing.  The hotel restaurants are great, we were lucky enough to eat in all of them.  The feeling in the back of their boat from the transfer to/from St Mark's Square cannot be replicated - you feel like you are on the top of the world.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 4, 2013Dear Guests,  I really appreciate your comments regarding your second stay with us at the Hotel Cipriani.
