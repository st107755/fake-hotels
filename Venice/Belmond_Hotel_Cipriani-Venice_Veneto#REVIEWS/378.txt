Yes, it is insanely pricey. There. said it. What you get in return is a wonderful welcome back from EVERYONE, who all remember your name from the last visit. You also get stunning views, the world's best chocolate gelato, the boat ride back and forth to St Mark's, the peacefulness of being able to get away from the crowds, and of course the fantastic swimming pool. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a room with a view of the Giudecca canal, Santa Maria della Salute, and St Marks. It was our very own moving postcard.
