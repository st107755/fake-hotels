This is a great hotel on an island just opposite the main island on which most often Venice is situated. If you like the 1950's styling this will be perfect for you. The main fine dining restaurant is magnificent, was a real highlight. Personally for me this is a hotel best enjoyed in the summer, as even with a heated outdoor pool you just feel it would be so much more appealing on a hot summers day.
