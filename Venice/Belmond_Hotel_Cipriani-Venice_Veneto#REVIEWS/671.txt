We very much enjoyed the Cipriani.  The hotel is beautiful, the staff is very welcoming, and room was comfortable.  We also enjoyed Fortuny Restaurant for dinner.  The water shuttle was very convienent and it was nice having our home base away from the crowds.  The Cipriani is very pricey, but I will return when back in Venice.
