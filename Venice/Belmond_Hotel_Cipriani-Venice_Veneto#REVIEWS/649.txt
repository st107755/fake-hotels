I love this place because it's not terribly grand - in fact, rather dated and dowdy with vacant unused spaces that they don't seem to know how to fill. But it's away from everything else in Venice and so worth its weight in gold. The restaurant is a joy - simple cooking where you can find something as basic as a pea soup or fish baked in salt. It's not at all pretentious and I felt relaxed here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Apr 4, 2013Dear Guest, I appreciate very much your comments regarding your recent stay at the Cipriani.
