Second time at Cipriani this time for long weekend with the kids (13 & 10)  whilst some of the rooms are a little basic the overall experience is fantastic  wonderful dinners at Cips over looking the lagoon, impeccable service and beautiful late afternoons by the excellent pool  Cipriani is such a great counter to the hustle and bustle in the main part of Venice that its lovely after a day of sights, arts and food to arrive at the Cipriani dock nr St Marks to disappear on the boat to your own tranquility and air at this classy placeRead moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
