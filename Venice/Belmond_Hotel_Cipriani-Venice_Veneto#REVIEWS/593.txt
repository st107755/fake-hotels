Recently stayed 5 nights at the Cipriani in Venice.  We were so warmly welcomed and coddled the entire time.  We stayed in a suite with two full bathrooms overlooking the quiet garden.  After spending all day on the water, the tranquility of our garden was a welcome respite.   We also enjoyed the percieved exclusivity of the location.  We like being across the canal from the tourist hordes.  The hotel appears elusive, but anyone is welcome for drinks or a meal.   This is now on my list of top three hotels in the world.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
