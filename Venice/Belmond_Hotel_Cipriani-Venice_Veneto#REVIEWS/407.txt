Just returned from a truly fabulous few days at this beautiful property. We were so very well looked after and had an unforgettable stay - arriving by beautiful private boat, the welcome from Roberto, our amazing suite with its own garden, all the beautiful hotel gardens, the pool, restaurants and my favourite ever breakfast location. The location is perfect, ideally away from the hustle of Venice and allowing for wonderful views, especially from the hotel's boat, loved it all! Cannot wait to return!
