Luxury  and pricey hotel , but worth every  penny : staff wonderful, helpful and efficient, rooms are very comfortable, breakfast excellent. location: if you want to be in the hubbub of the crowded center of the ville, this is NOT the place for you, but if you value your peace and quiet after the noise, THIS IS YOUR PERFECT place: the few minutes transfer by the boat  to the St Mark Square is at your service at any time. looking forward to return there!
