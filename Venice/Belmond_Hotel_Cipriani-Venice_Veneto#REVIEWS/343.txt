Booked in conjunction with a journey on The Orient Express, VSOE, to London, the sojourn at "the Cip" was magnificent !! Not enough stars to reflect the opulence of the site, and impeccable service.  Transit to the Venice Gare Central via the Cipriani's private motor launch was an added bonus.  Truly worthy of inclusion on your "Bucket List"Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
