We have recently returned home following a fantastic stay at the Cipriani in Venice.  This was our second visit there and once again we had a wonderful experience.  We had a junior suite with a lagoon view which comprised a very spacious and beautifully furnished open-plan bedroom/living area, a wonderful marble bathroom with enormous bath and roomy terrace with loungers and outdoor chairs and table. We ate in both the Cips Club and Fortuny restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed both experiences.  The Cips Club was particularly fun with very friendly staff and an impressive (and good value) wine list.  The Fortuny Restaurant achieved the perfect atmosphere superb food in a setting of relaxed formality. One thing in particular that has made both our stays in this hotel so memorableâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
