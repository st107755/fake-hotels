Stayed here for two nights before embarking a cruise. We organised a private transfer from the airport which is the ONLY way to arrive at this hotel. We were greeted by a very happy and smiley head concierge and then swiftly escorted to the reception. Again we were greeted exceptionally well by all front desk staff and then shown to our junior suite (22) on the ground floor with private terrace, a beautifully furnished room, our only negative would be the lack of a lagoon view.  Best breakfast ever. We will be backRead moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
