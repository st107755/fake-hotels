A great escape from the marauding hordes of tourists in Venice. We selected this hotel given it's outstanding pool and the fact that it's a water taxi ride to the main Island. Overall the service was very good, despite it being a painful process to get pool service. One real disappointment was that outside of the pasta everything on the menu at the various locations at the hotel was quite mediocre. However net net a good experience particularly if you want relief from the July tourist masses.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
