Top notch. Enjoy a 2 hour breakfast on the side of the water. The heated Olympic size pool, the gardens, the service, bar ...everything. Our room had a beautiful private garden off it that was fantastic as was the room itself. The complementary boats owned by the hotel drop you over to St. Marco Sq in about 4 min. Top class location.
