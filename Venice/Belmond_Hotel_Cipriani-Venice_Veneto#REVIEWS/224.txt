Wanted to give our boys a special Easter meal as we were far away from our family that day. It was recommended by a friend who had stayed at  Cipriani to try Cip's Restaurant. Very happy we did. The hotel's staff was most gracious upon our arrival. Led us out to their beautiful gardens as we waited for our reservations. Our boys were captivated by the well cared for free roaming rabbit and ducks. The restaurant itself was outside under a tent along the stunning water front due to beautiful weather that day. Our table was just lovely as was the service and the food. We were also happily surprised by an enormous (& far too lovely to eat) Easter chocolate egg with a toy inside for the boys to break and devour. This experience put smiles on all of our faces for the rest of the day. Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
