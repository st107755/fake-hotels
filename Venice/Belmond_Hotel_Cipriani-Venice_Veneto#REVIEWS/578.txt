We stayed here as a start of our Orient Express holiday - the room had a garden view and his and hers bathrooms - fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were friendly and welcoming. One of the best items was the exclusive boat shuttle to St Marks Sq. which picks you up from the hotel in avery stylish boat, and when you are ready to return, you just pick up the phone by the waters edge at St Marks Sq and the boat is there in a couple of minutes. A great start to a great holiday.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 11, 2013Dear Guest,  I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at our Hotel Cipriani.
