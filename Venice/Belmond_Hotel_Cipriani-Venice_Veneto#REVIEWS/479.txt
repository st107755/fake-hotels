Truly magical a place where you can visit Venice in the morning then return to pool and the gardens in the afternoon and feel a world away!  It says it all when tourists want to come and see the hotel but can't stay and yet brag they have seen it.  From when you walk in the door to leaving service is 5 star plus.  We are already looking at other hotels in the Belmond Group.  THANK YOU.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
