Outstanding in every way. This is a lesson in how to do it. The best in the world is expensive...unfortunately !! Save up, remortgage, do whatever you can....just get there. The Cipriani has been at the top of its game for a long time and deserves its place as one of the best in the world. Of course, the setting helps but arrogance doesn't play a part here. You don't have to be George Clooney or Audrey Hepburn.....everyone is made to feel special.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Apr 30, 2018Dear  Jules P,  I thank you very much for your very gratifying comments on our property.
