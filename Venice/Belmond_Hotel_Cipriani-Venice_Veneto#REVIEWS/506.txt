We stayed frequently at the Cipriani between 1995/2006 , but felt that it was resting on its laurels and so went elsewhere . This was our first stay since then and the hotel is definitely back on form. We were upgraded to a suite in the Palazzo Vendramin which we loved and the views towards St Marco are breathtaking .The long overdue renovation of the restaurant , renamed as Oro , is a great success and we had an excellent dinner with very charming but professional service . The charming bar staff deserve particular mention and we're looking forward to seeing them again soon !Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
