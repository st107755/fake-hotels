A wonderful 2 days at the Belmond. It was perfect with children as there is an amazing salt water pool and sunbathing area. The restaurant overlooks the water and is a peaceful oasis from the hub bub of Venice. The shuttle travels every few minutes and is a lovely excuse to take a boat ride. The staff were amazing and very attentive. We took 2 inter-connecting rooms overlooking the water. It was all perfect and everything we expected Venice to be. A lovely combination of sight seeing and relaxing.
