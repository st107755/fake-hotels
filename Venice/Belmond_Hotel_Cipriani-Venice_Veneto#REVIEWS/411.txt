Lovely hotel, a little bit away from Venice center, beautiful rooms - absolutely loved the room and the decoration, very good service, maybe too pricey for the location..... every 115 min free boat shuttle service to the center excellent food both for breakfast and dinner but slightly aggressive doves for breakfast and very very aggressive mosquitoes at the dinner at the waterRead moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
