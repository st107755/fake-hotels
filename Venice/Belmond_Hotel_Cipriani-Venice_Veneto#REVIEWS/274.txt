From the moment you  arrive until the moment you leave you will feel the magic of this enchanting hotel.  The location is unique;  close but not in the tourist husstle of Venice. The views, the gardens, the pool, the room and the  food were excellent.  But most important, the people and the attention to detail, the smiles, fresh flowers in your room every day and being called by your name made the difference during our stay.  The property is breathtaking and inmacualte.   Definitely a place To come back to.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
