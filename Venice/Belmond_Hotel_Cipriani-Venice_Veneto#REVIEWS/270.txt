We just loved it from the moment we  stepped off the water taxi until we left.  The hotel is immaculate and the staff are pleasant and friendly. Nothing was too much bother.  Roberto the concierge had some really helpful tips as it was our first stay in Venice.   We had a garden view room that was very large with a separate living area and a terrace.  The hotel is situated straight across from St Marks square and has its on complimentary water taxi that is free of charge 24/7.  We will be back........Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
