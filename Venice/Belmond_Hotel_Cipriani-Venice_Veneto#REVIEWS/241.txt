I still love to go to this place, this time with my granddaughter Olivia who just turned ten years old ! Children are very welcome in the Cipriani and well taken care of ! We have a Suite and Olivia sleeps in our living room it works out fine ! I think the new manager knows of the weaknesses of the different restaurants ! Cips is exellent also with children ! The food in the bar could be much better and Oro has to change ! Why did they bring an american decorator , we have so many good ones in Europe ! The food is too elaborate, it should be simple but exellent. We did not find one single thing on the menu for Olivia so we went back to Cips.The service is exellent it carries the whole Hotel and the new Manager is seen everwhere I like that !Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
