I am happiest when I am on the water, so Venice is my kind of town and I was in my element the two or four times we would hop on the hotel's private water taxi to cross the Guidecca Canal straight out from San Marco. The Hotel Cipriani is simply the best.  I've also stayed at the Danieli and can now confidently say "Danieli, you have been bested!".  I doubt the Cip could have been much better in an aspect.  I could go into detail, but it would be a very boring review with so many superlatives. Biggest surprise:  You can use the pool 24 hours!  Midnight swim, anyone?Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
