My wife and I stayed at the Cipriani for four nights this October for our 25th wedding anniversary. When we arrived, several of the staff (including the head concierge on a water bike!) were waiting at the dock to greet us. The service was unequaled. Without exception, everyone was warm, friendly, kind and competent. The hotel itself is beautiful and, although secluded, only five minutes from St. Mark's by private launch. Our room was spacious, tastefully decorated and immaculate. The food was outstanding. My wife and I have stayed at many historic hotels and this outdoes them all.
