The most amazing hotel, the staff were so friendly and the rooms were perfect, but my only disappointment was the food.  The breakfast was good, but the restaurant by the pool was very expensive and very average, both days we ate there the food was very disappointing.  Also the restaurant The Cip which looks out onto Venice was also extremely average.  Food in Venice was much better and also better priced. From such a expensive and well known hotel I did expect much better food - the price was no surprise but the low standard of food was.  So go and stay but eat out.Read moreDate of stay: August 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
