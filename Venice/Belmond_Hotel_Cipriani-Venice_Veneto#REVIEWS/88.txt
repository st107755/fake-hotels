Everyone knows you canâ€™t go wrong with a Belmond property and Hotel Cipriani is no exception.  A must do on everyones wish-list. We visited for some lunch by the poolside, it was such a lovely afternoon.  From lush landscaped gardens through to hidden alcoves the grounds are vast, the hotel feels very private, almost like a private members club. Understated elegance is reflected in the decor, hand picked boutiques glitter along the marble walk way. The restaurants and bars have an intimate feel and the service is attentive but not obtrusive.  It is real agony to have to drag yourself away from such a place.  We look forward to visiting again very soon.
