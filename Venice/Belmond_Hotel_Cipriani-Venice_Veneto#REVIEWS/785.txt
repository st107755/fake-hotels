We had been recommended to go to the pool side restaurant and have the buffet.  29 Euros each but the food was delicious and a lovely setting. We took a good 2 hours over our lunch and felt totally unhurried. Very nice, discreet staff.  I would avoid the other restaurants in the hotel as they are very expensive but I felt this was good value (for Venice!). You catch the complimentary boat from S.Marco over to the hotel. We spent an hour in the gardens before hand - beautifully scented buy jasmine everywhere.  A lovely half dayRead moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
