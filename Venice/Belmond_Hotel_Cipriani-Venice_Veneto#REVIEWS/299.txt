We stayed at the Belmond Cipriani for 3 nights and 4 days. This is by far the best stay we had in Venice. The hotel is beyond 5 stars with outstanding and discrete service, stunning yet comfortable and welcoming amenities (great pool, wonderful gardens, equipped gym...) and a staff that makes you feel at home. Their 3 restaurants are amazing. Elegance, refinement and peace in this "resort" charged with history.  Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
