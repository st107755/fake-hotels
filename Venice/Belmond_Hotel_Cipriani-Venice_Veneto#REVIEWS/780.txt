There's something more than a little dated about the Cipriani - whether it's the 70's style of the bedrooms and open spaces, or the other guests....However that's not necessarily a bad thing. The quality and attention to detail are high, but without the stuffiness or self-consciousness you can get at high-design hotels.  The gardens, private launch, fabulous swimming pool and lagoon side breakfasts all make it worth it.  But don't bother with the Fortuny restaurant: rather boring, overpriced and old-fashioned.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
