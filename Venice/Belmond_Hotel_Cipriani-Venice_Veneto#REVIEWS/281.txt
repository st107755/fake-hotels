We stayed for one day after a cruise. The hotel is very quiet set on a small island with amazing gardens and a large swimming pool. Expect to pay in excess of $1,000 a night, but this is a truly world class hotel and so the price is appropriate. We got a free upgrade to a suite which was amazing. The staff are all extremely friendly and our 7 year old son was given free toys and gifts and made to feel right at home. The free water taxi to St Marks means that the hotel is very convenient for Venice without being overrun with tourists. Ideal for the discerning traveller with an eye for quality.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
