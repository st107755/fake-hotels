Yes i will say the overall Cipriani Hotel experience was amazing as its not something one will do twice, if they cant afford it, in their lifetime. So, Its for this reason i personally was a little dissappointed on a number of things during our 5 day stay within my room perse - for instance clothes storage was ridiculously small and we had a suite in the Palazzo Vendramin and yes the staff arranged a mobile clothes rack when asked but this could only fit in my lounge room, thus made my visual experience a little "downgraded"(reminded me of my uni years). the scuffed parquet flooring could have done with a polish(something it seemed to lack for probably 2 years) light switches were hit and miss as you never knew how to turn lights on and off, water jugs didnt work - no coffeeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
