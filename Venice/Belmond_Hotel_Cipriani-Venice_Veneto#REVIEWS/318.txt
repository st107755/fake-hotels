We visited here for 3 nights in May 2016 after being recommended to go there by our travel agent.  We were not disappointed.  The hotel is set on an island and you reach it by private launch where you are given the warmest of arrivals.  The suite we had was superb with a balcony overlooking the lagoon.  We only had breakfast each day which was served on the terrace by some of the best staff we have ever come across.  Nothing was a bother and the food was superb.  The gardens are lovely and the pool is a lovely oasis of calm after a tour of Venice.  It is expensive and to be fair worth every penny.  Well recommended.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
