The Cipriani was all we thought it would be and more.  Beautiful and relaxing surroundings.  Excellent food and service.  You feel that you are in a spa all the time. Great to have the water taxi available to go back and forth to St. Mark's Square.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 21, 2019 Dear mariamartinez7000,  Fist of all, I would like to thank you very much for staying with us.
