A very nice location Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable stay. The room was fabulous and the rest of the hotel and grounds were fantastic. The location is amazing not so far from the center of the city. Plus, there was a regular boat taxi which added to the experience. The only disappointment was the service level in the restaurant. On the one night we stayed in for dinner, it was very slow, and it was difficult to find a waiter to make a request. This was despite the fact only half the tables were being used. However, the food was good.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 15, 2019 Dear lanfeldding,  I would like to thank you very much for staying with us and also for your beautiful review.
