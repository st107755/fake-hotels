I could extol the virtues of this hotel from the gorgeous room to the divine poolside bar and the fabulous Walter, the perfect pool, the delicious Cip's Club, Giudecca 10 and breakfast service on the terrace but it was the attentive 'friends' who welcomed us and cossetted us and transformed this hotel from a merely beautiful place to a perfect Venetian 'home'.  Venice has been forevermore transformed by our time at The Cipriani - this will be our Venetian 'home' forevermore.  Should you find an opportunity to visit The Cipriani, a day on the private launch (Shirley boat with the fabulous Fabbio at the helm) is an absolute must as arranged by Roberto.  This hotel is built on the foundation of charming and perfect professionals.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 7, 2019Dear Pricecd,  First of all, I would like to thank you very much for taking the time to write your beautiful review concerning your stay at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
