Arrived in Venice on the Orient Express from London and stayed for two nights at the Hotel Cipriani. The train and hotel are beautiful and the standard of service from start to finish was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel is an oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of Venice, but the boat service between the hotel and St Marks square ensures you are never far away from the attractions of Venice. Breakfast is superb, food at the pool bar is excellent and our room excellent. Having experienced the Cipriani I don't think I could stay anywhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
