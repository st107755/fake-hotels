We stayed as part of a package after a trip on the Orient Express and therefore had a much lower rate for our stay.   This made it excellent value.  The rooms, the location and the staff were all very good.  The breakfast was aslo very good.    The only slight downer is that the food in the cips Club is good but not as good a standard as I would expect for the price compared to other restaurants in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
