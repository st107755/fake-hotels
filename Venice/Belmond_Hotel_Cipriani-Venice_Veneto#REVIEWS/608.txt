loved the hotel and the service provided by the hotel.  I stayed here for 2nights and they were not enough to enjoy the most romantic city in the world!  Enjoy the major boutiques by walking distance from the hotel as well as the amazing italian restaurants in Venice!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
