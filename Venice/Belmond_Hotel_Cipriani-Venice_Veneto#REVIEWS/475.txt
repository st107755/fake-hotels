we went there for 3 nights before our wedding in lake como to relax ahead of time. easily, the best hotel I've stayed at in the world. we booked a premium room and were upgraded to something some memorable that can't be duplicated w a spectacular view of the grand canal. one morning we woke up to opera singers serenading us below our window. barbara in guest relations became an instant friend.  crossing the grand canal on the hotel taxi boat and being able to call for it on the other side is a terrific touch and very functional. i ordered room service from the phone i used on the other side of the canal to call for the boat and had chicken fingers and chocolate ice cream waiting in the room upon arrival. decadence. #feellikeakingRead moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
