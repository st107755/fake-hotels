Noting really compares to Europe if you want an old school romantic break, but nothing could be more sophisticated and elegant than the Cipriani. Of course it is aware of its own status but the staff were all perfectly helpful and accommodating -  it avoids that overt air of superiority that many hotels in this calibre can suffer from.   No job was too big or small for the concierge and we were perfectly at home in our very large and spacious lagoon facing suite. I must also stress how wonderful the location is when you consider the mayhem that unfolds in St Marks Square. It is most relaxing to return to the pier and float away on the HMS cipriani as the bright lights and noise fade away.   A beautiful hotel and a timeless experience one will remember for many years to come.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
