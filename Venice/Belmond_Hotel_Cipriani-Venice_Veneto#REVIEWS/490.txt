Beautiful hotel with first class service. We had a room by the pool which came with reserved sun loungers. It was wonderful to exhaust oneself in Venice knowing that you were only a boat ride away from collapsing by the wonderful pool. No sun bed bagging at dawn here!!! This hotel is evocative of its era and is a contrast to the usual Venetian grand hotels. Staying there felt like two holidays in one, a city break with a seaside resort. Unique. It is very expensive but well worth it. I loved the boat transfer to and from St Marks square. I wanted to sit outside one evening for coffee and they even brought me a freshly laundered pashmina to wear so that I wouldn't have to exhaust myself by going back to my room to get my own!!! Can't wait to returnRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
