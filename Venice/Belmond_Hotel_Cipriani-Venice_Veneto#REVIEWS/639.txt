Delightful friendly/ welcoming hotel. Room 73 with huge terrace and lounge which we didn't need to use because gardens and pool were so inviting. Food good especially breakfast. Try small donuts with custard filling, so yummy for a treat. We both enjoyed this 4 night stay very much, celebrating our 38th wedding anniversary. The staff are so friendly and really make you feel at home. Our favourite food was at ristorante quadri st Marco sq, upstairs. We will defiantly return within the next year to stay in this unique hotel. Thank you all for making our stay so very special! X  P.s do visit Murano glass Center, outstanding.
