Visited for a special 60th birthday meal on Tuesday 28th of October in the Oro. We had the tasting menu and wine flight. Each dish and wine was enthusiastically explained to us by a young vibrant team without being overbearing or pretentious. Carlo Tofani was very attentive and offered to add an extra course that I was interested in. Each course was well cooked and presented. The outstanding dish was the veal tortellini dusted with cocoa in a cheese sauce. I hope the Michelin inspectors give it justice when they are awarding their stars this month. The next time we are in Venice we will definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
