I felt so lucky to spend a night at the Cipriani and from the initial welcome Michael gave us, to Barbara congratulating me on my birthday the next day it was perfect. It was only one night but we would love to go back again. The staff, location and service superb. Thank you for also organising our meal at the Cip Club and such a fantastic view whilst having dinner. I will recommend a stay to anyone - we will start saving again ourselves too!
