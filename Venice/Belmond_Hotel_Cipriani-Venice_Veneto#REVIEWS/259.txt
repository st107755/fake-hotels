We stayed for 3 days on the first leg of our Belmond Grand Tour(staying in 3 Belmond properties). It is an older hotel loaded with history and old world glamour with traditional decor. We had a deluxe junior suite with a balcony overlooking the water. Breakfast was served each morning with the option so sitting in or outside. Fitness center was never busy. Venice is a jewel and staying at Cipriani makes it even more special. A hotel shuttle easily takes you back and forth from the hotel into St Mark's Square. Agree with other reviewer, no need to use hotel service for transport to and from airport/train station. We used Venicewatertaxi and all was seamless. October has been a wonderful time to see Italy with less crowds and cooler weather.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
