I was skeptic at not being more close to the points if interest,  but not only was the water taxi rides nice, it was a relief  to get away from the crowds,  but it was a special experience to edit for the boat coming to and from the Cip.  The hotel arranged  all our dinners and they were always on par to our expectations.  Our only disappointment was that we were upgraded our first night and although our room was nice the standard  we stayed in the remaining time was far better.  All in all the staff was great, the restaurants good and the old world atmosphere fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
