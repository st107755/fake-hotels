We were nervous about staying on a little island a very short boat ride away from the main part of Venice, but in retrospect (and when we were there) we were very glad we did. Venice is fun (and we usually like to be in the center of it all), but this is one town where it pays to be just a bit outside the mess. The hotel is stunning. And the boat ride is quick and pretty. Not the cheapest spot in town, but highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
