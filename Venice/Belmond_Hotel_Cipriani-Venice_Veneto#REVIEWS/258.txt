We had a brief stay for just one night which was definitely not long enough. the hotel has a very warm welcome, large bedrooms with a balcony, welcome fruit and a substantial marble clad en suite bathroom (good quality shower gels and shampoo etc). Dinner at the club restaurant was lovely over looking the centre of Venice, the food and service was excellent, breakfast on the terrace was substantial offering a great choice of fresh fruit and pastries, the cooked breakfast was under par, over cooked omelette and strange tasting mushrooms. beware of the seagulls who swoop to feast on leftovers! There was a lovely large pool which is heated and comfortable sunbeds surrounding. very enjoyable and worth going back to.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
