Stayed at the Cipriani as part of a trip on the Orient Express with friends celebrating BIG Birthday/Retirement. Hotel across the Lagoon from St Marks Square. Private launch to transport you back and forth day and night. Lovely gardens, spacious  elegant rooms. Excellent restaurant,if a little pricey! The bonus was a heated huge swimming pool,quite something in Venice. The only downside was it did not open until 9 am,so a swim before breakfast was not possible. Very friendly staff who were helpful arranging trips etc.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
