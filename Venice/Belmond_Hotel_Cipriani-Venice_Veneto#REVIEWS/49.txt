If you had the good fortune to stay at the CIPRIANI years ago as my husband and I did every Summer you would understand how my son and I were disappointed on our recent visit. It has become a destination of transients and who can blame people when you look at the staggering prices. A perfect example is how the same glass of wine went up from €16 on Wednesday to €22 on Thursday. No mistake as the bill was computer generated. I am glad we went as I can finally say I am done with Venice.

As the same time, I am really sorry to learn that your last visit was disappointing. From your review, I do not understand if you asked for clarifications upon check-out for the different prices for the wine and also if your are comparing exactly the same wine,  the same vintage and the same producer. If there was the opportunity for you to correspond with me further please contact myself directly and I will be more than pleased to personally investigate on the matter . Thanking you once again for your attention and patronage, I send you my best personal regards.  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel Cipriani  Read more
