We stayed here for a couple of days after a trip on the Orient Express.  Well what can I say, everything about this hotel is special, our room was fabulous, the service was very warm and friendly even for non celebs!  We made use of the hotels boats service and never had to wait more than 5 minutes. This is my new favourite hotel and would recommend it to anyone celebrating a special occasion. I would love to come back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
