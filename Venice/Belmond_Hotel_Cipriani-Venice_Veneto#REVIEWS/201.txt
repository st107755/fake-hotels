My wife and I visited Venice as part of our 50th birthday celebrations and so we wanted to do it in style hence the Cipriani. We were not disappointed. The room (with lagoon view) was fantastic and all the staff were so kind and attentive. To visit "the city" (ie St Mark's Square), the hotel provided a private motor boat service which was great and only took a few minutes to get across. One key thing to note with the Cipriani is that it has a pretty decent and large swimming pool. So after all the walking and sight-seeing, it was great for us to get back and chill by the pool for a couple of hours with cocktails! Would highly recommend and we will definitely be coming back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
