The Hotel Cipriani is one of those hotels that cannot be overrated. No matter what you think you might experience when booking this hotel, you'll be impressed. I stayed in this hotel with my daughter for her graduation present and it was absolutely amazing. From the welcome champagne in the room to the free water taxi to the piazza san marco, the spacious room, awesome breakfast and lovely staff, we couldnt have asked for more. The price was WELL WORTH IT and this is the best way to spend a vacation in Venice. One of the, if not THE, most amazing hotel we stayed in.Read moreDate of stay: September 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
