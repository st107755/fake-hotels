We stayed three nights in this Belmond hotel property and we were pleased by our time there. Hotel has a private boat bringing you to place San Marco available 24h. Rooms are nicely decorated (take the view on the lagoon). Hotel has splendid outside pool and tennis court. There is also 1 star Michelin restaurant. Staff is professionnal, and they make your stay a memorable one, welcoming you upon arrival at the pier as well as departure from the concierge. We had such nice experience that we will probably come back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 15, 2017Dear skurf,  I thank you very much for sharing your positive experience based on your recent stay with us.
