On my second visit to Venice, and after a beautiful boat ride down the canal, we arrived to Cipriani for lunch. It was on a mild rainy day, peaceful and calm. We had great food with lovely company. The staff were friendly and helpful.Good service.They had a good wine selection and all the dishes we ordered had wonderful taste and savor. Clean, tidy and luxurious. Would definitely go again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
