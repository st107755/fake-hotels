This is most outrageous customer service. Spoke to reservation manager explained our flight from Air France cx last minute would arrive a day later with proof. His comment that we had special rate would penalize us as no show rather then move us one day later. Very poor way of dealing with customer who stays at many Belmont Hotels. This would never happen at Four Seasons! I will ask management to address his insensitivity in the hospitality industry.

From our side, I understand that the lack of flexibility of one of our staff members was frustrating and I did apologise when I personally met you at our hotel. I hope that the rest of your stay proceeded smoothly.  As we take your comments into serious consideration, we will better evaluate the facts reported by our guests before a decision is taken under the same circumstances you experienced in order to improve our customer service in future.  Also, to partially compensate the inconvenience caused, we did reimburse 50% of the total cost of the first night and I do hope to have you back to our property.  With my kind regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General ManagerRead more
