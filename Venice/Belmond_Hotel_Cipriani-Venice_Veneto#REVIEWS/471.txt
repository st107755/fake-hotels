Stayed at this hotel for a week in September. I have to admit to it not being my first visit!! It is such a relaxing and welcoming place. The staff are unfailingly polite and helpful The food in the Cips bar is delicious and the view across to the city is breathtaking. I was somewhat disappointed in the food in the newly updated Oro restaurant. The new d√©cor is beautiful but I was not so enchanted with the new menu. Nevertheless it was another lovely week at the Cipriani.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
