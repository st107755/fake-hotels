After a long flight we were welcomed to this wonderful hotel with a room upgrade and a nice bottle of champagne.  What a great welcome! Eveyone was so kind and attentive to our every need.  The room was beautiful and the sheets were fabulous.  The pool bar was great and the martini was yummy! We will reccomend this hotel to all our friends.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
