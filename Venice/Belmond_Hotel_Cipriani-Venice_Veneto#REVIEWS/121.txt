We stayed at Belmond Cipriani, arriving on the Orient Express Train via Paris to begin our honeymoon in Italy. This hotel is stunning, gorgeous in every way. If your coming to Venice you must stay here. The free shuttle in and out of St Marks Square every 20 minutes makes life so easy here. The pool (unbelievably good) and pool side bar and cocktails are amazing and well worth it during summer. The dining is fabulous and with Venice on your doorstep the choices are endless. The staff were very friendly and management made our stay exceptional with a Suite upgrade. We will definitely be back Cipriani but next time for longer.
