Just returned today from Venice where we stayed at the Cipriana for a long weekend. This place is without doubt the best Venice has to offer with fabulous amenities and truly outstanding staff, it's often said that a good business is what it is because of the staff and in this instance this can't be any more true. A special mention should go to Roberto who seems to know everyone and can't do enough for you, along with Franko the barman who serves the best cocktails. Also Massimo the resident pianist is very good and charming too. speaking with other guests it's clear why this hotel is successful and many return trips are made, we will do the same too. With the warm weather we had it was also wonderful to use the fabulous pool and gardens.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
