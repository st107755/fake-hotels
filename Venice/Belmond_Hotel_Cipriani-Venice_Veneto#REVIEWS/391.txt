We travelled to the Cipriani hotel for our 50th wedding anniversary last year for 4 days. What an absolute stunning location.

We did have to "push the boat out" as it was a 5 star and very expensive but for a special occasion it cannot be surpassed. It was also being further improved as the day after we left George Clooney stayed prior to his wedding.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
