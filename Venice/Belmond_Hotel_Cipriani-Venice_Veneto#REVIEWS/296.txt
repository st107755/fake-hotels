This is undoubtedly one of the best Hotels I have stayed in  We had a lovely room overlooking the lagoon and the room was very , very good   Not overly large but the bathroom was fantastic , big bath and separate shower  Everybody at the hotel went out of their way to help in any way possible , they were very helpful  Breakfast was fantastic , buffet style BUT they did offer hot alternatives  But be careful , if you want to eat in the hotel restaurants , you must book  It was expensive , but in my opinion worth every penny  Highly recommendedRead moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
