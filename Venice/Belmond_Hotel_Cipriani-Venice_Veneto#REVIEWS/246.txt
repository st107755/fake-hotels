Arrived by Water Taxi from the Airport - great service from for our whole stay and the kids even managed a swim in the outside pool in October!  Had a great meal in Club Cip, thoroughly recommend with great views out to Piazza San Marco.  Fabulous breakfast in the morning.  Rooms were excellent, had a sumptuous bath to relax tired feet in after a day walking around Venice.  Would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
