We booked the hotel with a short notice and ended up paying a very high price for the room. The hotel is nice, but at this price range I would expect I to be perfect at every detail. I just feel something was missing and here and there the hotel seemed a bit run down. I loved the small pampering the most:  breakfast served to the room (complimentary service!), a massage at the spa and the attentive staff. The hotel location on itâ€™s own island is very peaceful and the ferry ride is actually quite enjoyable. Strongly recommended for elderly couples, but young crowd might enjoy a more central location more.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 4, 2013Dear Guests,  I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at Hotel Cipriani.
