We visited Cipriani's for lunch and the hope of a dip in their pool.  Lunch at Cip's was fabulous. The food was pricey, but the quality and the service, exceptional.  As we are not hotel guests we were not permitted to use the pool area, instead sitting next to the pool at the bar. A little disappointing for us, but if we were guests I would definitely appreciate the exclusivity.  Well worth a trip over for lunch on their free private transfer from San Marco pier. No need to pay for a water taxi as long as you explain you are going for lunch/dinner. Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
