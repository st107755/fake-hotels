I’ve always loved this beautiful legendary place but I will never stay there again. I wrote the concierge 4 times over 10 days to set up my favorite restaurants and outings and never heard back. Never seen anything like it. Inexcusable.  We finally gave up and switched our reservation to the Aman, Venice’s most beautiful hotel, where the concierge managed to book all restaurants, spa treatments and outings within the hour.

In this connection, I checked with all of our departments and unfortunately the only 2019 correspondence we could find was a request from you which was answered by our concierge team the same day. I also asked our IT manager to see if your emails happened to have ended in our spam or archive, but unfortunately he was also unable to find anything else.  I am sorry you did not attempt to reach us by phone as maybe the matter could have been immediately cleared.  I truly apologize again but it seems like your emails never reached us.   I hope you may reconsider a future stay with us and please feel free to contact me directly and I am will be more than pleased to coordinate your visit.  With my best personal regards.
