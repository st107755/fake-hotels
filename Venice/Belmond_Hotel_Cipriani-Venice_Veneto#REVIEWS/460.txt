Enjoyed every minute of our trip to Venice, which was made even more special by our stay in this hotel.  From the moment we stepped off our water taxi and were given a tour of the hotel by Luigi to going back to the airport again we were looked after by the staff brilliantly at every stage.  I have stayed in most of the Belmond Hotels and this is certainly one of the best.  It was lovely to spend the day in the streets of Venice and then come back to the seclusion of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
