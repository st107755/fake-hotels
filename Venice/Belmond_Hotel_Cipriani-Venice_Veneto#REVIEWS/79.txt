I am really glad to learn that your was 'A very special stay in Venice' and that you appreciated everything about the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.  I am happy to share your wonderful words with my collaborators to further motivate them. Thank you for your rewarding comments.  As far as the Bellini is concerned, we made the choice to serve it only when the peaches are available as we do not use frozen juice  as all our cocktail are prepared using fresh fruit only.  I hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back on the occasion of your next visit in Venice ..maybe in May when the Bellini is available!  With my best personal regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel CiprianiRead more
