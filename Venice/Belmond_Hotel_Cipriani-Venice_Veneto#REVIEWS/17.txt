The hotel is very beautiful. Service is incredible. Food very tasty. Best thing about it is the location : away from the crowded Venice and still a few minutes away from everything by boat. Swimming pool even if we were not able to use it at this time is incredibly beautiful. Breakfast is near perfection. Still the hotel seems to be too expensive for what it has to offer but looks like Venice best hotels have this trait in common (unlike many other beautiful cities). Try not to book the first category of rooms as we got a Junior suite which is supposedly twice as big as the regular room and it looked like a normally sized room... maybe a bit bigger that a regularly sized room.Read moreDate of stay: November 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Nov 13, 2019Dear Rubenbrk,  I would like to thank you very much for your beautiful comments and I am delighted that you consider the Belmond Hotel Cipriani a 'great hotel'.
