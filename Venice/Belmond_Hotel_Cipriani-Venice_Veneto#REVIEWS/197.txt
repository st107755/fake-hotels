Our kids love affair with the Cipriani started the moment we arrived with Chippy the seagull, one of many little gifts that they received during our short stay for (the) Redentore (festival).  Parents receive gifts as well (thank you for the wonderful Pisaroni nectars!) but the most precious present is the abundance of kindness everyone working at the Cipriani exudes.   The quirky Venetian charm of the hotel, the Olympic size pool (a rare treat in Venice) with zany swimming toys, the Merchant of Venice cosmetics and the lavish garden turn this into a one of its kind experience.  The prices are eye watering but you (and your children) won't forget the time spent at the Cipriani. Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
