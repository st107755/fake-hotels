We had our (small) wedding in the Antique Garden at Hotel Cipriani in Venice in June 2014.  It was an outstanding experience. Before the wedding day, they were very easy and pleasant to work with, so I had a feeling things would run smoothly.  The day of the wedding, however, surpassed all of my expectations. The Antique Garden was stunning for a wedding -  overlooking the water, with beautiful gardens and sculptures. The food was excellent, the flowers and chair and table settings were stunning, the service was impeccable. I honestly could not believe how well organized, perfectly set up and gorgeous it was. I could not have hoped for a better experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
