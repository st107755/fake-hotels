We stayed at this hotel as part of trip on the Orient Express and we were not disappointed.  You reach the hotel via the hotel water taxi which runs every 15 mins, 24 hours a day.  We had a warm welcome and received at upgrade to a suite on the fourth floor overlooking the lagoon.  A member of staff explained where the bar, restaurants and pool were and told us about other hotel facilities.  We were then showed to our suite all the while being made to feel very special. The suite was beautiful but I would agree with other reviewers it would have been nice to have had tea and coffee making facilities and a hair dryer.
