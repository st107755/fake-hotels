Ooo lala...this place is a real treat.  The boat ride up to the lobby for check is elegant and refined.    The spaghetti pomodoro by the pool was delightful   The service is top notch.  I love when outdoor pool/beach areas have the service button!    They have a boat which goes back and forth to the main square in Venice every 10 min.  I don’t know why anyone would stay at Aman over Cipriani (we tried both)  Cip’s place (the main restaurant on the water) was decent. Not the best but pretty good.  Can’t beat the view. Service was great   Overall really nice spot !!!
