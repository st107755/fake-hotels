I have stayed here several times over the last two decades.  It is a wonderful retreat from the hustle & bustle of busy, noisy Venice at the beginning & end of the day.  Great pool & lovely green spaces, peace & quiet.  Jetty welcome always brilliant, reception good, concierge always positive & polite.  Restaurant & bar service not quite as cheerful & positive or attentive.  Food is excellent.  Breakfast buffet excellent, dinner - especially on jetty in water very good & atmospheric.  Rooms always well attended, & well supplied.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
