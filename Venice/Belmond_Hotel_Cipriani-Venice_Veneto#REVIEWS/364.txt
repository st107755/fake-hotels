Value for money is very difficult - it's a lot of both.  Had a lovely room, an upgrade, that had a balcony, windows on two sides and perfect quietness. One day the housekeeping was late - past lunchtime. The staff is professional, rendering superior service, and unlike some high quality properties, did not have their hands out.  Breakfast is beyond first rate. It would be nice if they had a discreet Vaporetto ticket service.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
