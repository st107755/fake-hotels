It was a great spot. I think the prices were very over the top you don't mind paying for good food and wine but just a bit to over priced. Fantastic pool and crèche for children. The ladies in the crèche were amazing nothing was to much for them even walking your children and to your hotel for you suggesting local restaurants to try I found them more helpful than the front desk. Went to some local rest thanks to them recommending it. The boat service to and from to St Marks was good always availableRead moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
