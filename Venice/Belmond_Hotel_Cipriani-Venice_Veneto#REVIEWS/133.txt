Staying here was just like a dream, arriving on a speed boat from the airport was magical! Our room with a balcony overlooking the lagoon was beautiful, not huge but fine! Breakfast on the terrace was so lovely in the sunshine, staff so friendly and very attentive, food was plentiful and delicious! The pool was the nicest I have been in! Huge and a great temperature, pool staff very friendly! Taking the hotel boat over to Venice everyday was fabulous, then coming back to the hotel for peace and quiet was so lovely, then sipping cocktails after dinner was the perfect end to the day.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 2, 2018Dear 123suzanne25,  Thank you for your wonderful review and your gratifying words.
