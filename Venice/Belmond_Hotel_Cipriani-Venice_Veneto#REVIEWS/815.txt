I stayed at the Cipriani in early September and it was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life.  The room was lovely and overlooked the lagoon, the pool was spectacular (I had no problem with attitude; some of the chairs were reserved but that was about it), the staff courteous, friendly and efficient and the food amazing.  I agree that Cip's Club is the better of the two restaurants for dinner, but they were both excellent.  The breakfast is one of the best I've ever had.  Best of all is the fact that the Cipriani is a short boat ride away from the huge crowds in St. Mark's Square.  It is such a lovely respite from the hordes of cruise ship tourists that are discharged every day.  Yes, it is expensive, but it was worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: September 2005HelpfulShare
