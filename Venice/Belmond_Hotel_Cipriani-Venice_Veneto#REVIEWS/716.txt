We had a meal for 19 of us here which the hotel arranged along with drinks and canapes. It was absolutely fantastic. The food was great, the service faultless.  10 of us then stayed for 2 nights before 6 of us went on to the Orient Express to Paris.  The hotel pool is amazing, and we had garden rooms which were beautiful. The bar is great, with the guy entertaining on the piano, we had great fun dancing and singing.  Drinks in the bar not cheap but this is the Cipriani so was what we expected.  The boat service available to and from San Marco square is regular and well manned.  Perfect hotel would go back tomorrow!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
