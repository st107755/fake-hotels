We stayed at this superb hotel as part of a package which included a trip from Venice to Calais on the Orient Express. The hotel had just reopened after a few months of redecoration and was absolutely beautiful. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was stunning and opened, via a small garden, to the heated outdoor pool (perfect). The hotel is stylish and elegant and exceeded all of our expectations.  Service was second to none, the staff were very helpful and very professional. We were made to feel very special indeed and had a fantastic break. The complimentary boat taxi service to San Marco (5 minutes) which runs every 15 minutes 24 hours a day is very useful.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
