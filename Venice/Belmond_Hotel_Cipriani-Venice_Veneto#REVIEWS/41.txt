Yes the Cipriani is expensive, they do not hide the cost, if it is in your budget, it is worth every Euro.  From the moment you step off the boat we experienced the utter professionalism of the Cipriani.  We could fault nothing.  The boat transfers to San Marco are brilliant, all staff that you interact with are brilliant. Cup s Club is so good, shelved led plans to eat at Oro to dine at Cips again.  Being on Giudecca is a welcome relief from the crowds in  Venice.  The Cipriani is an oasis in a wonderful city.  As stated all the staff are first class, however  Watching Roberto deal with the guests at the dock area, is a joy to behold.   We will return.
