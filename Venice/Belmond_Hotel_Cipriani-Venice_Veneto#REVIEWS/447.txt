I stayed here as a child fifty years ago, came back forty years ago and again this summer.  We didn't stay here this summer (too pricey for us), but you have to take hotel's taxi and go for drinks or dinner.  It is still an amazing hotel with superb service and attention.  We sat by the pool and had a very romantic evening of snacks and cocktails.  My wife had never been before and said it was one of the most romantic places I have taken her!  Don't miss it!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
