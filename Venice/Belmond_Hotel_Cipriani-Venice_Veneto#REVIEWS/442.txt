After we chose Venice for our wedding, there was no hesitation in choosing a hotel. Cipriani is the most gorgeous place in the city. Perfectly located on the island, it has a romantic garden for the  ceremony, separate broadwalk with stunning views of the canal for the reception, and an absolutely fantastic and somewhat gothic ballroom for the dinner and the party.  Despite they had to serve a lot of people at once, the food was delicious! We were also referred to  other hight-end companies for the music and flower arrangements. Wanted to thank Simonetta, the wedding coordinator in the hotel, for being so professional and very patient with us.  https://c1.tacdn.com/img2/x.gifRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
