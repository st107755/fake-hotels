This was our first visit to Venice & the Cipriani and we wanted a hotel to escape the crowds, the Cipriani is just perfect for this; a haven away from the crowds and a perfect location. The service however is disappointing and not what I expected from the Belmond Group, having stayed at several other hotels in the Group. The Warm Welcome as promised by Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager is not endorsed by the Head of Reception Manager,who is dismissive and unprofessional, unless of course you are a A list Celebrity or Billionaire, you will get his personal attention!!  I agree with the previous reviewers comments that the service is Miserable.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
