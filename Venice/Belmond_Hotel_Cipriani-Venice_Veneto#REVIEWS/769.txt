It begins with a warm greeting from Roberto, who helped arrange a fabulous trip for us to Burano, to Gastone, a concierge who can make reservations  at great resturants and get you museum tickets. As far as I'm concerned the word "can't" is not in their vocabulary. The young ladies who serve breakfast on the beautiful outdoor patio are outstanding. Have dinner at Cip's... the food was exceptional. It was a little chilly and the staff magically produced a shawl for my wife. Even the gardeners give you a buon giorno and are willing to answer any questions you may have about the flowers in the Casanova garden.The Cipriani is truly a great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
