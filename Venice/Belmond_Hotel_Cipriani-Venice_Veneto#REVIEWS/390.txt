Absolutely wonderful stay at this incredible hotel - the private boat arrival, amazing suite in the Palazzo Vendramin with its own garden, the views and grounds are just beyond beautiful, the pool, dining on the terraces and all the charming staff. Just loved it and can't wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
