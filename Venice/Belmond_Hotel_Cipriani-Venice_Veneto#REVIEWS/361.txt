From the moment we were met from the water taxi until we left, we were made to feel very welcome by all staff who could not have been more helpful and welcoming. We had a wonderful room very close to the pool  with its own little patio. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience of staying at The Cipriani and if in Venice again we will definitely stay there. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
