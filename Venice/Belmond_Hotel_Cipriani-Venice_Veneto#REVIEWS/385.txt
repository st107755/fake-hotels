Just come back from an exceptional week at the Cipriani  -  this was my 5th stay and it gets better every time. I can't think of a hotel anywhere in the world which has such fantastic, charming and friendly staff  -  who are so really well trained and professional. This all contributes to making one's stay really so relaxing and hugely enjoyable. The food, particularly at their Cip Club restaurant was really outstanding.   For years now my favourite hotel in the world has been the great 'Post Ranch' in Big Sur, California  -  the Cipriani is now so exceptional it even beats that.  Goes without saying will be back guys.  Paul Hamann Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
