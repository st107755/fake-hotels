Visited end september; the hotel is located 5 mn boat ride from St Marks square with complimentary boat provided by the hotel 24hours a day - every 15 mn to be exact.  The property is a tranquil oasis away for the crowds in Venice, 2 excellent restaurants, aa very good spa and tranquil staff. Lovely very large salt water swimming pool with an adjacent bar. good views and quite rooms. Not cheap but really worth the price. will return  CP and  CP FamilyRead moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
