We spent 2 nights here after travelling on the Orient Express. Very efficient and friendly meet and greet from staff who were very efficient without being too obtrusive. Our large bedroom was very stylish and comfortable with a huge bed, a balcony overlooking the gardens and a well appointed bathroom with lots of luxurious toiletries. The outdoor pool was a beautiful blue, crystal clear, saltwater and warm. It was beautiful to swim in. In keeping with the rest of the hotel, the breakfast was excellent, beautifully presented and the staff very attentive - and an amazing view! The hotel's launch transfer to St Mark's Square was another huge plus point especially as it ran at request. We cannot fault the hotel, it really was 5*. We would strongly recommend and would love to revisit.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
