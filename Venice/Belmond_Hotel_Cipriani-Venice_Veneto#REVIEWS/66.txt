The Belmond Cipriani is a class by itself. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are elegant, the food is fabulous, and the service is unbeatable. I felt as it I was being welcomed into a family. There is no place I have ever stayed in that the staff was as wonderful as at this hotel.  Dear Danilo and Barbara thank you.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jun 20, 2019Dear LisaaLisaaLisa,  What a pleasure to read your beautiful review and gratifying words.
