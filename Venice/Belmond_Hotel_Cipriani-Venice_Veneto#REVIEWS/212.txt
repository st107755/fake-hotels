This was a truly excellent hotel.  The quiet, peaceful location is perfect - the hotel's motor boats will quickly take you St. Mark's, but it is wonderful to be away from the crowded streets of Venice.  The hotel's property is like an oasis - the gardens are large and well-manicured, the pool is beautiful and well-kept, and the choice of dining (including breakfast) is excellent.  Best of all, the staff are friendly, professional, and very good at their work.  This was an exceptional hotel; one of the best.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
