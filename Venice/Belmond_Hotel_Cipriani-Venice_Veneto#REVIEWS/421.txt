One of the most beautiful properties i have seen in the world. Service is outstanding.. Mr Luigi took me around the hotel never seen such extraordinary service. You should stay in the hotel only to be toured around by mr luigi. The conceige Mr Tommaso was outstading and found us an extraordinary italian resturant to have lunch. Never had such good  italian food. The hotel has a pool which is huge and all facilities. Rooms and service is outstanding. They even have own boat to go st marco. It is true seven star hotel one of the very few in europe.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
