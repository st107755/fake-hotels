We stayed at the Cipriani for three nights and whilst the service was excellent our room was a little pokey, especially for the price.  The room was in the heat of the sun all day with mirrored windows to try and help reflect the heat but still the chambermaids insisted on switching off the a/c in the evening and consequently when going to bed the room was extremely hot and the a/c had only just about brought the room down to temperature by the morning.  The swimming pool is wonderful as is the location.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
