We stayed at the Cipriani following our trip from London on the Orient Express. A big splurge for us as we would not normally spend such a lot for a city break hotel. We booked a lagoon view with balcony, the room was lovely but was nothing like the room shown on their web site. It was obviously a newly refurbished room but it totally lacked any character nothing to suggest Venice apart from the Murano lights. Everything was white or cream - very tasteful but not Venician. The price of food and drinks was outrageous and the food we had was not good. Take the boat and eat in the city. The pool, shuttle boat and gardens are wonderful and we did enjoy our stay but as regular visitors to this unique city we shall stay somewhere else next time.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear Sir, I am sorry that your recent stay at our Belmond Hotel Cipriani was not totally satisfying. As far as our rooms are concerned, they are individually decorated therefore the pictures shown on our website are indicative  of the category and not of all rooms. Every winter we renovate some accommodations in bright colours with Venetian touches: Murano chandeliers, white stucco on the wall and the bathrooms are made with the best Italian marble from Carrara. With regard to the price of our food it is aligned with any other deluxe restaurants in Venice. With my kind regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General ManagerRead more
