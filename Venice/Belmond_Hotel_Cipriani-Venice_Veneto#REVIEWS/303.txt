Amazing to be whisked away from the airport by boat and arrive at a lovely jetty on the canal.   This is a beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms and different areas to sit, drink, eat etc. However I would advise booking the hotel restaurants before arrival - we couldn't get in either of the ones we wanted and as we arrived late afternoon it was a bit of a pain to have to start looking for a place to eat - although there are a lot to choose from in Venice!   The pool is huge which is great. They have a beautiful wooden boat which is well worth a hire.   If you like to be away from the hustle and bustle of Venice then this opulent hotel is a must. Obviously why many stars stay here. However, just remember if you want to nip out its a boat ride every time. Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
