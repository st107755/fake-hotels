The Cipriani is delicious with no pomp and ceremony other than attentive nationals making up the team who are unobtrusive and helpful beyond the call of any duty.  Room delightful with a high powered jacuzzi put to full use.  High end products.  Boat transfer to and fro St Mark's also a delight with liveried captain and upholstered seating.  Got a good haircut too though the treatments are costly - but hey this is Italy.  The boutiques are for window shopping but a boat to Burano for the lace and linen boutique a must - you won't leave without buying something.  Room service quality did not falter and the turn down evening service is the best.  Food as expected yummy and the Fortuny a delight with views over the water and a lovely atmosphere.  I will review the Orient Expressâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
