Perfect way to see Venice and still escape the crowds - an island just across from St. Mark's with beautiful views of the Lagoon.  Ask for a room or suite with a view of St. Marks.  The restaurants a exceptional, although expensive, and the pool is a welcome escape on a hot afternoon.  Booked a personal tour through the hotel of Venice via the hotel boat - canals and islands.  Best side trip - ever!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
