We stayed in this enchanted place towards the end of September. I think I can say that the Hotel Cipriani is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed. Staff and service excellent, food fantastic.A step away from Piazza San Marco. I also recommend a walk in the garden and enjoy the relaxation of this enchanted. Fairytale atmosphere. I love the CiprianiRead moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
