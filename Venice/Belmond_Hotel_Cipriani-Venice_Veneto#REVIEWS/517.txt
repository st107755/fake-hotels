Stayed there 10 years ago and loved it.  Probably would still love it but we stopped by just for lunch (trying the Gritti Palace this visit) and were underwhelmed with the physical surroundings.

Didn't see inside rooms but the outside looks dated and just not fresh..Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
