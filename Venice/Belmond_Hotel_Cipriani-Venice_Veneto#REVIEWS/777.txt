we travelled with VSOE as part of the venetian interlude staying at the Cipriani and then transfering to the Orient Express.  The hotel was a delight.  Clean and welcoming.  Yes Roberto is a real charm and made our experience even better.  The staff are fantastic.  The evening meal in the Chips restaurant was out of this world.  Expensive but a once in a lifetime experience for us and never to be forgotten.Read moreDate of stay: April 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
