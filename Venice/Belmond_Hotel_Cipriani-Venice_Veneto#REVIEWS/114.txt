We stayed for two nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and just loved the hotel.From the private motor launch from the 'mainland' to the service and meals on the terrace, it was pure luxury. Our room was probably the largest bedroom in any hotel we've stayed in, which is quite something for Venice! The staff from the maids to the reception staff were all extremely helpful.
