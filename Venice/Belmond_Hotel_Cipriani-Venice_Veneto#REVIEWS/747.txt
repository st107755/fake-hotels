The Cipriani sets a service standard.  The staff could not be more genuinely warm and welcoming, without being obtrusive.  The rooms are charming and luxurious.    The hotel was kind enough to upgrade us to a lovely room overlooking St. Marks.  Memories of the view still give me goosebumps.  I will never forget the feeling of crossing the canal in the evening on the Cipriani's private boat.  The only thing more spectacular was the lovely Bellini I enjoyed each evening to the sound of the Cipriani pianist.    While pricey, you will not feel as if you had overspent.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
