You can certainly see why this wonderful hotel has earned the reputation of the best hotel in Venice.  From its private boat which picks you up every 15 minutes from the beautiful St. Marks Square, to its stunning gardens and sumptuous breakfast buffet (Prosecco on the juice bar!), this hotel is truly five stars.  However, possibly the best aspect of the Cipriani is its world-class service.  KLM lost my suitcase, and I was very panicky as I was getting on a Cunard cruise the next day; the concierge dealt with everything for me, from making calls to the airline to giving me a bag of essentials to get me through the night.   One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and I will definitely be back.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
