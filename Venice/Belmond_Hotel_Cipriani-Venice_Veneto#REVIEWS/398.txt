Celebrated my 27th wedding anniversary here, it was gorgeous.  Our room was pleasant and very clean but would book a room with a balcony overlooking the lagoon next time instead of without balcony! Nice to be within water taxi distance of San Marco.  Spent our first evening on a gondola trip that the hotel kindly organised on our behalf...so romantic followed by a return trip to the Oro restaurant for dinner...Lovely meal served by very passionate waiters clearly proud of their food and service....however incredibly expensive.  Nice choice of bars in the evening on return from dinner although we did feel that service could be improved on as we had a long wait for drinks.    Managed a few hours by the pool which was lovely...very friendly staff around - they don't bother youâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
