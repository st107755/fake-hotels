This staff at this hotel really are very attentive and could not be faulted.  We were very lucky to be able to swim in the pool even in April as the weather was lovely - this added to our enjoyment of the pool. The one blip is the price of the food - EUR28 + 10% service for a very poor chicken sandwich. Our room overlooked the lagoon and the doors blocked out all sound. The bed was very, very comfortable and we slept the best we ever have in a hotel. The private water transfers over to St Mark's square make you very special. My only slight moan is that the glory is starting to fade a little, eg peeling paint in a few places, our toilet flush only half working etc but overall this is a lovely place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
