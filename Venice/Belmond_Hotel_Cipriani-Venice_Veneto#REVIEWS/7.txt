This was my first time in Italy. The experience at Cipriani is one I will remember forever.

The experience at Cip's Club was so extraordinary, we ended up dining there twice during our stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 20201 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo Ottazzi, Other at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 17, 2020Dear marianaprincep,  Thank you for taking a moment to review your recent experience at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani and I am delighted to know that you chose our property for your first stay in Italy.
