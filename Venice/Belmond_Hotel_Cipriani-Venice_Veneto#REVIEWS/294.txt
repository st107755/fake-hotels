We took a boat taxi from our hotel, JW Marriott to have dinner at the Michelin star rated Oro restaurant at the Cipriani hotel. The dinner was excellent. We ate outside and enjoyed the view as the sun was setting. The mushroom risotto was excellent. The prawns were good. My wife received mixed advice from our waiter on whether the heads were edible. This made for a fun conversation. The only blemish on the experience is that we became dinner for the mosquitos outside at the end of dinner (obviously not the restaurant's fault) so we and the other guests outside moved inside where there was a large table of 12-14 Americans in their 50s who were very loud and obnoxious. They could be heard outside and likely across the bay. It happens, but we were going for a romantic experienceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
