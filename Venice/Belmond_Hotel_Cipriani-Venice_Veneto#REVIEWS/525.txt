Just had our annual visit to this magnificent hotel and even when you think it could not get better, it proves you wrong and it does. !! New restaurant and menu is wonderful and certainly deserves Michelin Star. Congratulations to the new chef on his great food and innovative dishes. Service is second to none, Walter in the restaurant and Tamazi and Alexandra on the front desk gave us exceptional service - we cannot wait to return to this wonderful establishment.
