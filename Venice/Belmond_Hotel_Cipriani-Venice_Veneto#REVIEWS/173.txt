We had a lovely 2 days in Venice in November. As it was the birthday/anniversay of my wife and I wanted a special hotel. It  was absolutely the right choice. This hotel is truely unique, with charme, great service and attention to detail. Alone to take the hotel boat from and to San Marco is more than romantic. The hotel greeted us with champagne and a delicious dessert. The room had a beautiful view, the best linnen and all perfectly arranged.  All this has its price but if you want a truely unique hotel away from the masses of people I can only recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
