Visited here as a treat for our silver wedding for two nights!!  Our room was amazing, view out over the lagoon. It was spacious and well furnished with a little bottle of desert wine and biscuits waiting for us. The service and staff were impeccable, and the whole place was beyond reproach. One warning though - it is VERY expensive 25 Euros for two teas with a few biscuits. We ate in Cips club on our first night. Again food was lovely but overpriced for what we had we felt. Added bonus was that we could order breakfast to be served in our room at no extra cost. This was a wonderful indulgent luxury which we loved!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
