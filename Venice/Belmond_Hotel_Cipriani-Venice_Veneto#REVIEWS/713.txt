I stayed at this hotel in late June and it was amazing.  I spent 3 nights in a room with an amazing view of the gardens.  I was with parents and a sister on a trip to Venice.  Every day, we would take the boat, and once or twice the vapparetto to the the city.  The pool at the hotel is quite nice, even though it was rather cloudy the day we visited it.  The rooms were amazing.  They were well decorated and very large compared to other hotels in Italy.  I did not eat dinner at the restaurant, but did have breakfast, which was amazing.  The only thing is that it is REALLY EXPENSIVE!Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
