We have stayed several times.  Best pool in Venice if you like to tour and then relax and take some sun.  Service is uniformly excellent but the rooms and rest of the hotel now need updating.  Food excellent, boat service and greeting excellent.  So great to be just a hop away from the fray in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
