Perhaps it is the reputation which preceeds it but we found the Cipriani very underwhelming and were rather disappointed. It is ok but nothing to get excited about. Sure the location is amazing and the private boat service  into the mainland is excelllent. However, the hotel is very grubby and rough around the edges. It could do with a re-fit and paint job. The bar is small and the restaurant is rather stiff and stuffy. Overrated and over-priced. Try the newly opened San Clemente Palace which is set on its own island and is overall a better hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 20041 SaveHelpfulShare
