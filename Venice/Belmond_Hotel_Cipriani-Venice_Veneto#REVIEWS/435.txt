I have had the pleasure of staying at the Cipriani for a week every summer for almost 10 years. From the private jetty near the Piazza San Marco and swift private boat to the hotel, the welcome by the "doorman" at the private jetty on arrival, all is calm and seamless.  This beautiful luxurious quiet oasis makes one of the world's great cities, even more magical. The arrival and check-in is always seamless. One immediately feels relaxed. The rooms are large, thoughtfully designed classic elegance with a modern twist. No tricks and flashiness here. The many large gardens are all meticulous kept and beautiful, the Olympic pool amazing. A necessity if one visits in the hot humid Venetian summer. The breakfast on the waterfront is delicious and an unforgettable start to the day.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Mar 3, 2015Wow, what an amazing comment.
