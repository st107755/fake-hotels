one of the most memorable hotel stays of my life!  Loved the complimentary motoscafo rides to the noisy mainland and then back to our serene, movie-scene like accommodations.  Exceptional service.  I'm writing down that I visited in 2012 but it was actually many years ago, but still is imbedded in my memory as a spectacular experience.  Especially heartwarming because I treated my Mom to this trip, and now she is gone.  The photo I took of her beaming face on the motoscafo trip from the hotel to St. Mark's Square was the one I used for her obit....that happy smile was how I want to remember her!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded May 7, 2013Dear Madame,  I would like to thank you for your comments and the beautiful words you have used to describe your stay at the Cipriani. I have been particularly touched by the fact that this trip was the last made together with your Mom and that you have used the picture taken on the boat for her obit. I really would like to have a copy of this picture to keep in our gold book to remind her forever between our past and beloved Guests. Thank you again for beeing our Guest and I really hope to have the opportunity to welcoming you soon again at the Cipriani. With best personal regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General ManagerRead more
