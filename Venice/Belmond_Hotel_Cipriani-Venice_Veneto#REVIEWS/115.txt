5 star service, Michelin starred restaurant, red clay tennis, spa, gardens, private boats, boutiques, views of all of Venice, cocktail lounge with innovative drinks and live music, gigantic pool with full staff at the push of a private button, beautiful room, super helpful and knowledgeable Concierge services (Tommaso was awesome)! Just across the Grand Canal from the tourist littered streets of city Venice, this amazingly beautiful and gigantic oasis island property is minutes by shuttle to St Mark's square. It's the perfect vacation getaway. See all of the sites of Venice and then escape the craziness back to your quiet, secluded luxury. Highly recommend taking a private Cipriani boat tour of Burano, Murano, etc. with Captain Fabio.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 21, 2018Dear MrFordCT,  It was a true pleasure to have you as a guest and thank you for sharing your opinions concerning your stay with the community.
