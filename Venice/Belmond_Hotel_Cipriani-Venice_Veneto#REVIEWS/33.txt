Wow, this hotel is so special, in the nicest possible way it feels like a step back in time.  Venice can be a challenge if you don’t know where to eat and drink, there are a lot of tourist traps.  This hotel is a welcome reprieve.  The staff couldn’t do enough for us, the concierge was incredibly helpful and even the lovely lady who cleaned our room was beyond helpful  Magical  I will definitely go backRead moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful vote1 RepostHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 14, 2019Dear  ExcursionHero,  Thank you so much for taking the time to write your review about your stay at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
