The private boat trip from St Marks Square bringing us to the hotel set the scene for our stay and it was luxury all the way.  The boat is available 24 hours a day to drop you over and back to St Marks Square at a whim.  The Cips Club restaurant is breath taking and a must if you're staying at this hotel.   Guests are allowed use the outdoor pool 24 hours a day and it's always warm.  The only negative is that we extended our stay by 2 nights and unfortunately we had to move out of our room from the main hotel to a very small chalet type room on the grounds which wasn't at the same level.   It ain't cheap.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
