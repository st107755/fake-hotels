My husband and I have just spent 3 nights at this wonderful hotel after arriving in Venice on The Orient Express. It's fair to say that we were initially slightly disappointed with our room, a lagoon view double with a balcony. The room itself was ok but the bedding and quality of the towels not really what we expected for the price. This was soon forgotten,however, once we experienced the friendliness of the staff, service received throughout the hotel, facilities and standard of food and drink. The constantly running  water shuttle to St. Mark's made it so easy to hop in and out of the hustle and bustle of Venice and every time we returned to the hotel it was like returning to an oasis of calm. The hotel is not cheap but definitely worth every penny and we can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
