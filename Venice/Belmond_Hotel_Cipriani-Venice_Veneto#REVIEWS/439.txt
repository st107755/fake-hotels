This luxury hotel is situated on a small island looking towards St.marks Square but there is a Hotel boat that goes back and forth all day so travelling across the water is quick, easy and enjoyable too. The hotel is beautifully decorated and nice and quiet, its so nice to have a pool and beautiful gardens in the summer to relax away from the bustling tourist area of Venice. The restaurants are all divine and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We will definately return and recommend this wonderful place.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
