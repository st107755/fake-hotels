All part of a good hotel is the customer service , this hotel was exceptional , the staff were efficient , friendly, really helpful and organised . They organised tours, guides, restaurants and all was perfect . Such a great location , a five minute boat ride to the centre of Venice but away from the hustle and bustle . Beautifully appointed hotel , fantastic spa treatments , lovely serviced pool , food and drink superb, Cips Club restaurant superb . All in all a fantastic 3 day break Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
