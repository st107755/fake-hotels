We stayed here having arrived on the Orient Express for the trip of a lifetime, and felt than in spite of the huge price tag it was well worth it.  Venice itself is manic and exhausting, walking, getting lost and therefore worn out is the thing to do here, so having a place to retreat to that was peaceful and serene felt like complete luxury.  One evening we took their Bacari tour by boat that visited non touristy bars with a guide, Stefano, who was great company and an interesting guide - a really relaxing way to see bits of the city we hadn't managed to cover by foot.  The price of the tour is steep, but if time is short and you want to feel like you've really discovered the city in a relaxing way we would highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
