It's extravagant, opulent, expensive and many more things but its still a most special place to stay if you can afford it.  The staff are friendly and welcoming and even the restaurant is high quality and so it should be.  A return to London on the Orient Express was also a fantastic experience and should be on everyones bucket list but trust me, don't do it in July or August. It's too not and humid and there isn't any aircon, just the windows and a small fan!  The food onboard though is as good as an Michelin star restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
