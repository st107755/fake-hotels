What need I say about this extraordinary hotel?  The service is without doubt the best in Europe and the staff are models of efficiency and charm.  The hotel is not cheap - it wouldn't be- but it is beyond just luxury.  It is stylish, timeless, cool and friendly with the best sited restaurant I have ever seen at Cips overlooking Giudecca Canal and St Mark's.  We loved this place and will return.
