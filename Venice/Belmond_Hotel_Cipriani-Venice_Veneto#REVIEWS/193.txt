What an experience! It was a delight ! They excelled themselves with superb service and delicious Italian food. The hotel itself has a relaxed atmosphere with a sophisticated and elegant undertone. The exceptionally pleasant and helpful staff such as Thomas and Sebastian at the concierge made our stay the best that it could be. If visiting Venice and not staying at this hotel then I definitely recommend a visit to one of their delicious restaurants such as Cips, Oro or the Trattoria!! The rooms were comfortable and very clean, spacious and extremely luxurious !! Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
