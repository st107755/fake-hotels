My husband and I stayed at the cipriani in April this year, we got our stay as part of the orient express experience  The hotel is in a most beautiful place in venice looking over the estuary and away from the crowds we would normally not have been fortunate to stay here as it really is for the rich & famous as it's a bit pricy for us but what a treat it was  The bedrooms were beautiful & generous toiletries gave exceptional luxury  We ate outside for breakfast just for the views  And tried the resturant over looking the sea one evening, fine dining not a usual option for us but thought we would try it  Wow it was expensive but an experience we won't forget  Thankyou for making our orient express trip magicalRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
