Not sure where to start in applauding what the restaurant, the waiters, the chef and his team have achieved here, it is that great. Me and my friend celebrating her 'big number' birthday had such a brilliant afternoon here, we still talk about it and wish we could go back tomorrow. From getting to the island in the little boat, to the very welcoming staff at reception, the excellent wine list, exquisite (lunch) menu, the atmosphere at rhe outdoor section of the restaurant even though it was raining cats and dogs over the lagoon, all of it just wow. Yes, the bill was a big one, but as we were celebrating a big birthday, we didn't want to hold back and we didn't regret a single euro spent there. Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
