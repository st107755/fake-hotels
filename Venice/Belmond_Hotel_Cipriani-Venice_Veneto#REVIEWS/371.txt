We've been here many times and it remains an great experience and the best place to stay in Venice. Room was fabulous ( although no balcony), overlooking the lagoon. 'Extras'- shuttle boat to St Mark's Square  24/7 and olympic size outdoor pool are fantastic. Staff were fabulous and service discreet. The food in the Oro restaurant  however was disappointing- pre the refurbishment last year spectacular favourites were sea bass in a salt crust and Cip's venetian chocolate ice cream with marmalade sauce- sadly no longer available.  Tip: Eat at the Cip's bar. Fresh fish is amazing. Room for improvement: Oro food and pre drink canap√©s which are incredibly basic.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Guest,  I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
