A special and elegant hotel which is a pleasure to stay. From the moment you arrive one feels a sense of well being and calm. The management and staff are polite, attentive, well presented and cannot do enough to make your stay more enjoyable.  The rooms are immaculate and very comfortable. Our room had fantastic views across the lagoon.  The swimming pool is heated to th perfect temperature, for me anyway, and the poolside bar/restaurant menus will temp anyone to stay and relax poolside and forget about leaving the hotel. Arrigo Cipriani's famous bellini's are delicious.  The hotel offers its beautiful shuttle boat(s) to hop across to St. Marco square.  Personally speaking, this hotel delivers on all levels - luxury, friendliness, cleanliness, relaxation.......you get the idea!I  Grazie mille to everyone that made our stay so special - we will see you next year for sure.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2020LocationCleanlinessService3 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo Ottazzi, Other at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 30, 2020Dear Nofark1,  I appreciate you taking a moment to write about your recent stay with us at Belmond Hotel  Cipriani.
