Last visit to the Cipriani was for the Venice Film Festival, and there is no better hotel to choose for that event. Away from the maddening crowds of Venice mainland, yet just a small (free) boat ride from St Mark's Square, this tranquil setting is a hop away from the Lido, where the festival takes place. And, for that week, expect to bump into plenty of famous people from the acting world.   Best meal of the day is breakfast - what a location / view!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
