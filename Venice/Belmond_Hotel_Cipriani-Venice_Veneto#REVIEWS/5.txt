The hotel is nice (expecially the large pool) and we loved the location but for this price we expected more from a 5* hotel which is one of the most famous hotels of the world... the service at the pool wasen’t friendly and the entire place could really need some renovation.Read moreDate of stay: September 20202 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo Ottazzi, Other at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 10, 2020Dear patrickbucher,  I thank you for taking the time to share your review and I am sorry that despite the fact that you found our hotel nice, you were disappointed. I deeply regret if our hotel was below your expectations and I am little bit surprised to learn that the service at the pool was not friendly and therefore I will investigate with the head of department. Anyway, I hope that there were also some positive aspects regarding your stay and  probably you may give us a second chance in the future.  In the meantime, I send you my best personal regards  Giampaolo Ottazzi Directeur Général Belmond Hotel CiprianiRead more
