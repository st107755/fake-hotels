This is our third visit and the Cipriani gets better every time. The location in Venice is perfect with the excitement of the fabulous hotel launch to St Mark's Square and back whenever you wish. We had a lagoon room view with balcony which was lovely. Nothing is too much trouble for the entire Cipriani team who make everyone so welcome. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed in every respect and the famous pool is simply wonderful after a morning sightseeing. Highly recommend the Cips Club with the amazing views across to Venice centre from the outside floating pontoon restaurant (it doesn't move !). Not silly prices and have as much or as little as you wish. We very much looking forward to our next visit.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 26, 2019Dear PhilG361,  I would like to thank you very much for taking the time to review your third stay at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
