Stunning hotel in every way.  We were upgraded to a suite which was lovely with hand-painted walls and beautiful antique furniture.  The bathroom was fantastic in every way - luxurious towels, lots of toiletries, TV at head of bath (with jacuzzi) large power shower and separate toilet, bathrobes and slippers included.  The grounds are beautiful, but sadly the weather on our visit did not allow us to make the most of the views, gardens, terraces or pool area.  Breakfast in the main dining room was superb.   Nothing to complain about at all, a remarkable hotel worthy of it's reputation.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 21, 2013Dear Guests,  I would lke to thank you for the nice comments about your recent stay at the Cipriani.
