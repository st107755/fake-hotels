My husband and I just got back from a 4 day stay at the Cipriani.   We had stayed at Belmond hotels before, and the Cipriani definitely lived up to their reputation for excellence.  The hotel is in a beautiful location, and the private motor launch to St. Mark's Square makes it convenient to all of the top sites.   I can't rave enough about the staff.  From Tomasso at the concierge desk who organized all of our last-minute requests for tickets and tours, to the entire staff at Oro restaurant, everyone was so gracious and kind.  We have already started planning when we can return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Apr 10, 2019Dear EaglesFanToronto,  First of all, let me thank you for taking the time to share your review and for your beautiful comments.
