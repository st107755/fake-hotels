I can only reiterate the other reviewers of this fabulous hotel.  From the moment we arrived at the Marco Polo airport we were met by friendly and courteous staff, who transported us (and our luggage) onto a waiting water taxi to the hotel.  There we were greeted by very welcoming staff and given a tour of the hotel.  Although I booked a "classic garden view" room, we were upgraded at no extra charge to a fabulous suite overlooking the lagoon.  I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel, the staff and the restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
