I have mixed feelings about the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.  The hotel has many things to recommend it — a beautiful setting, friendly and very capable staff, very good (though not great food except at Oro, which is exceptional), an amazing pool, and old-style glamour.

While I am delighted to learn that you appreciated various aspects of your recent stay, as the setting, the staff and the 'amazing pool', at the same time, I am sorry that you have mixed feelings due to the location of the accommodation assigned to you at the Palazzetto. I would like to add that many guests, as your husband, prefer to stay at the Palazzi because of its privacy and the wonderful view overlooking St. Mark's basin and the Doge's Palace, I am deeply sorry that the location of your room ruined your whole experience and I would be more than pleased to coordinate your future visit assigning you an accommodation in the main building should you give us another opportunity to reinstate your faith on the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.  With my best personal regards.  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel Cipriani  Read more
