3rd stay here and I always leave a bit disappointed!     It is a fantastic location and having the pool to return to after time in the centre is very welcome in the summer.    The challenge is unless you specify a renovated room you risk paying the same price for a very dated one (my last trip I was given a room that looked like it hadn't been occupied for years........friends had a similar experience on this trip).     Also "views" aren't always the great ones - again some lagoon views fab, some it's a stretch to say it's really got the view.     The spa is ok.    The new main restaurant is nice but again trying to get a good table I.e not the one at the back behind the grubby screen is a challenge and very very large tips are required.     The food here and at cips is just ok.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
