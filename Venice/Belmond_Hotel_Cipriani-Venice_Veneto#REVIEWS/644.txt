It is reputedly one of the leading hotels in the world. The service is friendly , the rooms delightful and the pool to die for. We did, however, feel it was a little too far out of Venice if you wanted to see the museums. We always seemed to be coming and going and could not just pop into the hotel for an hours rest. It is, however, very peaceful and has a lovely pool. No early morning swims though- you aren't allowed in before 9am... Food in the bar and restaurant seemed overpriced so better to eat out - another boat trip!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
