After paying some of the highest rates in the world at break fast while seated at my table,  i asked the waiter (in a white jacket) for some still water he said "It was at the buffet and I could get it my self"  The European service rarely rise to the American or Far Eastern service levels and The Belmond CIpriani also delivers poor service but in very pretty surroundings. The bathroom were superb with amazing showers. The restaurant for lunch had delicious food. At breakfast you have to order eggs of a menu and that can take some time  It is not located on the main island so you have to take a boat ride , but the hotel gives that free and at regular intervals.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
