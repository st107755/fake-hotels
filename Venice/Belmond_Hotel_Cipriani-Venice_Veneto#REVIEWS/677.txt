We were recently married at Cipriani and the hotel staff made our day incredible! The coordinator made the planning easy and answered emails quickly and with great concern for some of the details we may have overlooked. The room was beautiful, overlooking the pool. They make you feel like royalty from the moment you step off the boat (which is a complimentary shuttle to and from St. Marks, very nice drivers) and all the service staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. I can't say enough great things about this hotel and I couldn't be more great full to the staff for making our day so memorable. Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
