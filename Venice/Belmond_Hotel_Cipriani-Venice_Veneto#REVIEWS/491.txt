Hotel Cipriani is like another city in Venice. After long hours of sightseeing in the centre, we always came back to tranquility and peace. Room views, gardens, swimming pool made us relax after a busy day. Restaurants are delicious, stuff is very very friendly. There is a boat which goes to the centre and back every 30 min! Best place to stay in Venice, especially for couples on their honeymoon!!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
