Class, style, privacy and old world service set this hotel apart from the many parts of Venice which can be over-run & rude.  We just stayed for lunch and were treated respectfully and with a sudden down poor of rain that stopped all the water taxis from answering calls and running the concierge was able to get through and ordered one for us to the airport for less that I was originally quoted.  Thank you Cipriani for your warmth and grace from the moment we arrived to the drinks around the pool, to the lunch over the water looking back at Venice to our reassuring ease of our departure.  Oh and this is with us bringing our luggage with us which they accommodated effortlessly and with good grace and poise.....nothing was too much trouble !!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
