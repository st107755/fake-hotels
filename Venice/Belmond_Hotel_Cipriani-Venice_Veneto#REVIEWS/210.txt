After years of staying at the Gritti, Monaco and Bauer I overnighted at the legendary Cipriani Hotel yesterday. The cuisine and bed were wonderful - but I found the rooms lack softness and warmth.  There was no soap in my bathroom and given the class of hotel I was surprised that there was no pressing service on Saturday night - Although after some begging they did iron my clothes in the end.

I am sorry to learn that your stay was not up to your expectations. As far as  our rooms are concerned, they vary in style, view and size and are renovated every winter in rotation. Our bathrooms are equipped with different kind of soaps,  body lotion, etc. and our housekeeper would have been more than pleased to provide soap in the case that she would have been notified that something was not in the room.  After my investigations, I know that the pressing was done as requested. I hope to be able to welcome you back in the future for a better satisfactory experience.  With my kind regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel CiprianiRead more
