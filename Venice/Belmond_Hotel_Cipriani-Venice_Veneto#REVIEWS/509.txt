The Cipriani is the perfect hotel to be near, but not in the middle of, Venice.  You are close enough to travel easily to the main island by complimentary hotel-provided watercraft but far enough away to have perfect peace and quiet away from the tourist crowds in a lush, beautiful setting with stunning views.  Well deserving of its reputation for sophistication and quality.  A true world class hotel but not for the bargain conscious traveler.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
