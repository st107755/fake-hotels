returning guest, recently stayed for the event, lovely suite overlooking the lagoon, the fact that this is on Guidecca island-which now has some nice rustic bars appearing on the walk up to the Molino Stucky the other end, makes the difference so you can get away from it all, but be so near to the action is a big plus, and the large swimming pool area, nice complimentary shuttle boat sets it off also, The Gritti palce is the only other hotel in venice in the same league, Oro restaurant is excellent as well as the floating Cips(in the summer!!)Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
