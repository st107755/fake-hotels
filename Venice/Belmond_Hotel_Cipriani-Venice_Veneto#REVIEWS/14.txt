This trip we rented a apartment with artist friends attending the Biennale, but came out on the private launch for a walk in the garden and a little lunch. Lovely, and amazed at one of the best hamburgers I've ever eaten! who knew? Met a very special gentleman and author of the Cipriani "beverages" bookâ€”Walter Bolzonella. He is a delight. Also met an adorable bride on her way to wedding dinner and honeymoon.
