The hotel is nice but felt more like I was at my grannys house than at a world class top hotel. The bathroom set was older than my grandmothers house!  The room was fine but as a suite with terrace and views we were surprised to have to climb stairs, duck doorways, and deal with wasps nests! The pool is fantastic and huge.

Also, I regret that you did not like the style and décor of your room and, in this connection, I would like to inform you that during last winter we renovated various rooms and also added some terraces in order to offer more comfortable and lovelier rooms. Our 24-hour complimentary shuttle service, run by our beautiful mahogany boat, is usually much appreciated and as you say, part of the charm of our hotel. It only takes five minutes to be in St. Mark’s square and the privilege of being on Giudecca island is to escape the crowds downtown. As far as our restaurants are concerned, I am sorry you could not find a table in one of our restaurants during your stay. If you will consider a stay in the future in our hotel, I will be delighted to show you our improvements and also to coordinate your booking.   Giampaolo Ottazzi General ManagerRead more
