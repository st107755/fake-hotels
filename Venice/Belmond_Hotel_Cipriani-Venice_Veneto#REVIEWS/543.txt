We have been to the Cipriani for our 40th after celebrating our 25th at the same hotel.We consider it the BEST hotel in Venice.The staff are extremely polite and helpful especially Robert. The breakfast is a good buffet served in a lovely dining room and weather permitting outside overlooking the lagoon.Lunch  and drinks can be taken from the poolside bar. There is no problem being on Guidecca island as the hotel has a private launch which ferries you back and forth to St Marks Square 24/7 . The evening  of our Wedding Anniversary we ate at Oro which was very good but be advised it is pricey. We will be back.jRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
