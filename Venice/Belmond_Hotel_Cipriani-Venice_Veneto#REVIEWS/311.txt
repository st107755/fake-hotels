This was one of our stopping points on a Euro tour.  We'd dined at The Cipriani previously and this time we stayed over.  As was expected, from start to finish the service, attention to detail, dining, bar and pool service, etc. was first class.  If it's good enough for us it's good enough for that American actor that also uses it.  We ate in at the hotel for dinner and lunch and the cuisine was exemplary, as was the service.  We had a wait for our table one evening and had a complementary drink in the bar to fill the void.  The pool has plenty of grounds so you're not on top of each other and there's a drinks service provided.  The dress code has been relaxed (progress?) and smoking is allowed on the terrace which at breakfast was an irritation but hey, times change. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
