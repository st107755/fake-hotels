Our two-night stay at the Cirpriani was part of our Orient Express train journey. The hotel though old was very well maintained. Our room was spotless and big by European standards! Bathroom was clean and had first-class bath amenities.   Staff were professional and friendly. They make you feel like returning guests. Always ready with a smile. Breakfast buffet was very good and had a lot of choices.  Though the hotel is in another island across the main tourist area of San Marco, their 24/7 boat service was very convenient to get you across. But to be honest, my husband and I welcomed the peace and quiet of the hotel's location.Read moreDate of stay: March 20141 RepostHelpfulShare
