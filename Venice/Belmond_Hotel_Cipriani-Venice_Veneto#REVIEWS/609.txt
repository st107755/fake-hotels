we stayed at the Cipriani for one night , had a beautiful Junior Suite facing the sea. I could watch the boats passing buy from my bed. The room was big with a nice sitting area all redone but old fashioned a very big shower. The TV was old fashioned but sufficient no flat screen. We came by boat from the airport it was a beautiful easy boat ride. Service the Italian way with lots of charm and heart. Prizes like the Costa Smeralda in Sardegna but you know that before you go. We liked the feel of the hotel, the gardens are beautiful an old fashioned pool (no infinity pool) very nice boutiques with things you only find in Venice . I happen to like lace and glass ! Yes its expensive ! We had nice salads and spagettis in the bar nothing special, simple ! You pay for the simplicityâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
