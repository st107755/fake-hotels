While used to 5 star hotels all over the world, it always feels an extra treat to return to this place. Perfection lies in the detail. The hotel is not new by all means and some updates are needed, but it is all about service, friendly & honest professionalism and savoir vivre. When visiting Venice in summer the pool & brekafast on the the patio add additional moments of luxury. On my last visit in May the only fault i could find was the over-salted hamburger in my room service and having to wait a few minutes for my breakfast table . Looking forwardd to be back in September.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
