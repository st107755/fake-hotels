As other reviews have noted, this is wonderful place to stay. Quick and easy into St Marks square but quiet and peaceful at the hotel. Food was top notch and not too overpriced (but this is Venice....) and service was warm and professional. Room in the separate place building was good with a nice view, although I think I will stick to the main building next time (you don’t actually spend most of the day looking out the window)!  Cip Club has the same view anyway. Photos below are from our room. Stayed in 	Vendramin Suite With St Marks View at around €2700/night.

I am glad to learn that your stay was almost flawless but in the future you will prefer staying in the main building rather than Palazzo Vendramin overlooking St.Mark's basin. Also, I am delighted to share your rewarding comments with our staff and I look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back in the future.
