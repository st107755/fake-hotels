We recently spent 3 nights at the Cipriani to celebrate our Silver wedding. The service throughout was excellent as were the surroundings. We were a little disappointed in the bedroom size and the window didn't do justice to the beautiful view , being  long and narrow. However the balcony made up for it. We ate at both the bar and the lovely Cips restaurant on the water. Both were excellent with delicious sole in Cips being my favourite. Beautifully fresh and beautifully cooked! The only thing that struck us as strange is that the pool bar closed at 7, re opening at 10 whilst the bar closed at 10 so we found ourselves  moving from one to the other along with the staff!! That being said, we had a fabulous time and can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
