venice is a beautiful place but this hotel doesnt do it justice. my second visit to venice but first to this property and i cannot emphasise the dissapointment i endurered. from the moment i stepped off the water taxi i was disspointed with all before me. first no concierge to help with the bags, dissapointing rooms irrespective of the price, when you factor in the price (2,400 euros per night) even more depressing. food by the pool dissapointing, at least there was a pool and not to crowded.  would recommend the ca'sa gredo hotel for anyone above this place, better rooms and friendlier atmosphere. cipriani obviously has an awesome publicity machine selling this average property. a few bulgari cosmetics in the bathroom does not make up for the other faults.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
