We stayed three days in April at the start of a celebration trip in Italy. Received an unexpected free upgrade to a junior suite, which was really great. The staff were absolutely excellent throughout, we even tested the 'Jose' concept (watch their promo video!), and left a knotted necklace chain with the concierge while we went for dinner, and sure enough they'd untangled it when we got back).   Expensive? Yes. Probably the most expensive hotel I've ever paid to stay in, and that's before the upgrade which would (for our budget) been eyewatering. Worth it? Yes, for the special celebration on the trip.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 31, 2018Dear John W,  I with to thank you very much for your review based on your stay in April and for sharing it.
