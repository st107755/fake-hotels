This is the Venetian dream. Concierge is fantastic , nothing too much trouble and great local suggestions for restaurants. Breakfast out in the gardens over the lagoon is heavenly. Faultless and very personalised stay. A perfect partner with the orient express. Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
