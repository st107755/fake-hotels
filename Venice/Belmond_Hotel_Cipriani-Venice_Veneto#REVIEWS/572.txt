This was the second time our family has had the good fortune to spend time at the Cipriani, and each time we were treated with kindness, class and wonderful service. It is difficult to put into words just how lovely the property and the staff are, but if you have a chance, this is one place you must visit. The rooms are fine, but the elegance of the pool, the grounds, the shuttle to st. marks square, and the restaurants are legendary. The concierge staff knows everything there is to know about Venice, and Roberto makes you feel like you are home each time you arrive at the dock. The prices are high, but the memories are priceless.
