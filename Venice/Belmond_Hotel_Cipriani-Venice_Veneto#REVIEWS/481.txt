Worth every penny and then some. Service, ambiance, grounds, rooms, food and beverage, staff are all top notch. we wanted for nothing and the staff was ever present when we did and non intrusive when we didn't. Yes it is across the lagoon from Venice which made it all the better when we wanted to escape the crowds, chaos and tour groups from the cruise ships. Peace and Tranquility with all that Venice, Murano, Burano & Lido provide just a short boat ride away. A must visit.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
