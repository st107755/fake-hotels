We were amazed by the personal service, every single staff member was excellent! The pool was such a nice temperature and so deep in one end and shallow in the over so it was great to dive and just chill and drink! Our view out of the windows was stunning. In one window we looked our the beautiful Venice and all the boats and in the other we looked over the equal beautiful and well kept gardens! Our family went into town often and it was so easy, the boat came to town and back in 15 minutes max. If you want to relax by the pool, go into town and sleep so peacefully ( did I mention the rooms and the beds where so comfy) the Cipriani is the place to be in Venice. It definitely made my stay in Venice worth while!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
