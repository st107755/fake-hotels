It's always such a pleasure to return to this classic Grand Dame of Venice.    A stunning peaceful retreat from the bustling vibe of Venice.  From the moment you step off the boat you feel welcomed by the gracious and professional staff.  Special thanks to German, Stefano, and Lorenzo in the restaurant.  German helped me choose a beautiful wine.  I always like to try wines I've never had when I travel.    Roberto and Sebastiano and all the concierge team provided service with excellence!  Thank you to the Housekeeping & room service teams for all the details provided in my room!  Opportunities for improvement:  Some of the pool staff could be more friendly.  Look forward to my next visit!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
