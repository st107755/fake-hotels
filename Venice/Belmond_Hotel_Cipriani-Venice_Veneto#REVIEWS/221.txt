We visited here for a special evening meal and got here by private boat. You need to book in advance but it's worth it and somewhere special. This is the way to be treated - and you might even see a star or two. The service is top notch with food to match. It's top end and exclusive and get there early to enjoy the atmosphere- and a cocktail in the gardens or by the pool !!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
