My friend and I took the hotel  courtesy boat from St Marks to The Cipriani for lunch,  From the moment we stepped off the boat when the staff greeted us, the experience was perfect. We explored the beautiful gardens and then had lunch at Cips, overlooking the lagoon.  We had an aperitif first and then a wonderful light meal which neither of us could fault. Considering we were in Venice, in a delightful setting with a superb view, the prices were not outrageous.   All the staff were charming and professional.   I would stay there on my next visit.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
