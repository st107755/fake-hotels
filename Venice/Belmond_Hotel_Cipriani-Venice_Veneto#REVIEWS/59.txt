The Cipriani is located on Giudecca Island, about a 5 minute private shuttle ride, across the lagoon, to the chaos of St. Mark's Square.  One of the main reasons we chose the Cipriani, was it's peace and tranquility.  We weren't stuck with the masses morning, noon, and night.  If we wanted to relax and get away from the crowds for a bit, the hotel helped us do just that.  The private shuttle the hotel provides to St. Mark's and back every 5 minutes was extremely convenient.  Our room was lovely, and had a view of St. Mark's across the lagoon.  We could almost see the beginning of the Grand Canal.  The hotel grounds are well maintained, beautiful, and relaxing to stroll about.  The olympic sized saltwater pool is stunning.  The on-site vegetable and herb gardens are delightful. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 29, 2019Dear JeremiahChris,  I would like to thank you very much for your extensive review based on your personal experience at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani and for sharing it with the community.
