We arrived here unplanned and stayed for lunch in the bar.  Yes it's expensive but if you didn't know that until the bill arrived you have been less than smart.  The food was excellent and the wine superb and still cheaper than equivalent Hotels in say Mayfair in London. The service is classy and the setting gorgeous. It makes for a great treat and is almost value for money if places like this ever can be. It's not real world for most of us but I suspect many come here to escape the real world for awhile.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
