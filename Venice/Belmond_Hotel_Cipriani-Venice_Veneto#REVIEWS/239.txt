Wow, what a hotel. To the hotel staff - thank you for making our stay such a fabulous one.   We went for my wife's 50th and we are both so pleased we chose to stay at the Cipriani.  The staff were outstanding and the hotel is absolutely fantastic as is Venice! Everything was just perfect, the decor, the food and the atmosphere. If you have the chance to go to this hotel - GO! We were thoroughly spoilt and made to feel special.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
