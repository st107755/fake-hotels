My husband and I stayed at the Cipriani for 2 nights at the end of our 21-day Italian adventure.  What a way to wind up our trip!!!  We stayed in an elegant, well-appointed room overlooking the waterway and grounds with a large balcony.  The room furnishings and bathroom were classy, and the service couldn't have been better.  My husband said that it was the best hotel experience he's ever had, and we are frequent AMX Fine Hotels and Resorts customers so that's saying a lot.  I really loved the pool!  My massage was incredible as well.  All-in-all, the Hotel Cipriani provided a very elegant and and amazing experience.  You will not be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
