This hotel has a charm of its own and is undoubtely unforgettable in many ways. Unfortunately ,unless you pay a lot for a suite (which are OVERPRICED) ,you find yourself in rooms with OLD (not ancient) furniture,which are quite unconfortable. Nothing to say about the excellent public spaces and services offered.  For a lower price ,I experienced SAN CLEMENTE  of TURIN HOTELS , a 5 Luxury -rated hotel ,with excellent rooms ,spacious ,newly refurbished. The decor of SAN CLEMENTE is simply impressive and there  is a 'vaporetto' (boat service ) to Piazza San Marco every 20 mins. For those who want luxury, excellence .I strongly recommend the SAN CLEMENTE (XV century) rather than an over priced CIPIRIANIRead moreHelpfulShare
