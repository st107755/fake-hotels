This was a birthday present starting with a trip on the Orient Express, finishing with 3 nights at the Cipriani. Quality of room, service from all sections was excellent. Never had any problems when asking for advise and service from staff. Thanks for a wonderful birthday.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
