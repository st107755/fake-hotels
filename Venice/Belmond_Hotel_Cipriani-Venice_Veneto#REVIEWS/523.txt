We recently returned for 7 nights at this magical hotel for a special family event. It is a beautiful setting and is meticulously maintained.  What always sets places apart for me though, is service.  I cannot thank the staff enough for what will remain a very special memory.  Thank you and I hope to be able to return sometime soon.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
