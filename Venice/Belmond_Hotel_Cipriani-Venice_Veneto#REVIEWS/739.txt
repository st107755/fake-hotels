Our family of five had the most wonderful time! The ambiance is superlative and service even better. We were so impressed by the warm welcome we received by the entire hotel staff, including Roberto and Gianni. What a pleasure to have them arrange the perfect 18th birthday for my son at Cips. It was so great to be able to leave the busy island to return to this elegant oasis across the grand canal. I can't imagine staying anywhere but here in Venice!! Thank you to everyone for making our trip unforgettable. We will be back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
