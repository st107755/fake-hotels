arrived to find that we had been up graded to a lagoon view suite.  Stunning views from the balcony.  The open air pool was great for a swim before breakfast.  Service exceptional.  Avoid the resteraunt over priced and indeferent quality.  You expect that in a 5 star hotel the kitchen staff should be able to peel prawns and not leave bits and also mansge to do the washing up correctly.  We had to send back cutlery which was dirty.  Overall an excelent stay with one disapointing mealRead moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
