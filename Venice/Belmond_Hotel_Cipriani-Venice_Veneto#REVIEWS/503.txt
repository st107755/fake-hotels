What we loved abut this place was its location right across from San Marcos square.  It was great to spend the day shopping and then come back to the serenity of Hotel Cipriani.  The service, food and cocktails were excellent.  Our lagoon view room balcony was actually quite tired and located right above the dock for the hotel shuttle.  Our direct view was of both the hotel and the lagoon - it wasn't the best view.  The hotel gardens were whimsical and beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
