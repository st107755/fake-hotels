Was there in early September for 4 nights with my wife. It's simply a classic.  Service is just great, on par with the other hotels of the same chain like the Splendido and Villa San Michele. The concierge desk knows all the good tips and can schedule everything you need, staff gets to know your name from day 1 etc.   The grounds are unique in Venice. A fantastic olympic-size swimming pool, great terrace for breakfast and afternoon drinks, beautiful gardens, a clay tennis court and kid's club (our kids did not go but it's quite alright).  The rooms may be weak, a bit old and cramped (depends of course on the category) and could be upgraded in a place that starting rates are 1000eu. However, that did not bother me as got very lucky with the weather and stayed out on the town mostâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
