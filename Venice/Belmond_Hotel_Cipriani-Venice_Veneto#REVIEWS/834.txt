this place is just heaven. Order Bellinis and sit in the terrace garden as the sun sets and the pianist starts to play - its just magical.  We stayed in a junior suite in the Palazzo which is just a short walk from reception but its worth it as you get unbelieveable views across the lagoon to St Marks square.  The swimming pool is slightly salty so swim with your mouth closed.  We had our first dinner at the Cips club restaurant at a table on the pontoon - it was so romantic and the food was wonderful.  The boat ride across to St Marks is probably my favourite part of our stay as its just incredible.Read moreHelpfulShare
