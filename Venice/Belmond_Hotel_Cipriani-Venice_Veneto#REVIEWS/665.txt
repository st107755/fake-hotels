This hotel has a great reputation and well deserves it.  From being met at the St Lucia rail station and whisked by motor lauch down the Grand Canal to the hotels landing stage to breakfast on the terrace overlooking Venice Lagoon, the Cipriani  is a delightful haven of peace and old world charm.  The hotel's private motor launch runs every 15 minutes (day and night) to a private landing pier by St Mark's Square so Venice sights are only a few minutes away.  Don't expect cheap, because it isn't, but you get what you pay for in quality and service.   Highly recommended for a special ocasion and especially if travelling from Venice on the Orient Express when the organisation to get from the hotel to the train makes the transfer effortless.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
