the worst restaurant experience in my life as the whole water on the tent of the cip's restaurant came on top of me and my girlfriend despite the fact that the last rain in the city was 5 hours ago. this happened at late night and we felt freezing during the whole evening. i paid my whole bill regardless despite wasting my 450 euro wine to this incident just so i would be able to properly and objectively complain here. the staff acted as if this is normal course of life despite the fact that 3-4 kgs of water came on top of me at 10:15 pm! really a horrible experience. beware!Read moreDate of stay: April 20176 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
