What a wonderful hotel.  It is in a fantastic location, just a 10 minute boat ride (in the hotel's private lauch) from St Mark's square and has super views across the lagoon towards the Lido.  The staff are simply sensational, friendly and well informed but not intrusive.  We were given an upgrade on arrival and a tour of the facilities.  You can feel the passion the staff have for their jobs and the hotel.  The suite we were given was magnificent, 5+ quality throughout.  Our only gripe, no tea making facilities in the room.  The hotel also has a lovely rose garden which we enjoyed walking around after breakfast.  The smell is just lovely.  Breakfast is at Oro's and is exceptional as you'd expect and has great views across the lagoon.  It is expensive but it's well worth theâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
