Stayed there with my husband and child in April. This is the best hotel  I have stayed in with regard to views, service and breakfast. The outdoor swimming pool is a little corner of Paradise. Cip's club restaurant has a fantastic view of St Marks Square and as the sun goes down and the lights come on across the lagoon,  is magical. Loved the boat ride to Venice every morning and we also arranged to be met by the hotel staff at Marco Polo airport with a private shuttle and water taxi transfer (half an hour boat ride to the hotel) and we departed in the same way.
