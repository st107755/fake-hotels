A very classy hotel which obviously has some very aristocartic type clients.  It is a very expensive hotel which will cost you especially with the EURO being so strong right now.  the rooms are not overly spacious but the facilities are stupendous with a huge pool, spa and top class restaurants.  The bar is rather stuffy and you feel that you would have to be retired and a fan of sherry and single malt whiskies in order to fit in.  Take advantage - but be aware - of the free boat tour to Murano island that the hotel provides but has obviously arranged with one of the premier (and most expensive) venitian glass makers.  They will send you there on a private boat limo (15 mins through venice which is quite nice) and once there you are taken on a tour with a "used car salesman"â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2005HelpfulShare
