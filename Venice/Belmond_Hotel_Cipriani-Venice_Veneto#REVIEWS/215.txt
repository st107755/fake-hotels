We stayed for the final five nights of our Belmond Italian 'Grand Tour' and found this hotel to be beautiful and elegant with the highest levels of service we have experienced anywhere. We were greeted graciously and charmingly by Roberto (and his tortoise Roberta) and from that moment on, we felt like guests in a calm and beautiful oasis a 5 minute boat ride away from the stunning but crowded St Mark's Square. We loved all the restaurants for dinner and breakfast and the service was without exception excellent. Our room, with a beautiful balcony overlooking the lagoon and traditional Venetian furniture, was perfect. The Olympic-size pool and excellent poolside service and drinks made for a relaxed afternoon after a morning of Venetian sightseeing.....a truly exceptional hotelâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
