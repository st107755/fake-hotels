We traveled to Venice on the Orient Express which was fantastic, and as we approached the Cipriani by boat we knew straight away we were in for another treat. The hotel is wonderful - the best hotel we have ever stayed in! The staff were excellent and made us feel at home straight away. Our suite was amazing with a view across the lagoon, which we could have looked at for hours. We went for a swim in the outdoor heated pool which was great, and although I think the hotel was pretty full it never seemed busy. Its just such a great place to stay and we will definitely return!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
