Had the pleasure to stay in one of the suites overlooking the pool, the room had a great terrace where you can relax after a long day walking in Venice. Probably the only hotel in Venice with a huge pool with sea water. It’s truly a luxury experience, you’re in Venice but the hotel itself is quiet is perfect to relax. Has great restaurants, 2 Michelin star Oro and Chips club. Early breakfast on the terrace is so relaxing. Take a walk in the garden behind the hotel, which has ducks and rabbits.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
