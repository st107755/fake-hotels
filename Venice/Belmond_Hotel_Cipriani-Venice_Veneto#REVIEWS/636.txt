This was our second stay at the Cipriani.  This is truly an elegant hotel.  I am not sure what some of the reviews are referring to when they say the hotel requires updating.  My family and I had three rooms and they were beautifully furnished and impeccably clean. The staff was wonderful,  attentive and eager to please.  The setting and the gardens are beautiful and access to St. Mark's Sq. is very convenient by hotel watertaxi.  As stated in other reviews, the hotel is expensive but for me and my family the experience was worth it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
