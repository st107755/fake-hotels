We spent the first night of our Venice holiday at the Cipriani.  We had a lovely time and the staff were most helpful.

The hotel's water taxi from St Marks is an excellent service and so easy to find when you arrive from the airport.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Jul 2, 2018Dear CasaPedroBarrera,  Thank you for taking the time to share your personal experience with the community.
