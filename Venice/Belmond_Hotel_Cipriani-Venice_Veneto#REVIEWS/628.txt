Beautiful Hotel in fantastic location.  Continuous courtesy boat the St Marco.  We had a suite with a large roof terrace that was beautiful - fantastic room!  Gardens and pool are great.  Breakfast very good.  This Hotel offers the highest of standards.  I didn't pay for it as it was a birthday gift, but clearly not the cheapest hotel in Venice.  For a special occasion treat yourself and if you fancy travelling on the Orient Express go for it - very civilised!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
