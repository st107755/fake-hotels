Having stayed in Deia on many occasion the manager of La Residencia made me promise that if ever in Venice we would go to the Cipriani to stay or have lunch. We took advantage of the complimentary boat from St Marks and within an hour and a half returned in the same style. We had a table around the pool which was the only restaurant open and although we enjoyed prosecco and water after 30 minutes our food had failed to show. As we left I complained and was told the kitchen was very busy and it wouldn't long. As there were diners at just 5 tables it was difficult to accept. The barman to his credit apologised and declined to take pay for anything. We didn't want free drinks but a special romantic lunch. I don't know what else to say.Read moreDate of stay: October 20164 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
