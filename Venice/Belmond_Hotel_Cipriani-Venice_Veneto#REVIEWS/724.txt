The legacy of this hotel tied in with the Orient Express train from Paris - Venice is a glamourous package to be sure. But the hotel on it's own is pretty much a typical 5* hotel in terms of service and amenities that one would expect anyway.  Stayed here for 3 nights in early November 2011 and hotel was nice and rooms were lovely. Service in the restaurants are a bit hit and miss but generally ok if you ask to speak with the restaurant manager as it then gets sorted out pretty quickly.  Just be aware that you are not near where all the main attractions in Venice are so it's always a bit of a traipse getting about the sights even with the hotel boat. Personally I would only stay here if I'm not doing much in the main attractions like San Marco or Accademia etc districts. Veryâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
