From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the service at the Cipriani was outstanding.   This is an old fashioned hotel in every way (including the decor and the majority of the guests) but this is what makes it feel very unique and special.  Best place to be in Venice, quiet but close to all the action from the hotels launch - yes it is 'expensive' but in return is totally exclusive.  Will definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
