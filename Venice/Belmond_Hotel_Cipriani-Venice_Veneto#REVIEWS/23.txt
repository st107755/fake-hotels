For most of us this resort is very much a special occasion kind of place.  If you are coming from the main island of Venice a boat will pick you up just by St Mark's Square and take you to this wonderful hotel on Isola della Guidecca.  Allow time to have a drink in the pool side bar, there are a host of special cocktails and they come with delicious nibbles!   Dinner at the Oro is quite the experience, the tasting menu and wine pairing are definitely an extravagance but a wonderful culinary adventure.  The staff are amazing and the whole evening is very special.  Potentially more than you are likely to spend on a meal in most places in the world. but if you want something truly memorable, then go for it!Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from jumps63, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Nov 4, 2019Dear Femida M,  I would like to thank you very much for taking the time to share your review and for your beautiful words of appreciation.
