The hotel itself was very nice and we were upgraded to a suite with a huge balcony overlooking the pool and a lovely sunken bathroom.  Can't fault the room, but don't know the exact price as it was part of a package, but it won't have been cheap.  The hotel drinks are expensive, but this comes with the territory, so shouldn't be a shock.  My only advice would be don't dine in the Ors restaurant as overpriced and the Cips restaurant is much better, but is is far better value to dine / drink elsewhereRead moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
