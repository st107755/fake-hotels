Didn't eat dinner here but breakfast was amazing huge selection of fresh fruits, cereals , baked goods and eggs cooked to order. Beautiful views over lagoon to St Marks.  Room was large and quiet and very comfortable.  Everything you would expect from 5 stars! Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
