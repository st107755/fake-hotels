The welcoming to our arrival was so warm and friendly although we arrived late . I expected a better property in general . It's out dated and needs an up-grade . My room had an amazing view over looking the water. After a good sleep the setting for breakfast was so romantic but the selection for the buffet was a disappointment . But I must stress that the courtesy and the help of the wonderful staff has made my stay more enjoyable .Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
