From the point our water taxi drew up to the dock to the time we sadly left the hotel and staff did not disappoint our stay here was amazing. The greeting at the dock followed by the checking in was very welcoming, and Michael who then took us to our room showing us the main points of the hotel was a star. The hotel room afforded us a stunning water and garden  view from the balcony. The room was well appointed and of a sensible size. Meals in the restaurant and bar were very pleasant and the service in all areas was exceptional. The hotel was of a high decorative standard with lovely gardens and a swimming pool that we would look forward to using if we visit in a warmer time of year.  Very memorable start to a trip on the Orient Express, thank you.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
