Thankfully the bedlinen has been changed. But you don't have to be a Clooney fan to enjoy this hotel.  It is impressive and everything you would want from Venice. Enjoy the private boat to and from your private island that the hotel sits on, especially enjoyable when there are queues waiting for water taxis and you get to sit in your own Cipriani bench on the dock, so everyone passing by knows you are being chauffeured off to sleep at the same hotel as Clooney. The hotel is majestic, the staff attentive, and the experience uplifting.   Go for it, and you may just end up on a sunbed next to George Clooney.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
