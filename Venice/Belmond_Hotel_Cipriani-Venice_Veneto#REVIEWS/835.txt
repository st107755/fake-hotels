We stayed at the Cipriani in late Sept 2003. The hotel generally lives up to expectations - secluded position on Guidecca, private launch to Venice part of its charm, and the rooms and service all you'd expect from a 5 Star establishment. However, room rates are very high in the main season, and costs for simple extras such as shirt ironing are excessive. Staff are efficient in the main, without being over-friendly. Overall it has to be highly recommended for the setting alone, but not quite the full 5 star rating.Read moreHelpfulShare
