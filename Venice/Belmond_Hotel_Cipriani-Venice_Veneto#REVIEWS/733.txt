A fabulous stay. Everything was right about this hotel (but be warned, it is expensive, but still good value). Gorgeous location, delicious food, excellent friendly service throughout. The management is top notch, personal and utterly professional. Exceeded our expectations (as well as our budget, but absolutely worth it!)Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
