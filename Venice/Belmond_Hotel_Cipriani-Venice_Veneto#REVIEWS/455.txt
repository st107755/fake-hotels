We stayed at the Cipriani for a two night stay after arriving on the Orient Express. We had a suite which was to a very high standard and every attention to detail - as you would expect. The view over the Lagoon was spectacular. We ate in Cip's Club on the decked area over the Lagoon which is a "must" - really good food in a perfect setting. The staff in the Hotel and Cip's were excellent and the concierges were very helpful.  As another reviewer mentioned there were some minor issues over breakfast orders but to be fair I would view that as my failing to speak Italian! The water taxi to St Mark's Square runs every 20 minutes 24 hours a day.  Overall a wonderful experience and one I would love to repeat.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
