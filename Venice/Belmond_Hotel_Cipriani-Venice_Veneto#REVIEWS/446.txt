I have been lucky enough to stay in many of the best hotels in the world but in my  humble experience I would have to rate the Belmond Cipriani as my No 1 - the service is beyond 7 star and I can totally see why George Clooney chose this this for his wedding. The views from all the rooms are just spectacular and the personal attention to detail is almost extraordinary. I was also above impressed with the food and wine selection. I really cannot wait to return as soon as its open again for the next season early in the spring.  My best advice would be to arrive on the Orient Express, which is also a once in a life time experience. Although I hope to be spoilt and return every year. Its just too good to miss :-)Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
