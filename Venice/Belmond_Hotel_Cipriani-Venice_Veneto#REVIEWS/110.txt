Myself and my wife stayed here for 3 nights in September 2018. The service here was second to none. From the moment we arrived by water taxi to the day we left was a memorable experience that will never be forgotten. This is one the most expensive hotels in Venice so everything, obviously, is very expensive. Although there is 24/7 complimentary water transport from the hotel to Venice (St. Marks Square) that takes about 6 minutes.  The hotel has a lovely almost olympic size outdoor heated filtered salt water swimming pool which was absolutely brilliant for relaxing after a days sightseeing around Venice. If you are celebrating a special occasion, this is the hotel to say in one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Sep 19, 2018Dear Trevor B,  I would like to thank you very much for staying with us and for sharing your enthusiastic comments on TripAdvisor.
