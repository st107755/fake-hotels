A very posh and elegant hotel, it's small and cosy yet very luxurious.. The people who work there will always greet you with your name and they make you feel like home. The room is constantly cleaned the second you leave the hotel and the restaurant is just amazing. Had the best breakfast there with amazing view and they had all kinds of food for all kinds of diets, I love this place.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
