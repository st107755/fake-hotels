Had two nights in the Cipriani as part of an Orient Express trip as a birthday gift from my better half.  From the second we arrived we were so well looked after.  Our room overlooking the pond with the turtles and the private landing dock  was superb.  Huge room, huge bed, huge bathroom and it appeared from the floor plan we had one of the smaller rooms on the floor.  Staff in the bar were friendly and attentive.   We did a walking tour of hidden venice organised via orient express, the cipriani private motor taxis dropped us of at st marks piaza.  Perfect location to start getting off the normal tourist visit points. Did eat in Cips one night and will do a separate review of that. Fantastic couple of days in a superb hotel. Just don't focus on the price tags.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
