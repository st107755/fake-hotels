We have just returned from our honeymoon in Italy and the Cipriani was amazing. We had their private transfer which was superb and recieved the warmest welcome from Roberto at the hotel jetty. We were upgraded to a junior suite overlooking the garden however we were a little disappointed in the room, no cd player, a little small and in need of updating but this I suppose is part of the Cipriani's charm.We soon realised the service was incredible and the pool the best we have ever seen. This was the best food we have ever been served especially the Cips Club, a beautiful evening to treasure, we also had breakfast here...Superb. We can't wait to return however this time only if we could stay in Palazzo V. So perhaps our 5 year anniversary. Read moreHelpfulShare
