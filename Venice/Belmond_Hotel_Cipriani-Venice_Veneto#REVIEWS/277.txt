We had wanted to stay at the Cipriani for some time but never quite made it. This time we made it for our 35th wedding anniversary and it was just as good as we'd expected. Our room was lovely and had a separate seating area plus a large bathroom and a very comfortable bed also 2 balconies. On arrival the person checking us in first of all got the wrong person and then the wrong dates - not a good start especially as we had booked via the hotel website!! When this was sorted out we had lunch as our room wasn't quite ready and after lunch were shown to the lovely room where a complimentary bottle of fizz and an amazing chocolate cake awaited us. The bar area was very nice and you could eat outside as well. The main restaurant was however disappointing but the Cip club was good.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
