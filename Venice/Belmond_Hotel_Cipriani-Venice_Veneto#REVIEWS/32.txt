While I am delighted to learn that you found our property a 'fantastic place' at the same time I am sorry to learn that you could not thoroughly enjoy your stay due to some noise due the behaviour of the room on the second floor. As far the improvements that you suggest at the breakfast and Cip's Club, please feel free to contact me directly in order to share more details.
