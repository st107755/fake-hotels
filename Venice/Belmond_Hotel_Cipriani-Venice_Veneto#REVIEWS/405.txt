Such a luxurious and awesome experience surely if you can afford it, the place is very small but very classy.  The room is always kept clean the second you walk out of it the house keeping takes good care of it.  The hotel provides their own boats every 10 mins to go to the city square. The food collection was beyond awesome for breakfast, whatever your diet is, you'll find what to eat.  People working their at the reception are so friendly,helpful and they'll know you by name.   Such an awesome place to stay for vacation. Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
