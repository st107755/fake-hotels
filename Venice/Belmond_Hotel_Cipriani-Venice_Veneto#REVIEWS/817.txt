Fabulous  luxurious hotel in a truly   magical setting. Wished we  could have stayed longer than 2 nights.  We visited for a wedding anniversary and  booked  a standard room as part of  Orient Express train  package  but were thrilled to be  upgraded on arrival  - without asking  - to a lovely spacious   junior suite with  2 tvs, 2 bathrooms  - one with jacuzzi - and a huge  bed.  The bathrooms were  stuffed with  oodles of   high quality  toiletries and there were also pots of chocolates and sweets in the room, we felt pampered.  Sadly didn't have time to try out the swimming pool  but  it looked wonderful. Great gardens and lagoon views.   Friendly  and efficient staff everywhere eg   on reception,  porterage,  private  ferry to Venice  and  bar,( we sat on the garden terraceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2005HelpfulShare
