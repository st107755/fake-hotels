Booked and paid a room in April for a much planned trip with friends.  Unfortunately we were forced to cancel as my father in law got extremely ill and was forced to stay in intensive care.  Being 85 we knew they would need us around in the days to come and knew that we would not be able to use the reservation made.  Called the hotel, explained, asked to either be refunded or at least to have the reservation changed.  The hotel is simply not willing to accommodate or arrange for alternatives. Being a world class hotel and having paid 1800 euros for a room, we would have expected the hotel to be a little bit considerate, understanding or accommodating of its guests.  It was not their issue, got their money, the rest was really not something they would consider caring about.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 20151 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Ms. Marta,  I am sorry if it took me so long to  answer your comments.  I would like to apologize if in some ways we have not met your expectations and that at the end you could not travel to Venice.  Unfortunately your booking was made for our Biennale period at the beginning of May and the cancellation policy during that period was particularly strict but very well written in our confirmation.  I hope you will have another opportunity to come and visit us in order for you to have a more objective opinion about our standard of service and I am sure we will be able to meet your customer service expectations.  With best regards,  Giampaolo Ottazzi General Manager Belmond Hotel CiprianiRead more
