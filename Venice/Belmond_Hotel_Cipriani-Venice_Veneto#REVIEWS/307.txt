What an amazing Hotel!! It's location is sublime, just 5 minutes away by launch from the hustle and bustle of St Marco to a world so refined, relaxed, beautiful and welcoming! From the moment we alighted our launch upon arrival we were greeted with such care and courtesy and shown around this breathtaking property! This hotel is really special! We were checked in, given a lovely room upgrade by a lovely lady called Alessandra (called Alex locally) who could not have been more welcoming and friendly. No stuffiness here, just good old hospitality and exceptional hotel keeping! There was absolutely nothing you could have complained about! The property has a large and beautiful swimming pool, the gardens throughout are simply beautiful whilst supplying the hotel with all their ownâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
