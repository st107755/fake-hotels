We are here on a recent stay in Venice. We had a lovely boat road to the hotel and were made to feel very special the whole night. The hotel gave us lots of little extras to try from the chef which we enjoyed all of. Our food was delicious and the staff were lovely. It's obviously an expensive meal but a great experience!
