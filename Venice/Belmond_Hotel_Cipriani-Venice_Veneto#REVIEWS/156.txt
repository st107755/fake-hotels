Warm personal greeting on arrival that was a constant warmth through out our stay. Excellent grounds and facilities surround this tranquil oasis in a vibrant city that even after several visits never fails to surprise and entertain us. Our room was garden facing with views of the canals just visible to our left and right, with ample space to rest and relax and a generous on suit. The pool area and bar are a treat to the senses and should be enjoyed when ever you can find the time to sit back and relax. dining in any of the restaurant's is a sensory pleasure on all levels, this has to be one of the best establishments we have stayed in to date.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Apr 30, 2018Dear Happyquests,  Thank you for your wonderful review and for taking the time to share it with the community.
