My husband had heard of the Cipriani for many years and wanted to try it despite the incredibly expensive (even for Venice) price.  Part of the problem is we inadvertantly were put in a suite and charged accordingly!  The room was gorgeous with lovely sitting room, comfortable bed, and enormous bathroom.  2 flat screen tv's and a balcony overlooking the "lagoon."  The staff was very helpful.  As a swimmer, I appreciated the Olympic size heated salt water pool.  The boat to St. Mark's Sq. was very convenient.  We ate at the Cipriani restaurant for dinner and it was good, but not great.  Next time I'd eat elsewhere.  And although I am glad I got to try the Cipriani, I would stay somewhere else next time- simply because of the price.Read moreDate of stay: April 2005HelpfulShare
