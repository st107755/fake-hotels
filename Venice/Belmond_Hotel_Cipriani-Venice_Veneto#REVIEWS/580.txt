A hotel perched on the edge of an island - yet close enough to boat trip to Venice and surroundings islands. Attention to detail is second to none. The hotel is perfectly managed and the service is polished to the extreme. Our 25th wedding aniversary could not have made better. The restuarants are classic. Expensive but well worth the money. Each part of our journey was planned with precision - travelling in style on the private boat to and from San Marco was magical. First class and the memories wont fade.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from jumpsvenezia, Direttore generale at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 11, 2013Dear Guest,  I appreciate your comments regarding your stay at our Property.
