We sat by the restaurant outside by the pool for the famous Bellini and enjoyed a Capaccio which was created like a masterpiece and scrumptious with every bite. We enjoyed the 5 star service, relaxation, beautiful views, and people watching. If your lucky enough to stay at this hotel you wonâ€™t be disappointed. The grounds are pristine,well kept, filled with peace, serenity, and beauty to take your breath away. Worth checking out for a cocktail if your not a hotel guest.... highly recommend experiencing this place!Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Nov 13, 2018Dear laurieSue,  How wonderful to read your enthusiastic words about the Belmond Hotel Cipriani.
