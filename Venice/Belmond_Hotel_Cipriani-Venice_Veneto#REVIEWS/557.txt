Superb room with great decor and every facility. Fabulous view over lagoon and large swimming pool. Good light lunch in pool veranda and  larger menu in lagoon-side outside restaurant. Very good service and top dinner. The concierge and water taxi manager was most helpful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
