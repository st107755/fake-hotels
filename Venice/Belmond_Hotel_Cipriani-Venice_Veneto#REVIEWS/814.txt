a once in a lifetime experience that we intend to make a once in a year experience! exceptional in Every regard, beyond our expectations (which were very high). staff was highly professional - helpful, accomodating, and friendly. the grounds, rooms, food, service, pool, setting, spa, views..etc were as beautiful and pleasant as a fantasy. I had to keep pinching myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. all the top hotels in Europe are expensive, especially with the dollar against the euro. this is one of those hotels to splurge on - it will be a peak experience that you will cherish for your entire life. we can't wait to go back!
