A unique hotel in a unique location.  My travel agent is a member of Bellini Club, so we got an upgrade to a junior Suite.  This was a lovely room with a lagoon view and balcony.  There was a complementary bottle of prosecco waiting for us.  The hotel organised our transfers from the airport and back to join a cruise.    This, as you would expect, is a very expensive hotel.  Allow around 38 Euros for a sandwich in the bar  But the standards of service and quality of food are really top of the range.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Aug 10, 2018Dear  Martyn K,  I would like to thank you so much for your wonderful review and for taking the time to share your opinion with the Tripadvisor community.
