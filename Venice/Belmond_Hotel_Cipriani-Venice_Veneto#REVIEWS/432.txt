We spent 5 nights here on the tail end of our honeymoon and we are so glad we ended with them. It was the most up to par hotel we stayed at the duration of our 2.5 week honeymoon in Italy. First they have American plugs so no more blowing up any more of my hair tools. The concierge and front desk were beyond amazing! The two gentlemen in the bar made our trip! "The Jamie Special". Every single staff member went above and beyond to make our stay incredible and stress free. We loved it here! Thank you to all the staff who helped make our stay so wonderful! Say hi to Roberta for us and we will be back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
