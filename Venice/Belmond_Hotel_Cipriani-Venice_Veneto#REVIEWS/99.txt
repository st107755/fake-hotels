Eight of us had lunch by the pool at the Cipriani.  We had been there maybe 20 times before.  It is a lovely spot even though a hamburger costs 40 euros.  We always order a liter of the house wine, which is 36 euros.  This time the waiter said soave and I said sure thinking they had changed the house wine.  Well the sneaky waiter went and got a 72 euro bottle of soave, poured it into an empty liter glass and served it  When the check came and I complained, the waiter was gone and the other waiter claimed he was could not change it.  We did not leave a tip and won't go back.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from Giampaolo_Ottazzi, General Manager at Belmond Hotel CiprianiResponded Oct 9, 2018Dear  David G,  I thank you very much for your review concerning your lunch by the pool but I am very sorry to learn that your experience was not a positive one.
