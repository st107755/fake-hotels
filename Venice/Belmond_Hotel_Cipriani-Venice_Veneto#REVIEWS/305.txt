We had a very pleasant stay at the hotel in April 2016! We were lucky enough to get upgraded to a presidential suite! We had our 5yr old son in tow and the extra space was  great! The breakfast outside with superb, lagoon views fabulous! The pool and surrounds were fantastic though the food at the Porticciolo Pool restaurant was at best average! Staff were attentive and welcoming!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
