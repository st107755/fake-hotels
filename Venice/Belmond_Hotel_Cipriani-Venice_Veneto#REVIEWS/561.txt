It started by being picked up at the airport by my private boat for a ride to the hotel.  Check in was painless; in my room in 5 minutes and in bed after a shower, to get ready for cocktails on the terrace.  Swimming pool was huge and views of the city were great from the terrace.  Bedroom was spectacular with super bathroom, shower etc  all in all a great placeRead moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
