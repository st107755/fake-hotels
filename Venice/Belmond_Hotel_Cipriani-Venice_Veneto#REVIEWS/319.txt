What a stunning property! Gorgeous suites, so Venetian. The views are post card perfect & the food - incredible! But, it is the staff that sets this property apart. I felt like I was being welcomed home. So attentive, honest & helpful. They were being every bit themselves & this makes it so special.   The Olympic size heated swimming pool is a rare feature in Venice. The grounds, flowers & chefs gardens are delightful along with the chickens, gorgeous rabbits & resident turtle Roberto.  The Cip ( as it is fondly referred to) has a private transfer to whisk you in & out of St Marcos square at your whim.   Don't miss the champagne breakfast by the water & be sure to order a Bellini.  This was a very special stay. Perfect for your first time to Venice or even your fifth! Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
