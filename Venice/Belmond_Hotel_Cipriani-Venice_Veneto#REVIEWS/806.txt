The Cipriani is one of the high points of our civilization. I cannot think of a better-located, more elegant or comfortable hotel in the world. I will never stay at any other hotel in Venice. It is expensive but extremely beautiful, authentic and luxurious. The swimming pool is stunning and can there be a more delightful or decadent way to spend a day than to spend it by the pool at the Cipriani followed by a delicious lunch looking over the canals of Venice? One very small fly in the ointment is the rather fed-up and dismissive attitude of some of the staff but others more than make up for it by being very helpful. Try to avoid staying in the Vendramin - the main building is much better. Read moreDate of stay: July 2007HelpfulShare
