Wonderful, WOnderful WONDERFUL. This hotel is a must on anyone's bucket list..... Yes it is expensive, but if you have this as part of your orient express trip then you must have saved your pennies. The room was amazing overlooking the Lagoon, after the orient express trip the bed OMG the bed was so nice, we did not move all night! Food was great, trip to the center of Venice in the private launch amazing, move over George Clooney! Loved it so much will definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
