I really liked this hotel which exceeded my strong expectations; the hotel is truly 5 stars. Being situated on the Venetian island of Giudecca which is just minutes away from the main Venetian island is preferred after an exhausting morning exploring. The salt water pool at the Cipriani is huge and wonderfull for swimming laps. For those who like to run, the waterfront of Giudecca is 2.5 kilometers long for a perfect our-and-back 5K (the hotels small fitness center is more than adequate). The hotels restaurants were varied but if you plan on going, reserve a table at Cip's Club in advance. Its a special place what with its views of St. Marks Square.  We had the garden view suite and the room was sublime.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
