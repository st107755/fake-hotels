We travelled to Venice with our son (10). We have been to Venice several times and always want to travel around by water, and then wander the streets. Hotel was a great base to see Venice - better than we imagined. The boat from the hotel to St Marks goes every 30mins from first thing to 1am. Efficient and on time and provides a good sense of the city in the lagoon. The island is some way away from Venice proper (there is no direct view of the city) but it did not pose any issues, and you can see the tower from the bar.  Given the heat, it is really good to be able to stop in the middle of the day, come back to the great pool, and refresh before tackling the city again. The pool is really excellent, and they manage the beds etc well, and so you can usually find a spot to hangâ€¦Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
