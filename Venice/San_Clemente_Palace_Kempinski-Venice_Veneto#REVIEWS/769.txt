We stayed here in a suite for 2 nights before boarding a cruise.   We arrived here by water taxi from the airport. The trip itself was very scenic. This is a picturesque property with a pool and beautiful paths and areas to explore. The suite had a gorgeous view of Venice.    Amazing service from all staff. The concierge organized a complimentary excursion to Murano Island to watch a glass blowing demonstration.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, drinks from the bar, and lunch at the cafe by the pool. The freshly made wood oven pizzas were delicious!  Piazza San Marco is a 10 minute boat ride via the hotel's complimentary shuttle service. The shuttle boats were beautiful and the kids enjoyed the ride. Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
