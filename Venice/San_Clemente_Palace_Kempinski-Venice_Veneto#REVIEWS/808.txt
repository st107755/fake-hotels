From the moment we arrived we were in love with the hotel and it's wonderful staff.  My daughters, niece and I received a very warm welcome and were in awe of the hotel's beauty.  The d√©cor was truly amazing and the staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful.  By far, our favorite hotel of our trip to Italy.  It's not inexpensive but worth every penny.  I cannot say enough good things!  Can't wait to go back one day!  Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
