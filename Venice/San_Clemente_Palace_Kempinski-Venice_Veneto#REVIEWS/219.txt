Back once again to the best Hotel in Venice as on previous reviews of have said. Just love our times here always at the end of June for my wifes birthday. I spoke about not receiving certain recognition as on previous visits for her birthday and loyalty to this hotel over the last 12 years . I do understand though that the hotel has changed owners on a couple of occasions over them years. But some faces still remain especially Alessandro on the concierge desk we have know for those 12 years and always pleased to see him there.
