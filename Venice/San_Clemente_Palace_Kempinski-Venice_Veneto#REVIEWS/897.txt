The San Clemente Palace is a gorgeous hotel on its own private island. At first we were worried about accessing the main part of Venice but with their private shuttle service there were no issues! We could jet across to Venice, explore the amazing city and simply catch the next shuttle boat back to the hotel (they come every half hour). It was nice to have a relaxing retreat away from the hustle and bustle.  The food in both the restaurant and pub was really good. The views across the water are amazing and the grounds themselves are spectacular!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
