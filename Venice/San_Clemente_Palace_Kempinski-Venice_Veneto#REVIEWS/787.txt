We enjoyed 5 nights here in a suite and found it very comfortable.    We had butler service provided by Lena and she provided service above and beyond. The attention to detail is excellent as one may expect at a St. Regis.   The breakfast is a feast that we all agreed we could enjoy for lunch due to the huge variety.   The boat shuttle to town runs on time and being on a private island is a wonderful respite from the crowds of Venice.    However, it does take time to get back and forth and planning is required.   We enjoyed having a pool to relax at which is rare in Venice.   The concierge team were very knowledgeable and helpful.  The hotel exceeds on every level except the gym which is relatively small and minimal.   We plan to return next year.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
