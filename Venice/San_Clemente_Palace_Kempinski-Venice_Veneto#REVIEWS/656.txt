This hotel is stunning.  The beds, amazing.  You get to sleep and you are away from all the noise of Venice so you feel you have escaped a bit.  The gardens, beautiful. The front of house staff (concierge, front desk) is some of the finest I have seen in the hotel and hospitality industry, but back of house (banquets, room service) needs some help.  Orders were rarely complete (except on day one).  A few other guests we were with said they had the same problems....inconsistent in some areas.  This hotel could be great if they could get their F&B departments to be on the same service level as the front of house staff.    Would I stay here again - absolutely!  Staying in a Palace is rather fun!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear FranceJunkie40,  Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
