Great experience at this Kempinski Hotel in Venice! Lovely atmosphere. We booked the speed boat from the airport to the hotel (through the hotel), and though very expensive, it was worth every penny. It was such a great introduction to our stay! Service was impeccable, nothing was too much trouble. Great amenities and the food was good. Breakfast is Buffet style as well as A la carte all inclusive. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet of the island and the complimentary boat to and fro to Saint Marks Square added a touch of style. You will not be disappointed:)Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 20, 2016Dear Fam5love,  Thank you for sharing your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempiniski.
