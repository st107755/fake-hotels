We stayed at the hotel for a family weekend trip and we couldnâ€™t have imagined how perfect everything was. The two connected rooms were large, beautifully decorated, extremely clean and the beds very comfortable. Also loved the Salvatore Ferragamo amenities. The property was so well kept and the heated pool the perfect treat. The food at the hotel was also delicious. Lastly the staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. We loved this place and will definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 4, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski with all the TripAdvisor readers.
