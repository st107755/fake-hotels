We cannot speak too highly of the San Clemente Palace a truly wonderful place to stay and experience Venice. The friendliness and attentiveness of the staff made all the difference. It was exceptional and this was demonstrated all down the line.  We felt very special and facilities wonderful as was the daily ride into Venice. I hope to return one day in the future and would highly recommend it.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear sherryl s,  Thank you for your enthusiastic feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
