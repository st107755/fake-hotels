I stayed at the San Clemente Palace from 5-7 July. From the moment we stepped off the complimentary shuttle from San Marco onto the island jetty I felt we had arrived in an orderly, refined oasis of calm a million miles away from the hurly burly of the main city. Our suite was immaculate; the food and beverages outstanding. I particularly enjoyed the complimentary beer and soft drinks in the room. We also made full use of the excellent pool; and enjoyed sitting in the loungers by the jetty looking out across the lagoon to the city. I’d love to come back.    One bonus - if you like art, the lush gardens of the Kempinski are full of outstanding original artworks - quite a wow factor as you take a stroll before dinner - or the rather awesome breakfast.
