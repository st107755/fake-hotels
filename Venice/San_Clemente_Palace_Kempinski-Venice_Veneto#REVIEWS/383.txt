The location is perfectly in an island 10 minutes sail from Piazza San Marco. It was no t easy to find the dock of the hotel's motorboat.  Have in mind that shares the same dock at the right of the waterfront once you get from San Marco if you don't mind to pay a 80€ taxi from the train station. The hotel is luxurious. Wide spaces, huge gardens and very clean. The junior suite was so big and the three of us had enough space to feel comfortable. What surprised us is that high speed internet had an extra cost even though as we were members of their fidelity program they didn't charge it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 27, 2017Dear joaquin g, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.
