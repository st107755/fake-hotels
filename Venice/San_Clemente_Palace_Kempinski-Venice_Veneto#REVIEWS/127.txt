My fiancé and i came to this hotel for the first time and were amazed by the resort. The private island is a welcomed retreat from the hustle and bustle you experience in Venice. The accommodations are truly exceptional as is the service. The food however was the highlight. We have traveled all across the world and have never been to a resort that offered the most amazing breakfast and dinner experiences. While the food is pricy(like the hotel) it is well worth it. The restaurant outside overlooking Venice and it's waterways at sunset is magical. We will definitely be back to Kempinski Palace!Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Guest Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 29, 2019Dear Mr Anthony,  I would like to thank you very much for taking the time to share your opinion based on your stay at our hotel and for sharing your great experience with all Trip Advisor´s readers.
