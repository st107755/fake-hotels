My boyfriend and I just came back form Venice. Stayed at the St Regis for 4 nights and it was just the right choice for us.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and the grounds are very well looked after. The swimming pool area is great, extremely relaxing considering how busy it gets when you are in mainland venice! It was over 30C during the day and we would have regretted not having a hotel with a gorgeous pool. We tried the acquarello restaurant one of the evenings and the scenery is simply breathtaking. Don't hesitate just book!  The gym is extremely quiet and the equipment is fantastic, the perfect companion to a run around the magnificent grounds. My only gripe is the water pressure out of the taps seemed painfully slow, not a major concern but worth noting.  Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
