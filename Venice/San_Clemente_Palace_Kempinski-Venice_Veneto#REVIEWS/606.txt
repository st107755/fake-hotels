The hotel grounds are amazing. The staff and the concierge are fantastic. The food is good. The hotel is not in the center of Venice which is nice and is only a 10 minute shuttle away. I stay in 5 star hotels often and the San Clemente is great. I would definitely stay there again next time in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear review2688, Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
