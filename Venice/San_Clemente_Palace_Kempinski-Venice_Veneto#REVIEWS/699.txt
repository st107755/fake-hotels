The place is amazing. BUT, if you plan on staying just for a few days, I think it's better to stay on Venice island itself. Commuting is real fast, and arriving in the morning on Venice is amazing, but still, you have to chose on whether you stay in Venice or enjoy the hotel. The room are nice (classic style, a bit old fashioned), the Breakfast is fantastic and the waitresses are really really really nice. the pool is great.  So, it's a beautiful scenery outside, the corridors and hotel amenities are not charming at all, but the pool and breakfast are gret.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
