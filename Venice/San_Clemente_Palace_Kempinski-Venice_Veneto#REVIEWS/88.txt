We loved staying and the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.  The property and hotel are gorgeous! It was nice to escape the crowds of Venice and retreat to a private island oasis.  The staff is superb.  They are beyond helpful.  Our rooms were nicely decorated, spacious and clean.  The kids (18, 15, and 12) enjoyed taking the hotel boat shuttle to Venice.  We enjoyed walking the trails on the property as well as sitting by the pool after a completing a day of exploration in Venice.  Nice areas all around to sit and watch the sunset.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 23, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience with all Trip AdvisorÂ´s readers.
