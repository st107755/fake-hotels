The only problem with this hotel is that it is SO spectacular you will not want to go explore Venice.  This resort could be a destination all by itself and I would be happy here for weeks.  A truly 5 star, unbelievable experience with 5 star staff, 5 star dining, and 5 star rooms.  The Medici family themselves would be very happy here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 26, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your inspirational and encouraging feedback shared on TripAdvisor!
