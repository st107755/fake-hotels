This is one of the best hotel we have stayed in italy. It is really beautiful and every detail is taken care of. Just walking around the hotel is a great pleasure in itself. Rooms are great, so are the breakfast, the restaurants, the staff, the pool... yes every thing. We almost saw nothing from the city cuz we decided to say more on this amazing island.   Will we be back - definitively! Maybe we see more of Venedig next time.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 21, 2016Dear MarKio86,   Thank you indeed for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
