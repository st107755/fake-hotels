The hotel is situated on its own little island and more importantly away from the crowds. The hotel provide a boatshuttle service as and when required. The bedrooms were spacious, clean and decorated laviously. Great bar with a wide range of drinks and cocktails.  Breakfast was really good and although we didn't stay for diner the food looked lovely.  The staff were all very polite and we were certainly looked after. A return visit will be booked!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Mar 24, 2017Dear Lyn L, Thank you very much for your positive feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
