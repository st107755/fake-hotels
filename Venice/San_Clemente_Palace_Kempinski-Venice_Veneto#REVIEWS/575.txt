Really nice hotel, large rooms, good facilities (pool, tennis, golf, restaurants) and good service, excellent breakfast. Regular free boat service to San Marco Venice. Perfect destination for a quieter romantic get away, whilst being close enough to go into Venice for the day, for dinner etc. The only improvement we would suggest is the addition of a " day room"  service to shower and change after checking out as the pool facilities are less convenient for that. Also the restaurant recommendation we got for dinner in Venice was a bit disappointing, given the high standard of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
