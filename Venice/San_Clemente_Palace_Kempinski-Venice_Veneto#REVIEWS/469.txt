My wife and I were celebrating our 35th anniversary and the hotel kindly upgraded our room and left us a welcoming bottle of wine - a lovely gesture.

I hope we can return again one day.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 13, 2017Dear Z7239DOjohnd, Thank you for your positive feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
