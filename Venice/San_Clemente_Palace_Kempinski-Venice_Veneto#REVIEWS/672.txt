Even some mixed weather couldn't dampen my review! This is a 5 star hotel in a beautiful location away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Huge wide corridors, high ceilings and lovely rooms. There is a complementary hotel shuttle across to St. Marks Square area. There are staff everywhere to cater for your every need. Prices are definitely not for the faint hearted. Rooms are expensive as are drinks in the bar.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
