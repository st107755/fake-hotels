We stayed on the 2nd floor right off of the grand stairway. There was no noise.  The room was glorious, simply glorious. We have a beautiful view of the lawns and the lagoon beyond. The rooms are chic but decidedly in an old-world ornamentation. The staff, the food, the rooms, everything was wonderful.  It was also a *gift* to be able to leave Venice behind and retreat to our little sanctuary on San Clemente.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 3, 2018Dear Guest,  thank you very much for this kind review shared on TripAdvisor.
