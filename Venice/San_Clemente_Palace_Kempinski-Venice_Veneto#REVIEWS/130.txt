There are nicer places to stay in and around Venice ! It’s 4:30 and I’m sitting outside my room because I can’t go in there because once again after being out all day the maid is only just cleaning it so we cannot shower etc to get ready to go out again ! We are constantly asking for the tea to be replenished for the kettle in our room only to be advised by the reception this is not automatically done and we need to ask !! That is a 1 star service not 5 star !!  Location lovely hotel beautiful shame they let themselves down with the room service considering the price I expect more , will not be returning . If u want to relax by the pool that’s impossible as that is very noisy !! Management ? Will just say the usual !!

I am delighted to read that you appreciated  our lovely property and our location.  I would like to apologize if in some ways we have not met your expectations at the fullest due to some issues as the cleaning of your room was not made before your came back to the room and that delayed your plans of going out again and that you had to ask or the tea to be replaced.  Please rest assured that your comments have been shared with all the Head of Departments involved as I believe that we can improve and achieve better results.  It will be a great honor for us to host you again on this unique island, and if the occasion should arise please feel free to contact me directly.
