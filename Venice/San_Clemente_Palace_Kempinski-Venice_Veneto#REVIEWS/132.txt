We arrived on Monday fabulous boat arrival.  Checked in everything ok.  Down hill from here .... Tuesday have to ring housekeeping at 3.30pm to clean room .... Wednesday ring housekeeping to clean room at 3pm today came up to room at 2pm not been cleaned fed up of complaining to be honest. The room we are in is 423 beautiful suite but no service.  The hallway at the bottom of stairs full of dirty glasses places etc been there 2 days take a look at my photos.  We contacted General manager 2 days ago hadnâ€™t even contacted us back.
