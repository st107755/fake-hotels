Excellent standard of efficiency from all of the staff who do make you feel very welcome, I witnessed some extremely poor behaviour from a couple of guests towards some staff who dealt with this very professionally (rudeness) I must stress that this rudeness was completely unwarranted. Beautiful rooms clean with  plenty of space including a separate bath and shower. Food was well presented and also of a very good standard. Just to add to the positives an efficient boat service with friendly crew and punctual service. One very minor negative the pool area has a large number of flies and these do become a major distraction the staff use citronella candles I believe these should be extended to guests and then perfection can be achieved.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
