Stayed here for three nights whilst on a long weekend break in Venice. It is gorgeous, sumptuous, refined, elegant without being stuffy, and the setting is unbeatable as others have commented. An oasis of calm just 10 minutes by launch from St Marks Square.   And there are some really good deals to go there on the BA website!  The staff individually were charming. Breakfast was excellent, if somewhat erratic in delivery. The rooms were spotless if a little variable on timing.  The reason only 4/5 - virtually anywhere else the minutiae don't matter, but the relaunch as a Kempinski is recent and i think the systems aren't quite bedded in yet - perfection is a lot to ask but at this end of the market it is promised and expected.   Would i go back  - in a heartbeat!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 8, 2016Dear DJAV,  Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
