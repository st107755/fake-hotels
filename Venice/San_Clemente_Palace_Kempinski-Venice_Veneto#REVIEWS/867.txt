We came here for our 40th anniversary and were not disappointed. The location and hotel are James Bondish and absolutely stunning. Food and service were excellent but need to be very mobile as long walk between rooms pool restaurants    But be aware that they have a free shuttle as 20 min boat ride to centre of Venice. Although does add to ambience. Could not fault it. Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
