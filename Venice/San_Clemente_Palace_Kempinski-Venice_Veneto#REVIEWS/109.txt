I have stayed between 05-07 July in San Clemente Palace Kempinski to celebrate my birthday & had fantastic time ... the hotel is a true oasis of luxury with very well appointed rooms, seamless service and awesome restaurant & bar. The swimming pool & gardens with lots of private corners provide a fantastic retreat after a busy day of sightseeing in beautiful Venice. The boat trip back to the hotel on sunset is a special treat in itself. Breakfast buffet is a dream with a great selection of Italian cheese & ham. All in all a true luxury!  P.S. try the one and only Turkish coffee of Venice in the hotel bar and don’t miss to visit 11th century church just at the hotel dock which also hosts part of biennale.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Guest Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 10, 2019Dear Ms Gozde,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience with all Trip Advisor´s readers.
