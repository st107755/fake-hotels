You could not choose a more idyllic location.  However, it would appear as though the staff assumes the view will make up for service.  I am not particularly wealthy, so I splurged to be here on an overnight with my son before a cruise.   When spending approximately $500 per night, I do not expect to have to repeatedly go to the bar or pool bar to request service.  Others seem to not have this problem ( note, “others” to be couples).  Single individuals are not treated with the same consideration. This attitude would then suggest a discernment in approach to guests that is quite frankly inappropriate given the amazing possibilities ( and cost)  of this property.
