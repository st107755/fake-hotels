My adult children & I stayed at San Clemente Palace and it was wonderful!  Service & staff were stellar!  The breakfast was visually beautiful and delicious! From the moment we arrived we loved the grounds, how quiet they are a nice break from the crowds in Venice.  The pool area is a nice respite from a long day of touring Venice in the hot Italian sun.  Our room was spacious and had gorgeous views of the water!  We will return to Venice & San Clemente Palace!
