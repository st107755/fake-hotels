St. Regis San Clamente is a marvelous property, with beautiful envitonment, excellent facilities. The nature of this island hotel is really breathtaking and so soothing. I went there for two days on a business trip and loved the hotel. The view from the hotel to Venice downtown is so lovely.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
