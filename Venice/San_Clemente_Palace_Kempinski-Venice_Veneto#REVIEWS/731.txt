Absolutely gorgeous hotel, reopened after a major renovation and renaming in 2014.  Immaculately maintained, great service and comfortable rooms.  Five stars all the way, a perfect way to do Venice but get easily escape the daytime cacophony that can be San Marco/Rialto.  Boat ride is 12-15 minutes from San Marco (dock is in front of the Danieli Excelsior) and is really a wonderful ride.  Boat runs every 30 minutes, so you never have to wait too long.  Booking a room that includes breakfast is almost a must, especially when adjusting to the time zone at the start of your stay.  Lunch and Late Night room service menu could use some tweaks, but the main bar is really nice and open very late by Venice standards (1 AM).  Overall it was an excellent stay, highly recommended.
