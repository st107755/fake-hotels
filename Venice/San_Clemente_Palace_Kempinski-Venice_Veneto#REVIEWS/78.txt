My wife and I got a boat taxi from Marco Polo airport directly to the island to save time and hassle, the views on the ride in were breathtaking and worthwhile the 30 minute ride for 140 Euros.  Once we arrived at the hotel and its private island we were blown away. This place is absolutely beautiful, the staff are so welcoming and accommodating to the smallest of details. For the first few hours my wife and I explored the Hotel, its history and the character it holds before we remembered we best go and see Venice.  During our time (3 nights) the hotel never appeared to be too busy, however the hotel never seemed to understaff either which meant there were lots of people to assist when needed. The pool is great in every way, good size, good depth and never too busy on our stay.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 15, 2019Dear Mr-and-MrsWillibobs, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
