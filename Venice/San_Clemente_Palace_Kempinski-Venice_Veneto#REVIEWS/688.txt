My husband and I stayed here in August 2015 when this property was still a St. Regis. It is a bit removed from the hustle and bustle of Venice (which I prefer after several trips to Venice) The hotel has beautiful grounds, including a large outdoor pool, which is pretty rare for hotel in this immediate area. Our room was large, spacious and tastefully decorated. I would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
