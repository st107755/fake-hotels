It's not everyday that you stay at a hotel which occupies its own island.  When its a private shuttle boat ride from one of the world's most crowded tourist destinations, it's even more special to be able to escspe to tranquility every evening and to arrive right at St. Mark's Square every morning.  The hotel is a special place as well, with its own church and sculpture park.  Compared with the high standards you would expect, the only comments we had were that the rooms were a little small and sparse and the breakfast service a little limited given the price.  Small problems, but then the price does deserve perfection.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 1, 2016Dear chris_butler_uk,  Thank you for your feedback on your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
