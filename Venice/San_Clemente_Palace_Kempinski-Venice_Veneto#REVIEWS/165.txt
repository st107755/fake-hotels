Positive: - The location - Even though the hotel is not on one of the main areas of Venice, they provide free shuttle service every 30 mins to San Marco. This shuttle service lets you see the San Marco and other attraction areas from the sea and lets you escape from the crowdedness of Venice. The hotel owns the island so it is very private - The spacious, modern and clean rooms with a huge bed.  - The hotel's pool that was heated. - Breakfast was buffet style with good amount of choices.   Negative: - Can't really think of anything.  As a couple we truly enjoyed the hotel and staff was very professional and helpful.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from LudoviciMarko, Executive Assistant Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 25, 2019Dear sinanbilol, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
