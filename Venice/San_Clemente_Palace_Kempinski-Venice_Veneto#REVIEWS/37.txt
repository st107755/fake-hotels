An amazing private island only 7 minutes by the hotels private motor launch into Venice. Large spacious room, excellent food and service, this is the only hotel to choose when considering Venice. San Clemente Palace is breathtaking. The grounds are beautiful, the staff was exceptional, and the location is a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of the main island. The hotel was a short boat ride from the main island, and we never had any trouble. We enjoyed a grand deluxe room which was huge and very comfortable. The hotel also provides unlimited sparkling and still water bottles.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 21, 2019Dear 686jonathan, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
