My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights during our mini-moon to Italy.  We loved the hotel and grounds; the complimentary shuttle to Piazza San Marco every 30 minutes; and dining in Acquarello restaurant.  Service was excellent in the hotel bar and restaurant and, whilst it is hard to find anything to criticise, we didn't really feel like they went out of their way to make our stay special.  Still, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to see Venice in luxury.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 30, 2015Dear Guest, Your nice feedback about your recent stay at The St.Regis San Clemente Palace Venice is very appreciated.We are very glad that we met your expectations by providing an outstanding service.
