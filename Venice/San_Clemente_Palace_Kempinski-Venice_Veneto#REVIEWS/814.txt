Beautiful hotel with a huge, heated pool on a secluded island, a quick boat by water away from the tourist areas of Venice (takes 5-10 minutes, and the hotel has a free shuttle every 30 minutes).  Venice was HOT, really hot, and having this oasis to return to and swim was a luxury.  The rooms are huge, the hotel is very clean, and the breakfast was fantastic.  Our kids loved it here and begged us to stay longer.  Lots of things for kids to do on the property!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
