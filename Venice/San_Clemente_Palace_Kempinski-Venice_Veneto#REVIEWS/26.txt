We stayed here for my mums 60th birthday and the hotel was lovely, in the most stunning location too! The staff were excellent and even made her a happy birthday cake for breakfast one day! Good choice at breakfast and the pool restaurant is great if you want pizza/pasta instead of fine dining. Complimentary water taxis to Venice too are great and luxury. Will definitely try and go back!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 31, 2019Dear 895emily, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent experience at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
