Stayed at the Kempinski with my sisters, received excellent service. The hotel staff are really lovely, attentive and welcoming. The continental breakfast was great. The rooms are spotless. Our room was upgraded for free. The shuttle is well organised. Overall an amazing stay, would definitely come back.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
