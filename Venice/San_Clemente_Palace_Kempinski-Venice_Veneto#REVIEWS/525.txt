I had a wonderful time in this hotel. Its location is unique, you are close to Venice but far from the madness of the crowd under your balcony. Great rooms, great infrastructure. The food is amazing and the hospitality is one of the best I have ever experienced. Friendly and truly skilled staff! Our concierge Matteo - who was one of the best, I have ever interacted with during my travelings- arranged the most suitable restaurants for us based on our exact wishes, which was truly remarkable.  The surrounding is peaceful and just amazing. It is surely one of a kind experience without too much fuss. I would surely return to taste their pistachio cake again... heaven! This hotel is safe bet in Venice, if you want to have some relaxed time with your sightseeing. I loved it!
