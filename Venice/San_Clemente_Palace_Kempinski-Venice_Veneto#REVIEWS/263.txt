This hotel plays in the league of the Cipriani - but for half the price. It beats the Amanhotel for serenity. And it has more sense of place than the Danieli. San Clemente Palace is highly recommended for demanding travelers who want to get away from the extremely crowded atmosphere "downtown". The boat shuttle to & from San Marco Square runs like a clockwork, every half hour. Food and breakfast quality was excellent. Staff were attentive from valet to waiters. The bar is an architectural gem. Despite being in an old palace, the rooms feel fresh and new. The antique church at the entrance is a window into 1000+ years of Venice's history. The green gardens are made for walking barefoot. The pool is olympic in size: what a pleasure after a long day in town.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 5, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
