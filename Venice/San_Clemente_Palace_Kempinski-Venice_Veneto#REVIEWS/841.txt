The property itself is one of the most beautiful European luxury hotels we have stayed in.   The rooms are unusually spacious and the location on an island makes for a tranquil retreat from the crowds.   The service was a bit uneven due to an unusual event (the property owners birthday party).  However, the staff worked hard to improve our experience post the disruptive event.   I would book another stay here vs. the high-end San Marco hotels or Cipriani.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
