What a stunning hotel. The whole experience is 5 star..... it is luxurious and matched by the perfect service from all of the staff.  The location is simply perfect.... a short ride on the hotels complimentary boat service from St Marks square.... really makes one feel that they are special.  The night we stayed here was a gift for my 50th birthday before we went on a cruise and I can honestly say I couldnâ€™t have stayed in a more perfect hotel.  Thank you for your welcome and professionalism.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 30, 2019Dear Alan-Ollie,  thank you for taking the time to review on TripAdvisor the recent experience at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski on the very special occasion of your 50th birthday.
