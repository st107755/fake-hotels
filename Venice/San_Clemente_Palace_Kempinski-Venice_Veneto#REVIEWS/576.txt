Idyllic location and the shuttle boat service to San Marco is an added bonus. Gorgeous grounds, the pool area is lovely. A delicious breakfast was served in a beautiful walled terrace. The room was immaculate. The service from everyone was really excellent. We just wished we had stayed longer to take advantage of all the facilities.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
