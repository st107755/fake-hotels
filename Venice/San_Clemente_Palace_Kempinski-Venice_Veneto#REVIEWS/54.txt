Visited on a company leadership offsite. The hotel is great, friendly service and beautiful pool area.  Food in the restaurant was sub-standard. Almost no knowledge of Vegan, and what was offered was Pasta with Tomato Sauce! At a 5 star hotel! To make matters worse, the pasta was extremely overcooked and splitting apart. I avoided dining the rest of my stay as I would have thought Italian’s would have known how to make interesting vegan food, and be able to cook the pasta ‘al dente’.  The highlight: Costi the barman who does the most incredible magic tricks I have ever experienced! He is incredible and should definitely be performing on stage!Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 21, 2019Dear sudielasudes, thank you for sharing with us the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace kempinski.
