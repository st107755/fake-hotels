The San Clemente is an amazing location- an enormous private island, just 10 minutes from San Marco by boat. Really peaceful and quiet but so close to all the action! The hotel building is extraordinary, a converted monastery complete with chapel it has been beautifully restored. What struck us particularly was the service- nothing was too much trouble and the attention to detail was excellent. The concierge service is incredible- the wonderful Michael knew everything we needed to know and guided us with restaurant bookings etc to suit us and our two children. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Nov 17, 2019Dear yummityscrummit, thank you for sharing the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
