The hotel is so nice, with a very good location that is far from the noise and crowdness, it takes 10-15 min to get to san marco, we enjoyed the way and sightseeing to/from the hotel. the weather when we reach was raining but everything was settled. we park in san marco garage that was booked by the hotel, the access to it was easy and comfortable. the ambiance of the hotel and decoration was top in all meanings, the landscape and cityscape was wonderful.  The only thing needs attention is the dinner, we thought its going to be better interm of food varieties selection and service at the dine in restaurant. Overall, the hotel is amazing and staff are friendly and helpful specially the concierge.  Thank you !!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
