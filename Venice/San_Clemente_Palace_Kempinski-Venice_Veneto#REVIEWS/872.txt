We had a great few days here. The hotel was spacious and comfortable. Heated, large swimming pool, tennis and even mini golf. My husband and I had a romantic dinner in their terrace restaurant overlooking Venice with the most amazing sunset. Our children loved the pool and the grounds to run around in.  After a busy day visiting Venice, this hotel on its own little island was perfect! It is very close - the hotel offers complementary boats to and from St Marks Square - under 10 minutes.  The staff could not be more charming and accommodating. We will definitely go back - Venice is the most beautiful city in the world and this hotel made the whole experience even more special.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
