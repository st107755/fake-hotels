Hotel San Clemente located on Isola di San Clemente is a superb location providing restful privacy & escape from the busy hub of Venice & Piazza San Marco (10 min trip via courtesy water taxis). The hotel has an interesting past history of which a mental asylum/ leprosy colony being one & so perhaps not surprisingly the building externally has a foreboding dark depressing persona. Internally it is beautifully elegant with bedrooms large sumptuous & luxurious. Staff are efficient & customer focused. Business meeting stay confined too-long on the island. Apart from developing claustrophobia did experience there lunches evening meals & breakfasts - of the highest quality, although not inspiring, but expensive! Drinks too are exceedingly expensive so beware!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 18, 2015Dear Guest  Thank you for leaving a review of our property on tripadvisor.
