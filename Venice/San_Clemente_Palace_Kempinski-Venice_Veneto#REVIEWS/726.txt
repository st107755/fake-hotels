The St. Regis took me by surprise. It was magical, beautiful and the staff were bending over to help and be helpful. You truly felt taken care of. It used to be a convent I believe but also a palace. And I felt like royalty staying there. The breakfast was amazing. The room was beautiful. Bath was luxurious. Grounds were immaculate and lovely to walk around. I only wish I could have spent more time just "hanging" out. It was a beautiful resort. They are on a private Island and have a complimentary water taxi over to the main part of Venice. I have stayed in many nice spots, but this one I will truly remember.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
