Beautiful property.  Very quiet and peaceful compared to the bustling city center.  Convenient shuttle service to and from San Mark's square every 30min.  The concierge and hotel staff were always kind and helpful.  Definitely a highlight of our trip to Italy this year.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 24, 2017Dear mat_demarchi, Thank you for your positive feedback on your experience at our hotel.
