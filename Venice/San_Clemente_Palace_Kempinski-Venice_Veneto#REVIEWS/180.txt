Had a wonderful time at this hotel, peacefully located away from the crowds. Genuinely warm and welcoming staff (my thanks to Alessia, Michael and team), great food and service, spacious and well-appointed room, convenient shuttle boat to San Marco. Best of all: thanks to a generous room upgrade, I got to enjoy fabulous lagoon views, making for a truly memorable stay. Canâ€™t wait to come back!Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Nov 18, 2018Dear SoulJude, thank you for your lovely feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
