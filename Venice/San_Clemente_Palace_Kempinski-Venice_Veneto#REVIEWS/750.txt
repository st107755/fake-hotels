After a weeks stay, our overall comment has to include the concierge and butlers here.  Both provide consistent good service.  Including unpacking for you.  Nice ! Every thing was at par with regards to room ( after we declined our first room)  In a week we can always point out some areas for improvement but all minor;  one exception that is reflected in many other reviewers comments. The food is overpriced ( even for Venice), this we would agree with as well.  But it was a good stay  and free boat rides whenever.
