We stayed four nights at this hotel.  It is a great place for a romantic couples break.  The rooms are decorated in a typical Italian style with oversize bed and marble bathroom.  The public areas are very stylish.  The breakfast offer is wide ranging and includes free Prosecco and cooked to order items if you want them.  The staff are superb - very attentive, polite and welcoming.  We enjoyed the trips into Venice on the hotel boat.  The island church, whilst not in use, is an architectural gem worth a look around.  There were a few niggles such as air conditioning not on, pool closed, centrally controlled heating system, very pricy drinks and eats, but somehow they just didn't matter.  Being in such a welcoming and beautiful setting trumped all that.  It was great to return toâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
