Exclusive location:  San Clemente is an island of peace just 10 minutes ride by shuttle boat service from the crowds in renowned San Marco square. Lush gardens adjacent to rinascimental San Clemente church is all so fascinating.  Rooms : The silence of an antique monastery, furnished with good taste (rinascimental venetian style). High roofs and spacious rooms. Courtesy bathroom set by Ferragamo added that extra touch.   Seaview swimming pool with state of the art sunbeds, wellness club, a choice between 3 restaurants and laguna view bars renders it a perfect romantic setting in probably the most romantic of all cities  (Venice)Read moreDate of stay: September 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 17, 2018Dear guest, thank you for your taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
