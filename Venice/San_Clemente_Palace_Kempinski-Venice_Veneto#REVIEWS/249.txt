This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel, and it's a real treat! Close to the centre of Venice and far away from the crowds, so you can relax and enjoy the nature and space on San Clemente.  The rooms are a good size, beautifully decorated, this hotel has everything you need to enjoy your holiday: spa, restaurants, gardens, and outside swimming pool. The staff is very efficient and super friendly.  One thing that was a bit disappointing, is the price for breakfast: 50 euro per person! Last time I visited the hotel (two years ago), breakfast was included in the price.  I would understand if it was 25 euro per person, but 50 euro is taking advantage of the location.  But otherwise, this hotel is a little paradise in the centre of Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 13, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review you recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
