Excellent and unassuming restoration of this old monastery with beautiful gardens. It is the only building on the island.

You may of course visit downtown Venice with a 5 min boat ride offered by the hotel or you may spend a day relaxing on the island enjoying beautiful views and excellent amenities.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Mar 24, 2017Dear NIKOLAOS L, Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace.
