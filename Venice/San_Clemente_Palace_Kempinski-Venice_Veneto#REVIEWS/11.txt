Highly recommended! A paradise in Venice within minutes to San Markâ€™s square with their beautiful wooden boats. The gardens are spectacular, rooms are good size and nice. The spa could be better.. Their Aquarello restaurant was the best dinner we had in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 23, 2020Dear B4267KKtommyb,  thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the description of your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
