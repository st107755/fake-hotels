We booked 2 Starwood hotels when we were traveling in Venice for 5 days, one is Hotel Dsnieli and the other is St Regis San Clemente Palace. We enjoyed the stay! It is a calm and beautiful island that you can spend a whole day, soak-up the sun without doing anything. Big room with tall ceiling. Excellent concierge service. People are friendly and helpful. It is also a great place for children. Free shuttle water taxi every half an hour to/back San Mark's Square. We did not find anything wrong with this hotel! Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
