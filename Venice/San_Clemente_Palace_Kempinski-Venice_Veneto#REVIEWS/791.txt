Great family friendly hotel on a private island away from the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to visit via the hotel's complimentary water taxi service. Good pool and space for kids to burn off energy after seeing the sights of Venice. Quality restaurants, very helpful butler service and knowledgeable and friendly concierge.
