I have stayed here on numerous occasions, seen all the sights in Venice so this is my go to hotel when I just want a few days away from it all.   The service and staff are outstanding and they are all so friendly and helpful.  Check in was so easy although we did arrive at the end of the afternoon so knowone was at the reception, however you only need a few people to be checking in or out and you will have to wait a while.   We are always given an upgrade but we refuse because we like to stay in room 224 as this looks out across the gardens to the jetty where the shuttle boats mores to disembark new arrivals.   The gardens are maintained and groomed so that they look immaculate. I would highly recommend you take a walk around the outskirts of the island to explore the gardensâ€¦Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 3, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
