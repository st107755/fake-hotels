I had the most memorable stay at this beautiful hotel and can not wait to return , but second time round  for a week. The room, the breakfast , the sunset  and the location made it a magical memory. I loved taking the frequent  motorboat shuttle to San Marco and then escape back to this tranquil place. The pool area was as lovely although the hotel could work on a separate kiddies pool area, as it could  be a bit noisy at times, if you just want to rest and relax (I have children) At night on the terrace where we had supper  it was not a problem:)Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
