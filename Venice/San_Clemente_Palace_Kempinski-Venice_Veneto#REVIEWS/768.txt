Visited in height of hot August summer tourist season. San Marco was packed with throngs of people, but just a short private boat ride away is the St Regis.

Loved it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 17, 2015Dear Guest We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.Thank you for highlighting the beauty of our magical island and our services.
