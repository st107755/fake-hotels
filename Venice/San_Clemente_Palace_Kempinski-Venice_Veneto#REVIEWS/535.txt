The San Clemente was a welcome respite from the crowds on the mainland.  Convenient taxi launch, beautiful grounds and pool.  Our room was quite large and comfortable. The food was just right but we only had breakfast each of our 3 mornings here.  This was among one of the most unique properties we have ever stayed at and we will be back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 3, 2017Dear rr1954, Thank you for your enthusiastic feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
