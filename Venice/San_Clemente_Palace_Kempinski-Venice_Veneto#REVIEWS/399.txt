Beautiful hotel with amazing stuff have had 3 visits and all have been excellent, however the hotel does have issues.  1. Even though the hotel is 5 star, to expect staff to wear the outfits they are wearing in 40c is cruel. They look unfortable, plus give them a casual uniform , it's 2017.  2. Some of your customers are extremely rude to your staff , kick them out , you don't need the money :)  3 . Get a bigger boat . It's like being in an oven in that boat .  4. 9 euros for a bottle of water is a rip off . No matter how many stars you have , it's a rip of for a bottle of  standard water. They are only one pound in England. It's not cheap to stay in this hotel , so don't screw people on the water.  That's the only things wrong with this hotel apart from that it's awesome.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
