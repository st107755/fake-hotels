For over $1000 AU per night I don't think it is worth the money as the Euro was killing us. Nice place to escape the main city but everything is very expensive in this hotel. The food by the pool was probably the best if of the lot but still pricey. The casual dining next to the fine dining area was awful and probably the worst burger ever had. Breakfast was exceptional but at $48 euros it should be. Our mini bar was not restocked once during our stay and dirty glasses were left in our room and never collected. Nice place but wait for a better exchange rateRead moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post your feedback on TripAdvisor and for your positive comment for the location and ambiance of our property.We regret, however, that certain aspects of your stay were disappointing to you.
