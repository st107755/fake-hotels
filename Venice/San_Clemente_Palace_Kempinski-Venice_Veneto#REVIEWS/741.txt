We spent three days here on our honeymoon.  The hotel grounds are immaculate -- a converted monastery -- with plenty of space to walk around, soak in the sculptures or just soak in the pool.  The ferry service to runs every 15 minutes so though you're far away from the hustle & bustle of the Grand Canal you never feel isolated and unable to explore the city of Venice. The service was friendly and attentive.  The food and morning buffet were surprisingly delicious.  The outdoor bar / restaurant area was the perfect spot to watch the sun fall into the sea and polish off a bottle of wine -- don't forget the bug spray!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
