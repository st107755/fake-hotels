Situated on an island this is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of Venice. However, St Mark's square is only ten minutes away by the frequent boat shuttle provided by the hotel.   As you'd expect from a five star hotel, the food and service is excellent, but what makes this place special are the wonderful gardens and outside pool, which is unusual to find in Venice.   This is my favourite hotel and I can't wait up return!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
