A great place to get away from crowded Venice and still have access. The hum of the locusts and the lush lawns with enormous trees makes it a truly magical place. The grounds are impeccable. Great large rooms with comfortable beds.   Kids loved the lovely pool but mostly adults....yet totally kid friendly.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 11, 2017Dear robertaT8869GC, Thank you for sharing your positive feedback on your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
