We recently stayed at the hotel for four nights for a work incentive trip in the middle of June. Good hotel with nice food and situated in a nice location which is a short distance to the main part of Venice. The staff were very nice especially Costi who ensured we were very well looked after while showing of some very fun magic trips that were quite Cooperfeld esque I might add. Very cool stuff.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Guest Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 22, 2019Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay in Venice and for sharing your great experience with all Trip AdvisorÂ´s readers.
