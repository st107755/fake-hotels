What a fantastic Gem of a hotel on its own island in Venice.  The hotel was perfect, wonderful pool and sunbathing area, lovely grounds and very nice rooms. All the staff were very polite and helpful including Edwardo our Butler and the General manager who completed our week stay by letting us have a late check out. Complimentary ten minute boat ride to St Marks square (and back) every half hour was great. Only downside was it was expensive to eat and drink at the hotel.
