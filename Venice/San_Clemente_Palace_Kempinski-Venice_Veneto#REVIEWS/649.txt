Super service from the upgraded hotel. Good pool bar/restaurant with food not badly priced for such an establishment. bar is a touch expensive (Peroni EUR9, glass of red starts at EUR12, and water is EUR7 for 50cl). Hotel standard inside is excellent, clean, elegant, air conditioned, great turn down service. Half hourly boat to San Marco.  Clientele predominantly American when we stayed there (with occasional attendant vociferous child in tow) but also British and some French and /Russians. Not as Italian as it used to be but the service is also not as Italian as it used to be!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 20, 2016Dear Ducati_enthusiast,  Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
