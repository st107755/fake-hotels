Truly a great hotel. Enjoyed to spend the day at there large pool side for active swimming while my lady enjoys sightseeing of Venice and it's Attractions. A very frequent both schedule gets you to San Marco within 20 min. The chef and the cuisine is of very high level. Breakfast buffet one of the best I enjoyed in Italy. The historic church which is part of the hotel complex gives an impressive arrival experience when coming back late night. Was a daily must visit. Certainly a hotel to go back to.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 3, 2018Dear Guest, thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience with all TripAdvisorÂ´s readers.
