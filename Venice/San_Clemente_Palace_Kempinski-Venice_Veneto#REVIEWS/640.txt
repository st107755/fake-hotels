The first time I stayed at the San Clemente I knew I had to go back! I have stayed at many first class hotels and by far this is one of the best! Starting with service! There was not one time that I needed anything it was quickly taken care of! We were a family of 7 with three rooms so many things were requested . There was always a smile on the hotel staff! They made sure we were happy! I can not even describe the grounds words are not enough you must go and see! I am going back in October to take my father counting the days!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 8, 2016Dear faymous123,  Thank you for sharing your feedback on your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
