The St. Regis Venice San Clemente Palace is an outstanding property with impreccable service.  The hotel and grounds have a palatial presence and create an inviting atmosphere.  The guest room are newly renovated,  spacious, beautifully decorated and very inviting.  The marble bathroom is large and has the finest bath products.  The staff is very attentive to details and delivering first class service.  This is a "World Class" hotel which I can confidently recommend.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
