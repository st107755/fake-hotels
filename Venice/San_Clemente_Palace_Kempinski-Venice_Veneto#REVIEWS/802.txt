We stayed in the St Regis in Venice for two night prior to boarding our cruise. The place is amazing. This luxury tranquil hotel is an oasis in the middle of busy Venice. Within 10 minutes per (complementary) hotel boat shuttle you're at the San Marco square ready for sightseeing. We would definitely recommend this outstanding place. The service is excellent, like you would expect from a St. Regis. We enjoyed and and will definitely come back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
