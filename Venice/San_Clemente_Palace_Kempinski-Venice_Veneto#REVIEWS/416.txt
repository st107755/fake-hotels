Hi you will not be disappointed. Got upgraded to a junior suite and it was fabulous - the hotel is nothing but gorgeous. The rooms stunning and the staff perfect - I actually can't fault it - it's on an island of its own - there is a private shuttle bus to st Marc's square every 15 minutes. The concierge and reception was excellent. Swimming pool area, if I am honest, needs more umbrellas - but that is the only negative.
