San Clemente is a stunning property there is no doubt.  From the moment you arrive you are absolutely amazed by the property's beauty.  The entire surrounding and greeting process was as if arriving in the old tv show fantasy island.   That being said, the hotel (as I now know) was only just recently branded the St Regis and is apparently one of their independently owned hotels, not directly owned by SPG.  It shows.   Upon arrival, while I was pleasantly upgraded to a suite, I had to change rooms due to an overwhelming smell of damp and mildew.  Once on a high floor this was rectified.   I was there for a special occasion and had several advance requests of the concierge,  most of which were not done to specification.  Basic emails were responded to with cut and paste responses.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
