I've been to Venice in the past but only for a couple of hours and when I finally got the opportunity to stay there overnight I decided to stay in the San Clemente Palace! It was actually recommended by my friends who had loved their stay just after the re-opening under Kempinski. I can't find enough words to explain how marvellous it is: the rooms, the restaurants, the gardens, the chapel...the all place is stunning! And the service is excellent as well, the staff is always ready to answer your requests and the management is around and greet you every time with a warm smile! I truly loved my stay here and I'm defenitly coming back soon!
