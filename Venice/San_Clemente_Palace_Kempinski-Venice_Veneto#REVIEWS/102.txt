What a wonderful time we had as a family at this magnificent property. We were a family of 6 with 3 rooms, everything about each room was wonderful. The service is attentive and the reception staff were a pleasure. the setting of the hotel with its stunning views made for the perfect escape from the Venice crowds. The complimentary shuttle boat was a joy and made our stay. We will be back! Thank you San Clemente.... you truly are something extremely special.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 18, 2019Dear Guest,  I would like to thank you very much for taking the time to share your opinion based on your stay at our hotel and for sharing your great experience with all Trip AdvisorÂ´s readers.
