What a wonderful hotel/resort. It started with a private water taxi (Euro 130) from Marco Polo across the lagoon to the island resort and a very special and individual greeting. Easy check in, upgraded room on the ground floor with a lagoon view. Very friendly staff who seemed happy in their job. The evening dining options were a bit limited with only fine dining and bar snacks. The room service menu was a little different, but not what one fancies. Breakfast was a very full fare, standard, but extensive buffet with a variety of fresh produce, and cooked plate at request. The bar was very comfortable, if a little on the expensive side. Lovely swimming pool and pool side restaurant (closes 5:30). Free wi fi. Very efficient courtesy shuttle to San Marco, every half hour and moreâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
