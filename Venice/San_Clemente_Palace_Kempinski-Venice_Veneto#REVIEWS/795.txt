Venice is a very busy city, making this place the perfect counter. This Hotel has recently re-opened and is on a quiet island is about 10 minutes away from St Mark's Square by free boat ride every 30 minutes. We never felt rushed to catch a boat and they were very reliable. The environment is stunning with a secluded heated pool, good quality food and very friendly staff who were very accommodating to our 2 children. The perfect retreat before braving the crowd of Venice!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
