This hotel is situated on a lovely little island minutes away from Venice, that can be reached with the hotel's free shuttle boat running at regular times. Like the rest of the Venice area the place is beautiful and full of history, but in stark contrast with the crowded main island, the San Clemente is beautiful, clean, quiet, and the staff very attentive: quintessential luxury. As the rest of the area, there's history everywhere you walk, and right beside the classically beautiful hotel there's a picturesque church, open to the public to visit, as well as temporary art installations, and delicious Italian food outlets. Visit it if you want a quiet getaway, great food, and a full romantic view of the Venetian Laguna!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 23, 2019Dear diegot679, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
