The San Clemente hotel is located within stunning grounds, the pool is gorgeous and the surrounding sunbathing area is lovely and spacious, with beds also on the grass verge under the shade of the trees, should you wish to keep out of the sun.  I would like to make the hotel management aware however that the pool staff are very late in coming out to guests, as it's a 5* hotel, the pool staff should be out at 10.30am when the bar opens and asking guests whether they would like a drink or any snacks, this was the only downside.  Special thanks to Fabio at breakfast and lunchtime for looking after us, Kelton also, and Veronica at Acquerello. Everyone was marvellous.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 28, 2019Dear ClaSca13,  thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
