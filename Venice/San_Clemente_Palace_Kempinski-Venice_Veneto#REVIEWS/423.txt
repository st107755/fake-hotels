A beautiful hotel on a private island. The staff is so friendly and polite, the food at the Aquerello Restaurant is really good - I recommend the lobster tagliatelle! and a Pizza for lunch at the place next to the pool. The SPA offers a range of great treatments and even a facial with gold. Would definitely go back!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 24, 2017Dear Momo T, Thank you for sharing your positive feedback on your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
