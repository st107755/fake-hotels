Very nice hotel with great location.  Breakfast is brilliant and rooms very nice. It is wonderful to come back after a hectic day in Venice to this little paradise! Unfortunately the pool was already closed and Spa seems a bit small but we enjoyed the rest of the hotel very much. WE stayed in a junior Suite which was very spacious and had a comfortable bed, The room lacked a little bit of natural light as the hotel is an old monastery. Highly recommended. Even the ride over to the island is a pleasure itself!Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
