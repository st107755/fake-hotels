We spent 2 nights at the St Regis San Clemente Palace and were totally blown away by the resort's beauty, service and amenities. We were a little concerned that the resort was on its own island away from the old city, but it was perfect. We could dip into the tourist scene of Venice and escape to the luxury of peace and quiet at the St Regis. I wish we had planned to stay longer!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
