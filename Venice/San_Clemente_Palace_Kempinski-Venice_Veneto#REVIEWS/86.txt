The hotel is located on its own island. Amazing property! Has everything one need. Everything is well located and organized. We had some minor issues but the staff made everything to fix them. Really great staff and service! The breakfast was really nice and taking it in the courtyard was amazing! We had a dinner at the poolside restaurant. It was ok. Maybe we should have had the pizza. Herd it was great.  The staff and the concierge were amazing! They really helped us out with everything. The whole experience was a great mixture between city trip and relax holiday. Kempinski is always to its standards.
