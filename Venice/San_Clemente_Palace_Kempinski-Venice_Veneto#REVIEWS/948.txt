The hotel is beautiful, romantic, lovely, charming.. etc etc. The room we stayed was super big, cozy with a nice decoration. The piscine area is nice. The restaurant close to a chapel is super romantic. The night we had diner there we could watch a nice classical musical presentation.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
