Wonderful property and well maintained grounds, historic value at a reasonable luxury price. Staff and butler team are extremely accommodating and helpful. One of our best European stays and we have travelled a lot extensively so are aware of good vs. excellent.  Taxi shuttle service was prompt and ran like clockwork. If you want to enjoy Venice and stay in a luxury hotel then St. Regis is your #1 choice. Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
