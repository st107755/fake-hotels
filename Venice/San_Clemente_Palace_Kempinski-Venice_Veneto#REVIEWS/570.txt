My wife and I stayed here for two nights on the last leg of our Italy trip.  Kempinski Palace was a perfect oasis to relax and unwind from a full travel schedule.  The fact that it is a private island cannot be undersold.  With Venice being so crowded during the day the hotel pool and grounds are a perfect place to escape.  The hotel only shuttle is fantastic and from ou off at one of the most central locations in the city. The staff is fantastic and is always willing to help and get yo what you need; albeit at price.    Overall a great experience and plan on returning.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
