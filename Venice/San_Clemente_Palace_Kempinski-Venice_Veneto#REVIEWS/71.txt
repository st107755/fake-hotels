We stayed here on a family trip , and both the wife and I felt this was one of (if not the)  the most impressive hotels we have ever stayed in. Grand in scale. Breakfast buffett and the dinner we had were both excellent. Rooms and decor beautiful. My wife and daughter had a "mother-daughter" spa package and felt it was otstanding. You do have to take a boat to get into Venice itself-these leave every 30 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 15, 2019Dear 71JasonM, thank you for your great comment and the generous words used to describe your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
