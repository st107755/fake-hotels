I have stayed in Venice many many times and have not stayed anywhere as fantastic as this - on every level it was 10 out of 10.  Beautiful, immaculate rooms, and hallways and furniture. Gardens, music and pool. Wonderful staff too.  It ticks every box.  Highly recommend.  I will be always staying there from now on!Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 28, 2019Dear Thenoves,  thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the comment related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
