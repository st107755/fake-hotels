I was with my parents there for 2 nights in early Aug, got an upgrade to junior suite. Hotel situated on its own island, great food, comprehensive facilities, wouldn't want to leave the island at all. Staffs there are very friendly, and I had a drink the other night, it comes with complimentary snacks and desserts. Will definitely come back again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
