We stayed at The San Clemente Palace, Kempinski at the end of June.  Before we arrived, the Concierge very kindly booked our transfers from Marco Polo , we were greeted at the airport and everything was taken care of along with a beautiful boat ride catching our first glimpse of Venice !! We arrived at the hotel and were greeted very warmly by Gianluca who organised a fabulous room upgrade and was the most charming receptionist we have ever met! His English was fabulous and we felt very rude only knowing a modicum of Italian.  The hotel was exceptionally clean and beautiful and all the staff, especially the Fine Dining restaurant and the pool side could not do enough for us.  We would highly recommend this hotel as you have the most beautiful view across the lagoon to San Marco…Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2019Dear Guest,  Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay in Venice and for sharing your great experience with all Trip Advisor´s readers.
