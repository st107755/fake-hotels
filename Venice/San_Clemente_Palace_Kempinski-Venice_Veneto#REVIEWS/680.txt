Only two nights to sample the wonderment if this hotel is not really enough. You have to try it to believe it. The level of service offered to guests is above and beyond...truly special. The hotel quality is amazing and can not be faulted. On arrival we were upgraded to a Junior Suite which got things off to a really good start. We were celebrating my partners birthday and even that was noted with a birthday cake waiting for us in the room. When you stay is nice hotels and the attention to detail is so good, your experience is enhanced to another level. Kempinski has really got this right. Brilliant.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 20, 2016Dear David S,  Thank you for your  feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.    We are pleased to hear, you have enjoyed your stay with us and appreciated our services.
