It is nice to have a quiet moment in this beautiful property. I had high expectations. We had a lagoon view room; the view was indeed fabulous but the room on the small side. Particularly the bathroom was small and did not feel luxurious enough compared with other St. Regis or Four Seasons. Too simple and plain, no place to hang wet hand towels. The room needed better lights as it was too dark to read or check maps. I would not go back if I ever go back to Venice. I would definitely choose the Gritti Palace.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 22, 2015Dear Guest,  I am very sorry to hear that you found the room too small for your needs, had you alerted a member of staff we could have moved you to one that you may have found yourself more comfortable For your next visit in Venice, please do let us know and we will try and meet your needs to the best we can.
