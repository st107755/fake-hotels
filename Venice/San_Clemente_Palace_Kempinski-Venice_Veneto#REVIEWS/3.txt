We booked for a night at this really wonderful, quit and charming place and we like it really, Wonderful garden, nice rooms, sundowner in the garden. Really good, But the prices are incredible high for this time of season in October. The pool was closed, the spa was closed, only the breakfast-room (the same room is also the dining-room) was opened. the service friendly but still in training. For our opinion, at this time they could do much better at this price-level.Read moreDate of stay: October 2020ValueLocationService2 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Claudia Zuin, Altro at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded 4 weeks agoDear 270herg,  thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
