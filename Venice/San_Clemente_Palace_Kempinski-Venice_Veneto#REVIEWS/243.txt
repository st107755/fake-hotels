The property itself is fantastic and we enjoyed the room, hotel building and the grounds including the old church. Check-in was too slow. The water front restaurant staff were least interested when enquired about dining options (they almost looked offended as if we are not fit for their fine dining). Cold staff in general. Even the guests didn't look like they are enjoying themselves. There was one redeeming incident - two young ladies managing the kids club - they were phenomenal with our kids.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 19, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
