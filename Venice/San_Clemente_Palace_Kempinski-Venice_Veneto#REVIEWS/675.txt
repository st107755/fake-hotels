After a couple of years I have the opportunity to visit Venice again. I came with my family and chose the newly re-opened San Clemente Palace which is now under the  management of Kempinski. This was definitely the best decision.  We experienced the excellent service right from our arrival until we left. It has another flair when we arrived at the hotel's boat dock to be greeted warmly and assisted by the staff. After the hustle & bustle in Venice, we could just go back to the island & its serenity. And this is made easy by the hotel's complimentary shuttle boat. We were able to totally relax given that there is so much wide open spaces & lush gardens.   The restaurants are all excellent. The buffet breakfast spread is what we look forward to every morning.
