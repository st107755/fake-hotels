Private island been rent from kempinski  Amazing outside areas  Top restaurant river view with amazing food  Nice pool but not many choices from the pool menu  Great breakfast  The only reason to make me go back again is the free boat transfers every 15 min all day to and from San Marcia Luxury private boats  The ride is just an experience  The rooms are big and very clean and the bathroom is spacious to our junior suite   No balconies in any room  Smoking areas all over outside the buildingRead moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
