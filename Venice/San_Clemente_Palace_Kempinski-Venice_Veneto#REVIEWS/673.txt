Amazing hotel. Lovely location. Hotel is beautiful. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Private water taxi to get to the hotel from Piazza San Marco which is one of the main tourist spots in Venice. You really do get the best of both, a quiet hotel away from the busy crowds but not too far away. The island the hotel is situated on is lovely too. Definetly worth checking out and going for a walk around. Breakfast is also very nice and definelty worth getting with your room.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
