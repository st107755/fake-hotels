Totally relax and enjoy one of the finest hotels in the world.  Staff is always freindly and making sure you are taken care of from the moment you arrive.  All the resturants are fantastic.  After traceling Europe for over a month, this is the place I want to return to again.  Thank you St. Regis Venice for a wonderful time.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
