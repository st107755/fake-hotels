A magnificent and luxurious destination on a private island just 15 minutes away from San Marco. A beautiful view from the rooms that will leave you speechless. High-quality food cooked in delicious dishes. A perfect ferry service going from place St.Marc to the hotel every 30 min. The concierge gave us precious restaurant recommendations and organized us a wonderful day-trip to Murano. The garden was well-maintained and profoundly relaxing. Covid  measures were well-respected, maybe excessively: no fitness center available only a small disposition of weights in the garden, the swimming pool was also closed and once we had to wait for the next ferry in order the respect the right amount of passengers on board. As a conclusion, an incredible stay in a first-class palace.Read moreDate of stay: July 2020HelpfulShare Response from Claudia Zuin, Other at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 23, 2020Dear IFDtravel,  I would like to thank you very much for your preference and for taking time to share your recent experience at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
