This was an excellent place for our family to end our Euro vacation. We were able to visit Venice and escape back to our "island" as our kids called it. The rooms were excellent- some of the most spacious I experienced in Europe. We had our own room and the kids had an adjoining double twin bed room. The butler service was a nice touch and the pool was a great treat in the summer heat.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
