Room was very spacious. Bed comfortable. The grounds are large so you can wander around without feeling cramped onto island The hotel occupies the whole island so it is very private. pool area with bar was very relaxing Excellent service from all staff especially the concierge who gave very good recommendations for restaurants in Venice  Room has an amazing view back over Venice.  Only negative is thet the first courtesy boat doesnt leave until 0850.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 4, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for sharing on our TripAdvisor page the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
