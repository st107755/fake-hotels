Stunning hotel and site.  Lush grounds, amazing pool, great water taxi service.  Superb attention to detail, spacious rooms, exquisite beds and bed linens, very comfortable and relaxing.  Great breakfast included.    Lovely grassy areas, tennis courts, pool is deep and cool, but has great seating and cabanas.  Small 3 hole pitch and put,  but had no left handed clubs, or kids clubs to borrow.  Otherwise a fantastic stay only 10 minutes from very busy Venice.
