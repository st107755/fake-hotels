My new favorite in Venice. Started as an option since my favorite was booked but it's won me over! Stunning property. Phenomenal staff. Amazing views. Simply superb!!  Can't wait to go back!!  Everything from check in to departure was first rate. Rooms were massive and elegant. Great to escape the crowds after a full day in town.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 31, 2017Dear BatesMoFo,  Thank you for your kind feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
