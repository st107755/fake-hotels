What a beautiful calm peaceful oasis this hotel is.  This property is stunningly beautiful and it is such a relief to return to after being in the hustle and bustle of the Venetian streets.  I would stay here again, just because it is so peaceful and so beautiful.  It has a great pool area with a lovely little outdoor restaurant.  The staff are extremely friendly and try hard but the service is a bit "clumsy".  Dinner on the terrace at Acquerello restaurant was lovely but again service was a bit clumsy and awkward.  Breakfast was fabulous!  Our room was really lovely and well equipped.   This is a gorgeous property,  beautiful grounds, lovely rooms and with a relaxed yet sophisticated elegant vibe.   I would definitely return and hope to do so one day!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 22, 2015Dear Guest,  Your nice feedback about your recent stay at The St. Regis,Venice is very appreciated.We are very glad that we met your expectations by providing an outstanding service.
