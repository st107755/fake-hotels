What a wonderful experience!  Our room was well-appointed, and we were well-cared for. This hotel is so welcoming to all its guests that they even have multinational foods available at the morning buffet!   The staff was very accommodating and helpful. Just stop at the concierge’s desk, and they will take care of it.  Venice was full of people, crowds everywhere. It was such a treat to know that when we’d had enough, we could go back to our quiet island to recharge by the pool, or just relax with a view across the lagoon. This was a very special time, and a very special memory. I can’t wait to go back!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
