This property is absolutely amazing. The staff from the first minute we arrived to when we had to leave were so friendly and were attentive to every detail. The property is beautiful in every way. The rooms are large and beautifully decorated. Ours had a great view looking towards Venice. Pool and surrounding area is relaxing after spending the day in the center of Venice. The water taxi service is convenient and provides easy access to St. Mark's. I would highly recommend this hotel and I hope to visit again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
