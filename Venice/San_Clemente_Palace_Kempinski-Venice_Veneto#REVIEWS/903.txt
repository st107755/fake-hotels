Spacious, newly refurbed, helpful staff, great concierge, good breakfast, perfect for escaping the Venice crowds. The hotel is on its own island, 15 mins by boat to Venice mainland. Hotel provides a free and reliable transfer every 30 mins to and from St Marks Square. I was with my husband and two kids and would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
