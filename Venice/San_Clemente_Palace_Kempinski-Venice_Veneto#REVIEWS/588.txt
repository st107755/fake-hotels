San Clemente Palace is a beautiful facility on its own island a short shuttle from St. Marks. The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are exquisite. The employees go the extra mile to insure your stay with them is memorable. I had no idea that this oasis in busy Venice even existed.After a busy day seeing the sights it was wonderful to return and lay by the pool for a little peace and quiet. They named it a palace for a reason and when staying there between the facility, grounds and employees your feel like royalty.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
