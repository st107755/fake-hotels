We loved this hotel.  The St. Regis Clementina is a former monastery turned hotel, on a private island ten minutes from the hoi polloi of Venice.  Stark luxury--each room has 25 foot ceilings, the hallways are like bowling alleys.  Very quiet, with gorgeous grounds and views from every part of the island.  The service is fantastic.  With zero notice, the concierge made a few phone calls and arranged a tennis pro, as well as complimentary water taxis for an excursion.  The waiter remembered us (as well as our cocktails of choice). We felt extremely taken care of at this property.  We will definitely come back!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
