Wonderful place, outstanding service level, nice room, excellent food. Unfortunately, even tbough it is forbidden, some clients bring kids toys (inflatable mattress, big buoys, etc. ) preventing other clients from using the swimming pool and making the pool area very noisy. We do recommend this hotel and look forward to going back.
