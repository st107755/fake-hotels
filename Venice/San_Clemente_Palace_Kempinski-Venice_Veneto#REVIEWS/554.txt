From the location to the staff and everything in between this hotel was absolutely AMAZING.  It was our honeymoon and the guest service left us a beautiful handwritten card with cookies and chocolate as a welcome in our room.  The grounds are large and private perfect for my husband and I to stroll.  The only time we knew we were not only was in the restaurants or on the shuttle bus which are very punctual.  Very quiet and romantic.  We will definitely return to this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
