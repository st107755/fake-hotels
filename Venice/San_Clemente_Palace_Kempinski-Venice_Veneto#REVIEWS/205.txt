We arrived in the early evening by water taxi which was a great start to the holiday.  The concierge met us from the water taxi and showed us to the reception.  All staff were both friendly & helpful throughout our stay.  We had a pizza at the Dolce bar which was pricey but a pleasant atmosphere.  Breakfast had an excellent choice of food, relaxed atmosphere and very attentive staff.  We had a superior room which was large, airy & comfortable.  If I wanted to "picky" we missed the lack of tea, coffee facilities!  It was nice to be away from the busyness of Venice for just a few hours.  Fantastic views and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 30, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your great feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
