Great Place to spend Vacation, wonderfull Food and Service.  Very close to San Marco Square, away from the Mainhem and loudness of big crowds. One of the best Hotels I have seen so far. No wonder is part of the Leading Hotels of the World. It deserves its reputation!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
