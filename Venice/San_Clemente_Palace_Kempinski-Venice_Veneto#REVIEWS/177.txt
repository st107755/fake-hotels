A fantastic property with swimming pool, tennis court, great fitness center.  The staff is exemplary.  The property is extraordinary.  The food and service excellent.  You are living in a palace that was converted into a hotel.  The property is a small island completely owned by the hotel.  It even has a 1000 year old church.  The ceilings are remarkable high; extra exercise just wandering the halls.Read moreDate of stay: August 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Feb 5, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review your stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
