Overall an interesting stay. Large facility with a resort feel.  Great complementary boat ride to the hotel with an on-time and organized schedule. It's nice to get out of crowded venice streets and have some space and tranquility. This hotel is great for that and would highly recommend the venue.  Reception can improve; we were told we had breakfast included in our stay, later saw we were charge. Had to argue which was not pleasant, as they gave the impression that the front desk did not make a mistake! but they ended up accommodating at least. Front desk at times does not answer calls and we asked for an iron, it took 1 night and a morning to arrive, three calls after!! All&all was happy we stayed here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 14, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
