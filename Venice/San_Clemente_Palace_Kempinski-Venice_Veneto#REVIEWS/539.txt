So it's the wife's birthday. She never been to Venice. Got to take her somewhere special.   You want special?  San Clemente gives you special.   The hotel has to be one of the plushest in Venice (which is saying something). What's more, it's in a vast plush palace on it's own island.  An island not only with this very special hotel but also a large pool and acres of land much of which is wooded.   A hotel owned waterbus takes you from San Marco to the island and back. It's about 5 minutes to do the trip. What's great is that while St Mark's Square can get very crowded and hot in the summer, if it all gets too much you can jump on the boat and in five minutes you'll be walking through the cool woods on the island.
