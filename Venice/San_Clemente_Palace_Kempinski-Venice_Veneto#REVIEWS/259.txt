So glad we booked our stay here away from the hotels on the “mainland” of Venice! This private island provided a quiet getaway after touring the often crowded streets/piazzas of the surrounding islands. It was kinda cool taking a private water taxi to the resort. The staff was attentive and friendly. Nice wide and long hallways. The rooms were fairly large, clean and very comfortable.
