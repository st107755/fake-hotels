Completing a review of a stay of over a year ago, so beware that mine is not contemporary as some, but I believe still accurately reflects what you should expect to see here.  Rooms: No your tiny European room, but rather spacious and nicely appointed.  No complaints about the bath, bed and housekeeping.  Staff helpful and professional, but did observe some cynicism on the part of a few young staff when the patron's back was turned.  Typical of the young generation everywhere these days as many do not consider service as a stepping stone to ascending to upper management in the hospitality arena.  Food:  Everything from breakfast to in-house restaurant was top shelf.  Loved the convenient launch service to Venice.  A true luxury property in my opinion.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 6, 2017Dear ohgeorge, Thank you for your review of our hotel.
