An amazing hotel! The grounds are beautiful and the hotel itself is impressive. Staff are on hand to provide a genuinely warm welcome and nothing appeared to be too much trouble to help us enjoy our stay. The complimentary water taxi service to Venice city is reliable and quick so you never feel too far away from the action. Can't wait to return to this hotel!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for the generous words describing your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
