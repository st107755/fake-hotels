Beautiful location with reliable transport every half hour to and from St Marks Sq. Pool lovely and quiet allowing relaxing contrast with bustling centre of Venice. I had a couple of problems at the hotel and the management dealt with it swiftly and fairly. I would thoroughly recommend it. Decor modern but in keeping with Venice style.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to share the feedback of your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
