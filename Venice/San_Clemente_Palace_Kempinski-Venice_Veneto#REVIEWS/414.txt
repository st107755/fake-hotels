Our stay went well above and beyond our expectations. The staff was truly attentive and pleasant - every single one of them! Yes - to get to San Marcos Square it is a courtesy ferry ride - but that really adds to the allure. The island felt like a haven after a day of exploring in the city! We will certainly return to stay here - Venice is magical the hotel just added to the experience!Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
