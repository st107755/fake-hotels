My boat engine overheated and I mored on the island around 5am The security staff member was vey impolite and unhelpful, as well as the duty manager who threaten to call the police on me for illegal parking.  I was forced to swim and climb onto the island before I could check into a room.  After checking in the hotel staff had to be nice to me.

Hopefully you will have the chance to experience the hotel on another occasion, thus giving us the opportunity to change your perception.  Sincerely,Read more
