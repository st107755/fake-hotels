10 mins by boat from city centre, but with view of the city. Away from the hustle and bustle. Pool (rare for Venice) beautiful setting. Staff amazing! Pool area and restaurant fab! Everything you could need for a holiday. Especially loved the Acqua de Palma toiletries. Would certainly reccomend.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
