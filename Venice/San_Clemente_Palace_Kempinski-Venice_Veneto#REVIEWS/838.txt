Nice location, beautiful garden but the rest is quite disappointing. My room was in a small building behind the church. The path to the building is in a bad shape and dirty with electric cables hanging from the walls. In the small lobby of the building there was a mattress against a wall, walls in desperate need for a painter and the elevator smelled of humidity. Food and service are below average. This hotel does not meet the St Regis quality standards. I am a Starwood Platinum member and I filled out the Starwood review after departure complaining for the quality of the room and I never got a reply back from the hotel management (I always do!). A very disappointing experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from Pietro R, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 12, 2015Dear Guest First of all we would like to thank you for letting us know about your recent stay with us.
