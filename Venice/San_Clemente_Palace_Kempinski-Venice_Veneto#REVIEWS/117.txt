From the airport arrival to the day of leaving everything was smooth and clean. The hotel is a fantastic building with many amenities, the staff were very polite and helpful the choice of breakfast was great. The restaurants and bars were very nice cannot think of a bad moment or food. Would recommend and visit again one day.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 5, 2019Dear Mr Nigel C,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience with all Trip AdvisorÂ´s readers.
