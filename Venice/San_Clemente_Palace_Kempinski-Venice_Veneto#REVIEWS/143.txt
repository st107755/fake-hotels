Wonderful experience all around. Just far enough away from beautiful Venice to get away from the crowds and relax in a great atmosphere. The grounds are gorgeous to explore with a wonderful view of Venice. The water shuttle runs every 30 minutes like clockwork from the island as well as from San Marco. The breakfast spread was absolutely amazing. The staff was superb. Michael the concierge gave us great suggestions for places to eat where locals enjoy, we wanted to stay away from the touristy restaurants. Costi at the bar was the highlight of our stay. He awed us with his card tricks outside in the afternoon and provided great conversation in the evening when we went to the bar for our nightcap. Both bartenders seemed to be good peoples. ;)Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 1, 2019Dear ddawny3, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
