Incredibly helpful, polite and friendly staff.  A beautiful hotel in a stunning location on a private island, just perfect in every way... The shuttle boat to and from St Marks Square was every half hour and therefore you never had to wait that long either way, it was just so well organised and efficient. Definitely would love to return.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 17, 2018Dear guest, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
