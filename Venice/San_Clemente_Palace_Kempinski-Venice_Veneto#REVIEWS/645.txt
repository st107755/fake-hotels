We stayed here for a night during a 36 hour tour of Venice and it did not disappoint. The location of the hotel on its own island, accessed via a tender from St Marks square was impressive and the ride to the island was great as we got to see Venice from a distance. Rooms are huge as is the hotel generally and the restaurant and bars are as opulent as I've seen. We stayed in March so the pool was closed but I'd imagine that it would be great on a hot day with the backdrop of the lagoon with Venice beyond..Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
