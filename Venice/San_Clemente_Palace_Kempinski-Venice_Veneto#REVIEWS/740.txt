What can I say- Venice is beautiful but when you arrive by boat to your own private island life cannot get better. Running path short but great. Room big high ceilings fabulous- huge bathroom- stayed with a girlfriend and they split the bed into twins from a king - the restaurant was fabulous- delicious dinner - The bar is beautiful hang out with rafaleo the bartender and ask for a spritz!
