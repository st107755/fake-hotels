This was our 4th visit to the hotel, although it's around 10 years since our last stay, and it seems to get better every time.   The trip was to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday and they went out of their way to ensure it was special, with complimentary prosecco and chocolates in our room, and additional treats each few days.  The room was stunning, the grounds and pool area beautiful and the service exceptional.  At breakfast there was the option to dine indoors or outside in the courtyard. On previous stays we had noticed service issues at breakfast, but over our 9 day stay this time there was not one single problem. Service was seamless and professional, the food selection was vast and of the highest quality, and the whole experience every single morning was flawless.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 14, 2019Dear mb1605, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
