This is an follow up comment to my previous review of this property.  Given the somewhat negative feedback I provided earlier, I was contacted by SR management. I got the feeling that they took my comments seriously and were willing to take constructive criticism in a constructive way. As such, I would like to add a star to my previous review & look forward to seeing/experiencing the improvements during my next visit to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
