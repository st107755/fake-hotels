My wife and visited Venice and the Kempinski last week for three days. I am well traveled and had the fortune of staying in lots of nice hotels but must say from the moment we were greeted off our water taxi to the moment we left, our stay was never short of excellent. The staff were brilliant and the suite offered a form of luxury any hotel would aspire to. Well-done to the hotel and staff. The hotel offers a supreme level of service and its location albeit around 15mins by private water shuttle away offers a piece of tranquility set in a bustling city.  Venice was amazing.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
