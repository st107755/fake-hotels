When visiting to look around the hotel we had lunch and were disappointed. Expensive c30 euro per pasta dish, was expecting at this price to have better presentation, service and quality of food. Also to note this was the first location to suffer from wasps and flies. Note this is not a rating on the overall hotel just lunch at Garden bar.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 25, 2016Dear MartL001,  Thank you for sharing your feedback on your lunch at La Dolce restaurant.
