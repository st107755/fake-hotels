I was hesitant to stay away from Venice proper but this hotel on it's own island took away any of my doubts,  The service was exceptional and as was our deluxe room overlooking Sam Marco Sqaure in the distance.  The concierge and hotel staff were so accomadating and responded to numerous e-mail berfore we even arrived.  We had dinner on the terrace and the food was delicious.  Breafeast is serviced inside or in a courtyard when wethaer permits and fantastic,  They offer a complimentary water shuttle to Sam Marci Sqaure for sightseeing and touristic activities.  We even had a famour artist as our next door neighbor!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
