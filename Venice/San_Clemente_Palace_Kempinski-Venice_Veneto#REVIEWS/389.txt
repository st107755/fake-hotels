Our stay in Venice was constrained to a couple of days. We decided to stay at the San Clemente to get a break away from the main tourist areas after our sight seeing s days and this worked became of the tranquility of Sean Clemente.  The hotel is beautiful and very peaceful which assisted with amazing nights sleep.  The rooms have high ceilings and are very spacious.  Make sure to explore the grounds.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
