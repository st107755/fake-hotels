Fabulous hotel in a super location.  Just returned from a wonderful 6 night stay. After a busy day sightseeing it's great to escape the hustle and bustle of Venice and head back home to the tranquility and luxury of the San Clemente. The hotel's boat service is a treat in itself and takes around 15 minutes to St Marks. Forget the 5 star hotels in Venice, this hotel is far superior. Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
