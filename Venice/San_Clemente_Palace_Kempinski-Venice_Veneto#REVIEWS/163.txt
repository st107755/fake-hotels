I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the unique property in Venice! The hotel is located on a private island just 15 minutes away from San Marco.  Just alone the arrival experience is incredible, hoping on a boat after busy Venice (especially now during Easter it was really crowded) and arriving on the calm island was great! They really have these wooden, typical Venetian boats! Breakfast buffet was really great although the hotel must have been full during these days. The hotel has a unique Venetian design. My room had a probably 3 to 5 meter high ceiling.  We had dinner at La Dolce by the pool which was really casual and you can enjoy a great pizza! I recommend the truffle pizza!Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from LudoviciMarko, Executive Assistant Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 25, 2019Dear KaiWink, I would like to thank you very much for sharing your positive comments and feelings based on your experience at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski on the occasion of Easter celebration.
