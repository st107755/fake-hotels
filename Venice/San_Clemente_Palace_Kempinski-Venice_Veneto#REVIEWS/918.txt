The hotel is located on its own private island, just a short complimentary boat ride (water taxi) to San Marco Square. The staff went out of their way to get us to the hotel as we landed in a hailstorm and our original water taxi could no longer navigate the lagoon. Lorenzo, the concierge, was very helpful at getting dinner reservations set up for us. The restaurant on property was excellent! Only wish I had another day there to enjoy the pool.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
