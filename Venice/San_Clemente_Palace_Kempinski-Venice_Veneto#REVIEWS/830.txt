Stayed here as part of a tour from end to end of Italy.  Best accommodations of the trip.  Just don't plan to eat there, go into Venice.  Sodas at the hotel were something like $12 each.  But can't beat the luxury and the special treatment with the private yachts to and from St. Mark's Square to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
