A wonderful hotel in its own private island and just 10 minutes from Venice, via private water transportation. Everything first class. Excellent quality and service in every aspect. Highly recommended, if you are looking for unique experience. Thanks to their wonderful staff, specially to the Ladies in Red. Carlotta made our stay extremely special.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 26, 2017Dear Adalberto P, Thank you for your feedback on your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
