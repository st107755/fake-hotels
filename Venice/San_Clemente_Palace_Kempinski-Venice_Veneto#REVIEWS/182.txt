Do not underestimate Venice off season!  Very short but very pleasant stay at this luxury property located on a private island with complimentary boat shuttle to/from San Marco.  Impeccable staff, tastefully casual-chic atmosphere, full service range available, including spectacular breakfast buffet and in-room courtesy details.  Clean and quiet, needless to say.
