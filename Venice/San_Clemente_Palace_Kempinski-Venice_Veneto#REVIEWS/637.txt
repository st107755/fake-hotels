We stayed here for a 3-night wedding anniversary, long weekend. As a surprise trip, I didn't have any wifely input to get the right hotel, but I'm delighted I chose the San Clemente.   The location, hotel & service were all excellent, as was the breakfast. We're sorry we didn't try out the restaurants for dinner, but spent most of our time exploring Venice and eating out. For those thinking that staying on the Grand Canal is a must, we found the opposite. After a full day exploring Venice, the joy of picking up the hotel boat from Piazza San Marco and arriving at our peaceful haven 10 minutes later was beyond joy. The grounds & hotel are absolutely stunning. We look forward to returning in the future.
