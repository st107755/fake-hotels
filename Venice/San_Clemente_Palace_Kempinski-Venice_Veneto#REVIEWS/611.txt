You must stay here.  The hotel is perfect.   The transportation free boat shuttle to San Marco works very well.   The check in desk and the concierge are 5 star service providers.  The waterside bar is excellent and the bar snacks are next level.   The restaurant is also very good and definitely worth a meal even in a city with food options like Venice.   We spent a couple hours at the pool and it was very nice and well cared for.    Venice is awesome and we loved it but it is nice to take some time away and the island is very peaceful (especially in August)Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear travelingENT, Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
