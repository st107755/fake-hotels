Had a fabulous stay here in October. It's an escape from the busy and noise from Venice. The hotel has a free water to and from the square. It feels like a peaceful escape. It's a traditional but slightly modern style hotel (definitely not like the old Venetian style of rooms like some of the hotels on the island). The good was quite good, as well as cocktails as the staff were really attentive. I was missing facecloths from my room and it took the next day for this to be sorted (I think there was a language barrier as I had more hand towels instead in my room). The only thing missing for this hotel is a spa, which they are working on and should open in spring 2017.  This place is beautiful when the sun sets so make sure you make time to view this.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 3, 2017Dear lilexie, Thank you very much for your kind feedback on your stay at our hotel.
