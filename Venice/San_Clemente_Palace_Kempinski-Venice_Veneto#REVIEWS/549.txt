We went to Italy for our Honeymoon and Venice was one of our stops! We decided to stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski which is a private island hotel. I have to tell you, the hotel is gorgeous!! It is very well kept.  The hotel, the staff, the room, the food - all were amazing!! I would definitely come back to this hotel! Our experience at this hotel was exceptional.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
