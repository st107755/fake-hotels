I took my wife here for a 40th birthday treat & the hotel surpassed all expectations. A beautiful getaway from the hustle & bustle of Venice. The complimentary shuttle boat service really added to the experience & certainly saved some much needed euros! The staff couldn't have done more for us, with all service industries & taking human involvement into account you are always going to get a few minor shortcomings. However, it is how you deal with these that create magic touches & we were surprised to receive complimentary cocktails for a breakfast service that we were informed was below the hotels expectations.  The public areas are special & they do make you feel like you're on a film set. The newly restored church is amazing & wonderful to walk around in peace & tranquilityâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
