My husband and I stayed here with our 2 kids--ages 16 and 19.  We needed two rooms--one king and one with twin beds.  Rooms are HUGE by European standards.  I was a bit apprehensive that we were on an island and not in the heart of Venice, but after a long day with the crowds, it was VERY nice to come back to a quiet, beautiful place.  The complimentary boat to and from Venice was always on time and the bottles of water in the cooler was a nice touch!  I heard many of the hotel guests comment that this was one of the best hotels they have EVER stayed at and I have to agree. Simply stunning!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Scott H,  Thank you very much for such an enthusiastic review.
