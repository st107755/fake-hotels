This hotel is brand new.  The staff is very courteous.  The rooms are huge, unlike most European hotel rooms.  The restaurant by the pool has great food.  This is a great hotel to get away from the hustle and bustle of all the tourists in Venice.  Very quiet, relaxing atmosphere.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
