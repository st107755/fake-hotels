After a slightly rocky start with the check-in the remainder of the stay was excellent.  It was the perfect base for exploring Venice and then relaxing by the pool at the end of the day.  There was a boat running every 20 minutes to and from the hotel. The room was stunning and very spacious, we even had a complimentary welcome mini bar.  Housekeeping also provided a turn down service with slippers and water bottles.  We only ate at the poolside restaurant on the last day for lunch which was good.   They also offered a waiter service around the pool area.  I didn't quite manage the gym so not sure what that was like.  We did sit and have pre-dinner drinks at one of the other bars overlooking the water, it was magical.  Would definitely return for another stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 18, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
