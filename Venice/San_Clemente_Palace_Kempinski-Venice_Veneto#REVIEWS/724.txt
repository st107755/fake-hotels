This property is a wonderful respite from the  tourist crowds of Venice - and yet, a quick boat shuttle away - you can access all that you want. Stayed in a 2-room suite that was lovely. Ate a beautiful meal in the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the European buffet for breakfasts. The property is gorgeous and pristine, but the helpful and friendly attitudes of every employee is what makes this experience over-the-top. The concierge gave us numerous suggestions that always met our exact need for accessing the best of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
