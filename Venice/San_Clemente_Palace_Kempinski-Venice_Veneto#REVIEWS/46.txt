The hotel is beautiful, immaculate and quiet.  The breakfast is excellent and the servers were so accommodating  We had the most memorable meal in Acquerello Restaurant while staying at the San Clemente.  It was absolutely outstanding- the beautiful evening outdoors on the terrace, the entire meal was delicious!  But the evening was made truly memorable by the excellent service provided by Marco and Stephanie B.  We will never forget them!  They both took such good care of us during our meal.  We felt truly pampered!  I told my husband it was the best dining experience Iâ€™ve ever had.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 28, 2019Dear Runner0707,  thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
