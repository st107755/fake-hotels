Absolutely fantastic place to stay. Staff is great. There is a shuttle boat every half hour that takes you to and from San Marco ( St. Mark’s Square)which is about a ten minute ride. The pool area is very nice, there is a tennis court, spa and a kids club.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay in Venice and for sharing your great experience with all TripAdvisor´s readers.
