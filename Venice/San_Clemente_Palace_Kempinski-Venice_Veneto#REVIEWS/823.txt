What a lovely resort on a lovely island just a stone's throw from Venice!  With the shuttle boat (runs very regularly every 30 minutes), it's easy to get to Venice.  We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing at the pool and dining at Aquarello with a beautiful view of Venice.  Breakfast buffet was outstanding!  Staff was friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
