My wife and I stayed at this fabulous hotel 18th-21st June, 2016. Absolutely wonderful hotel on it's own Island, just 10 minutes (in their own water taxis) to Venice main city. We booked via BA (flight + hotel - with B&B included), the hotel is top end luxury. Wonderful grounds, outdoor pool & service.  I think I had seen a previous TA comment about the service at breakfasts and I can also comment that whilst the food was great the staff (lots of them for very few customers) seemed to be switched off for a couple of the days we were there, looked like there were some internal squabbles going on which lets the hotel down a little because everywhere else the service was exceptional.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear 988Mark,  Thank you for your feedback on your stay at our property.
