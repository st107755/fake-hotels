Fantastic property. Just 10 minutes by boat from San Marco and yet in a separate island which proved to be much cooler than the city of Venice in the hot month of August. It's a fantastic nomination as you can visit the city of Venice during the day, but then withdraw to this lovely property and enjoy the beautiful gardens and relax by the pool as if you were having a summer holiday by the beach. Service is excellent and very friendly, rooms are well appointed and breakfast is very good. Only minor drawback, the bill we got at the end was completely and grossly wrong and I had to go through each item and get it corrected. I know I am not the only one this has happened to, so I suggest a bit of care when checking out.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
