The hotel is very enjoyable because you can press a in the lobby and crew send you up to your room! There is a tennis court, pool, soccer field, golf, spa and even a outside bar! They have there own boats to Venice from the hotel! The whole hotel is in the water on a island! In Venice there is NO cars only boats and water taxis, police and garbage trucks! Come now! P.S the medataraiden sea flooded Venice so now there is water everywhere!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear 593owen, Thank you for taking the time to review our resort.
