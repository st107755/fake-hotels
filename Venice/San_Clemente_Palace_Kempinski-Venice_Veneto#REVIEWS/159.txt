Very high quality peaceful hotel on its own island just 15 minutes from heart of Venice. Very interesting old church attached to the hotel.  Well appointed rooms, beautiful grounds, extremely professional staff. The food was excellent, with a great breakfast range. Swimming pool well managed. Disappointed that there were Tea bags in the room , but no coffee, and I need a coffee when i arrive and wake up ...I could have used room service but this i just a hassle. Very impressed with staff, especially Simona who ran the breakfast delivery and Karston in the restaurant at the swimming pool, an lady ..Valentina? [from Sicily} on reception. The boat leaves the dock every 30 mins to St Marks square, and the last one is around 12.30 midnight.  It is expensive, but then you always payâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from LudoviciMarko, Executive Assistant Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 30, 2019Dear Douglas, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
