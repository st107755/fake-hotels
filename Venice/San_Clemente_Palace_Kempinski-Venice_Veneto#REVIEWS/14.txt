We expected 5 star everything, but got 1 star service. The accomodations are outdated and need renovations. The ambience is nice because they have a large sprawling property that overlooks Venice across the water. But the staff are not friendly, not trained well in service, and it shows. The water taxis take forever even when they call them for a specific time, so their shuttle seems better, although it is not that frequent either. Definitely do NOT go here. A waste of your money and you will be angry at their horrific, arrogant, rude service.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Nov 17, 2019Dear worldtraveler952015, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay. We regret that we were not able to reach your expectations to the fullest in terms of service in general. Kindly note that the shuttle service was not guaranteed regular on the last days due to the exceptional weather in all Venice area and the staff did their utmost to grant safe service.
