Just back from a short week in Venice.  This is the place to stay.  After exploring the city, there is nothing more wonderfully resting than taking the 10 minute complementary boat shuttle to your own private island, far from the crowds.    The place is huge, but it is because the building is so vast.  Everything is perfectly appointed.  At the same time, it feels very homely.  Staff is always happy to help and cannot do enough.  The concierge is very attentive and made all our bookings as requested.  Had some very good advice too.  The food is tasty and portions very generous.  On the last evening of the stay we could not face the crowds of Venice and stayed on this little paradise that this island essentially is.  All perfect.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!
