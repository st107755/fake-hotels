The hotel is situated on a small island a short boat ride away from the busy city center of the legendary Laguna. The building used to be a monastery adding to the peaceful serenity of the island's beautiful garden. Even the ancient church is preserved and can be visited. Chirping birds in the trees and the purling water just beneath the edges of the generous terrace make you feel in love with life. Having a sundowner while viewing the glittering silhouette of Venice slowly lighting up is a nice way to start the evening before hitting the city for dinner. The staff was really courteous and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 20, 2016Dear Cristina W,  Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.    We are pleased to hear, you have enjoyed your stay with us.
