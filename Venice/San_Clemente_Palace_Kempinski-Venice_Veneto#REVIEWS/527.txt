Stayed for 3 nights at this iconic kempinski hotel.  Service excellence was at its best. From arriving to our departure every request was taking care of in a professional manner.  Personal attention was always there when needed.  Their cuisine was outstanding. If you have the opportunity to have dinner in their fine dining please try the gnocchi. Simply superb. Thank you team for making our holiday special.  Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
