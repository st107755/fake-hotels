My wife and I were heading off on a Cruise ship from Venice.  Rather than arrive and head directly to the Cruise Ship, we decided to spend an evening before our departure.  This would help the 6 hours of Timezone change plus it gives you time to unwind before the cruise.  The Hotel was fabulous.  It all starts when you jump on their free shuttle to the Hotel, then once you walk through the front doors you see the wonderful staff all ready to help you out.  In the end, we should have stayed more evenings just to enjoy everything the Hotel has to offer.  Next time we go to Venice, I'll be staying there againRead moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 9, 2015Dear Guest We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.Thank you for highlighting the beauty of our magical island and our services.
