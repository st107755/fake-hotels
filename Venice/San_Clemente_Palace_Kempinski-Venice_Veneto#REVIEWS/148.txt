I am writing this review on behalf of my father and his wife, who stayed at the hotel last week.   They had an unforgettable stay and were looked after so well by all the staff in the hotel.  As part of the deal they had booked they had breakfast and dinner.  My father said the food was excellent.  They even sorted out afternoon tea for his wife's birthday one day.  Eating breakfast al fresco was very special and the view over to Venice was unbeatable.  The hotel provides a complimentary water taxi, which leaves every 20 minutes.  Escaping back to the peace and tranquility of the island after the crowds in Venice was very special.  A huge thank you in particular to Claudia Zim, who ensured they were really taken care of.  It really was a perfect stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 30, 2019Dear LizY123,  thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
