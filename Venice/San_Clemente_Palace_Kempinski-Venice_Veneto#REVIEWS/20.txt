Some surprises at arrival; the spa, the heated pool and the casual restaurant nearby the pool (where they say you could have gotten the best pizza in Venice) were closed from our day of arrival (November 1st) on. The rooms including bathroom (at least our room) were only heated in the morning and the evening. Not nice when you already arrive with a cold. Apart from that a very well led hotel, very kind and helpful staff that knows its business, excellent restaurant, excellent roomservice, superb breakfast, nice room, very neat hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Nov 11, 2019Dear Adventurer627429, thank you for the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
