The St. Regis in Venice is one of the best hotels my wife and I have ever stayed at, if not the best!  First of all the staff is extremely friendly and service minded, starting from before our arrival. The 10 minute mahogney boat ride transport you from the very busy and crowded Piazza San Marco to a calm haven of luxury on a gorgeous little island. The property and the facilities are fantastic, both inside and outside.  The rooms are pure luxury, the beds to die for, the breakfast a feast really, the pool area fantastic- and all of this just 10 minutes from the city center.  We loved the boat ride - it was just perfect to whisk you away after that bustling city! We know where we are staying the next time we are in Venice!Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
