An interesting property located on St Clemente island. This exquisite property is well put together with fine touches and makes for a fine destination.  The property and rooms are well kept and luxuriously furnished. There is an air of tranquility which gives a welcoming respite from the crowds in Venice. Truly lives up to its historical significance as a sanctuary. The grounds are well kept and is a pleasant evening stroll. The outdoor pool is beautiful in the moonlight. Dinner at the much acclaimed Acquerello was average at best. Beautiful sunset views overlooking Plazza San Marco and excellent service was however not matched by the food.  Still, it is a choice destination and well worth a stay. Special mention must be made of the Head Conceirge who is extremely knowledgeableâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 13, 2017Dear Tze Chong W, Thank you for your positive feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
