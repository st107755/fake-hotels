Incredible hotel in a former monetary on its own island.  Our room was huge and looked out over the lagoon to Venice.  One night we sat outside at the bar and watched the sun set.  Breakfast was included with our room and was excellent with all kinds of choices.  I do agree that buying food on the island was expensive.  A couple of drinks and some sandwiches cost $200 for lunch one day.  We found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  Nice outdoor pool and fitness room. Make sure you are part of the Kempinski rewards program.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear jasonschmidt321, Thank you for sharing your positive feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
