We are staying for 3 days in the San Clemente Palace. They upgraded us to the Marco Polo Suite a very large Suite with waterviews from all the windows. Nice large bathroom and large bedroom.Very nice very large Breakfast buffet ! We arrived late at night and had a beautiful ride from the airport without any traffic. Very nice Pool area nice Restaurant next to the Pool ! Unfortunately we did not manage to get a Reservation at the Aquarello Restaurant. Easy Ride by boat to San Marco, Murano or anywhere by Taxi.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 17, 2019Dear Crystal1942, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
