This hotel has nice open rooms with a nice view of Venice.  However, the hotel is on its own island.  Free shuttles come back and forth to the hotel.  This is unreliable since the shuttle has certain timetables and takes 15 minutes.  Also, this hotel is gigantic so it could take quite a long time to even get to your own room.  This hotel feature history since it was a convent long ago.  Also, the hotel has a nice breakfast buffet serving pastries, cereals, fruits, and more.  A restaurant, La Dolce, serves lunch and dinner.  The hotel requires tons of walking so if your handicap, this hotel is a no no.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from Pietro R, Public Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 11, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for leaving a review of our property on Tripadvisor. As you correctly point out, our hotel offers a complementary shuttle service to and from St. Mark's Square. The shuttle departs regularly and its schedule is quite reliable. I regret that in your experience this was not the case and wish to assure you that our drivers are generally very scrupulous in observing the timetable given to guests. Naturally a delay may occur from time to time but it is quite rare. We find that most guests enjoy being in our serene oasis, gently removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. Again thank you for staying with us and for sharing your opinion.Read more
