This hotel is so wonderful. As its on its own island and getting the boat to Venice every day made our visit even lovelier. It runs every 30 minutes until midnight so you have lots of options to getting around. The hotel restaurant and bar are a must if you are staying. The view of Venice is incredible while having a drink outside. Thank you for a great few days, with great service the whole time. We will be back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 10, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
