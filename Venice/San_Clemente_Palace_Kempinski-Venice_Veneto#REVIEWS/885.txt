My sister and I really enjoyed our stay at this oasis by Venice. The staff was wonderful! Ketty met us when we stepped off our short boat ride from San Marco and immediately made us feel welcome. She was always ready to help us in any way.  Guillome was extremely warm and helpful. I feel like he is one of a kind and the hotel is so lucky to have him. I feel like I've made a new friend.  If you want to relax and be pampered stay at the st Regis San Clemente palace.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
