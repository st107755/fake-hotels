I was worried after making my reservation that not being on main island would be a disadvantage however I think that there is no nicer way to arrive in Piazza San Marco each day. The calm of the island, it's beautiful grounds and stunning church are a haven away from bustling tourists. Our room was beautiful with a stunning lagoon view. The rooms are simply elegant, spacious (which I had not experienced in other 5 star hotels in Venice) and well equipped. Staff, whether in corridors, at reception or in restaurants were friendly, warm and helpful. The building is incredible with wide corridors, tasteful d√©cor and a feeling of calm despite the number of guests.  I would recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning on my next Venice trip.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 28, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your detailed and truly appreciated comment shared on TripAdvisor.
