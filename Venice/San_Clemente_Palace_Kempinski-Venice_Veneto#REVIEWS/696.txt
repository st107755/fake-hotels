My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and decided to stay at San Clemente Palace, which incidentally was part of St Regis in September 2015. The hotel was very nice as were the rooms. However, we had the worse service one could imagine. The newspaper did not arrive in the morning, and that carried on despite numerous requests! The staff were most unhelpful and kept on passing the buck. Totally unacceptable and therefore I would not recommend this property to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
