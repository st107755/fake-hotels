Wow! Fantastic hotel set in beautiful grounds, just a short boat ride from mainland. Very impressive hotel, wide corridors which were very well decorated. Spacious rooms. Lovely setting for relaxing and then close enough to pop over to visit the sites of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
