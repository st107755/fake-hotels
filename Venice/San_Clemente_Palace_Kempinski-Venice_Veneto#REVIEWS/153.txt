This is one of the best hotels I've stayed at.  The property is exquisite and the service was top notch.  The rooms are large with high ceilings!  This is a 5 star resort!  The free boat shuttle runs every half hour from the island to San Marco and takes about 10 minutes.  It may cause you to rush so you don't have to wait a half hour but the ride is nice and is beautiful and relaxing once on the boat.  Breakfast is great and the service was outstanding.  Highly Recommend!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 13, 2019Dear JimUnited1, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
