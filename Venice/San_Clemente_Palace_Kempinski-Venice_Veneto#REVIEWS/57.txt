The entire property is gorgeousâ€”but you already know that. What you might not know is that there's a charming bartender named Costi at the hotel bar who also doubles as a magician and will endlessly entertain you. The bar is quiet - we showed up around 11:30pm after dinner and ended up staying there until 1:30am because he was not only making great drinks but also entertaining the entire group of 15 we had with his tricks. He even stayed open later because we were having an excellent time.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 7, 2019Dear klr330, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
