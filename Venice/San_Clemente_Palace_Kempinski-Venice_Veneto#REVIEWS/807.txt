Under 15 minutes by boat from St Mark's Square, the San Clemente Palace is an ideal place to stay during the heat of summer.  It is a former monastery, and the architecture is elegant.  The service is well-meaning but not the most efficient unless you have butler service.  We were fortunate enough to have Lena and Ioana look after us: they were terrific.  The grounds are well spread out, but the pool is spoilt by the screaming children who are allowed to run riot.  The hotel should have a separate children's pool.  Our room was large, quiet and comfortable, with plenty of natural light. Breakfast was excellent, and served in a pretty courtyard.  I had a special birthday when staying there, and the hotel generously gave us a  bottle of prosecco and a splendid birthday cake.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
