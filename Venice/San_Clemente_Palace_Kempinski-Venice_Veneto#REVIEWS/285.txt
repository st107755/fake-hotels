The San Clemente Palace Kempinski is located on San Clemente Island just off the main island of Venice.  The hotel has a shuttle boat service to the Venice every half hour, so accessing Venice is not a problem.  The property encompasses the entire small island.  If you're looking to have a relaxing, resort like getaway from the hustle and bustle of Venice with the convenience of hopping into the city anytime, this is the place for you!  The property is luxurious and peaceful.  There are 2 restaurants, a spa, a beautiful pool and plenty of outdoor areas to take in the views.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 7, 2018Dear Guest,  thank you for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor!
