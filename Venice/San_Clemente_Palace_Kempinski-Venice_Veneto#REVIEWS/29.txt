We do a lot of travel,we have been at many Kempinski hotels but never experienced a perfect stay like at San Clemente Kempinski. The garden is so beautiful and well taken care.You can enjoy every corner of the island. Chef Giorgio prepares his specialties in Aquarello restaurant.I recomend  the fresh pasta dishes with Seafood and the Risotto with truffles. Rooms are very spacious and high roofs with nice furniture. Concierge service Antonio and Michael  are always prepared to help you. Breakfast buffet is much more higher  then you can expect .Everything is fresh made  and delicious. We are in October and today is such a sunny day we are enjoying every moment. Thanks  to all San Clemente  Team, We will be coming very soon:)Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 29, 2019Dear Kelebekturkiye, Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience with all TripAdvisorÂ´s readers.
