A beautiful 5 star facility that is its own island.  Amazing staff, grounds great, food wonderful.  Boat shuttle back and forth to San Marco was the best way to get back and forth.  Funky comtemporary art everywhere. Beautiful historic 11th century chapel and great views of Venice. Will stay here again.
