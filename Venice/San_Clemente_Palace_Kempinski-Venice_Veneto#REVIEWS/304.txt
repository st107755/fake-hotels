I had the chance to stay at the San Clemente Palace, Kempinski, in May 2018 for one week. The location and surrounding is superb, the island is very close to  San Marco square (15mn by boat) but you can easily avoid the touristic crowd and enjoy a very exclusive and restful environment. Accommodation, cuisine and services are the one that you can effectively expect from a true 5 star Palazio. You will enjoy your stay, and keep some great memory of it (at least, I hope as much as I did). Grazie Mille, San Clemente !Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 3, 2018Dear Guest, grazie mille for the lovely feedback left on TripAdvisor.
