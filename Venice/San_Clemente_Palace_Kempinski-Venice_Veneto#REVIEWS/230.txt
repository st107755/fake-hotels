Wonderful time was had at this family friendly and high quality hotel. The staff were gracious and friendly and the food as in most places in Italy was excellent. Would definitely go back. Thanks to all the staff in the Aquerello restaurant were fabulous and the food was excellent. Great pool for the kids and good kids menu too. Shuttles to and from St Marks every twenty or so minutes. Not cheap but then not a lot is in Venice and I thought it was wonderful and will definitely go again.
