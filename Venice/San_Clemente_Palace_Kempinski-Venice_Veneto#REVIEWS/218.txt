I stayed here while attending the Venice Film Festival. I cannot day enough wonderful things about The hotel. The service was impeccable! The rooms for a European hotel were generous. They were decorated very elegant. The restaurants all had delicious fabulous food! The boat service to the other parts of Venice were prompt, comfortable and may I say drivers were handsome .  I felt very comfortable and welcomed ! I want to go back already after just leaving a week ago.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 23, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor the comments related to you recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski during the special events attended for the Venice Film Festival.
