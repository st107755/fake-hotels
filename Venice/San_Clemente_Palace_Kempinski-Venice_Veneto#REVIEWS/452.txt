I had a lovely time at the San Clemente and I would definitely recommend it to all that want to stay in Venice! The island and hotel grounds/rooms are amazing and they upgraded us to a wonderful room with a view of the lagoon. Staff were polite and helpful but service through breakfast could be better.  The breakfast could also have had a wider selection for a five star but it was very pleasant. The evening restaurant was also very good! I would definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Matthew B,  Thank you for sharing your positive feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
