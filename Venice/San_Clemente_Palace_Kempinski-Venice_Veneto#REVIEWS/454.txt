I'd read reviews before coming here, and noted that it was expensive (really? Five star hotel in its own island in the Venetian lagoon?

The hotel boat was easy to find (thanks to the reviews) and arrived quickly, bringing us to an oasis of peace in the middle of one of the busiest tourist cities in the world.
