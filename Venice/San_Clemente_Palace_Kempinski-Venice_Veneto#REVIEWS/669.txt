One of the most stunning settings we've ever been to, lovely rooms, views, pool and great free shuttle boat to San Marco... but sadly the service was very patchy. Breakfast on two of four mornings was appallingly chaotic and lunch at the pool restaurant was very slow expensive and they overcharged but staff tried to be friendly and helpful. When we complained about the service we were given little to acknowledge our inconvenience - a small tin of biscuits!!  Overall if the service improves then it would be perfect. Come on Kempinski - it's not up to scratch yet!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 30, 2016Dear Nicole G,  Thank you for your feedback on your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
