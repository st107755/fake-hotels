This hotel is very special, I almost don't want to say too much as I would like to keep it to myself, however, it really is a wonderful place that deserves massive recognition.  The room we had was just a standard but it really was beautiful with a large bathroom, and the bed was a dream (can only imagine what the more expensive rooms are like). The breakfast was fantastic, everything you could possibly want.  The staff were so welcoming and charming, and the poolside was truly blissful, it really was like being in another world.  All of this in one of the most special places in the world, Venice - you really would struggle to find a better hotel in certainly Venice, but anywhere in the world.  We loved it so much that we just can't resist another trip, we're booking to go backâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
