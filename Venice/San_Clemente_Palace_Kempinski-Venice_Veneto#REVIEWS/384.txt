My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our 2nd wedding anniversary in April 2016. It was beautiful and spectacular in design and very original since it is a converted monastery. Rooms are nice; nothing spectacular but clean, elegantly decorated and simple.   The breakfast was great as was the service. The food was fresh and tasty and the facilities were excellent, including the regular boat shuttle into the main town. The pool was beautiful and very relaxing. We didn't get to enjoy it as it rained a lot during our 4 day stay but would have if the weather was better.   Have since recommended to a friend who visited a few months ago and she thought it was just as good as we did.
