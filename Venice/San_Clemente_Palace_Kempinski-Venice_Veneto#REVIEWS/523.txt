Great islandic hotel to isolate yourself from the chaotic rush on San Marco and pushes in the narrow streets. San Clemente enjoys fantastic position vis-a-vis main attractions and only 15 min boat trip to the airport.  Large green gardens cover the hotel and hide you from noise of boats.  Spacious clean rooms, large bathrooms with separate bath and shower. Service everwhere (restaurants, lounge areas and etc.) is quick, friendly and attentive.  Bad habbits of an old lawyer tease me to pick up something to critisize, but frankly I cannot, except for picking up a glass of nice Sovblanc by Felluga and say "mille grazzie"; gents, for excellent weekend retreat!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
