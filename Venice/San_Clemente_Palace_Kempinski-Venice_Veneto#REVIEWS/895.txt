The San Clemente Palace is absolutely beautiful!  On its own tranquil island with private shuttle service, a service staff ready to serve your every need, it's truly a wonderful place.  Concierge service is fantastic and hotel staff were lovely!  The room overlooking the water was amazing.  A magical experience!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
