This is our 12 stay which has changed ownership now on 3 occasions. It was part of the Turin hotels group then St Regis hotels and now part of the Kempinski empire. We have got to know some staff who survived the changes pretty well also. We always come on my wife birthday and one year we came twice for our Anniversary. We did have to stay at the Hilton one year as the Clemente was closed which showd us how wonderful this hotel is. The only negative on this occasion was that on previous visits my wife always got a cake or flowers or all 3 some years, but nothing this year. But we would not stay any place else.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Hotel Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 13, 2017Dear burlington7, Thank you for sharing your feedback on your most recent stay at our resort.
