This place is a dream. It was my first time in Venice, and from the speedboat ride out to the private island, to the stone walkway up to the entrance, and finally being warmly welcomed by the amazing staff waiting inside, this hotel was simply perfect. The island itself hosts several restaurants, and the hotel has an amazing bar right down from the lobby. The views of Venice are second to none, and some of the rooms themselves to look out on the city. The whole island is rife with history, and it has many walking paths and seating areas to sit and relax. If you have a chance to visit this place, please do - the staff provided a true luxury experience, on par with what I have come to expect from Kempinski. A must see!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
