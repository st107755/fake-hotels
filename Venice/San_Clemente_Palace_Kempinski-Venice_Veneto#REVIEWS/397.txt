booked a four night romantic stay at san clemente palace,for wife and i.this hotel looks the part with it nice gardens and terraces,nice interior and cheerful staff,but there are little things you don't need on a romantic break.my wife likes what she likes as do most women,so you will see how a weekend can turn sombre.arrived buy boat great trip ckecked in went for some midday lunch buy the pool,both ordered prawn salad my wifes turned up with no prawns,first little niggle not to worry. then every day having to ask for things missing one time asked three staff for sweetners before getting them herself.cannot fit all little things in this review.this should not happen in a hotel of this calibre will not go back there.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
