The location and the facilities are perfect, the hotel is improving since it was taken over by Kempinsky. But it is still far of the mark in terms of service, especially in the area of food and beverage. No capability to have decent current food, it is either the luxury hotel, at ludicrous prices or a sandwich. A lot of little services failures, with a global feeling of unfriendly staff, makes you feel uncomfortable. It feels like all the staff are unhappy and they make you pay for it. Unacceptable. We stayed for a whole week, with some serious incidents, and didn't even have a little attention from the hotel management. A lot of efforts ahead to bring the hotel to a 5* level.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Rooms Division Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 25, 2017Dear 640clementc,  Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us.
