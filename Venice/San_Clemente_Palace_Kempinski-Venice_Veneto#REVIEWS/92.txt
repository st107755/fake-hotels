Stayed here for five nights and enjoyed every minute! The hotel is amazing - very elegant atmosphere surrounded by a beautiful garden with a stunnig view over Venice bay. Perfect to relax after a lively day in Venice. In the evening you can enjoy great food in differnt places - they even offer a private dinner on their sunset hill! #perfect spot for #proposal Entire hotel crew is very friendly and professional. All demands have been fullfilled in no time. The 10-15 minutes drive on a typical Venicien wooden boat from the center of Venice to the island is well organized and is such a nice extra feature. I highly recommend to choose this hotel for a perfect stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2019Dear Guest,  Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience.
