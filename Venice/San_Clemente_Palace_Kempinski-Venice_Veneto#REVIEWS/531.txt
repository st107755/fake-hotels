My husband and I arrived to a warm welcome at San Clemente Kempinski and were upgraded to a beautiful suite with prosecco as it was our 4th wedding anniversary.  What a lovely surprise!   The room was very clean and spacious.  Anything we needed including room service was brought to us within a reasonable timescale and all staff we dealt with were courteous and friendly.  The concierge service was fantastic and recommended lovely restaurants to visit during our stay.    The shuttle to and from San Marco is a fab service and is available until midnight.  There is a spa under construction and the swimming pool was closed however this gives another reason to visit again! :)  Breakfast was much better on the second morning of our stay as our waiter fully explained what was availableâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Apr 3, 2017Dear dina134,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
