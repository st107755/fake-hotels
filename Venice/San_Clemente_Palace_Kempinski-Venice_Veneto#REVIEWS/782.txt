I would highly recommend that the hotel reduces the prices on its food and drinks purchased by guests. This will encourage more guests to eat and drink in the hotel rather than travel into Venice or to purchase food and drink from other sources. Other than that the hotel and rest of the services provided were excellent.                            Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
