It was truly a perfect stay for a couple. My husband and I stayed 4 days on the San Clemente hotel. The location is perfect because you are close to the center but have a small place to escape from the busy touristy streets.  We had a beautiful and spacious room overlooking the water. The restaurant for breakfast was excellent and the seating outside perfect.  The concierge service was excellent. I would truly recommend asking for their recommendations for restaurant bookings.  The spa could however be improved a bit.  Otherwise all perfect!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Aug 5, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your generous words used to descibe your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
