We spent several days at this beautiful resort hotel. Situated on a beautiful garden island, we were well served by the staff in these luxury accommodations with frequent water taxi shuttle service to St. Marks Square, But, the highlight of our visit were several late night visits to the Clemente Bar, a classic, salon bar with attentive, efficient waiters. Waiter, Costi, a particularly talented young man, performed, baffling and sometimes jaw-dropping, card, slight of hand, and cell phone tricks to our delight and our friends. We kept going back for more. If you are there-seek him out, You wonâ€™t be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 23, 2019Dear TrishV35,  thank you for sharing the feedback related to your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
