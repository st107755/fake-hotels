My husband and I visited this hotel on a 4 night stay for our honeymoon. Upon arrival, the resort grounds were beautiful. The room was nice but not luxury. It was a bit small and the air conditioning did not work very well. One highlight of our stay at Kempinski was our bartender, Costi, in the Clemente Bar. His lively personality and magic tricks made for a memorable time. The concierge staff and reception were also very helpful during our stay. Overall, this is a nice resort. However, we would not describe it as 5 star due to the quality of the rooms.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality & Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jun 3, 2019Dear Hannah L, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
