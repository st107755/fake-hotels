Exzellent Accomodation ! Short vacation-Trip. Very clean area in a beautiful atmosphere. TOP Service! The pool area invites you to linger! Everything was very satisfactory from the check-in to the check-out. The staff are very friendly and definitely take the concierge aside, he gives you the best tips!
