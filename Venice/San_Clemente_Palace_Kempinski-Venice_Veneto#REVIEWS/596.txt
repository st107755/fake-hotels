This is one of the greatest hotels I have seen (and I have seen some more). Beautifully located on a private island only 10 minutes away from the city center. An amazingly friendly and helpful staff, wonderful huge garden, great pool, perfect (!) breakfast, very clean and spacious rooms, nice hotel restaurants and great service. Yes, it is expensive, but this does not come as a surprise.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from SanClementeComms, Direttore generale at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 27, 2016Dear HSV1887HH, Thank you for your feedback on your experience at San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
