Tucked away on its own island, yet only minutes by complementary boat ride to the main square, this hotel is truly exceptional. Perfectly manicured and extensive gardens, a variety of dining options with beautiful water or garden views, and a beautiful (standard) room made us want to stay forever. The staff were also extremely attentive and Free wifi covered the entire grounds. Tips - Take a travel iron as there isn't one in the room, and they do not provide them on request either. The complimentary boat shuttles don't start until 9am, so you will need to arrange a water taxi if you want to leave earlier. Overall a superb hotel and highly recommended for a romantic stay, or honeymoon option. Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
