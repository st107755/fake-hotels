Dear Kempinski team,  from the very beginning the stay was just wonderful.  We already checked in at 10AM with Valentina, who has welcomed us warmly. As our room was not quite ready we enjoyed our first cappuchino at the bar instead, and walked then through the gardens of the island. At 11AM the room was ready and Valentina escorted us to the room while telling us about her first impressions and highlights of Venice, as well as about her loved home city Rome (I can totally understand you).  Also the service at the shuttle boat of the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The fact that the hotel is located on an island makes it a perfect choice when you want ro enjoy vibrant Venice on the one hand side, but also relax in a calm environment and at the pool on the other hand side. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded May 15, 2018Dear Christoph and Lisa, thank you for sharing on TripAdvisor your feedback regarding the recent stay at the San Clemente Palace Kempinski.
