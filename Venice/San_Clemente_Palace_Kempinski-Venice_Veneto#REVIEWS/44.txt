We stayed for our honeymoon for 2 nights following a stay in Rome and Florence (all 5* hotels). This hotel compared to the others was 5* in appearance, the grounds are beautiful and the hotel itself is very grand and impressive. However, we were slightly disappointed with the average room. The mini bar was only half stocked and contained no alcoholic drinks. There was no coffee machine, unlike the other hotels and although we received complimentary chocolate coated strawberries which were delicious we also received champagne in the other hotels. The room wasnâ€™t very big and had Marks on the walls and generally a little bit warn in appearance.  I have no doubt the restaurant will be fabulous and we are trying the 9 course tasting menu out this evening.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Executive Office at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Oct 2, 2019Dear SamHales, thank you for your feedback.
