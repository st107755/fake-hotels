A converted monastery that immediately captivated and relaxed us as soon as we stepped off the boat.  Utterly beautiful gardens and great staff who look after you but don't fawn over you.  Beautiful spacious interiors that haven't been overloaded with Venitian frippery, so it keeps the feel of an old monastery but with a bit of opulent class.  The gardens and pool feel like a different world compared to Venice just 10 minutes by boat away.  Regular (free) water taxis to the main part of Venice keep the action close by, but we loved the balance of calm offered by this hotel.  We absolutely loved it!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
