The hotel is amazing! Perfectly located on an island away from the busy venice area.  The hotel is a true palace that makes it hard to leave.  During our week stay, we spent a couple days just around the island relaxing and enjoying the food and pool. The restaurant Acquerello and La Dolce were incredible.  Try the tasting menu and the Seabass and filet with black truffles. Bellissimo!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Relations Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Sep 4, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your comment shared on TripAdvisor!
