We absolutely adore the uniqueness of Venice but also loved the ability to get away from the masses of people and go back to San Clemente Palace Kempinski and laze by the pool looking at the beautiful old building and gardens while our batteries recharged ready to go into Venice at night which was a very short boat ride on their private shuttle. Whilst the building is grand, the staff are wonderfully friendly and our children were welcomed. A great experience all round.Read moreReview collected in partnership with this hotelDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from SanClementePR, General Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 14, 2019Dear guest,  Thank you very much for choosing our hotel for your stay and for sharing your great experience with all Trip AdvisorÂ´s readers.
