We spent my wife's birthday in Venice. We stayed for three nights at the San Clemente palace. The property was spectacular and the service could not have been better. The concierge were very accommodating, helped arrange everything we needed from dinner reservations to water taxis to get us to and from the hotel tot he restaurants. On of the highlights of our trip was the first night at the hotel restaurant. The food was amazing. We had a pasta with lobster that was to die for and fish for main course that was fresh and tasty. The transfers back and forth to St Marks were always timely and easy to get on. Would go back anytime!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
