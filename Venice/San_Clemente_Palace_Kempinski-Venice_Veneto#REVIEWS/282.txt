Beautiful grounds such a unique hotel with free shuttle service.  Nice quiet hotel on its own little island with fabulous food and a superb stocked bar! The staff are super friendly and helpful which completed our stay.  I would love to go back to San Clemente and highly recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from ZuinClaudia, Quality and Guest Experience Manager at San Clemente Palace KempinskiResponded Jul 21, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for sharing your lovely comment on TripAdvisor.
