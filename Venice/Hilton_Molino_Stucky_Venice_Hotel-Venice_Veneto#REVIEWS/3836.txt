Traveling within western Europe two months per year for decades, we chose this American-style hotel to achieve comfort and good working facilities.  all hotel services met the highest international standards.  However, ferry (shuttle) services across the canal were once an hour and then sometimes once every two hours if boats were full.  we will never stay here again.  Fix this problem: every 15 minutes, a boat!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. I do regret that you did not find our complimentary shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs, however we can offer a guaranteed maximum number of seats and we are sorry that during your stay you were experiencing some difficulties in finding available space. In some circumstances, as an alternative, we are pleased to offer tickets for ACTV public transportation. The stop is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and a regular service connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. May I also take this opportunity to confirm that our shuttle leaves twice every hour to Zattere which is right in front of the hotel on the main island.  Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards,   Alessandro M. Cabella  General ManagerRead more
