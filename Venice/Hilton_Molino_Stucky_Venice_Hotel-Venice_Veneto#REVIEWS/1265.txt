This Hilton is of an excellent standard and the Italian touch adds a definite elegance to this admirable building. Food and service were impeccable. The skyline bar was a memorable place to finish off the day with its breathtaking rooftop views. The 'seaside' restaurant was a pure delight - a wonderful waiter. But above all the reception crew (especially Lise) very helpful....1st impression was excellent and the rest is 'redbrick' history. A great choice to sleep quietly and to be refreshed to go back to the Serenissisma Venice by shuttle boat...we'll be back.
