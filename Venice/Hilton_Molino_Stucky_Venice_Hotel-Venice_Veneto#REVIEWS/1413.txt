I took my wife to Venice for her birthday and was advised to stay at the Hilton by Amex, the hotel was fantastic a great setting with all you could want from a hotel. There is a pool on the roof but unfortunately it was closed, we had cocktails at the roof bar the highest bar in Venice. Rooms were a good size, staff were great, food good .boat service to take across the water. Would stay here again when we return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 21, 2017Dear Sir, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
