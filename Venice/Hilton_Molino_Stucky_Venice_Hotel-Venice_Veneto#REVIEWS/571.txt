If your not one to stay in the city of Venice this is a great spot to stay on the other side of the canal. With its beautiful roof top bar and pool its a great location when your down with walking the beautiful streets of Venice. The breakfast buffet - is not included but was defiantly shocked by the price of it but other then that everything was wonderful, clean and cozy. The shuttle for the hotel back and forth is free ( someone on here said they charge 7Euro for it) . The hotel lobby bar down stairs is great - from the coffee and snacks and the Aproal spritz. The staff is super friendly and most speak english. Will admit i got lost finding out room the first day tho. Its a great place if you dont mind being a 15 min ferry ride away from San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 18, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
