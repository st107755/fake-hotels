Arrived with no reservation. They found my wife and I a room that we booked for 2 nights. Rooms are extremely quite, spacious and well furnished. Bed, AC and room quietness offered an outstanding deep sleep refreshing quality. Bathroom was very well furnished as well, the water pressure though was a bit weak. Open buffet breakfast was diverse and extensive with a lot of options, much more than the stomach can handle. Exceptional prompt smiling service. We were helped a lot by the hotel staff on dinning locations, hot places, where to go and how to get there and any other small/big thing we needed was answered promptly with a big smile. Room service was prompt and professional. They provide for free shuttle service all day long.  Will I go stay there again? Most definitely.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 24, 2013Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
