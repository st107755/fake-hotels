I am sad to say our trip to the Hilton did not live up to exceptions.  The Hotel is very big, location excellent, but it has no sole.  The rooms very shabby, with one of the net curtains missing.  The bathrooms could do with being refreshed.  There was no turn down service on the two nights we stayed.  As we were there over Easter we expected it to be busy, but breakfast on Easter Monday was a shambles, they were not prepared for so many guests, the buffet and dining room reminded me of a canteen from the 1960’s.  We have stayed in many Hiltons over the years, this one just didn’t hit the mark for us.  Our rooms although delux looked over the internal workings of the hotelRead moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor.
