We stayed 3 nights at the Hilton and could not have been happier, we found the hotel to be very clean, great service and good area. Unlike some of the other reviews there is plenty on the island, good  food, supermarket, hair salon all at local not turist prices. The Hilton has normal prices for drinks, food water etc. that you would expect to pay at any 5 star hotel. If you venture out just a short walk away you will find the area to be quite charming where mostly locals live as the hilton is the only hotel on the island, the free water shuttle worked great up until 11:30 PM. If in Venice, I will stay again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
