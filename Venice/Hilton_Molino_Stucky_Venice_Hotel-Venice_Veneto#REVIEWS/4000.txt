Pros: Standard Hilton comforts & nice bed, etc. Boat service was nice to have.  Cons: Even with the boat service, it was a bit inconvenient to have waste time getting to the main island. We ended up paying a lot more than just our room rent in terms of internet service - Hilton restaurants (because we were too tired to take a boat ride to dinner), water, etc. We were there during the down season & the hotel was pretty much empty & they could have easily earned our loyalty by bumping us up to a nicer room with a better view, etc. But, they didn't. Not enough value for the price. There are better options.   Conclusion: We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next visit to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
