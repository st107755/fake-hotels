We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations.  The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we will  have the opportunity of welcoming you back in the future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
