My wife and I stayed on our 40th anniversary in August 2008. The hotel gave us a suite which we appreciated very much. I would like to return at some point and time because we loved the city and would like to visit all the sights we missed last time. The only negative was that we had to get a water bus or hotel shuffle to St Marks square, but they came very frequently and you can obtain a daily or weekly pass very reasonably. The hotel provided a very good breakfast buffet and the service was good and the rooms were very large and quiet. We were amazed at the structure of the building that liked that it was a converted factory with huge wooden beams holding up the floors above. This is a great hotel to stay in.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear Sir, Thank you for your excellent review of the Molino Stucky Hilton.
