all that was missing was the casino. Magnificent hotel located across the channel from the old city, where you can sit at the rooftop pool or lounge that looks over the city of Venice and watch the cruise ships pass by. I was very impressed with the staff at this hotel. They even gave us a private tour of the Presidential suite and the lookout from on top of the steeple. This is the highest point in Venice, even higher than St. Mark's tower. The air conditioning was the best in Venice, very quiet and very cold.    Very easy to get back to the airport, take the Hilton shuttle across the channel and get off at the first stop. Take the vapparetto to the Roma station. Take the number 5 bus to the airport terminal. It takes 1 hour.Read moreDate of stay: July 20084 SavesHelpfulShare
