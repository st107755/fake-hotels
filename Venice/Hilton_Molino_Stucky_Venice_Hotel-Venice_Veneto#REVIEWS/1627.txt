I am normally critical of hotels but I have to say this place is very pleasing to me.  Being across the canal on Giudecca somehow works --  with the convenient shuttle the hotel provides you have the best of all worlds:  nice view, quiet, away from crowds, access to the city as needed.  Bathrooms nicely remodeled, beds are delicious comfortable.  Free breakfast for Hilton Honors members was excellent though sometimes things run out (they always do in these situations).  Somehow the place just feels great.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 13, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
