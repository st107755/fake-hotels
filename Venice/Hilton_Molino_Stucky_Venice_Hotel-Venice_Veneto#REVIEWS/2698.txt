I'm not one to think I'm going to Venice, so let me get a hotel with a nice pool because who cares! But this pool was awesome!! You can just sit by the pool and stare at the Grand Canal. Amazing views!  Also, the room was very comfortable, nice bathroom, plenty of space. I am a Hilton Diamond member and this was one of the nicest Hilton properties I've stayed at. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They will charge 7e/pp to use their boat. We didn't use it because walking to the water taxi is convenient.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting such positive review about us and for your loylaty to our brand.
