The hotel is beautiful, but do not come with a lot of luggage!  You will have to take your luggage for a long walk either up and down three bridges with stairs, or thru a little neighborhood.  There is a hotel water taxi to the main island, but make sure you understand both when it leaves the hotel as well as where to catch it from San Marco.  Once you figure all of that out, you may have fun!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 21, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for posting a review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky. May I confirm that the suggested stop for Guests who reach the hotel with public ACTV transportation is “Palanca”, which is approximately 10 minutes walk away from the hotel door. The two bridges to cross may be uncomfortable with heavy luggage, whereas private water taxis or the Alilaguna public blue line drop you off directly outside the hotel entrance. For updated and complete details on transportation options, I invite travelers to check the hotel website at the transportation menu. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
