We stayed here for 3 nights in a junior suite, the room was amazing, lovely bathroom and spacious.  The room was spotlessly clean and well equippped with tea/coffee making facilities.  We had access to the executive lounge where we had breakfast each morning with hot and cold selection.  The lounge is also available for drinks and snacks during the day and in the evening pre-dinner drinks and canapes were available.  Staff were friendly and helpful and although the location is not in the middle of Venice a short shuttle taxi (about 15 mins to San Marco) and runs very regularly. Very good and well equipeed gym and spa.  I would highly recommend this hotelRead moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
