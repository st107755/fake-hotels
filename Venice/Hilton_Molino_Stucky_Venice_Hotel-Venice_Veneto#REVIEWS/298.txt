This hotel is a converted mill, hence its name, situated on the Guidecca Canal away from the centre of Venice. I adore Venice and having spent a day wandering around it’s nice to be away from the hubbub. The canal side rooms have a view of the main part of the city so you can look at it and remember where you are, as opposed to being in the middle and being anywhere. There is a shuttle boat, for a nominal one off payment which takes you to San Marco within 20mins of departure or at certain times of the day you can get off a Zaterre. Yes this hotel can be a bit pricey, but Venice isn’t cheap, rooms are clean and well appointed, rooftop bar is modern and elegant. When in this part of the world we return here trip after trip, says it all really.
