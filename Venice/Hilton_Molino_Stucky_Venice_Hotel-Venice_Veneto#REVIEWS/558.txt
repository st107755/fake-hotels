My wife and I spent a few days last week in this Hilton.  I was pretty blown away.  I’ve stayed in Hilton properties all over Europe and North America.  This property is simply outstanding, the best Hilton I can think of.  Beautiful location and marvelous combination of old world charm and updated conveniences.
