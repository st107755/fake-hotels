Wonderful time, beautiful property just a 10 minute shuttle boat ride from St Marks Square. The exterior of the property is so different from any place I have stayed before, however the interior is so typically Hilton.

Since its opening this year, on 15th May, it has never been out of service, therefore I suppose that when you visited us it was still closed due to the season. I  would like to take this opportunity that the Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day of the year (from 5 PM until after midnight) and our guests can enjoy a unique and spectacular view over the city of Venice and its lagoon. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
