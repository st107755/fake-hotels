I was at hilton molino stuckey this may and the hotel was appealing in every way . The rooms were super spacious and the amenities offered were tremendous . The swimming pool area was also refreshing as it gives a skyline view of venice . The boat service of the hotel which takes you to st. marco square is really helpful .
