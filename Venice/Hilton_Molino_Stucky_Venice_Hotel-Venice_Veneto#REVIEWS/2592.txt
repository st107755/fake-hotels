This was my first stay at a Hilton hotel. Friendly welcoming staff from the bag man to the reception staff to the cleaners to the breakfast staff. They all make you feel welcome every single day. The facilities are good and you don't want for anything, nothing is too big or too small.   Go to the sky bar on the 8th floor for an incredible view of the grand canal.  The free shuttle bus to Zattere and San Marco save you a fortune on public transport.
