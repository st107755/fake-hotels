The hotel is breathtaking - rustic and modern.  I have been diamond or gold with Hilton Honors for over a dozen years.  Rarely have I not been upgraded or allowed late check out. I received neither.    The Executive Lounge is a bit of a joke here.  It seemed to be made in haste by blocking a narrow sliver of the lobby. It was always over-crowded with guests and wait staff continually bumping into one another.    We had breakfast twice - it was quite grand with many delicious local choices.  Bravo to the chef and restaurant manager.  However, the service left much to be desired.  They were frequently out of items with long waits for refresh.
