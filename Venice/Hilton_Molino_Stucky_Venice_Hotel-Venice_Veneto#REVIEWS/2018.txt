Thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Hilton. Such a beautiful hotel in a great position. Staff were amazing. Very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The shuttle boat over to Venice made it easy to access. Also easy access to cruise ship terminals. This is my 3rd trip to Venice and this is the best hotel I have stayed at. Will definitely stay here again.
