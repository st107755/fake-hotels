Perfect start to our two weeks in Italy!  We stayed here for 5 nights and the hotel, location and staff were all amazing. We had a canal view room which was lovely to look over to Venice and get lost in a daydream watching the boats go by.   We loved staying on Giudecca. It was great to be able to head away from the crowds, with the hotel shuttle boat only taking about 15 minutes and excellent value for money. Guidecca is worth an explore, such a different atmosphere and the hotel recommended some great local restaurants.   We will definitely be back!

The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
