We had a great time at this beautiful hotel.  So many food options and gorgeous interior.  We did have issues because the lock on our door broke several times which left us locked out several times.  However, the hotel comped a water taxi when we departed so we were all good with that.  There are restaurants on the island of this hotel and there is a modern laundromat which def. came in handy!  Loved the water shuttle to downtown which felt like a free gondola ride.  If we ever go back to Venice we will likely stay here again!  Only other con is the restaurant on top of the hotel is very overpriced but does have great views!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 26, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
