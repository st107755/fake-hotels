We stayed there 3rd - 7th March and used a water bus to get there from the airport, it takes about an hour to get to the hotel as there are about 14 stops!!! but the view you get is fab. The staff at the hotel from the moment we got there to the moment we left were brilliant.  The food was excellent, breakfast is NOT continental, you can have cereal, or toast, or meats, yoghurt or the more traditional English breakfast as well as the usual choice of drinks.  The staff were friendly and efficient and could not do enough to help. The room we had was very clean and once again the staff were brilliant, including turning down the bed at night and leaving a sweet.  Bathroom was clean with a bath and a shower over the bath.  All in all an excellent hotel that I have no hesitation inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 11, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
