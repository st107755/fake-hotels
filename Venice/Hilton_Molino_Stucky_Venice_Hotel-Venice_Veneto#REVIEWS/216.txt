Hilton Molino Stucky knows how to manage a high standard of attention. Staff, restaurant, infrastructure, bathrooms, pool, gym, bars, and rooms are 5 stars. What surprised me, was the great modern & gothic building on Giudecca island.  Also, was the accessibility! - Thanks to private water transport that the Hotel has that connects piazza San Marcos with the Hotel. Just that reception from the PIassa to Giudecca island convinced me that I would gonna have a great experience with the hotel, which really happens.Read moreDate of stay: September 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2019Dera Guest, thank you for your positive review on Tripadvisor. It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you have enjoyed your stay in Venice. Receiving such nice feedback really motivates us and pushes us to do our best every day to make sure that all our Guests are as happy with our care as you are. We are happy that you have appreciated the location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for staying with us and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager  Read more
