The Molino Stucky was a 19th century flour mill that shut down in the 50's and was converted into a modern luxury hotel about 2007.  This a very classy property with warm and friendly staff.  The location is away from the crowds but just a short, complimentary water shuttle ride to San Marco and the Grand Canal.  We stayed 6 nights and are looking forward to a return visit next year.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback !
