If you're a Hilton Honors member, this is the hotel you want to save your points for! This was our last stop in our 9 day trip to Italy. I'm glad it wasn't the first. I wouldn't have wanted to leave. Hilton Honors members have access to the Spa and Executive Lounge with free food all day long. Our corner room on the 5th floor had a beautiful view of the lagoon. We saw many cruise ships come and go. The Hilton shuttle boat to St Marks was very convenient. We really loved our stay here!Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
