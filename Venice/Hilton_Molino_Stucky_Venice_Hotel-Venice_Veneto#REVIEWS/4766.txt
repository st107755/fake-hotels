The hotel seems to have mixed reviews so it was with a bit of trepidation that we made the booking,  I am pleased to state that we had a very enjoyable stay including an upgrade (Gold Hilton Honours) to a wonderful corner suite.  Previous reviewers have mentioned all there is to know about the hotel so i will not repeat this suffice to say we received very good attentive service from the staff particularly the two ladies on reception whose names i forget -sorry, as they deserve credit for their efforts!  During our time it rained for most of the weekend and St Marks Sq was flooded due to unseasonal weather conditions so we will have to return to see Venice under more favourable conditions and will definately be staying at the Hilton!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
