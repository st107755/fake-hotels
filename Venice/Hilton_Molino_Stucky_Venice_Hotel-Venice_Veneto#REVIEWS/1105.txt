We visited Venice for the first time and our stay in this Hilton was fantastic. Everything was awesome and the shuttle between the hotel and San Marco was timely and very comfortable. Hilton also arranged a complementary tour to Burrano to see a glass blowing factory. This was a great experience. Overall this was one of our best stays at a Hilton Hotel. I wish we had the time to stay longer.
