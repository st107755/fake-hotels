We also acknowledge and appreciate your criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our guests. I confirm that our property, an ancient building which was originally a flour mill and factory, has been restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice with 379 rooms and suites. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. I would like to apologize for your unpleasant dining experience and be reassured that I have immediately shared your comments with both our Executive Chef and F&B Manager in order to avoid such inconveniences again in the future. We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance, maybe during Winter time when our beautiful city is for sure less crowded and still very romantic. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
