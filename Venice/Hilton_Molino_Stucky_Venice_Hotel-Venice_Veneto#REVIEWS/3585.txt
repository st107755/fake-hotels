Getting to the Hotel was really easy with the Bus taxi.the Hilton has its very own stop. So you dont need to walk around with luggage looking for the hotel.the reception is small considering thd size of the hotel.but overall the service was great and very helpfull.they organized all our tours that we had booked in.we stayed in a standard room, clean ,comfortable and decent size bathroom.we had no views.roof top view by the pool was amazing.only doors shut at 9 so cant really see the night life.the buffet breakfast was nice couldnt ask for any better.no wifi in room unless you pay, but then again they have courtesy wifi on ground level with a fair size lounge with sofa chairs.tv was slow and every channel was in italian.so didnt understand anything. .free shuttle boat to take youâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
