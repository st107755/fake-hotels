The hotel was clean, staff accommodating.  Make sure you bring your own wash cloth or bath mit as they consider that a personal item and do not furnish them.  If you are unprepared you have nothing to bathe with.   The food in the bar/restaurant was delicious yet very expensive.  Venice as a whole however, is a cesspool.  We were told we came at a good time as the mosquitoes weren't bad yet.  However the stench in the canals was unbearable.  I am glad I went, and it's definitely something I checked off my bucket list. However, I wouldn't pay to return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
