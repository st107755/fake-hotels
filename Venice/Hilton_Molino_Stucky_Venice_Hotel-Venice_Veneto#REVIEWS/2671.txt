Wonderful rooms.  Executive plan is the way to go - even if you pay a little more for the room, the access to the lounge gives you food choices and drinks.  A little challenging figuring out what shuttle to get on to go back to San Marco (hotel is across the water from main Venetian island).  Once you figure out where to wait for the shuttle, it is great.   A few good restaurants on that side also just out of the hotel to the right.  Would stay again.  Be prepared for cost of water taxi to airport and from/to train station.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel on TripAdvisor and for sharing your experience.
