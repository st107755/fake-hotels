I am a Flight Attendant for a major US carrier and fly all international flights.  I LIVE it seems in European hotels and I love this one!!!.  This a modern reboot of an old factory building, but don't let that fool you.  Marble and Murano own the spacious lobby/bar/restaurant area (all open floor plan).  This was a pleasure trip,,,so the airline didn't pay for the room and no discounts were given.  I really feel we got our money's worth.  We opted for a junior suite that offers only partial water views, but we saved approx. $60usd/day by not upgrading.  And we had full access to the Executive lounge which is waterfront windowbox seating. Complimentary breakfast, also free wine, beer and apps from 5-7pm saved us even more.
