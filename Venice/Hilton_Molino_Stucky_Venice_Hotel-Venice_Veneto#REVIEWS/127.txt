Loved the location that is semi private. Available for private boat shuttle back and forth with San Marco directly for hilton guests only and 8.5 euro per person for entire stays. Also, 15euro for one way to the VCE airport from right in front of the hotel was nice and convenience(takes 1.5 hrs tho). Loved the room size, service from staff members, and also breakfast&roof top bar were nice Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review and for your comments on the famous Hiltonâ€™s breakfast and efficiency of our shuttle service.
