An excellent short stop at the end of a two week holiday.  The hotel is a really good place to stay if you want to see Venice, but not suffer from the downsides of living on the main islands: crowds, limited facilities and space in hotels, etc.  A very regular free boat shuttle means that you can be in the thick of things within 5 minutes of leaving the hotel door, so no real disadvantage over other options, and the kids loved travelling everywhere by boat.  The view from the hotel swimming pool (another advantage over 99% of other hotels in the city) is second to none.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
