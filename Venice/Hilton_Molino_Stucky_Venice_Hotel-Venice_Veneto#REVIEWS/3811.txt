We recommande the Executive rooms with view, beautiful roof top bar & pool with a great view on Venice. Bathrobes, sleepers, amenities ARE perfect. Breakfast in Executive lunch poor in regard of the equivalent hotel category, bad wifi reception in room.   The shuttle is always on time, it's appreciable and quick. We stayed there for 1 night in May 2014.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
