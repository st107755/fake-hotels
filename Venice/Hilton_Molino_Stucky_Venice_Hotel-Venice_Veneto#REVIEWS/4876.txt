Fabulous, glam hotel in Venice. The service & customer service we recevied at the hotel was second to none, the staff were always friendly and always on hand to help with questions and recommendations of where to go etc.   The rooftop pool was amazing....I can't really add anything aside from make sure you visit it!   The shuttle boat is efficient and the sailing staff are very friendly.  By far one of the best hotels we've experienced.   Grazie!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
