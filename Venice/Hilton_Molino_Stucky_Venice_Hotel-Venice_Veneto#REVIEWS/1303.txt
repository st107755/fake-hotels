My friend and I stayed for three nights in May in an exec room with a city view. The hotel is beautiful and being separate to the main part makes it a haven to return to after a day of sight seeing. We used the pool every day but I did find it cold but it is worth it for the views. We had exec lounge access and this had a nice array of food for breakfast including hot items and wine or beer between 5 and 7 each evening. The shuttle boat was great, we got on every time so it wasn't a problem but we were obviously not there in peak season. I loved the service at the hotel and in the exec lounge. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.
