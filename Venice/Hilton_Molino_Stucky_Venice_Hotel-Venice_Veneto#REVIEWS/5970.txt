The hotel itself is spectacular, fantastic building with breathtaking views over Venice from the roof top bar and pool areas. The hotel was fairly quiet during our stay but I advise booking your sun lounger by the pool to avoid disappointment as there are limited numbers available. As you would expect with a new hotel they are experiencing teething problems, we had no tea/coffee making facilities in our room, no bathrobes, the safe didnt work, initial problems with the shower etc etc  We really enjoyed our stay, 3 days seemed perfect, the shuttle boat service is a prompt and runs twice per hour from 7am to 2am. The best meal we had during our stay was at the Hiltons Aromi restaurant although expensive the food was superb.  We managed to share a water boat back to the airportâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2007HelpfulShare
