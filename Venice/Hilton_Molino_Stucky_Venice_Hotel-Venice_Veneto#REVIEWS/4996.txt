Stayed at this hotel for 1 night prior to our cruise departure.Booked 3 months in advance and pre-paid to get the price. We arrived from the airport in a water taxi and were warmly greeted in reception and checked in. The only disappointment was not obtaining a room with a view even though we phoned and e mailed requesting this. We went up to use the rooftop pool and the views are amazing -  this is probably why a bottle of beer costs 8 euros. We used a very reliable and frequent shuttle boat to San Marco - about 15 minutes away- to visit St Marks square and other sights in the evening. The following morning we had a wonderful breakfast with a very extensive choice. Caught the shuttle again into St Marks square to take a ride on a gondola and visit the Grand Canal & Rialtoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
