Future guests please note that the hotel has no complimentary spa facilities. The only thing complimentary there is the Fitness Room. The rooms are randomly numbered and with corridors which are like a maze, guests will get lost very easily. Pool is not open for winter. The roof top bar is not open until 5pm. This hotel is situated in an island across from the main Venice town, and that can be a good thing. The water shuttle (very very slow speed) from the hotel to Saint Mark's square is every 40mins.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
