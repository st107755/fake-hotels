Me and my family spent  two nights in this wonderful hotel. Everything about the hotel was fantastic, the location, the rooms, the staff and the food. The breakfast was delicious.    We were especially delighted with the free hotel boat shuttle and the VIP lounge. It's the little touches that make a great hotel and Hilton Molino Stucky excels in all areas. Thank you for a fantastic stay.Read moreDate of stay: November 20141 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 5, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
