Very nice hotel with elegant lobby and many amenities, but only some of the rooms have been renovated/updated.  Our room, unfortunately, had not been, however it was still well maintained, although a little dark and outdated.  It would have been nice if the hotel offered a free shuttle to the main part of Venice rather than charging around $7 euros a trip  No complaints about the staff, though.  They were all lovely and helpful.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 8, 2019Dera Madame, thank you very much for your nice review on TripdAdvisor.
