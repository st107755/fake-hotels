Over several trips to Venice I had seen the restoration of this massive warehouse/factory into a modern hotel that hasn't lost sight of its history. I stayed two nights in a canal-view room, and can't fault the work that Hilton has put into making this hotel a success. The room was spotlessly clean, the bed comfortable and the views outstanding. If I had to find a fault, the reception on the TV seemed to be quite patchy.   The breakfast buffet is extensive, if a little lacking in atmosphere. I also ate in the bar, and the food was fine. A private taxi from the hotel to the airport was expertly managed by the concierge, and made for a very positive parting impression of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for writing about us.
