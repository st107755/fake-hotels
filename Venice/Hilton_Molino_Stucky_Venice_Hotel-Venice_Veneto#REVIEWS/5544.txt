My husband and I stayed at the hilton for 1 week after spotting a bargain on expedia, the hotel is on Guidecca, a long thin island just across from Venice itself. The hotel provides a free shuttle, every 20 mins in summer and every 40 mins in winter which was very handy and saved 6.50 euros each on each crossing, if we missed it we just used the vapparettos across to pallanca and walked the rest of the way (500m). Breakfast was super pricey (10 euro for croissant up to 30 euro for super buffet), we reccomend buying fresh croissants and coffee from the bakery /trattorias on the waterfront of guidecca between the hotel and pallanca stop for less than 3 euros!! Or nipping over to zatterre to do the same. Or we bought yogurts, milk, croissants and fruit from the co-op in san marcoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
