We were able to accumulate enough Hilton honors points to cover 3 nights in a room with a view of the canal, which also included an unlimited pass to the executive lounge.  Probably, needless to say, our stay was amazing!  The hotel offers water taxi service from the hotel to St. Marks Sq. all day until midnight.  The concierge staff are excellent, extremely knowledgeable of the museums, churches, restaurants, etc.  Our room was very quiet and the bed superb.  The bathroom was a good size, with a tub and shower.  The public areas were very clean and elevators were always available and quiet.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
