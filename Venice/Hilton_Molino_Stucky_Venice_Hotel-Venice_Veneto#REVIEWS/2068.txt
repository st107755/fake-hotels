Stayed at Hiltons around the world but this is the stand-out best. Staff were so friendly, helpful and efficient, the whole hotel is kept spotlessly clean and presented to a very high standard. The building itself is amazing and the views from the rooftop bar and pool across the Guidecca cannel and the city of Venice are incredible. Staying at the hotel made this trip to Venice the very best.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 4, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
