I have stayed twice at this hotel , first time we loved it as it was just opening and was relatively not too busy and the customer service was outstanding.  The second time, we went there in July, and the hotel was fully booked and we were not given much attention. The location is amazing and the island is a pleasure to visit, walk around , it has a nice feel real than the main island , it is more exclusive .  I will stay again at the Hilton because most of the time, we get the best price/ quality deals and the location is very special.  The hotel boat provides a shuttle service to St Marco, every half hour.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
