We had a nice big executive suite, but the layout was difficult for the extra bed and the adjoining room is basically wasted. Nice bathroom and overall overything was spotless.  Hotel facilities are good with a small but well positioned pool over looking the lagoon. I didnt think the food was anything special and was overpriced but you can walk to better restaurants. The exec lounge is worth doing with free drinks and snacks all day. I think it could be better positioned - at the moment it is part of the lobby area. The boats to venice are a bit of a hassle but for us it was worth it to get the larger size or room in a nice modern hotel. I dont think many options in central venice would offer similar.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for writing about us.  I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the accommodation in one of our Executive Suites, featuring two fully separable rooms: on one side a relaxing bedroom with a king sized bed, on the other side an extendable sofa. We are sorry if an extra bed was not easy to be added. We appreciate and thank you also for your comments on our Executive Lounge, which has been relocated on the ground floor so that our guests can enjoy great canal views. Thank you very much for being our guest and we hope to welcome you soon again. Best regards, Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
