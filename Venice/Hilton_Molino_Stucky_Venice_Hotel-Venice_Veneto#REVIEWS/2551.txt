This is a lovely hotel, the bed is really comfy and the bathroom is big. The shuttle operated by the hotel costs around â‚¬4 per stay so it is really cheap and it runs very regularly, and on time!   However we felt that it would have been better to stay in the centre of Venice (Zattere, San Polo, etc.) as it is a bit inconvenient to wait for the boat and time our visits around it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property and our services but we regret you were not completely satisfied with our location. We still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island: it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
