We stayed here during our visit to Venice.  We very much liked the location of the hotel.  It is not in the center of the main tourist area and that is a good thing!  I had stayed in Venice previously and it is very loud when you are trying to sleep at night.  We made good use of the water shuttle service and only had to pay for transportation from the airport and to the train station.  It was not at all an inconvenience that the hotel was not adjacent to San Maco's Square.  The hotel staff is very courteous and eager to please.  The conceirge was very informative and accomodating.  The kids loved the breakfast buffet, which was included in our room price.  If not included in your room rate, it is expensive.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
