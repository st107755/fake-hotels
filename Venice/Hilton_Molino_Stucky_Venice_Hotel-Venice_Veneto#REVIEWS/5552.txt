Just to confirm the latest reviews .. no sign of grumpiness or attitude problem - quite the opposite - nice helfull staff - we were there to run the Marathon this weekend - very supportative, and cheerfull, good fun .. rooms clean though on the smallish side..), Breakfast just about ok - spa small but nice ( no kids allowed though...). Shuttle runs on time.. so if one gets a good deal - a perfect place to be .... it`s not a 5 * singing and dancing one .. but a decent place it sure is....Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
