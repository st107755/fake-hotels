The location of this hotel is excellent. Whilst it is across the Giudecca Canal there is a complientary shuttle water bus that runs most of the day and into the night and the location means you can get a peaceful night's sleep.  Breakfast is the usual large hotel affair with plenty of choice.   We had a large suite with a view over the lagoon - absolutely exquisite.  The Executive lounge is small and a bit limited but hey you should be out a seeing Venice so it's no problem.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
