We had an executive room. Really comfortable bed, excellent shower and view over the lagoon towards St Marks. The hotel has been created by converting an old flour mill and this gives it an interesting character but with all modern amenities.  The curtains cut out all light when closed and we slept really well. We had a super sea bass dish In restaurant and excellent Soave. We also used the Executive Lounge which provided a good range of snacks and drinks all day, with free wine and beers between 5.00pm and 7.00pm. There is a hotel ferry across to St Marks which is regular and reliable. The staff are incredibly helpful.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
