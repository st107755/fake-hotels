An interesting hotel recently converted from a derelict flour mill into a top class Hilton.  Situated on the island of Guidecca it is close to the Palanca vaporetto stop.  However, the hotel has its own motor lauch which runs from San Zaccaria (next to San Marco) to Zattere and then to the hotel and back again.  If travelling from the airport take the Alilaguna water launch to San Zaccaria (about an hour but only 12 Euros) and then pick up the Hilton launch. Check in was slow, but the staff were polite and helpful.  Our room was superb and overlooked the Canale della Giudecca. We stayed as Hilton HHonors members and had use of the Executive Lounge.  This room was disappointing as there was no view and the windows were low in the wall. However, the Sky Bar offers wonderful viewsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
