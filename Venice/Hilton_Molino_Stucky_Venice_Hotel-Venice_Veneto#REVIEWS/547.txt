My wife and I really loved the hotel. Our room was very bid and quite nice for the price. I booked well in advance and was surprised at how nice the room was for the price. Similar room would be well over $400 in late August in the "busy" part of Venice. I liked being a little bit away from all the crowds and the hotel boat made it easy to go over to heart of Venice. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2018Dear Sir, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
