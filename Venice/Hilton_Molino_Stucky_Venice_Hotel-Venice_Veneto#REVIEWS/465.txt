Every aspect of this stay was flawless. Could not speak more highly of this hotel and itâ€™s staff. Every department from Front desk, food and beverage, housekeeping, the spa, the shuttle boat, everyone was so great to work with and made the trip memorable. The hotel should be proud of their team members for executing such great service. Executive Lounge for Hilton honors members never disappointed. Would recommend this hotel to all and will plan to be back again soon!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 27, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your positive feedback on TripAdvisor.
