The hotel is located across the main canal that  cruise liners sail down. They provide a free shuttle boat to San Marco. After a hectic day's sightseeing in Venice it's lovely to come back to the hotel and take the lift to the Skyline rooftop bar where you can sip a cocktail or drink a coffee and enjoy the views over towards San Marco's Square. If you arrived in Venice on a cruise liner you can even watch your ship sail off on it's next adventure. An evening stroll down this side of the canal is quiet and pleasant, with plenty of reasonably priced restaurants and bars. The room was spacious with bath and shower. There was plenty of choice for breakfast. In an earlier life it was a flour mill and has been tastefully restored but still maintaining some of the original features.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 16, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
