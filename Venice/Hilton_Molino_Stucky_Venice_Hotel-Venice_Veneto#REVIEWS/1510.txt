This was lovely - great location for getting around the beautiful city without having to be in the touristic crush at all times.  There is a local vibe which allows you to grasp a bit more of the concept of people actually live in this mysterious city.  Be sure to take the opportunity to eat locally and wander the streets on this island.  The hotel offers a shuttle service that makes it easy to get across to Piazza San Marco or you can jump on a vaporetto to get around.  Be sure to have a cocktail on the rooftop and enjoy the view.  The rooms were nicely appointed and super quiet.  I would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments.
