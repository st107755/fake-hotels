We were treated like royalty at our recent stay to the Hilton Stucky. I have stayed in many hotels and by far this is the best service, atmosphere and accomodations. The hotel is directly accross from Venice and makes it extremely easy to get back and fourth using thier own private water Taxi. The private water taxi is actually a benefit as it is a beautiful 5 minute ride to the Basilica and lets one relax outside the city on a private island. The views from the hotel which overlooks the city are spectacular. The hotel is the most amazing place we have ever visited. I also want to recognize Constance and Ricardo as these two individuals went above and beyond to make us feel extra special. They took the time to ensure every part of our stay was perfectly thought out with nothingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
