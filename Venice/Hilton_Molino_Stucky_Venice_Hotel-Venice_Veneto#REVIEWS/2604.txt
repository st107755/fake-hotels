Located just across the Guidecca canal from Zattere and then an easy walk across the Academia Bridge to St Marks Square, the hotel has a regular boat shuttle service both to Zattere and also to St Marks.  Hotel was very busy with conference delegates and groups going out via cruises but there were plenty of public spaces to find a spot to sit.  We were lucky enough to have a room with a view and enjoyed the people/boat watching. Had a good meal in the Bacaromi Restaurant - great ambience and good food.  The Skybar has views in both directions but the evening we went for a drink the best side was closed for a private function.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
