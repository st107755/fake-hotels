We were so looking forward to our stay at the Hilton in Venice.  We booked it on Priceline months ahead.  When we arrived we found the desk employees stuffy and not helpful.  The rooms were small and had a door adjoining the room next door.  We couldn't sleep, for we could hear everything, and I mean everything.  The rooms were small and hard to move in.  The front desk wouldn't do anything about our problem.  Only stay here as a last resort.Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
