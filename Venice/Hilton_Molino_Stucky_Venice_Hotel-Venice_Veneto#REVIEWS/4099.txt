Really great hotel!!! One of the best Hiltons I have ever stayed... The hotel itself looks stunning, really nice staff, great breakfast, really nice that you have a complimentary shuttle to St. Marks, it is very handy indeed!! The room is lovely, amazing views to the city. I will definately be back again!!!!! Thank you!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
