Although it may seem pricey- with 2 young kids and a good size room in the king suite package, being that you get access to the executive lounge for breakfast and snacks from 7am to 11 pm (which the kids get through a lot) and is great for a beer when you get from a hot day in Venice and a free water taxi from the hotel to zattere or san marco, plus the pool it works out ok.  Whilst all well used by other guests it works out reasonable value with a family. The room is typical hilton but good as a base. One bit of advice book a water taxi for â‚¬100 from the airport.  Saves a lot of hassle with kids and luggage and makes you feel like you arrive in style rather than hot sweaty and in a mood! Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
