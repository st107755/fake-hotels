We found the hotel well-appointed and comfortable. The rooms have good beds, and are clean and modern. The hotel has a variety of places for drinks and food, but in Venice, I prefer to get out and explore the many fascinating sites and restaurants rather than stay on the island the hotel is located on. Water taxi from and to the airport can be expensive (about 140  Euros each way,) but there are other options presented on the hotel website. The hotel does have a water taxi that goes to two locations on Venice, for which there is a nominal fee. I do not usually book big American chain hotels when travelling outside the US, but we enjoyed our stay; for those who feel more comfortable with a US based hotel, then this may be a good choice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 24, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
