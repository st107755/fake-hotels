We stayed in this hotel for one night in Venice. Hotel itself is very clean and well maintained. Staff are friendly. Breakfast was really good too but unlike most hotels in Italy you have to pay for the breakfast (which is the case for all Hiltons). The only other thing is that you need to take the water taxi to go to St Marc square (~15 min ride) or other parts of the island. We were ok with that but keep that in mindRead moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 4, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
