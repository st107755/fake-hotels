I can't write a review as a regular customer as I have Gold status with the Hilton loyalty program.  I was upgraded to a junior suite and had access to the Executive Lounge.  The room was great with all the amenities I could want, the Executive Lounge is a terrific perk with access to snacks and water, coffee and soda.  The staff was very helpful with every request we had.  They even packed us a boxed breakfast because we had an early flight to catch.  My only wish was that it was more centrally located to tourist sites.  Although we stayed only one night, I would love to return if I ever visit Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your nice review on TripAdvisor.  I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you mentioned a positive experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  We are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical residential area.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Alessandro M. Cabella  General ManagerRead more
