Finally started my tripadvisor account after being pestered constantly to do so by friends. Hopefully I will be able to find time to update my trips more. This is my first hotel after joining my husband for his work trip in Venice earlier this year.   I must say the hotel is wonderful, the rooms are clean and the service is very professional. Being a part work trip, I understand the choice of hotel, but I must say it is not a romantic hotel. The location is not very convenient but they have shuttles and I made good use of them when I explored the town. Breakfast was very good and we really enjoyed the spread. Overall we had a very good experience but half the time my mind was just waiting for the 3 days to be over so that we can start our real Europe holiday!Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
