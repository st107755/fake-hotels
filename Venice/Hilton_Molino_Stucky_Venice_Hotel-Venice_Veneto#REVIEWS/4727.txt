Difficult arrival in heavy fog. Several vaporetti lines not working so had to walk from adjacent district. Once inside the hotel though all smiles and a suite upgrade made everything OK. Access to the executive lounge made a huge difference and turned breakfast from a zoo into a relaxing experience. Every staff member was helpful and jolly. Nice atmosphere too. Obviously it's not convenient to be on Guidecca but the shuttle service goes to Piazza San Marco so it's better than it could be and there are a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.
