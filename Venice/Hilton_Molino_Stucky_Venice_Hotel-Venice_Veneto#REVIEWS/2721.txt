Fabulous situation with regular boat service to shops and restaurants. I recommend booking a private speedboat from the airport to the hotel. A bit more expensive but so exhilarating. A boat trip to Murano is a must.  The beautiful glass is amazing. You will not be able to resist buying something to take home. The Hilton Hotel  has everything you need. Nice size bedrooms-- worth getting one with a good view of the passing boats. The Executive Lounge provides some very tasty wine and snacks 5-7pm - -  a good start to the evening . The Pool area could possibly do with some more umbrellas !Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2015Dear Madame, thank you for your positive comment about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
