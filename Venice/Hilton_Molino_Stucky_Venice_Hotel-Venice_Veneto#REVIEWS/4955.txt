Stayed here for 5 nights from 01 Aug. Room  spotless, staff first class and excellent facilties including breakfast. Special mention to Stefano up on the roof top pool and Matteo who spoke with us on our last evening having our meal he was very pleasant and informative. We had no real concerns, we did ask  prior to arriving if it would be possible for a good view and at a push from our room we managed to see the waters of Guidecca. Overall excellent trip and would definately stay here again.  ps* a mention to the shuttle boat service staff who again were more than helpful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
