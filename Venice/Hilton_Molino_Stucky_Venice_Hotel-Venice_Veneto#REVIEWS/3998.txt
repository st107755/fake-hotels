My husband booked this in for us for my 30th birthday - I'm reviewing this a little late, but thought I should do it anyway. The hotel is LOVELY! I love the location, the building is clean, spacious and beautiful, the rooms nice and the boat service was really handy to get to the main island. Bonus: the little Nutella bar in the outdoor courtyard, don't leave without trying it out!  The concierge team were really helpful and recommended some great restaurants to us during our stay, however my favourite place was probably Aromi's outdoor terrace, perfect for dinner.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
