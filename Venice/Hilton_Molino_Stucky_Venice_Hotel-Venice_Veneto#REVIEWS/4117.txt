Stayed here last month on our first trip to Venice. Really liked the free shuttle across the canal to the heart of the city. Rooms had canal views and were very clean and comfortable.The rooftop bar/terrace has greats views of Venice and the cruise ships pass right by entering and leaving port. You are few minutes from the heart of Venice, but with the shuttle and help when needed from the excellent staff you can have a great Venice experience. We really enjoyed the Rialto Bridge and Market and the Doge's Palace. Extraordinary places. We had the best meal of a 3-week Europe tip at the Ristoranta Do Leoni in the Hotel Londra Palace. DW and mother-in-law had  sea bass, the best they've ever had. A bit on the pricey side, but service and food for exceptional.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
