This hotel was more than we expected.  I was not excited about staying so far from the heart of Venice but this was perfect!  The island of Guidecca was lovely and had great views all around us.  The shuttle boat ran so frequently that we saved major money by not having to get a water taxi.  The hotel had an amazing breakfast and great staff.  They upgraded us to an executive suite with two room and windows on all sides.  It was amazing.  They even provided some free cocktails for our room. There are several amazing resturants within walking distance and the side walks are very wide and perfect for a late night walk. We spent 10 days in Italy but my 3 days at this hotel in Venice were my favorite!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
