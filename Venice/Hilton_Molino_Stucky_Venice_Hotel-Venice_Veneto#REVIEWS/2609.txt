Fabulous hotel in the Giudecca.  The hotel is housed in a the large all-brick complex of connected buildings that was formerly the milling operation for the Molino-Stucky brand.  Because of its size, it never feels crowded, even when it's fully booked.  The main areas of Venice are easily accessed by the hotel boat (five minutes to the Dosoduro sestiere).  The Giudecca is a quiet refuge that is great to wake up to and return to at night.  The hotel deserves its five star rating.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor, it is very kind of you to rate us five stars.
