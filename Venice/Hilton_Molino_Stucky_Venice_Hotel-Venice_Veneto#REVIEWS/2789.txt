The hotel is located in a perfect stop where u enjoy the calmness and the beautiful view of Venice while having the opportunity to go visit the centre of the visit; San Marco using the free shuttle ferry of the hotel... We faced a problem ordering food after 11 pm as they didn't have any option other than cold cuts and cheese platter.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2015Dear Jordan,   thank you for your kind review.   We are very pleased to see that you enjoyed your stay here, especially our quiet location and frequent shuttle service.   We are sorry that you had a problem with our Room Service, normally we have a good selection of items even during the night; I can only think that, due to a big number of orders on that particular evening, unfortunately they ran out of all the other dishes and they only had cold cuts and cheese platters. We apologize if this caused an inconvenience and we will make sure we have enough stock of all items for the night.   We thank you and look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
