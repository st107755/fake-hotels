The standard of converting an old pasta flour mill to a modern hotel is outstanding. Located on the north side of Guidecca island looking across the channel to the city.  The views from the rooftop pool are truly the best in Vencie.   Just a short boat ride from the station and with free shuttle to St Mark's Square this location is perfect.
