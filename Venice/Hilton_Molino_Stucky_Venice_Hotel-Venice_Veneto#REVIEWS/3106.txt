The hotel was overall good, but not excellent as for 5 stars. Rooms should be renovated partly. The service in restaurants is slow. The location is 15 minutes on shuttle boat to San Marco and 5 minutes to Zattere stop, which is inbetween island. Far from tourist crowds. Super nice sky bar on the top and lovely Nutella bar.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 10, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
