Convenient location just over the water from the main city, the hotel has its own water bus service that is easy and convenient. Great hotel and friendly helpful staff. Excellent breakfasts and worth paying for that upfront, as well as the superior room giving access to the executive lounge. That allows you drinks and nibbles early evening and is well worth doing. Beds very comfortable and a great nights sleep. A big hotel in terms of room numbers, which is unusual for Venice, but overall an excellent  choice of venue. wifi in public areas downstairs, room wifi was an expensive add on. Pool on the roof great on a sunny day!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We appreciate the time you took to post such positive comments about your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
