Loved the hotel, everything about if was perfect except it cost like 28 euros for a hamburger and chips or 20 euros for a small bowl of macaroni cheese. Cocktails on rooftop bar were fun but again 16 euros is ridiculous. Best thing about our stay was the Nutella bar In the courtyard which was also the only reasonably priced thing there. We were breakfast included yet they didn't realise this halfway through so tried telling us we had to pay. Could be a bit more organised especially as we paid nearly Â£2000 for a five night stay. Overall great time but you can stay closer to the main attractions for a lot cheaper and more choice of food. They do however give you a free shuttle boat ride into the centre of venice which is a bonus.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
