This hotel is on the island opposite St Marco's Square, Venice. Never fear as there is a free hotel shuttle boat every 15 mins through the day and evening.  We were B&B.  The breakfast is top class with all the usual things you'd expect - continental stuffs and cooked foods and well as a good range of cereals, fruits and juices.  We had a standard road but it was luxuriously appointed.  We stayed 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and so pleased we made it our choice.  The views and swimming pool on the roof are the icing on the cake so to speak.  From what I saw of other hotels there, I would not be surprised if this was the best.  Free wi-fi in public areas is good.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
