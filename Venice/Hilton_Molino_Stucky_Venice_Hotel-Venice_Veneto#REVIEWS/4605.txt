Hotel comfortable and the staff very helpful.  Would not hesitate to book this hotel again.  Also when Venice flooded the water level around the hotel was much lower than hotels closer to St Marks.  Don't be put off by having to use the hotels shuttle boat as they run frequently and it takes no time to cross the water even at night.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
