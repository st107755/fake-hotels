We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel from Oct 21-24 The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful with all of our questions. I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the room was especially traveling with a 2 year old. He had plenty of room to run around and play. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very large with double sinks, a big tub, and shower. The location was great! We didn't have any issues using the free water shuttle. The drivers were very helpful with getting our stroller on and off of the shuttle. We didn't do the hotel breakfast, but there was a grocery store close by for us to stock up on breakfast items.  My only disappointment was that the Nutella Piazza is closed during this time of year. I would definitely recommend this hotel.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
