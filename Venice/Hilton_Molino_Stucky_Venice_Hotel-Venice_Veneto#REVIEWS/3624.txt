Hotel nice, views wonderful (especially the roof top).  Typically european, 2 beds to the room are singles.  No, 2 doubles.   So, it was a king and rollaway.  Staff did get a better rollaway, as  the first was terrible. Booked through NCL, cost of  $750.00 for the 3 of us.  Not good, for the money.    Did not like the water taxi shuttle, it was a hugh waste of time, very time consuming.  Bad when you only had one day to see Venice. If you are going to splurge stay on Venice proper.  Not an outlying area like La Giudecca.  Breakfast was good.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
