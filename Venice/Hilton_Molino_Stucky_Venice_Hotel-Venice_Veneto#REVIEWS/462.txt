Arrived Venice 3 days ahead of cruise, but no luggage.  Staff went to out of their way to make our stay comfortable while we had nothing but the clothes on our back.  Elisa Zamunaro in guest relations provided basic necessities,  a comfortable room with a bottle of Prosecco.   Carlo Perilli, chief concierge and his team called the airlines to locate our luggage and to expedite their delivery to the hotel.  After 2.5 days, our airline finally located the bags and delivered them.  We were so grateful for all the hotel staff assisting with the language issues.
