My husband and I stayed here from Feb 3-5, 2015.   The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are all very friendly.   When we entered our room, we were shocked with the smell although I read about it on tripadvisor prior to our visit. I don't know what it was. Maybe the water, maybe it's the wooden furniture. The smell was just really bad.   Another bad thing was that we could literally hear EVERYTHING from next door and from upstairs.

We are glad to see that you liked our hotel and staff.   We are sorry if you room smelled bad, sometimes this happens and is due to a very high or very low tide. However, we will inspect again all rooms as we did not have this problem for a few months now. Also, we are sorry if you were disturbed by other guests in neighbouring rooms and we will check your room to see if they are well soundproofed.   May I please point out that unfortunately you stayed during the days that had probably the worst weather condition of the whole winter so far (extremely strong winds, rain, hail and very low temperatures). We would be pleased to welcome you back during summer or spring, when the weather is definitely more appealing.   Thank you and best regards  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
