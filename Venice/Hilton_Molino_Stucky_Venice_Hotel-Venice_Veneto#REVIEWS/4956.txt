This is a great hotel in a prime location, away from all the crowds and noise of San Marco, but just a short free water taxi ride away from it all. The rooms are beautifully appointed and ours had an amazing view of the Guidecca canal. The breakfast buffet was excellent in variety and quality of food. The roof-top pool is a welcome relief after a hot day of walking around Venice. If you arrive by cruise ship there is a water bus that takes you from the port straight to the hotel, so it couldn't be more convenient. I would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
