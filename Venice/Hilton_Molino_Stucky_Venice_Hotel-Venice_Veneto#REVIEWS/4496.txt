Really great clean hotel. Lots of character too - not very Venice - but still an old warehouse feel. Good variety of bars and places to eat. It offers a complimentary boat to two place son the main island which is ideal and saves costs on taxi and boat fares. The boat runs late too so you can still have a good night out in Venice and get back.   Only downside is the overpriced 25 euros each to use the spa. Not worth it all all and was a shame as it was one of the reasons this hotel appealed.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
