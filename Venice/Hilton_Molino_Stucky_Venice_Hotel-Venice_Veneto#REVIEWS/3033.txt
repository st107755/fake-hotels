Excellent hotel. Great location and service. Good size rooms and well maintained. Very nice lounges and terrace restaurant and cocktail bar. A variety of good quality food in restaurants.  Regular water shuttles to and from the hotel to different destinations gave a great experience to view Venice from the river.  We had a great view of Venice from our room.  Shame we had to pay extra for wifi in our room- a bit petty. But overall a great experience.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 18, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
