This was a beautiful hotel and we loved staying there.  Great price and accommodations for the price and the included breakfast was delicious.  It was a bit out of the way so we would suggest using the vaporetto to get around (the water taxi's can be a little expensive).  Even with the vaporetto, plan for a 20 min (at least) commute to the square or anything else.
