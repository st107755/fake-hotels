Can’t say enough about this hotel, I’m usually a fan of small boutique hotels or b&b’s but since this was a business trip we had to stay here!  Great facilities, room was nice, spacious and clean!  Breakfast was great, rooftop bar and pool also fantastic!  Shuttle service was spot on!  If you prefer hotels stay here,  just far enough away from the craziness but close enough to enjoy whatever it is you came to Venice for!  Enjoy!  Oh and don’t forget to eat at the Nutella bar!  Yum!
