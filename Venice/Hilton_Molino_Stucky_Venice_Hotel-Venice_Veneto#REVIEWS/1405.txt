Loved the room.  Stayed in King Executive with View.  View room is worth the extra cost.  Nice to look over the water at Venice. Room was well appointed with high ceilings and plenty of space. Water bus to St. Mark's was very convenient.  Staff helpful in guiding with use of the transportation system. Although had use of the Executive lobby and food offerings, chose to eat at the Barcaromi all four nights of my stay as the food and service was excellent.  However, there were several other nice options. Service was as would be expected at a Hilton Hotel and a large influence to making this hotel my choice.  I look forward to staying here again and hopefully can enjoy the spa, gym, and other restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
