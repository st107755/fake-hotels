I travel all over the world and this hotel is my favorite! I stayed here for one night on July 12th before taking a Mediterranean cruise. My room was beautiful with a lovely view of the canal! The hotel decor was beautiful and rustic with exposed beams. They had a room near the lobby with complimentary snacks and breakfast for Hilton Honors members. The staff at the desk and the concierge were all so friendly and helpful! And they had a complimentary boat shuttle to San Marco square and also a shuttle to the cruise terminal which was nearby and only 7 euros. If I ever come back to Venice I'm staying here again!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2013Dear Madame,  thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel and the transportation to the cruise terminal which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
