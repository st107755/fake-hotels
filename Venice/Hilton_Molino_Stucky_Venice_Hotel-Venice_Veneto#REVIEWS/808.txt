This is the second time we were staying at the Hilton Molino Stucky, this time in a fabulous room with a splendid view to Venice and the Giudecca Canal. The hotel offers a convenient connection to San Marco and the vaporetti stations are nearby. The hotel has moved the executive launch to the ground floor meanwhile, which is much more convenient. The staff is wonderful and you must not miss the sky bar with a wonderful view over Venice and the excellent signature cocktails (the barkeeper is excellent!!!). We really enjoyed the stay!!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 5, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
