Just returned from a trip to Venice and stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky.  Beautiful hotel, great location for visitors who want to be near the attractions but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Venice. Hotel has its own boat, which transports guests to San Marco, but is also a stop for the local boats connecting to the airport, Lido, Murano and a few other stops. Executive Lounge is small, but adequate. Downside to the Lounge has to be the number of children who are not supervised by their parents, a policy should be in place as they are a danger, in some instances, to themselves and others. Hotel staff we had contact with were all helpful, courteous and friendly. We will be back!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 29, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for posting an exhaustive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your positive comments on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
