Hilton Venice is a nice Hilton property. We  got free breakfast and access to executive lounge where they have evening happy hours because we have gold membership. Breakfast was certainly better than Hiltons in USA. Room was clean, comfortable. Bathrooms could have been better. Toilet seat was too high and shower wasn't the most comfortable to use.  One down side that we felt which might be a plus point for others was location. This hotel is located on a separate island called Molino Stucky. Hotel provides water taxi to the city and back but it was still a little inconvenient because each one way trip takes about 20-30 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 5, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and Guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
