This hotel beats expectations.  Albeit not many guests, the service was exemplary: front of desk, breakfast and bar & restaurant.   The breakfast quality and choice was probably the best we have ever experienced.  We had an out of season break so the value was outstanding for such a posh hotel.  However, the timing meant most of the restaurants were closed but we managed the ‘venetian’ and this too was excellent – we usually shy away from hotel restaurants but glad we didn’t this time.  But it closed the next day!  The free hotel taxi was always on time and very  useful.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 28, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
