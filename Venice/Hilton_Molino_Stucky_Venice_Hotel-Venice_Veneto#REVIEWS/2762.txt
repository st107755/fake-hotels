Great Hotel - was opened in 2007, I think. An iconic building that used to be a famous mill in Venice. Actually it is located in Giudecca, the opposite on the Grand Canal. The building is very interesting, options are great, on the roof - super pool with excellent view and bars Even a Nutella bar in the entrance for the kids The Pros - the Hotel, great rooms and clean bathrooms, the atmosphere, the rooftop and the ability to jog in the morning (it is quite difficult to do so in Venice since it is full of bridges and Giudecca is just on the opposite of the grand Canal so there are many shuttles that are from the Hotel that take you in a few minutes to Venice)Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for taking the time to write your review.
