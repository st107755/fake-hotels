We spent a week in September 2010, for a professional convention.  The hotel has been renovated and the room we were allocated (Deluxe) was very cosy, and we had a nice view on San Marco.  The shuttle service bewteen the hotel and the main island is quite efficient.  A very nice stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
