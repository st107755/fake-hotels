It's a little bit out of the way out on La Giudecca. You have to take a water taxi or a water bus + the free shuttle (or walk 10 minutes from the nearest water bus stop). Once you are there, however, you may not want to leave. The rooftop pool is absolutely amazing! Incredible views of Venice! This must be one of the best rooftop pools in the world. They could have had a few more chairs / sun beds, but if you have one you'll love it.  The rooms are very comfortable, but not all have a great view.  Service was good and the breakfast was excellent too, as you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (but we also got the hotel at a bargain price).Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
