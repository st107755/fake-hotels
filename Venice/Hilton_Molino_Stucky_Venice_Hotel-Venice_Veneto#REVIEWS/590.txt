Hotel is excellent. Definitely need to try to book an executive room that gives access to the executive lounge as every day happy hour is quite sociable with all the families coming together.  The pool on the 8th floor has one of the better views in Venice. Rooms are good and staff is very friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
