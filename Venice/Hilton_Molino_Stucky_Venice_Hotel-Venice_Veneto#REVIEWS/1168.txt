We are sorry if the location did not entirely meet your expectations; the Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island and not right in the city centre, that is true, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical residential area.
