I Can’t say enough great things about this hotel! As a Honors diamond member we got upgraded to a room over looking the water and Venice, which we appreciate so much. Exposed beams in the rooms add to this repurposed building’s charm and character, such things that are often lacking from other hotels. Marble bathrooms and great decor even made me question why haven’t they rebrand to be part of Hilton’s Waldorf Astoria collection.   Hotel has its own water shuttle, along with easy access to water taxis and the vaporetto system ( think of it as a boat / city bus). Make sure to check out the roof top Bar for a few drinks and great views of the city. Since they don’t have a kitchen up there so you will have to visit on of their other restaurants for food.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
