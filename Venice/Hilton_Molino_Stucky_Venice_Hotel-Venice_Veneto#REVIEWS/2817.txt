Request Venice view and your stay will be perfect.  This hotel is across the water from Venice with great views of Venice while not being in the heart of Venice.  The hotel is clean, room and bathroom were good size, restaurants and bars we very good, pool has great location on roof. Hotels water taxi was convenient to and fro Venice.  Definitely stay here.  Only complaint... they tell you where to park and how to get there but parking lot was full and we couldn't follow their instructions and thus had a miserable time getting there.  Do yourself the favor of paying a private water taxi!!!  We parked on the 10th floor of a parking garage up the street, we dragged our rather large suitcases along the cobblestone streets to the "water bus" stop, were told to get on the wrong "bus"â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments. It is a pleasure to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and have especially appreciated the location on the Giudecca island and the great views from our Skyline Rooftop Bar and Pool which have no comparison in Venice. I feel sorry about the arrival issues with regards to parking and public water bus, the private water taxi is indeed a more confortable way to get around in our city. Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky and we hope we can welcome you soon again here in Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
