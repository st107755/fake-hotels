We had a suite and exec lounge access which was a real bonus. As we went for Christmas we had no idea if anything would be open on Christmas Day in Venice. Big mistake. We opted for the Christmas Brunch, which was no more than a cold  breakfast and at â‚¬50.00 each x by 4 we felt very ripped off as we could have had our breakfast for free in with our room rate. The free boat service was regular and we never had to wait more than 10 mins for it even over the Christmas period. This is a great hotel and i would recommend it to all.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
