It may be difficult to find buildings for larger hotels such as this one on the main islands, so this Hilton's location on La Giudecca may be a necessity. It is, however, distant from the main attractions and Venetian neighborhoods you would want to tour, and you will require taking the Vaporetto to the center.  Having said this, it is still a very beautiful building and location, right on the waterfront. I had a room overlooking an internal courtyard - still very pretty, as the building is an asymmetrical compound with smaller enclaves, and that's part of its beauty and charm.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
