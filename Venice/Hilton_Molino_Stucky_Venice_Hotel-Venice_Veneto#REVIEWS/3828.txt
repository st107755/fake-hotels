Stay at the Molino Stucky Hotel for an experience that encompasses everything Venice is about. Pleasant Hotel on a lovely island away from the mainstream, but the shuttle and the nearby vaporetto stop make it easy to get around. Great cafes and bars on Guidecca Island round off the trip. Be warned, the Hilton isn't cheap, and three nights is about the max. before it becomes a chore. Had some great stays there.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
