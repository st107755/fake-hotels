Please note - I am a Hilton Diamond member and we stayed at the hotel on points.   We were concerned about the hotel being on a separate island from Venice.  It turned out to be a tremendous benefit.  The location is very quiet and peaceful.  A few nights we left the window open for air (since the A/C was not on) and it was very peaceful and quiet.  A couple of tips from our trip -  Take a private water taxi from the airport.  At least for us, after an overnight flight it was much nicer to be delivered right to the front door and the ride was maybe 30 minutes.  Cost around $120.00 but well worth the cost  Breakfast at the hotel was amazing!  For Diamond members it is complimentary but even if we paid it would have been well worth the cost  The front desk staff is very helpfulâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the detailed review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
