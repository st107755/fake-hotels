Excellent hotel, wonderful and knowledgeable staff. Extremely responsive to emails before we arrived and equally helpful once we were at the hotel. Recommendations for restaurants were all good, particularly the first night at Trattoria Ai Cacciatori. The shuttle was always on time and very easy to use. The private boat arranged from the airport by the hotel took us through part of the Grand Canal, which was a great way to arrive in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
