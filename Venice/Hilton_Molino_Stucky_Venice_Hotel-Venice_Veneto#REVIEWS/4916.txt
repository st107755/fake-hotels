This hotel has been beautifully restored from a working mill to a stylish retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the main island. A water taxi is provided free of charge to enable you to come and go as you please. Views from the rooftop bar are amazing with the added bonus of a sun terrace and swimming pool. Staff were friendly, efficient and always happy to help. Rooms were spacious, comfortable and very clean.  We are really looking forward to our next visit to the Molino Stucky!Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
