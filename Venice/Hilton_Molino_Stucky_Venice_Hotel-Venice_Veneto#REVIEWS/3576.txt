This was my second stay at this hotel, and it didn't disappoint! It's a great combination of old Venice and modern amenities. It's beautifully decorated... an old flour mill with soaring ceilings and old wooden beams but gorgeous furniture and fabrics and an AMAZING view! Do your best to get a room that looks out to the Giudecca Canal! The hotel has a lovely rooftop bar, a couple of very nice restaurants on ground level looking right to the canal and a shuttle boat that comes on a regular route to 2 spots across the canal. You can take a water taxi (Alilaguna) to and from Marco Polo Airpport to the dock of this hotel for 16 Euros per person each way. It take about 1 1/2 hours, but it's a beautiful ride!Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
