This Hilton is close to the Venice city center, yet not quite as crowded.  The hotel is located in a quiet place where you can relax after a busy day in Venice.  And the free shuttle boat brings you in a few minutes from the hotel to the busy center of Venice.  And then there is the magnificent roof top.  The bar and swimming pool on the eight floor offer a stunning view over Venice.  Once there, it is hard to find energy to go visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
