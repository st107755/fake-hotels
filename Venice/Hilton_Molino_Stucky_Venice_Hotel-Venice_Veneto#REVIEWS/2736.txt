I stayed at the Molino Stucky for 6 nights on the island of Giudecca, just a short boat ride away from the main island. The view from the roof top is amazing, rooms are big and beds very comfortable. The house keeping was excellent, so was the breakfast.  We were unlucky enough to have ajoining rooms and got disturbed by a barking dog and screaming children next door. Also drinks, food and room service were overpriced. Bottle water from the mini bar was also expensive. I also  hurt my knee quite badly when I slipped  in a puddle of water on the ground  floor. The next morning somebody slipped in a puddle in the dining room and hurt herself . That seems to be quite common!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 26, 2015Dea Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
