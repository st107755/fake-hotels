I am a frequent traveller staying at many hotels world wide. The location of this property, ambiance, the vibe and most of all service deserves 5/5. Looked at many properties around St Marco Square, which included some really expensive rooms. But chose this after reading reviews. Will definitely stay here again next time in Venice. Highly Recommended.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
