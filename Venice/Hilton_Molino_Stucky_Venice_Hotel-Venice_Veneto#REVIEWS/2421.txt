Had an amazing experience at this hotel while visiting Venice for the first time.  Obviously you must take a water taxi from the train station to get to the hotel.  Very nice rooms and views.  The rooms are somewhat small, but if you are on vacation you won't be in your room much.  Hotel restaurant is great.  If you are taking a taxi to the main city, give yourself plenty of time.  You can not go wrong with this hotel.  It is directly across the waterway from all of the sites.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
