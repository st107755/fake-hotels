We arrived from the train station and hopped onto a regular bus-boat which took us to a stop near the hotel.  We had to walk just a few minutes to the hotel.  It is a beautiful and impressive hotel.  Check in was quick.  We had a beautiful suite that had a gorgeous view of the canal.  It was on the fifth floor overlooking the free boat shuttle/taxi shuttle service to St. Mark's and other sights.  It was actually nice not being in the middle of the hub, commerce and population of the city centre.  The roof top pool is to die for! The hotel is clean and spacious. The staff - knowledgeable and polite and quite simply wonderful. The breakfast buffet was more than we could have asked for and the Bacaromi Restaurant was definately a hit with us. We would return to this Hilton hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
