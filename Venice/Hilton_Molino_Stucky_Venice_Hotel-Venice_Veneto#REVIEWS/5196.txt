We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April . We were a little concerned with the location but that quickly disappeared the hotel shuttle service is quick and efficient.It was actually nice to escape the hordes of people in Venice and relax at the hotel before heading back across for more visiting and dinners .  The hotel rooms are nicely  decorated as is the rest of the hotel .The views from the rooftop bar are not to be missed. Staff were friendly and efficent.
