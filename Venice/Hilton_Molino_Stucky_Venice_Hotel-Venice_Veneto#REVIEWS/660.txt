We loved our stay at Hilton Molino. Water Taxi took us right to the hotel on another island Giudecca but there are shuttles included in your stay to the other islands which is very convenient. Hotel is beautiful, clean, safe, and comfortable. We had a family suite, there is a grocery store within walking distance on the island that I wish we would have explored earlier as Hilton's do have refrigerators so you can purchase a few items to have more comforts at home. This is a little more expensive but we thought was worth it. Rooftop pool are amazing, buffet way overpriced for what you get. Great cocktail bar that overlooks amazing sunset. Would recommend and would stay again. Service was very good.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 23, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
