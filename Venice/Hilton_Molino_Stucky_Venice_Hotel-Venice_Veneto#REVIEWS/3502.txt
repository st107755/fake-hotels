Located in the island of Giudecca, just a 5min boat trip away from the main island in Venice, the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel looks impressive, especially at night time, when it's well lit up and can be seen from Venice. It was a flour mill originally and it has many original features from the building. Arriving there by public transport was pretty easy: bus number 5 from airport to Piazzale Roma, and from there take the vaporetto (water bus!) line 2 to Palanca. The hotel is 5*, marble floors and all around the hotel, including the bathrooms. It's just stunning. The room where we stayed was pretty spacious and tastefully decorated. The rooftop pool is a nice bonus and the views of Venice from the Skyline bar, wonderful. Prices for drinks and food quite high, as you would expectâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 10, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for the useful information shared on TripAdvisor which will help other travellers coming to visit us.
