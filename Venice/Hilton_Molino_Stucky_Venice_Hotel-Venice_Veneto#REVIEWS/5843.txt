This hotel is the perfect escape from the crowds of Venice.  Beautiful on the outside and luxurious on the inside, it was a nice change from our stay at the supposedly #2 Bed and Breakfast in Rome. (See Rome Post)  We are Hilton Gold and were upgraded to a large room on a high floor as well as breakfast each morning.  The room was very clean, modern, and comfortable.  Breakfast each morning was more than filling - make sure you try the hot chocolate!  The shuttle from the hotel to the Vaporetti stops across the water was very convenient; however, the Vaporetti stop just down from the hotel was equally easy to use.  If you get a bus pass while you're there then it makes it simple to plan your trip.    We'd stay here again without any hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: September 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
