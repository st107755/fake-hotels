We really enjoyed our stay here, but I am not sure if we would feel the same if we had paid the hotel web price.   On the positive side, we were upgraded to a room (304) with a view as it was my birthday. This was a lovely gesture. The room overlooked the shuttle boat pier, and it was fairly noisy, but we soon got used to it. The view more than made up for any inconvenience from noisy late night revellers. The room also had a beautiful glass chandelier.  Our deal included breakfast, which was great. I wouldn't have wanted to pay 30 Euro for it though. There was a substantial buffet, with a good range of pastries, meats and cheeses, as well as a hot food selection. The service was attentive and polite.  There was free wifi in the lobby, which was fine for checking emails etc. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
