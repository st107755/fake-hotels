The hotel was lovely. We used points to stay here so I hate to write a negative but the shuttle service could be much better. With only hourly service to San Marco Square you need to be at the dock at least 30 mins before the shuttle arrival. EVERY time we waited with other people there was always a few people who would just go to the front of the line and ignore the rest of us. This is beyond annoying because when the shuttle is full they leave people behind and you must wait another hour. I would not stay here again because of the shuttle. Just a heads up, I might add we ate at the hotel twice once for 120€ and in the lobby area for 70€.

I am pleased to read that you had a pleasant stay with us and enjoyed the hotel services and facilities. On the other hand I am sorry that you were not completely satisfied with our shuttle boat service. We normally have 2 rides per hour from our hotel, one stopping at Zattere only (across the water) and one stopping at Zattere and San Marco. During the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) we have an extra service to San Marco, so in total 3 shuttles per hour. As per Health & Safety dispositions, the maximum number of people on board cannot be more than 39 regardless of how many seats the boat has. May I take this opportunity to inform you that the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minute walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. I look forward to welcoming you back to the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
