The Hotel is of the high standard expected with a Hilton and has the advantage of being in a building with a very interesting history. Another plus is being on the "blue" line boat service from the airport which, though slow, brings you to the entrance with luggage for 15e one way. There is a useful water bus stop about 100yds from the hotel with services to most parts of the islands which makes a useful addition to the hotel's own shuttle service. The concierge is a mine of information on the best way to get anywhere by water . The train station is on the route which uses this stop and there are regular, inexpensive trains to Padua and Vicenza making day trips there feasible.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
