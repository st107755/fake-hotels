Excellent luxury hotel located across canal from  St. Mark's Sq. -- with free boat service about every thirty minutes makes location easy. Executive level is way to go as there are hors douvres and pastries all day for your return to the hotel after sightseeing. There is magnificent breakfast and rooms are spacious and very clean. The concierge is very helpful and friendly -- one of the best Hilton's I have stayed in as a diamond member. I can highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
