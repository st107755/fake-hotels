We are sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at the hotel and we have read with interest all your points. We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. We have tried to contact you during your stay with us but unfortunately with no success. We understand you met our Guest Relations Manager before departure to address your concerns which have been shared with the management the same day. We are really sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your review and you can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we will  have the opportunity of welcoming you back in the future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
