The Venice Hilton property is excellent however staff is not very friendly. As a diamond member I travel to many Hiltons. The property here is as good as it gets. However from the from front desk to the conceriage the staff is not friendly. Especially the Conceriage of which I had interactions with three different individuals. The property is a renovated warehouse which is an excellet property that has great rooms (with hard beds)  with excellent views. To get to the property from the train station take waterbus 51/52 and get off at the Zattere stop and take the Hilton waterbus. To get to the San Marco stop take the Hilton water bus as well. Breakfast buffet is excellent.Read moreDate of stay: September 20102 SavesHelpfulShare
