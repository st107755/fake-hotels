My family and i spent a night in Hilton Molino as part of our tour group with Singapore's tour agency, Euholidays. We had to catch a boat ride from Venice port to the hotel and it was smooth and fuss free.   We are a family of 3 and we were given a big room facing the sea. The room was really beautiful with wooden beam roof and it was really cosy. The bathroom was huge and brightly lit. Just beautiful.   Breakfast in the hotel was so really great.  We had a variety of food and the croissants were just delicious!!! We had a great time in the hotel and i wish i could come back again!Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 12, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
