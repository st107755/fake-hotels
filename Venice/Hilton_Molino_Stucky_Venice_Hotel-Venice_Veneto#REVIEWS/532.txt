We stayed overnight prior to our Mediterranean cruise. The accommodations were clean and spacious. The breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing with all types of fruits, breads and pastries as well as egg and breakfast meats.   We also ate in their restaurant for dinner and the food was wonderful, (if a little expensive) and the service was good.  The boat ride from the airport to the hotel was very interesting as is Venice.
