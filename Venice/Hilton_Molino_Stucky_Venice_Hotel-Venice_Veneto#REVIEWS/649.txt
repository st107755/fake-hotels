This is a beautiful property. But it is very inconvenient to get there - on the island of Giudecca which is very out of the way, and the shuttle boat is not that frequent.   The staff were very helpful and the room was also something to write home about - or on Tripadvisor :-)  If you can use Hilton points - even a better deal.  One caveat: if you are leaving from there to the airport - it s the longest water bus ride, so may have to take a water taxi (about 130 Euros). This is an issue with a morning flight.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2018Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and Guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Besides our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 11 minutes. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
