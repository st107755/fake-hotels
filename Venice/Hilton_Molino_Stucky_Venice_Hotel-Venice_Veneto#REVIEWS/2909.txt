It's a Hilton, so, it's big and can seem a bit impersonal. However, it's set right on the main canal with spectacular views. Our room was simply great-quiet, comfortable with nice furniture and a large bath.  We only had breakfasts there, buffet or menu, and the selection was very large. The food was tasty and well-prepared.  There's a shuttle boat that runs only every half hour, so plan ahead. You probably won't want to hire a water taxi--70 Euros for the same run as the shuttle.  This is one of the best large hotels I've yet stayed at.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
