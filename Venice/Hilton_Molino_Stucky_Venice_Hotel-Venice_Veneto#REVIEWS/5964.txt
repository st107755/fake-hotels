A true five star hotel? Not really if you are not able to enjoy the comfort of your room. I visited the hotel recently and I had sleepless nights and mornings due to the noise comming from next door room. It was so incredible loud that at one point I was convinced that it was a hole between the walls. When I knocked the walls  I realized that they were not proper walls, no brick ones but sort of wood material ones...what a pitty. As the hotel was fully booked  I had no other choice but to buried my head in pillows everyday!!!  This is tragic as this is a truly beautiful hotel. If you are as keen as me on your beauty sleep then think twice before staying at the Molino Stucky. Read moreDate of stay: July 2007HelpfulShare
