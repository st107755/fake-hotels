We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky in August 2014 prior to boarding the Regal Princess cruise ship for a Med cruise.  We were not disappointed with this hotel for the most part.  I had done so much research for hotels since in each city we visited.  If you like more American standard hotels where the rooms are large and there are more "American" conveniences, you will enjoy the Hilton Molina.  Free wi fi in the public areas, modern toilets, etc.  The hotel is NOT located where St. Marks Square and where the most popular sites are though.  It is only across the canal from the city center.  The hotel provides a FREE water taxi every few minutes to the city center.  This was very convenient.  From the airport we took a water taxi to the hotel.  It was pricey but totally worth itâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 18, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
