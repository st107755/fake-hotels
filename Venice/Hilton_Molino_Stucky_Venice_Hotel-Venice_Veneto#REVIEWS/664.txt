Very quick shuttle boat ride to hotel, shuttle always ran on time. Family Suite was large, with large bathroom as well - well worth the room rate considering Venice is so expensive. We did think the food was overpriced - good, but expensive. We opted to purchase the breakfast buffet ahead of time because it is cheaper, so ask about it when you check in. Also, this is some sort of Hilton time share (?) - Odd to have part of the lobby dedicated solely to time share guests for food buffet. The rooftop bar had great views, so worth the visit. Hotel pool was packed when we visited, so we didn't use. Anyway, overall it's a good choice and we would recommend (especially for families).Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 19, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
