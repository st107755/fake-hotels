Lovely hotel with great views across Venice from both the bedrooms and the rooftop pool and skyline bar.   We had no trouble with the shuttle service which is a real bargain. Seemed very regular and we always got a seat. Download the Hilton Venice app for a mobile version of the timetable.  Breakfast was great, one of the best I've had in any Hilton with a good variety of the normal breakfast food, plus extras like Nutella muffins, freshly made French toast and wide election of juices.   The gym was the best of any Hilton I've stayed in too. Very modern and well equipped.
