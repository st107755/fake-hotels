I really loved the space of this hotel, probably the biggest in Venice with clean amenities and good service. Some great things include: - Big rooms - Plenty of restaurants - Great service - Spa access - Good staff  Some things that could be improved: - More sunbeds on rooftop swimming pool - Covered areas in and around rooftop swimming pool - Executive lounge could be restocked more frequently - Selection of items in Executive lounge could be more varied day to day - No security for accessing Executive lounge, anyone could walk in after someone else - Frequency of shuttle boats could be greater midweek  We really did enjoy our time here though and would stay again if ever back in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
