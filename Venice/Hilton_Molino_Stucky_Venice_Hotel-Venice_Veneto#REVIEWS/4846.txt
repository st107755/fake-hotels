We stayed recently at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice.  It's a beautiful hotel and if you are a Hilton Honors member you get a complimentary upgrade and free breakfast.  I also was able to get free cocktails and snacks in the Executive lounge.  The place was beautiful, offered a free shuttle to St. Marks and one of the other water taxi stops so made it very easy to get around to both of the Islands where there are things to see.  The breakfast was amazing as was the staff in their attentiveness.  Quality was number one!  We would return there if visiting Venice in the future.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
