As a diamond member I stayed at many Hiltons including wonderful beach resorts and my wife and I were blown away by the stucky.  We started off a great note as they upgraded us to suite 418 which is large and has beautiful views of the city.  The hotel is in excellent condition and was decorated with beautiful fabrics and furniture.  Our suite was truly luxurious.  Everything else has been wonderful: the food at the executive lounge is excellent. The staff was very friendly and the boat shuttle works great. Highly recommendedRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
