We did not stay in the hotel, only visited the public areas and had a drink in the bar on the top floor. I have rarely seen a better use of an industrial heritage site. It made me think of St Pancras station in London. The flour mill was a beautiful red brick building to start with but had fallen in a state of complete  and utter desolation.  It is now a wonderful highlight and part of the Giudecca skyline. Beautifully light up at night. Inside the hotel is more than what you would expect even from a Hilton: super luxury in excellent taste.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 21, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting a review about our property.
