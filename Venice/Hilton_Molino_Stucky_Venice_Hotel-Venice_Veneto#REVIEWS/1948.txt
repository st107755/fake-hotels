The location of the hotel across the water from the main island of Venice is perfection (away from the tourists but readily accessible).  The roof top pool is beautiful and the hotel's Sky Bar makes it a romantic destination for a night cap Bellini. Excellent breakfast buffet and catered for Gluten intolerance specifically, which we valued.  The kids loved everything about the hotel.   The only flaw in an otherwise perfect hotel was the lack of movies in the room (we watched CNN/BBC WorldNews as we don't speak Italian)...A minor point, as in Venice you spend most of your time sight-seeing, but unfathomable why this service isn't available in a modern international hotel in a major tourist city.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
