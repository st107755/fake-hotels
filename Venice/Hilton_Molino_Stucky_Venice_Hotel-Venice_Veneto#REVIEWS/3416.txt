Loved my stay here!  So beautiful and perfect location, hilton shuttle (very prompt) was great for taking people across canal to main attractions!  Room was very beautiful and so comfortable!!  Bed was a nice treat!  Staff were very polite and prompt.  Executive lounge was a bit of a disappointment but was still a nice perk!  We rather enjoyed the little restaurants along the canal!  A wonderful evening stroll among the locals was a treat.  Word of warning if you take the public ferry to the train station beware!  Getting off of the overstuffed sardine can is almost impossible!  It was a nightmare of a ride!
