My wife and I stayed here for 3 days last week. This is a great hotel to stay at in Venice. We had a room on the 7th floor with a great view. The breakfast is delicious and has great variety. The staff, especially Daniel, who works the executive lounge in evenings, are there to take care of you. Check in went very fast and were granted a free upgrade on the room. The concierge services were very helpful in providing information on boat and train schedules. The pool and bar area on the 8th floor are spectacular, however we did not swim in the pool. I like the location, which is a bit out of the way from St. Mark's, but it is away from all the hustle and bustle. There are a few restaurants located near the hotel that are also worth trying, thus not having to use the boat shuttle.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
