I love this hotel.....if I could live in it I would! I have visited approx 45 countries and stayed in loads of the hilton hotels, and this has to be my favourite one in the world. I have been at least 6 or 7 times to the Hilton Venice and I have rebooked for this August and also for August 2015 already! Of course venice is a great location but the hotel has so many positives too....the view from the rooftop pool, getting away from the crowds to the peaceful island of guidecca, the shuttle boat, the huge lovely breakfast, the service, the standard of the hotel is excellent.  Most of the hotels in Venice are quite small and over priced. Whilst the hilton is not cheap I always prefer to pay that little bit more to get an amazing, truly memorable experience at the Hilton Venice.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
