This is a wonderful hotel across the waterway from Venice.  We arrived on a Friday after spending three weeks in Italy travelling from Air BnB to VRBO's to villas in the country.  It was a welcomed relief to arrive at the Hilton and be greeted by the staff to a remarkable fine old building.  The service and facilites were first class and it was so nice to be at a full service hotel.  One of the best features is that you are away from the hustle and bustle of being on the island of Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
