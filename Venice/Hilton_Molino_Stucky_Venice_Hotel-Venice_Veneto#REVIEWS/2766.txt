This hotel was very pretty, and our room was large and comfortable.  The bathroom was a good size.The water taxi made it easy to travel to St. Marks and ran frequently.  The breakfast had a lot of variety. The location was very tranquil, and it was nice to kick back in the lounge in the evening.  The hotel added to the charm of a visit to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 16, 2015Dear Ms. Jane,   thank you for your kind review.
