We never stayed at a Hilton hotel and tried it in Venice for the first time and......also the last time! What is good: - Beautiful building - Regular and free transfer by boat from the hotel to San Marco/centre - Nice rooms But what is not good: - Their "world famous" buffet breakfast is very poor for such a hotel. Not something to be proud of as a hotel. - In the room you can hear everything what is happening in the hallway/corridor (poorly isolated rooms) - We had a room with connecting doors and it was like there were no doors at all!!! We could hear everything said by the neighbours in the room next to us!!! - The restaurants and roomservice is totally overpriced!!! The value of the food is not worth the money you have to pay. We like good food and willing to pay for that,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
