I loved the room. Very comfortable. This hotel has it's own taxi to get you right over to the main part of Venice and it's like 4.00 for your entire stay. The front desk people were very helpful. We woke up very early and the early staff were very accommodating with getting us our coffee. The buffet is lovely. The eggs are never cooked enough for me overseas and every hotel was more than willing to cook the eggs and bacon well if I requested it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 23, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
