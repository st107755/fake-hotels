We, a family of four, just completed a four night stay. We had read the other reports and were not sure what to expect. I will tell you I spend 200+ nights in hotels/year and this was by far the best experience I have had in many years. The property sparkles from the entry to the rooms, to the pool and lounge area. The staff was excellent. From checkin (Bette) to the Director of Operations (Enrico) to everyone we came in to contact with, we had a great expereince. This was our forst trip to Venice. When we return (and we will to spend more time at Burano and Lido as suggested by Enrico) we will try to book at the HMS. Watch for cruise ship departures and arrivals and head to the pool to watch. An absolutely amazing place to view the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
