We stayed there for 3 nights in November. It was just after the big floods. So, the first thing we noticed was that the hotel ground level was high enough, there was no water in the lobby. Complimentary shuttle boat is a great thing, you don't have to worry about the schedule because it goes every 15 minutes. We were upgraded when we came so we got a fantastic corner suite. The view was inside the building courtyard, but since it is a magnificent building we didn't mind. The room was very spacious, clean and everything worked perfectly. Unfortunately it was the time of the year when rooftop bar is closed already so we didn't get a chance to check it out. Breakfast was standard Hilton, everything fresh and various.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
