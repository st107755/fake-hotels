Big and fancy, even for a Hilton.  Start with the water taxi that picks you up (or drops you off) at St. Mark's Square.  Room was up-to-date and beautiful.  View was great.  Largest buffet breakfast I've ever seen - and good.  Staff was English speaking and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
