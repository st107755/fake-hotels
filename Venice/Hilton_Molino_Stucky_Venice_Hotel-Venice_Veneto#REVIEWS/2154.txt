We recently stayed in the hotel Hilton Mulino Stucky for just one night. Hotel is rather new with a very nice pool on the roof from where you can enjoy a magnificent view of Venice with Guideca canal in front. The location is very convinient if you arrive by car. It only takes you about 20 minutes by vaporetto (boat) from the main parking house called Trochetto to the hotel. Hotel also operates its own shuttle boat to San Marco place which is again very convinient for exploring the old city. The room which we got was realy spacious, the bed was confortable and the staff at the reception was helpfull and polite. I can reccomend this hotel to all visitors of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 26, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
