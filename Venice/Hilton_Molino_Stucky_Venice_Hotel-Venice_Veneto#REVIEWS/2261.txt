the location of this hotel is good. they provide a boat shuttle to the main island. because of that its very convenient. its spotless. the staff are very willing to help out. the room was good size for Europe standards. But boy do they need help in the breakfast. we got to breakfast at 7am when it opened. all hot dishes were cold. ice cold. the selection is so mediocre and not filled rapidly. a huge negative for us.  My husband and I did rate them while we stayed on the property but nothing changed. Because of this would not stay again unless some changes are made. as I said property is just beautiful and large. but it needs attention given to this area.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 14, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotelâ€™s facilities. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you appreciated our Team Members and hospitality.

I am disappointed that you did not not enjoy the Breakfast experience as we keep receiving lovely feedback from our Guests, but we appreciate your criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service.
