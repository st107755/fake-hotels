We ended a 12 night Mediterranean Cruise here at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel.  It was absolutely beautiful.... like out of a magazine.  I basically cleared out my Marriott points to stay here for 2 nights after the cruise and it was worth every point.  The decorations looked like fine Italian furniture.  The room was large and extremely roomy and you couldn't ask for a better location.  We loved our stay here and if we every find ourselves in Venice again, I wouldn't hesitate staying here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
