I stayed with my family in this hotel on the 7th of July . Such a beauty.   you are met by great , polite and smiley time from the moment you arrive until you leave. The water taxi is available every two hours free of charge to explore Venice. The rooms are clean and fresh smelling.  We enjoyed our stay and will plan to go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
