We are happy to read that you liked our hotel and that you were satisfied with your accommodation and our overall service. On the other hand we are sorry if the location on Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
