We were greeted by the attractive Simone......   Ok, that was my wife, now I will chime in.   The Hilton Molino surely has the best customer service in the world.   Simone, at the front desk, totally took care of us upon check, he recognized that it was our 25th wedding anniversary, and put us in a beautiful room, view of the water and busy Venice.    P.S.  The two girls who work the Executive Club need to be commended for their exceptional service.     Ciao....   We will be back!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
