We stayed there for a single night after our cruise.  The staff were helpful and friendly the room was absolutely gorgeous. Would highly recommend this and will look forward to staying there again! Look at the website for pictures of the room and lobby.  The pool and bar on the roof are great and provide wonderful views.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
