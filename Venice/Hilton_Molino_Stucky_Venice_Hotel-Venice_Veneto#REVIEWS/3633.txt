We stayed at the Molino Stucky with two very dear friends and thought this was a perfect location.  Make sure you request a room with a view of the canal.  It is so relaxing to sit and watch the many and varied boats pass by the hotel.  There are several very good restaurants within a short walk from the hotel.  Just ask the concierge for recommendations.  The boat is easy to catch, both adjacent to the hotel as well as in San Marco area, etc.  If you are heading to Venice and want to enjoy just a bit of peace and quiet during your stay, this is a great spot.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
