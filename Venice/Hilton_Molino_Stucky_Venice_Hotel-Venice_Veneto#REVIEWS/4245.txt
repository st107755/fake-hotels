We went to that place while we were visiting a part of Venice we never had the opportunity to visit. We noticed the building while leaving from Venice for a cruise on the Mediterranean sea. While the building in itself is amazing, and the story of its former owner very interesting, we did not expect to find a place so exotic in Venice. The Skylunch is as well known as the SkyBar and is situated on the 8th floor of the magnificent " Molino Stucky" . The view is breath taking on Venice and the amenities are just incredible. The Restaurant is next to the swimming pool literally  situated on the roof  of the building. The view in any case is just fantastic. Add this to the terrace and your lunch ( buffet for an acceptable price) becomes absolutely different from what you can expectâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
