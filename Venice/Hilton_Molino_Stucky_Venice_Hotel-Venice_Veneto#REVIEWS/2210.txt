We used a great amount of Hilton Points to book our room and got a small room with a view of a wall less than 10 feet away!  The window was less than 5 feet tall from the base of the floor.  The chandelier was beautiful but very dusty.  The furnishing where lovely, the king size bed was comfortable, but the bath area was small and crowded.  The bath tube was slim making it hard to take a shower.  Also the shower glass was less than half the tube so water went all over the floor.  Ops... almost forgot, the elevator and floor we were stay on had a very strong smell of mildew and mold.  This smell would also linger in our room.  Did talk to someone at the desk and they stated they were having problems with the pipes and they would check it out.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 5, 2016Dear Sir,	 First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
