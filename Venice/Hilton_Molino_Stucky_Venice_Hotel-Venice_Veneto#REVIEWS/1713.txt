Very nice hotel in the past. We stayed on the executive floor, which has seen better days. The executive lounge had been moved from our floor to the lobby of the Hotel, which was quite uncomfortable while all guests could see you having snacks and drinks. The happy hour in the executive lounge was less desirable to say the least. Merlot for wine? Heineken for beer? This is Italy folks! Front desk staff was very friendly and informative. Make sure when you leave to make arrangements the night before for a water taxi in the time frame that you need it. This has to be done with the bellman's desk. We had a room on the front of the hotel overlooking the city of Venice. That was very nice!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky.
