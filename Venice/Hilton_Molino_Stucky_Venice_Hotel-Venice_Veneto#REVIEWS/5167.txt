This was our 60th birthday vacation trip and it was perfect.  The hotel was very clean and the people at the Hotel and the Island were very nice and helpful.  I have a gold card and the executive lounge food was very good.  The room was very clean and there was a great restaurant down the street that had great Italy food and atmosphere.  The prices at the hotel for food was a bit high but I had the best manhattan of my like there.  If you are going to venice then you have to expect to spend money.  The hotel is very large and the boat service to the main Island was always on time.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Sir, Thank you for your excellent review of the Molino Stucky Hilton.
