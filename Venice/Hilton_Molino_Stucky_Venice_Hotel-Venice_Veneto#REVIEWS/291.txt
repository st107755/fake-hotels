We stayed here for four nights. Like the location as you are away from the maddening crowds. The shuttle is convinient. The rooms and the decor of the entire hotel are  very old and tired.  The Executive Lounge quite poor as it is a narrow bit at the end of the main hall. The sofa bed for our son was incredibly soft. The furniture is very old.  The shower is in the bath which I really don't like. The in-room dining was of very poor quality and total waste of money.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2019Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
