Awesome refurbishment of a magnificent building - dominates the little island across the canal from 'main' Venice (where St Marks is) but poor service, lack of attention to detail & excessive prices in the hotel bars & restaurants in my opinion means it fails to be a 5 star as it is supposed to be. E12 for an hour on the internet (Hoxton can do it for free). E5.95 for a bottle of water in your room when the little supermarket about 500yards away it was 14cents. E9 for a (very) small glass of wine (not even Italian), supermarket had a wide choice from about 1euro - and it was very drinkable.  A burger in the 'casual' bar/diner E24. Hospitality tray not refilled properly, just the little things irked. Oh, and a 'complimentary' water-taxi to a glass factory is an hour longâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
