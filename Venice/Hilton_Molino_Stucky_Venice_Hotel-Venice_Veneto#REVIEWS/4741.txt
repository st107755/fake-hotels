We stayed here for 4 days in March 2012 and it's one of the best hotels and experience. As a Diamond HH member, we were upgraded to a suite with an amazing view of the waterway. For breakfast we were given vouchers for a full breakfast and also offered bite sized snacks, alcoholic and non-alcohilc beverages, desserts during the day. It's a bit far from main attractions but there is a boat that takes you to San Marco attractions. We were unfortunate not to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar but still enjoyed our stay. The staff were very helpful and would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel.
