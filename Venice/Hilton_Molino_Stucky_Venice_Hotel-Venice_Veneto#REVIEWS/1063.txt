Another amazing Hilton hotel and just what you expect when staying in one of their establishments it was perfect in every way. The rooms are very spacious and spotless and the staff couldn't have been more attentive and friendly nothing was too much bother. The food was excellent and the location is brilliant and makes it easy to get around. The only down fall I found was drinks are very expensive in the hotel compared to other bars and restaurants other than that I couldn't fault it. I loved the water shuttle very relaxing and a great way to get around. Welldone to all the staff and thankyou for a great stay.
