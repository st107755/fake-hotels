A fantastic hotel in a beautiful location away from the centre of Venice The rooms are comfortable with a large bathroom.  Internet service was a plus and we had no problems with it during our stay. The shuttle too San Marco and back every 40 minutes was fab. The staff are friendly and helpful and breakfast had lots of choice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 13, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on the hotelâ€™s facilities.
