We had one night in Venice after a cruise and chose this hotel for its rooftop bar and pool. We wanted to relax at the end of a great trip. This hotel is in Giudecca, not walkable from St Mark's Square. A shuttle runs to the square every 20 minutes and is quite nice actually. Our friends opted for a hotel near St. Mark's as they wanted to go out in the evening and didn't want the hassle of waiting for a shuttle.  Our choice was great. We had a full day in Venice but spent the evening enjoying the hotel. The rooftop bar serves minimal food, but we ordered the cheese and prosciutto platter which was delicious.  The room was lovely, and the staff helpful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
