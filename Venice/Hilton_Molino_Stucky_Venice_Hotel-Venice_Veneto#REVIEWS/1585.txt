I was there in September 2016, there is a beautiful bar on the roof top in which you can get a panorama view of sea, however you may have a difficulty finding your room because there are several elevators and passages for each block of hotel. The hotel is not located in a calm place but not in the main Island of Venice but it is that far either and the shuttles transport you to Venice and back for free. In the island the hotel is located you can find some good sea-food restaurants and there's an amazing bakery nearby. Overall I enjoyed my two day stay there.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 12, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
