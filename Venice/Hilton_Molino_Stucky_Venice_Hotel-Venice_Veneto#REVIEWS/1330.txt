We are glad to see that you liked our property and that you would come back to Hilton Molino Stucky. On another note we are sorry that you were not completely happy about our location and, though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
