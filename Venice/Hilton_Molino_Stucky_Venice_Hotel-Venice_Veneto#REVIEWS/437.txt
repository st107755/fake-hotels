First time staying here. Wow! Would recommend this to everyone. Cant think of one negative comment. Location was away from the hustle and bustle but hotel shuttle was super convenient.  Only regret is that we couldn't stay longer.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2019Dear Guest,  thank you for your extremely kind review on TripAdvisor.
