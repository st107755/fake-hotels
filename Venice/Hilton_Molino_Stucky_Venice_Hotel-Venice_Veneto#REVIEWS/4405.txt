One of the best hotels I have ever been in - cannot recommend enough! I booked through Olotels, and got a great price for a single room for 2 nights.

It was no problem though - they deducted the drinks off my bill!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
