A fantastic conversion and great location - nothing nicer than to come back to this beautiful oasis of calm and tranquility after a few hours melting in St Marks Square! Skyline Bar and pool staff really friendly and attentive and had a lovely couple of hours in the spa. Stayed for four days and couldn't fault it. Will be returning next year!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
