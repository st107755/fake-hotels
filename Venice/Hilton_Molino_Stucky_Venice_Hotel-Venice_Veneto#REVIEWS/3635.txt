We have stayed at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice in June.  Although we have been to many of best hotels in the world, I can say this hotel is very best and we really loved it.  It's a massive hotel with a number of great facilities, such as different types of restaurants, bars, spa, and pool.  Staff were extremely nice and we never forget the memories at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  Only small issue I can say is that one of shirts we dry-cleaned were damaged but the management has done a fantastic job on our behalf to get a compensation.  We couldn't be happier and I had to write a review to appreciate what they have done for us.  If you are looking for a hotel in Venice, Hilton Molino Stucky Venice is the hotel I strongly recommend!  Thanks again to the management, especiallyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
