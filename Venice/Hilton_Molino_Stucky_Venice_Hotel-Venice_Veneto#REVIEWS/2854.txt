While it is across from the main island of Venice, it provides that special all inclusive location to relax, eat, pamper, frolic, and romance.  The Hiltons rooms are beautifully decorated, comfortable, completely safe, and clean.  The staff is very knowledgeable, pleasant, and professional.  Their four areas to eat provide excellent choices for your special dining needs. The facility provides water shuttles to two sections of Venice for easy access to major shopping and sightseeing with many of the other water vehicles stopping to give you many alternatives to visit.  They will also arrange a private taxi to the train station or airport at slightly reduced rates. A great experience which we will experience again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 17, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
