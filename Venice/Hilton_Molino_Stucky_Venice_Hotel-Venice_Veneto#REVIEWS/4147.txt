We stayed here for one night, celebrating our 15 year wedding anniversary.  My husband informed the GM, and upon arrival, we were surprised with some lovely, romantic touches, including a hand written note. This was such fantastic customer service, and added to our romantic evening.  The rest of the staff was extremely helpful, polite, and knowledgable.  Our room was stunning, and overlooked the canal.  It was comfortable and immaculate. The hotel provided umbrellas when it was raining, which was greatly appreciated.  The location provided spectacular views. We ate the breakfast buffet, which was delicous.  The shuttle service was nice, although the hours were odd.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat,  it was a fabulous stay!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
