When arriving as a D HH member we were offered an upgrade. I asked for a nice view on the "canale" and we got finally a beautiful corner suite with a splendid view. The hotel is very nicely renovated with spacious rooms. The shuttle boat station is in front of the hotel and therefore very easy commuting from airport as well from the center. Also Venice is very "packed" you get in the area of the hotel some more space. The business lounge could offer more selection, but this is the only point to complainRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
