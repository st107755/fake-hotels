Just returned from this amazing hotel. All the staff were great, especially Guissipina, the concierege on the executive floor. She had the best recommendations and treated us as family.  The room was beautifally appointed. It was clean and large with many wonderful features.  The executive lounge had a large variety of foods and drinks and was open until 11:00.   The pool on top of the hotel was very inviting and has a spectacular view of Venice. This hotel had a shuttle boat that dropped guests off at two sites twice an hour.  It was very convienent and a welcome relief from the noise of the city. Our room overlooked the canal. I thought the entire stay of 5 days was great. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.
