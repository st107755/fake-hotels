High quality Hilton hotel with good access to the rest of Venice via hotel shuttle or by vaporetto. We had access to the executive lounge which was much appreciated - especially for the complementary breakfast and evening drinks. We enjoyed the buffet dinner on new year's eve in the Molino restaurant. All in all we had a very enjoyable stay. The Skyline pool and bar is presently shut.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
