This hotel exceeded our expectations. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. The rooms were very large, clean and nice to stay in. The location was good too as regular shuttle boats went to the main areas. The concierge were also extremely helpful in recommending places to go and eat and also arranged a free tour to a murano glass factory. Breakfast was also delicious - there was so much choice and the staff were also very helpful in making sure we were satisfied. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
