It's my one of preferred hotel for my family, friends or solo weekend. The good feeling starts by reaching by motor boat the hotel, continues at the lobby but the best part are the rooms. I was upgraded (as diamond member) to the suite with canal Giudecca view: room is spacious, comfortable, clean, quite and from a super comfy bed, you can enjoy the canal view. This is simply the best. Walking around you can enjoy the unique Stucky architecture. Do not miss the SPA: therapist are professional and an oil massage is what you need to be pampered at the end of your day. A particular thanks to Elisa Z. and all team for the support: they really make you feel home and they do the best to ensure an unforgettable experience.
