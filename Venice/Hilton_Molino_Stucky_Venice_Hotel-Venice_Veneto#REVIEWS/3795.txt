If you want to look across at the splendours of Venice and don't mind catching the hotel's water taxi to get to the heart of things, this hotel is great for you.  It is an impressive building and the staff were very friendly.  We only had a small room but as we were only in it to sleep, it didn't matter.  If you are thinking of visiting Venice and don't want to pay the steep prices of the older hotels, this is perfect.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
