This is a very nice hotel on its own, but when you combine the convenience of the location (no pulling bags through the town) and the incredible rooftop pool with one of the best views in Venice, you have to give it 5 stars.  The boat ride to the hotel from the airport is either long (1.5 hours on public) or expensive (110 EUR - one way for private), there was a mix of friendly and average staff, and the room had a bit of a musty/smokey smell at first arrival, but I would definitely select this hotel on the next trip to Venice.  The outdoor restaurant also has great views, good food, and friendly staff.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
