I was a bit concerned about the location of the Hilton Molino Stucky, since it was away from the more popular areas of Venice, but it turned out to be a great choice.  They arranged for airport pick-up for us, which worked seamlessly.  We arrived early after a long overnight trip but were able to immediately check in-- The front desk was helpful and understanding.  The hotel provides regular vaporetto service to San Marco Square, which was reliable and easy, and our room was extremely comfortable with a beautiful view.  Best of all-- when my husband left his jacket and passport in the hotel after checkout, the hotel staff went to tremendous effort to find us, but also ensure the security of our belongings.  I would definitely recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for your kind comments about our property.
