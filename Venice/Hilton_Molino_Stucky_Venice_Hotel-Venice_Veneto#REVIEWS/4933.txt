Where do I begin? The Hilton Molino was fantastic from the second we arrived until the last minute before departure. The check-in process was quick and seamless while the staff were polite and answered in great detail all of my questions. My wife and I were here on the last day of our anniversary and I must say I will definitely return to this hotel. The room had a fantastic view of the lagoon and everything from the bed to the toiletry amenities were all 5 star. We actually skipped a gondola ride to spend our last evening in this hotel! Special thanks to the following Hilton staff for their personal touches on our stay: Annimi Schifferegger & the manager Alessandro Cabella. Looking forward to returning to Venice and staying at the Hilton Molino!Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
