This hotel was a surprise substitution on our tour so did not know what to expect. Found a wonderful new hotel , more Hilton than historic even though it is a remodeled factory, but with great rooms and all the modern amenities it was a nice change of pace on the tour.  The hotel had an amazing breakfast, best on our tour and great staff.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
