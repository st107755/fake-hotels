I am so glad I booked this hotel. I love that it is not in the crowded St Markâ€™s area. The revitalization from an old factory is stunning. The staff is excellent. The dedicated water taxi is great. Love this hotel. I would totally stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 28, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you for leaving such a positive review about our hotel on TripAdvisor.
