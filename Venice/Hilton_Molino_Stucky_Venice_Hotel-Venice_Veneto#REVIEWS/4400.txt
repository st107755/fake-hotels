We went here to celebrate my wife's birthday and had long wished to visit the Molino Stucky,  We were not disappointed as we had a lovely room with a view over Guidecca canal, enjoyed breakfasts in the restaurant, dined for the birthday meal at Aromi (nice food and excellent attentive service).  A particular highlight was evening drinks watching the sunset at the Skyline bar which was superb.  The shuttle to St Marks was easy and convenient to use. The only let down was a very below par Executive Lounge - a shame as all others we have been to in Italy have been superb.  Would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
