For our first visit to Venice this hotel was a perfect choice. The service at the front desk and throughout the hotel was excellent. I felt welcomed on checking in. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean. The boat shuttle to St Marks was prompt and efficient. The buffet breakfast is like a resort, fantastic. The Concierge desk was helpful and had good suggestions for us. It was crazy busy over at St Marks so it was a nice relief to be able to enjoy the quiet atmosphere of Guidecca Island.
