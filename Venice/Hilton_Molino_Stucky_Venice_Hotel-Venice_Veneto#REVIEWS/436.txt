The hotel is rather grand and impressive as you pull up. We booked a city view exec room and the view was worth the extra money. The rooms are spacious and clean. The food and drink on exec package is non stop and saved us a few pennies on breakfasts and lunch.   There is a free shuttle from the hotel to St Marcs square that runs every half hour and we experienced no problems with this.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 29, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your excellent feedback on TripAdvisor.
