Excellent service upon check in! They offered us a great breakfast rate that was totally worth it! Best breakfast we had in Italy!  The room was large and comfortable. The bed was a large king and enjoyed its linens and spaciousness. The service at breakfast was fantastic! Extremely helpful and wanted to ensure that you were taken care of. We also ate on the roof top bar and had drinks. A little pricey but worth they money for the view and the small snacks served with the drinks at night.  The pool was wonderful, it was extremely clean and had a fantastic view! The hotel was also in a great location away from the crowds with easy access to the main centers via water shuttle care of the hotel around every half hour. Wonderful and relaxing!Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
