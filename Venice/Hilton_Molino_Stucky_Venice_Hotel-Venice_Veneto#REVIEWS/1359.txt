This hotel was very disappointing. Just an average "chain" hotel with no soul or character. We were shown two very tired and quite smelly supposedly "executive" rooms which we were not happy with. Finally we were shown a much nicer "executive" room which had a lovely view but we were told that we had to pay 70 euros for the upgrade. Being Hilton members we found this to be outragous. The "Executive lounge" is a bit of a joke...a corridor with very few food options. We also ordered some coffees in our room which never even arrived. The distance too is actually quite a drag. The beds are comfortable nonetheless. Would not both returning. Very average.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 17, 2017Dear Madame, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
