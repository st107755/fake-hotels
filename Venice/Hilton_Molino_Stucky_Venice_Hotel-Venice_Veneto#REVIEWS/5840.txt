Fine hotel, a really good choice if you want to avoid any risks to find yourself in a tiny, dark, noisy and overprized room (as it often happens in – even “luxury” – Venice hotels). A little downside is the location, as you have to catch a boat for the main parts of Venice, but the trip just takes some minutes and can be funny (especially when you take the free hotel shuttle with its “Capitano” flirting with every goodlooking female person nearby… ).  Our room (superior) was perfect and a real hideaway after long footwalks through the Venice quarters. Breakfast is very stylish (on executive floor), fine selection with nice presentation.   We would definitively stay there again next time.Read moreDate of stay: January 2008HelpfulShare
