We stayed here on Hilton points, so it would have been expensive if not for that. But the hotel is huge and beautiful. It is across the canal from the rest of Venice, but there is a private shuttle that goes from the hotel to San Marco square, which is very frequent, fast, and convenient. There is also a vaporetto stop very close to the hotel, which gets you anywhere in Venice you want to go. We bought a day pass, which allowed us to take unlimited vaporettos for the day, which was very convenient and a great value.  The hotel had a great breakfast buffet, and a beautiful rooftop pool with one of the best views of Venice. We would happily stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
