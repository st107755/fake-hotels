The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory which was restored and reconverted in 2007 to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy and, though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture and we are glad that you appreciated the special atmosphere.
