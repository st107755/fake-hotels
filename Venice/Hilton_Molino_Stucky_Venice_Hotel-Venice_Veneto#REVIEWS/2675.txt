Staying at this property poses the logistical challenge of having to take the water shuttle back and forth to the main island every day.  If the hotel offered something distinctive to compensate for that inconvenience it might make sense to stay here, but unfortunately it does not.  The service and atmosphere have all the charm and warmth of a train station, which in fact the lobby closely resembles at times.  Nor do you get more space or comfort - the rooms are at least as cramped and expensive as anything at a comparable level on the mainland.  Far smarter to look for a smaller place in an quieter corner of the main island, of which there are several.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 16, 2015Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
