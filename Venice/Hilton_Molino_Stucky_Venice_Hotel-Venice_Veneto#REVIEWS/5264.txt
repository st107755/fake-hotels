Well runned property, all te way Hilton do this. Easy to get to Venice´s must to see atractions, getting a boat that takes you to the front shore where your trip to Venice must begin. There´s only two things to improve. 1.-Internet conection is expensive, I just don´t know why hotels keep trying to get more money for a must-to-be-free amenitie. and 2.-No iron is availabel for each room, you must to go to an ironing room for each floor, what is so uncomfortable.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 21, 2012Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time and trouble to share your experience at the Molino Stucky Hilton with other tripadvisor users.
