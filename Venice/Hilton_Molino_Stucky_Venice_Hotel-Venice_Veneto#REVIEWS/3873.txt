Hilton Molino is a great hotel in every sense, good rooms, good service and good food. The installations are brand new, as if the hotel had been just opened. It is not in the main island, where the touristic attractions are, but conveniently so, as you are away from the crowds, but still 15' away by a private shuttle boat service that runs punctually from the hotel to San Marco. The Concierge service is excellent, booking all your needs efficiently and courteously. The view over the city Is fabulous, and you get to see the big cruise ships parading in front of your window.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
