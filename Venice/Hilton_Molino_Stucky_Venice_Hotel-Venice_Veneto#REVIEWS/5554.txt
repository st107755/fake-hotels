After a day with the crowds in Venice, taking the boat ride over the quiet of the Hilton is a grand way to stay. A very nice hotel in a great location with an attentive staff. The furnishings were top shelf, well maintained and an overall great experience. Only drawback is the cost, but everything is expensive in Venice. The view from my room window was every bit of it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
