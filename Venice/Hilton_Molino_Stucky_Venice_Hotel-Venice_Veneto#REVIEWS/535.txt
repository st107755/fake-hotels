Hilton Molino Stuckey is an oasis of calm away from the main hustle and Bustle of downtown Venice. This is truly and outstanding hotel and one of the best Hiltons we have stayed in. My wife and I stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed every minute. The Concierge Carlo was a delight. Extremely helpful and accommodating a true asset to the hotel. Went above and beyond to help solve a tour provider.  Diego in the lounge at breakfast was friendly helpful and full of helpful hints about Venice, the weather and what to expect.Really incredible. On the whole the staff were very professional and to be commended. The rooftop bar offers a great view and amazing sunsets. Staff here could be a little more attentive (minor issue). A truly memorable week. Thanks to all at Molino Stuckey.
