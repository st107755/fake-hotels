Away from the crowds, this Hilton is special to us! We visited Venice last August and rebooked again this past weekend! They gave us the same beautiful room on the Grand Canal! This hotel has an interesting history and special location! They always go above and beyond to assure everything is wonderful! Being a Diamond member sure has its benefits.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 23, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
