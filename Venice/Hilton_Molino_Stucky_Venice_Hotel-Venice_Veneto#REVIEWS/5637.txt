Hotel was great. Location is across the lagoon but they have excellent shuttle boats running. It was August, very hot and crowded so it was nice to escape. Rooftop pool is small but great views with the cruise ships passing thru the lagoon. Room was nice but difficult to find due to the fact that the hotel is a renovated factory. Breakfast was very good.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
