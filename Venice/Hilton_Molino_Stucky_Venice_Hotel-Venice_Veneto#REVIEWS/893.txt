Venice is magical, and staying in this hotel made my holiday in Venice even more magical. My friends were not too sure about staying on Giudecca island but I thought it was a smart choice so that we could avoid the millions of tourists and at the end we all agreed that it was the smartest of choices. The hotel is a stunning building which used to be an old mill. we had a room with a view over the canal and it was worth to pay the extra to get tha stunning view. The rooms are beautiful, not too fancy, comfortable. I would definetly stay again for my next trip to VeniceRead moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
