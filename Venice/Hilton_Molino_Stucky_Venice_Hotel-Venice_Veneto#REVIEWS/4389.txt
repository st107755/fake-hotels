We stayed here for one night, room is small, but artistic and comfortable.    The hotel is located on the island opposite to the main island, it has free shuttle boat to 2 main attractions, San Marco etc.  The pool on the roof is really nice, sunbathing while overlooking the beautiful scenaries of Venice.  There are a few restaurants on the island and the hotel reataurants are very good.  There are some tourists from the cruise ships but the hotel is big enough to accommodate without feeling packed.
