Great hotel, beautiful views and fantastic room. Very, very romantic as is Venice. The only thing I would recommend is using a fast water taxi from the airport. Although, the slower one is fine, it just seemed to take ages to get the hotel and after a long day you may not be up to the transfer.  The rooms were clean and beautifully decorated. We did not use the spa as there was so much to see in Venice and we ran out of time. With the hotel do not be put off by having to get a water taxi over to Venice, its quick and reliable. Just check timetable.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
