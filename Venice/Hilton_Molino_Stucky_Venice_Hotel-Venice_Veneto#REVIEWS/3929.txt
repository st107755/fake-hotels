This location is an old pasta factory set on a smaller Island across from Zattere water taxi stand.  The renovation has been done at a very high level of excellence, the staff is quite helpful and friendly, and the hotel is beautiful.  The shuttle takes people from the Hilton to Zattere, a famous waterfront avenue great for taking an evening turn, and on to Piazza San Marco, the most famous Piazza at the mouth of the Grand Canal.
