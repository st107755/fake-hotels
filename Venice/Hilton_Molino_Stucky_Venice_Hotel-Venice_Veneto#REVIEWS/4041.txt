What a magnificent stay! I loved every second of it and wished we could have stayed longer. Simply outstanding. Large rooms, well furnished, perfectly clean. The bathroom is large, well lighted, outstanding. Breakfast buffet was to die for. Nice Italian and Asian food offers. Had two nights dinner on the Bacaromi/Aroma restaurant. Very nice Italian and Venetian dishes. Probably one of our best meals during our Eurotrip. Location is a plus, in front of Venice, very easy to reach but very calmed and relaxing at the same time. Congratulation to Iliana (or similar) in Front Desk. Always with a smile, great attitude. They arranged for breakfast box for us as we were leaving quite early. Highly recommendable.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2014Dear Sir, Madame, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
