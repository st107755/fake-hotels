We stayed here in December and had an executive room which meant we got a great view of Venice right at the front of the hotel. You would think such a position would mean a noisier room but being 5 floors up it was fine and we could even see the mountains in the back ground. We made full use of the executive lounge though I was surprised by the small size of it but it had a good offering of snacks and drinks at most times of the day. The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent. The only thing I would say and this is a super minor thing is that some of the signage is out of date and the restaurant was not the easiest to find.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 18, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
