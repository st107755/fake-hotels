the hotel and staff were great. We arrived in Venice on Dec 27th to snow and rain and the executive  lounge was a needed stop after the train from Florence. We stayed at the hotel 2 nights in a large suite with our two teenagers. The hotel is across the canal from the main tourist venues but a free  boat shuttle provided  access. it generally runs every 20 -30 minutes so plan that in to the things you do in Venice. Our room was very comfortable and the kids even thought the pullout couch for them was okay.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 5, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your excellent feedback on TripAdvisor.
