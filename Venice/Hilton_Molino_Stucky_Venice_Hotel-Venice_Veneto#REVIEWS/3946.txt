My partner and I came here for a romantic trip and this hotel added quite a lot of romance! Stunning views over the river, and the bed was just so comfortable could have happily slept longer than I did, we even ordered the same pillows and mattress online for our house.   There was nothing wrong with the service but I didn't experience a very efficient or friendly staff but nor were they horrible, just very standard.   Food was excellent, and I would recommend staying here.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
