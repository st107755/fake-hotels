I cancelled my reservation using the Hilton Honors App several days ahead of our scheduled visit and was charged for my room anyway.  When I sent a copy of my cancellation confirmation email, they said that the hotel had made multiple bookings for my name that night and I had only cancelled one.  When I contacted Hilton Honors customer service, they acknowledged the additional reservation had been made at the hotel itself and not the members app, which is all I use to make reservations.  But this location was independently owned and they could not do anything about it.  I have been a Hilton Honors Member for many years and attained Platinum level many times....doubt I will ever book to stay with Hilton overseas again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2017Dear Sir, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor and for your loyalty to Hilton. I have investigated internally with our reservation manager and he confirmed that the first booking was indeed cancelled while the second, also made through the Hilton Honors app, was unfortunately not. This is why you were charged for no show for the two nights that were still present in our system. We are sorry you feel this way but we are most concerned about the issue and should you want to get more information please feel free to contact venice.reservations@hilton.com. Looking forward to hearing from you, with best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
