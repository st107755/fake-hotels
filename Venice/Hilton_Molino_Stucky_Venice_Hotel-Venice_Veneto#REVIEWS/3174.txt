My partner and I stayed here in February for 2 nights and I must say it was wonderful.   We came to Venice for the first time as it was my other halves birthday. I emailed the hotel prior to our stay to book a few treats for the room and ask about the transfer from the airport. They couldn't have been more helpful. Not only that we were upgraded to a suite and this just made the whole experience incredible.  The hotel was stunning, clean, and an obvious choice if you're looking for a 5 star hotel. The Sky Line Bar on the roof was also incredible, we went there both nights for a drink before heading out and enjoyed the view and the sunset.   Overall there is nothing I could fault about the whole trip and a lot of that was down to the hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
