Great hotel, sunny lovely room with views, fabulous pool with shaded lounge chairs, cocktails, appetizers and incredible 360 degree views overlooking Venice and adjacent islands. They have a private shuttle that takes you back and forth to Venice that runs every 20 minutes and being on the water adds to the Venice experience. If you are leaving on a cruise by chance the hotel shutter takes you direct but I would stay here whether or not I was cruising. Nice bar, staff, amenities.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
