We booked a vacation package through Delta Vacations for flights to Italy and a long weekend at the Hilton in Venice, which saved a ton of money on accommodations compared to booking separately.  The Hilton location is across a canal from the heart of Venice, which offered amazing views and a quieter setting but was still a few minute free shuttle ride to all the main attractions.  Highlights include watching boats pass by our canal view window, and a few great canal-side restaurants a short walk from the hotel.  We also loved having cocktails at the roof-top bar in the evening.  The view from the bar, as well as the roof-top pool were spectacular!  We would definitely return to the Hilton for our next Venice visit.
