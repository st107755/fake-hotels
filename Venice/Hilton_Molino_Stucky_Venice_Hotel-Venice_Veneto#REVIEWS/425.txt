Pool terrace was closed and reception didn't mention this at time of check in. Only when you go up on so many elevators you read the notice.  Bar terrace opens late at 4pm, so when you return from sightseeing it's dark. Isn't the purpose of the Molin Stucky the panoramic views?   Executive Lounge bedroom has small window for panoramic views.  Nice Breakfast.   Free shuttle boat to San Marco.

We are sorry to read that you were disappointed about the pool being closed during winter time. We would like to take this opportunity to inform also other travelers that Information on the seasonal opening of our pool is available on our website where it is specified that opening is seasonal, from mid May to September. We are sorry if this was unclear and that you were expecting the pool to be open. Our Skyline Bar and terraces are instead open every day throughout the year and our Guest can still enjoy the wonderful view over the city and the lagoon. Thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance of welcoming you again in the future.  With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
