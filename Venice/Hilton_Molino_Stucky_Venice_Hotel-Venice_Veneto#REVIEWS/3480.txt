It was my wife's 50th Birthday. As a surprise we went to Venice and stayed at the Hilton Molino Stuckey Hotel. The quality of room, surroundings and service were outstanding. The staff are really helpful and pleasant, in particular their guest relations and concierge who were very efficient. I recommend this hotel for any special occasion, I will certainly return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
