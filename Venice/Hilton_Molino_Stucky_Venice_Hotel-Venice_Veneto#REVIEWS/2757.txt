Me and my husband stayed at Hilton for two nights and absolutely loved the property. Although it is situated at Giudecca - a 10 minute boat ride from San Marco but the frequent hotel water taxis make it easy to shuttle between the two islands. The hotel has a Nutella bar serving some lip smacking desserts. Also the breakfast spread was one of the best we had in our entire trip - Do try out the freshly baked chocolate muffins, I don't think I have ever had such delicious ones! I'll recommend this hotel - a little away from the crowded island but connected well enough. We ended up spending late nights just sitting on the hotel parapets enjoying the breeze and the beautiful views :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review.
