I was worried about the hotel not being on the main island but there is nothing to worry about. The shuttle boat service is very frequent and just 4 minutes from the main bit of Venice. The hotel is clean and , when you visit a city built on water, you will accept that the city and hotels have a slightly musty smell. This is where this hotel comes into its own because it is modern and does not have these issues. You can walk down the road to eat in the local restaurants and the staff are fabulous and helpful. Lovely warm water, tea, coffee in rooms and huge pillows. Thank you for a lovely stayRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
