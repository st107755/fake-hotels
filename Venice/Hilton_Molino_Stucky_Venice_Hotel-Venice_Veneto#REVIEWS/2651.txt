This is really a very nice hotel with a free water taxi that can take you over to St. Mark's Square.  I actually preferred staying away from the busy square and being on a quiet little island a 5 minute water taxi away.  It allowed us to enjoy all the activity and then leave it behind when we wanted to rest.    The lounge is pretty mediocre and it feels like you are in a fishbowl (it's surrounded by glass in the lobby).  But we enjoyed a couple of drinks in the hotel at the lounge.  And it was a free lounge upgrage, since we have Hhonors Diamond status.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 23, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
