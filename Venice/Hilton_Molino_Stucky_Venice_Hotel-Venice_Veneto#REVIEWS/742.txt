Just back from second visit to this hotel. Will go back next time in need a short break. Fantastic hotel in a fantastic city. Exec rooms are fab but check that rooms have doors to close off bedroom, some do some don't. Food great and Skybar a must. Even room service food is great. Tried the Nutella bar this time, way too good for your health! All staff are tip top. Shuttle across canal is very regular. Local restaurants are also very good. If you are going to Venice give the molino stucky a go, you won't be disappointed.  My wife and I can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 3, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the nice review on TripAdvisor.
