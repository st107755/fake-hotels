My kids and I really enjoyed staying at the Hilton Venice during our recent visit.  The location was on a different island than the main sites but the hotel water shuttle to the main island was convenient.  There is also a grocery store, bakery, pharmacy and other things in walking distance.  The room was very nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating when we had an emergency that almost changed our travel plans.  The concierge went above and beyond in trying to help us.  Overall, this was a very nice choice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 30, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
