This is hotel in an amazing building and in an amazing location. It doesn't matter that it's not in the heart of Venice - in fact that's a bonus as you can escape the crowds. The hotel runs a shuttle boat service to the centre so it's easy to get around. If you want a large hotel, then this one at least has plenty of character. We were looking forward to using the rooftop swimming pool - but hadn't noted the small print hidden away on the website noting that it is only available May - September. This was really disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2016Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on the hotelâ€™s facilities.
