We just returned from a four night stay at the Molino Stucky Hilton.  The hotel was lovely though not in Venice proper, it was just a shuttle boats ride away from Venice.  The shuttle was great and made it easy to travel back and forth to the island.  The downside was that the shuttle was often full and left us stranded to find another way back or wait for 20-60 minutes or more.  The room was lovely and spacious, the beds comfortable.  The sofa bed that my daughter slept on was horrible and unstable.  Had she been a larger person she would have fallen through to the floor.  Since we had a suite, we had access to the executive lounge which served breakfast and happy hour snacks and wine for free.  Great perk!  But the place was super crowded and we were even turned away twice. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
