Just spent 5 wonderful days in Venice on a girlie holiday... We chose this hotel for its pool so we could have the best of both worlds.. great pool to chill-out by day & the buzz of the city by night. We were not disappointed....   The staff at this hotel were fantastic nothing was too much trouble and always very pleasant. We were there during one of the busiest weekends in Venice (the Redentore) the hotel was full but the service remained high. Breakfast was excellent, so much choice (apricot muffins to go a must :-)) and again a great service by the hotel team.  Rooms very clean, large, tidy with fluffy towels and robes.   Mini bar as you would expect expensive 7 euro for a can of coke. A bottle of Presecco is around 50 euro in the hotel but well worth it with the view.
