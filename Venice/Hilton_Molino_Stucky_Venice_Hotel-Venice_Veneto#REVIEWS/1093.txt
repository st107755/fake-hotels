My first impression of the room was this is luxurious, nothing like the business  Hiltons I'm accustomed to.  The staff, from the porter, to the front desk, to the breakfast staff, are friendly/helpful.  We found the shuttle convenient. Although not free, it's only 6 euros person for the duration of he stay.  If arriving Venice by train via Santa Lucia, I would recommend taking the water taxi. While more expensive than ACTV, the ACTV stop is about 5-10 minute walk to/fro the hotel.  The way isn't always smooth, inconvenient traveling with luggage.  And during the summer, a hot walk.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
