Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend with my wife and another couple. I’m a Diamond member and both rooms were on my name.  Check in: We had an early flight in and I emailed the property on this issue, we got the rooms at 10:30 AM !!!  Upgrades: Both rooms were upgraded to executive rooms with canal view !!!  Breakfast: Great buffet breakfast with all the local Italian meat cuts, great variety and choices with an automated fresh orange juice squeezer. All in all, perfect !!!  Service: Can’t write about all the small things that they do to make you feel on a perfect vacation. Front desk, bellboy, restaurant personal , the shuttle service from and to the city, all was just great !!!  I will definitely come back and would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. …Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 30, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
