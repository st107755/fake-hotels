We stayed here at the extension of our Viking tour, which Viking arranged.  Room was not clean - hallways not clean - little or no amenities.  Had to ask for face and hand towels and glasses ( which I'm glad I didn't use).  CAME HOME with bites on my chest and legs!!!!  And a charge of $112.00 that we can't figure out. It was an extension of a Viking cruise and there should have been no charges. And rooftop pool was closed both nights for a " private " party.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 22, 2016Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
