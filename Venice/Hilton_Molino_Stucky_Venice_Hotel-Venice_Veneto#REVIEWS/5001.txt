This hotel was the best Hilton my fiance and I have stayed at for our weekend getaway.  The hotel itself is very nice - The rooms are very comfortable, and the shuttle boat to and from the main parts of Venice were very convenient.  When it got too hot to tour around Venice, it was nice to return to our comfortable, cool room and freshen up for dinner. The breakfast offered was very good, and gave us a good start to our tour around Venice.  If we ever return to Venice, we will definitely stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
