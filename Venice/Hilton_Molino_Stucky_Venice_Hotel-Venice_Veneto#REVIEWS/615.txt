We are sorry if the location on Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and Guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Besides our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you again in the future. Sincerely  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
