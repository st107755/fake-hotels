We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a cruise . We loved the location- away from the maddening crowds! They have a shuttle boat that goes all the time to the main island. Only takes about 10 minutes. There are some great little restaurants outside the hotel just along the canal to your right! Room was gorgeous very classic! The bar on the roof could be updated but otherwise a most enjoyable place to stay. We even got a water taxi to the airport arranged by hotel not cheap but worth every cent when your flight is leaving early and what a ride along the Grand Canal! Remember to join their awards before you go! You do not get a card unless you have stayed at another Hilton Before but tell the main desk your number and they will add your stay ! Also suggest you book throughâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
