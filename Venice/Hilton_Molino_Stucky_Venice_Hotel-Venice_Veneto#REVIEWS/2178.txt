Me and my husband stayed here for 4 nights in a charming water facing room... The building and location is just perfectly romantic.. The skyline bar at the rooftop is very beautiful and gives you a 360 degree view of Venice.. there are frequent water boats connecting the centre and other places in Venice and have no problem with the accessibility.. The restaurant serves delicious sea food.. overall we had a good experience ..Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 16, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
