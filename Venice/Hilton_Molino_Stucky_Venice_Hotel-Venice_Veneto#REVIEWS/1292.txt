We loved this place. Beautiful. Great view out of our window, even though the window was off to the side. We had really good breakfast and snacks and coffee in the executive lounge, but they kept it too warm. The drinks at the pool were ridiculously expensive so we avoid that area. The boat shuttles were fantastic. They picked up and dropped in Venice and the Hilton gave a free tour of a Murano glass blowing factory.
