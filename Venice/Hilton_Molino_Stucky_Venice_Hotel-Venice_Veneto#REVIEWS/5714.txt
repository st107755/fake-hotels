We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky with a huge group and I couldn't be happier with the way we were all handled! The beds were super comfortable, the employees were courteous and always happy to help and the shuttle to the main island was so convenient! After walking around the main areas of Venice (and then staying in other cities) I couldn't have been happier with the location and environment of the Hilton. Being on the island of Guidecca it was extremely quiet which was amazing after a long day! I would highly recommend the Hilton Molino Stucky to anyone visiting Venice! OH, and the Skyline Bar on the roof is an amazing perk! Great bartenders and view!Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
