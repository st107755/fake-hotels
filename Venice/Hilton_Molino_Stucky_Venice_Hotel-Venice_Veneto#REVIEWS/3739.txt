This was our 2nd time to stay at this hotel, and we simply love it. Rooms are clean, bathroom are well maintained and clean too. Adequate choice of breakfast. They provide a shuttle service from the hotel to Zarate and San Marco & back to the hotel. You just have to have a copy of their time schedule so you won't miss the service.  The concierge staff needs a little smile and should be welcoming - he looks as if he needs a happy meal.  Had my birthday dinner at Aromi - our server (whom i forgot his name-Sergio? ) is such a great guy. and food was great! the weather cooperated that night. it was awesome.  Although its a non-smoking hotel - its still a good choice for us to stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
