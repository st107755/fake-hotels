You only turn 40 once so do it in style. Hilton is one of our preferred brands although we are equally happy using more unique hotels when travelling. We felt the price was fair, although admittedly we travelled off season in February. The building is impressive and has great views.

We are sorry if the location did not entirely meet your expectations, however the Giudecca island is closer to the city centre and St. Mark’s Square than other areas in town. Besides our  shuttle and private water taxi, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / line 2) station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. With regards to your comment on the room, we are pleased to inform you that we are in the process of reviewing designs and we do hope that should your plans bring you back one day in Venice, you will give us another opportunity to serve you.  Best regards  Ilio Roodni General Manager Read more
