The hotel is located away from the center of historic Venice which is good for having a quiet spot away from the bustle and noise of Venice but means more time to get to center and dependence on the hotel's shuttle boat. The hotel is in a huge reconverted industrial building and is quite  a rabbit warren. The front desk staff  were polite but impersonal. We had a lot of trouble getting our room key to work and they were between indifferent and unsympathetic which is not what i would expect from a five star hotel. The furniture in our suite was elegant but characterless. The food in the so-called gourmet restaurant Aromi was good but far from outstanding or memorable. Our expectations of the hotel were higher - we were rather disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: March 2010HelpfulShare
