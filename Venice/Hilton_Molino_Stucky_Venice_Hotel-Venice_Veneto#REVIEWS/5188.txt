I am a Hilton Diamond member and have stayed in many Hiltons worldwide.  I'll have to say this is one of the best Hilton properties I have stayed at.  I must commend the Guest Relations Manager, Constance, as I felt she went above and beyond in helping me in my requests.  We were celebrating a surprise birthday celebration and she did everything she could to make sure it went off without a hitch.    The property itself is beautiful and the location is superb.  The complimentary boat shuttle takes you from the front door of the hotel to St. Mark's plaza in just a few minutes.  When I return to Venice I will make it a point to stay at this Hilton again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
