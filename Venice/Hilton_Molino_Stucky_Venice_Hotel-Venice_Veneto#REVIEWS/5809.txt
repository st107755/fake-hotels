located on a secluded island, this was an awsome hotel, nice ventian breeze with all the things a usa traveler would like.  totally up to standard. really nice breakfast in the morning.  I used my hilton high honors points to stay here, and the executive level rooms are really nice with a view of the canal, and a great breeze in the morning.  When you run down the island there is a grocery store and nice restaurants nearby that are very reasonable.  The pool on the top of the hotel is the envy of the city.  The hotel is expesive at 350 euros each night, but it is well worth it to splurge with hilton high honors points. i was dissapointed that they charged 30 pence a minute to use the internet.  if you are a business traveler, you will find no internet hotspot in all of venice,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
