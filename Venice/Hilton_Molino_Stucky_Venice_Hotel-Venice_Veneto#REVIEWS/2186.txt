Very comfortable hotel. Wonderful diamond amenities.  Good shuttle. Nice breakfast and friendly staff. We enjoyed our stay and will return next time It is not on the Grand Canal so you don't explore the Venice streets by just stepping out and walking The fact that you have to be on a boat to get to st Marks as is almost always the case is not the big deal It's exploring the areas outside the hotel which is some what lacking from an experience perspective  Solid stay Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 11, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you found our Team Members friendly. The Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, is away from the crowded city centre and it is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. On the next occasion I think you should visit our island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
