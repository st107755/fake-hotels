Beautiful hotel away from the business of Venice.  We had an excellent view of Venice from our room.  The Nutella bar is worth a stop but you could probably share a crepe!  The breakfast buffet was excellent.  The pool was closed for the first day that we were at the hotel which was a disappointment.  When it did open up, it was too crowded to enjoy.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 30, 2018Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
