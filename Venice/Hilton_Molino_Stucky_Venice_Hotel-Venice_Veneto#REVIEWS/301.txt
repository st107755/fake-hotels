What a fantastic hotel this is. The staff are excellent, special mention for Marco on reception and Natasha at breakfast. The hotel is in a great location and the shuttle service is frequent and only costs 8.50â‚¬ for your entire stay. Breakfast is extensive and delicious. When going to Venice this is the place to stay.
