We wanted to use our points so decided to stay at the Hilton.  It's on Guidecca Island, so we were a bit concerned about the convience of getting from the hotel to downtown Venice, but we decided it's worth the money saved.  Turns out we didn't have to worry at all.  Guidecca is literally right across the river (maybe a mile length wise) and there is a shuttle every 20 minutes from the hotel to Zattare and San Marco.  While it's not as convenient as staying on the main island, it's also not that bad.  And the hotel is GORGEOUS. From outside, it's this huge brick building that takes up a good chunk of Guidecca.  And from the inside, there are courts where you can sit within the building but be outside.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 25, 2011Dear Guest,  thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
