Second time I stayed here.  They have their own water taxi over to St. Marks that runs hourly.   Top quality rooms, hotel, and staff that are fluent in several languages.   Left something in my room after leaving for airport via water taxi and called hotel.  They quickly let me know how to return to the hotel using the correct water taxi line.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
