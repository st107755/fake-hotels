I can't say enough good things about this Hilton. It's in a perfect location to catch any boat around Venice. Service was terrific in every department. Restaurants are all very good. The concierge desk made so many great plans for us. Transportation to and from the airport, trip to Murano and Burano, concert of Vivaldi's 'The Four Seasons' and tips for day trips around Venice. They were also a life saver when my daughter got sick by finding a Dr. that came up to our room to see her. This location is a perfect example of why we love Hilton properties.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 19, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for your positive comments on this website.
