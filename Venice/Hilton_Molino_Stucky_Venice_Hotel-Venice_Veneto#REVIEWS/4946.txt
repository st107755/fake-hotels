Glad I stayed at this hotel in Venice looked like the best one there. It's absolutely beautiful spotlessly clean very friendly helpful staff. room are spacious and luxurious there is a very wide selection at breakfast. The hotel is huge, so be prepared to get lost a few times!!! We did not hear a sound from any other rooms, we stayed in an executive room which included access to executive lounge which was a bit strange as it is just one part of the bar sectioned off which we thought a bit odd was expecting  A separate room and we were not aloud to take drinks outside so had to sit in bar to get your drinks we was disappointed about this as the weather was beautiful and as us Brits don't see much sun we always like to sit outside when we are away. But this would not stop usâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
