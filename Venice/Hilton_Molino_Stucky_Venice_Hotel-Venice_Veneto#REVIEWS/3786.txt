A fabulous location away from the bustle of St Marks Square.  Hotel is beautiful inside although rooms can be smaller than expected.  A lack of wardrobe space can be a problem if staying for more than a couple of days, otherwise the facilities are excellent.  Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Be careful not to book too far in advance as much cheaper deals can be had closer to the time of your stay.  A fabulous hotel, great restaurants and bars. Vitto and Vincenzo are two brothers working in both the bar and restaurant who really looked after us throughout our stay and made my special birthday even more memorable - Thank you both.   Be sure to check out the Skyline bar with its magnificent views.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
