I liked the Hilton a lot!  Although not on Venice proper, the hotel has a shuttle every 20 minutes so it's an easy commute and it gets you out of the crazy tourists area in Venice.  The hotels huge but everything is well thought out.  Very comfortable beds and the rooms are nice and large.  Food and drinks are definitely on the high side but service is excellent and the food is good.   I would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel .
