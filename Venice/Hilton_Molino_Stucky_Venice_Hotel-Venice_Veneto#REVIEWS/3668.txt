My wife and I stayed in this hotel while we were on a tour.  It is a large, modern and very comfortable hotel.  Location is great as it is located on Giudecca Island right across the canal from the main part of the city and they have a free water taxi that will drop you off on the main islands.  It's quiet and a great place to stay while exploring Venice.  Staff was very helpful, they were having a problem with their WiFi while we were there and went out of their way to help us.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
