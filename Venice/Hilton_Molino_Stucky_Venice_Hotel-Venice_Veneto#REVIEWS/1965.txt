We stayed here for three nights and the hotel room was very well furnished. Service was top notch and their rooftop bar served some great cocktails! The hotel is located on an island that is 20 minutes from the island with the tourist attractions and for that Hilton operates regular shuttle service which we found specially handy.  Note: The shuttle stop near st. Marks square is not marked which made it very hard for us to spot the ferry dock. The boat also leaves just in time, so in order to make it you must be there a little before time. Once we took the shuttle into the city we mentally marked where we got off and thats how we knew where to show up the next time to get the ferry to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 1, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our shuttle which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
