We stayed here on 3/7-3/10 2018.  Hotel was classified 5 Star and we paid for breakfast.  We took a water taxi which cost 60 euro,  there were no bell boy available.  So my wife and I roll our own luggage to the front desk.  We were offered to upgrade for additional 80, we refused.  They put us at room d 131, room smell like sewer.  Breakfast is  a buffet, however food was cold,  specially the sausage.  If buffet is open at 7, food should be hot.  To top it off, 1 reason we book this hotel is the view from the rooftop .. we were not allowed because pool section is closed.  Very disappointed at 5 star rating..last 2 hotel we stayed with 5 star ratings was four season in vail and Ritz Carlton in Atlanta.  Very disappointed at Hilton Morino!

We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. Your comments will of course be forwarded to the relevant management for their attention. May I take this opportunity to confirm that information on the seasonal opening of our pool is available in our website, where it is specified that opening is seasonal, from mid May to September. We are sorry if you were expecting the pool to be open, however we confirm with pleasure hat the Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day of the year (from 5 PM until after midnight) and our Guests can still enjoy a unique and spectacular view over the city of Venice and its lagoon. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
