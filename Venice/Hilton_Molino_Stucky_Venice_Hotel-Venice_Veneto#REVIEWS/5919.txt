The hotel is on a diffrent island ( giudecca) about 10 minutes boat ride (the hotel provides a free shutle service). The hotel is big and complicated you will get lost unless givven a map. Beeing a Gold VIP we recived a two room suite . The service and the food where execlent.  I would recommend as a romatic gateaway.Read moreDate of stay: February 2008HelpfulShare
