The location is very good, the roof garden has a great view to Venice. The bar however needs renovation, better music and also a menu that can accompany the drinks and the coffee.

It should be organised better.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 26, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your comments on our Skyline Bar, where we are pleased to welcome  also outside Guests who can enjoy a great offer of drinks while taking pleasure of the fantastic Venice and lagoon views.
