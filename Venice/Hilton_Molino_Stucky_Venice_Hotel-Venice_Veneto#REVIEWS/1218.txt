We followed the suggestion of other families and booked the Hilton for 2 nights on our trip to Venice.  Strongly suggest this hotel for any family with kids! Rooftop pool was key for taking a break from the summer heat.  Staff was wonderful.  Private water taxi to/from the main square of Venice allowed you to leave the mass of tourists and get a break and relax at the hotel.  Rooms were large for Venice. We had upgraded to Executive level, so having access to the Executive lounge was great for breakfast and evening snacks.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
