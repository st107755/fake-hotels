A flour mill has been restored and converted to an extremely beautiful, luxurious hotel. The charm of the flour mill has been completely maintained and can be seen in the details. The entire vibe of this hotel in boutique-y which is a good thing considering the big size of the hotel.  A little far from the main crowded Venice centre yet very convenient to travel forth and back on the complimentary and frequently run water taxi.  One of the best breakfast buffet ever.  I would definitely repeat the Hilton Molino Stucky if I travel to Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel.
