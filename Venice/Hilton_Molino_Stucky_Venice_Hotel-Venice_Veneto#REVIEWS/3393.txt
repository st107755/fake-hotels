Stayed here for a week in September (when George Clooney was getting married). Fantastic hotel, beautifully converted from an old flour mill, with rooftop pool and bar giving stunning views over Venice. Away from the bustle of Venice on Giudecca island but connected by free shuttle boat to San Marco. A boat cruise everyday!! Room was fantastic and no sounds from other guests apart from slight background noise from pool party, but that did disturb us in any way. For a large hotel, the staff were very efficient and friendly, especially the bell hops. Even considering this is a 5 star hotel it was very expensive for food and drink. 30 euro for breakfast each! But it didn't spoil things as there are lots of local restaurants and cafes close at hand. All in all a wonderful experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear  Sir,  We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we thank you for taking the time to leave your review.
