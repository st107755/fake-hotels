Abysmal service. 3 different waiters said they would return to take order and never returned. Spent 20 minutes trying to catch the attention of staff to busy cleaning tables, 3rd attempt to order drinks from a dirty table. Waited another 20 minutes for 3 cocktails. Cocktails were utterly basic, crushed ice and a garnish. €49 Euro for the 3.   Save you money, 5 mins walk down from Hilton ate lovely Italian bars sitting on the water. €12 euros for 3 Spritz, a lovely welcome and pleasant staff.   That was my second trip to Venice Hilton in  3 years. Will not return.
