This is one of the nicer hotels in Venice and mostly because it isn't on the main island itself. The nice hotels in Venice and kind of gross and old. Plus you would need to walk around the extremely busy streets of Venice with your suitcase to even get around. Super inconvenient. The Hilton is just wonderful. The boat stop is directly in front of the hotel. The rooms are renovated, spacious, clean, comfortable. The rooftop pool has spectacular views. The breakfast at the hotel is very good with lots of options and the restaurants and in room dining and great too. There is a Hilton shuttle that takes you to the main island every 40 minutes. It is 5 minutes away, literally across the canal. I am glad I stayed here and not on the main island.  Worth every penny!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 18, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
