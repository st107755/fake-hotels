Stylish hotel with expectant Hilton service. Can feel like a conference facility at times (don't they all?) but amazing building and nice environment. Rooftop pool can get busy but has amazing views and is a great place for a late afternoon siesta and drink. Very adult orientated though.  Likewise bar and restaurants on top floor. Cool place for cool people.  Really enjoyed being on the other side of island from main Venice island. Great to retreat to calmness at end of each day - don't be put off by this as water taxi's and buses are plentiful and easy to get around on.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
