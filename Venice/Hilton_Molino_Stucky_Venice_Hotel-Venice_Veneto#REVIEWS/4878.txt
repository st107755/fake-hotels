My husband and I have just returned from a holiday to Venice and Lake Garda.  We chose the Hilton Molino Stucky because the rooftop pool looked gorgeous and we thought it would be a refreshing break after spending a day exploring Venice.  We also like the fact it wasn't on the Grand Canal since a lot of reviews said that it could be very noisy, and we were looking for a nice balance between relaxation, but plenty to see and do if we wanted. We indulged in a private water taxi from Venice Marco Polo airport to the hotel which was arranged by the hotel's concierge.  We would highly recommend taking a private water taxi.  It started off our Venice experience beautifully.  Although, you can take a bus from the airport to the train station for about 7 euros.  It takes 20 minutes.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting a detailed review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
