I checked in to this hotel for a one night stay. Check in was efficient and friendly but I was also told the pool would close at 4pm due a special event. Not much help if you are checking in late afternoon! This was then compounded the next morning. As a Hilton Honours Dimond member I was expecting a late check out so I could use the pool. The front desk said they were busy but she would check with her supervisor. Half an hour later she rang to say no because they were busy.! Not what I expect. Very poor. Generally service was slow and not up to what I would expect in London or New York. The room was lovely though as was the location.
