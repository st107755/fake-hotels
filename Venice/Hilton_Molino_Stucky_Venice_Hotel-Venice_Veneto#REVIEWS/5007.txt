We arrived by public transportation to the Guidecca island using the Vaperreto line 2 and walked to the hotel without any problems. The hotel provided boat transportation every 15 to 30 minutes to the main island and it runs from early morning to 1am. Hotel staff was friendly and we were upgraded to a suite. The room was spacious, well maintained and clean. The bed was a full king size bed (not like the other hotels we stayed in Italy where 2 doubles were made into a king) and it was amazingly comfortable. We had the best sleep here during our trip. The executive lounge was well staffed and the breakfast was excellent in the executive lounge. The hotel has a stunning view of the city from the rooftop pool and the rooftop bar. We had a perfect stay at the hotel and we can't waitâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
