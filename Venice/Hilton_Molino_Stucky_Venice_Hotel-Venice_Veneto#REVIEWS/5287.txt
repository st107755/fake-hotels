We were a bit on the fence about booking this hotel as it was on across the way from the main part of Venice, but ended up being a great hotel. The boat shuttle was perfect as it was easily accessible and right on time. From airport took the city boat service which was a lot less expensive but took a lot longer then a water taxi, so if you have the extra money to spend the water taxi is your best best to and from Airport.  Room was great.... staff was super friendly and the lounge breakfast and dinner was great if you have status.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 11, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
