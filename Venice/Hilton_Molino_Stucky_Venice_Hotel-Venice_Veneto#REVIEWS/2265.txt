On the other hand I am sorry that you have found prices at our bar to be expensive, though I would like to assure you that they are in line with other 5-star hotels in Venice. May I take this opportunity to confirm that the Rooftop Pool is indeed open on a seasonal basis (usually from aprox. mid May to aprox. mid September), however the Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day of the year (from 5 PM until after midnight) and our Guests can enjoy a unique and spectacular view over the city of Venice and its lagoon. We acknowledge and appreciate your comments and criticism as they will help us to improve the quality of the service and we look forward to welcoming you and your family again in the future. With kind regards,  Ilio Rosoni General ManagerRead more
