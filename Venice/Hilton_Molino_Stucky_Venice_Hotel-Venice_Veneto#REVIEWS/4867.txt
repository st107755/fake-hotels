If you are in Venice Italy and want a nice getaway this is it! We were able to get a suite with a water view! The breakfast was fantastic, plenty to choose from. You do have to catch a boat to go across from the mainland so don't get there late in the evening. Our plane was late so we had to get a water taxi which can be expensive. We did not explore the island the hotel is on which we regret but there is so much to see and do on the mainland of Venice. We had dinner at the resturant which was very over priced for what you got.
