we booked this hotel, because of the pool, but unfortunately the pool was extremely cold and no one was able to use it. Therefore, we though to use the indoor Jacuzzi and spa. But  they did not let children under 16 in the Jacuzzi. So we totally lost the chance of using it. We had access to the lounge, which makes it good to grab a drink whenever you want, but the food at the lounge was not very good and also very limited. So we ended up only drinking a beer/tea  at the evening and not even touching the snacks. Also at breakfast, we found it very unorganized...we ordered egg Benedict, it took 30 minutes till we got our egg which was not even yummy and fresh. was very cold and dry. the same to any other request...always took long.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 4, 2016Dear Sir/Madame, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
