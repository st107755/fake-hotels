My wife and I have just returned from staying here for four nights.We were here for my wife's 65th birthday treat she knew nothing about it until we got to Gatwick airport. I had requested that if possible could the hotel do something special as a birthday treat I was hoping for perhaps a cake or flowers. But to our great suprise they upgraded us to a suite complete with a cake and a bottle of prossecco and membership of the excecutive club for the duration of our stay..The hotel ran it's own 40 seater boat frequently across to Dorsoduro  or St Marks so no problems there the staff were charming the choice at breakfast amazing .The older hotels are lovely but this recently converted flour mill was beautifully done with all mod cons and loads of comfortable places to sit afterâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2013Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your positive stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky and thank you for choosing our hotel for such a  special occasion.
