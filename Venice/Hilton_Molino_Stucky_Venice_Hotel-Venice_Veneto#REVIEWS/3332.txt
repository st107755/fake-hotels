Big hotel, with all that you would expect from a large, chain hotel.  Rooms are marble etc, although a little tired in places.  The service was faultless though - really friendly staff.  Wonderful views across the water back to the main parts of Venice - the only down side is that you have to catch a boat to go anywhere - not much happening on this side.  That has its benefits I guess - as it avoids the throngs and the noise of more central hotels.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 18, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your comments about the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for sharing your experience.
