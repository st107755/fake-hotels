Technically a 5 star hotel, but the stars also set my expectations to services and functionality high. The pool and bar at the hotel roof were excellent. Breakfast was definitely on the positive side. In addition to lack of the little extra, there were some negatives: The staff was friendly, but slipped on responding to request and gave some misleading information.  The gym did not open before 9 AM, and some of the equipment was out of order.  Mobile coverage in the building was varying and in our room absent.  We did not visit the spa.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 5, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
