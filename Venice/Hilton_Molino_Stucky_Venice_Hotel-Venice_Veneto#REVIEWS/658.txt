After touring much of Italy over the past few years, we finally made it to Venice...and we were not overly impressed. We did enjoy the hotel, nice views, great rooftop pool, but nothing compared to the service we received at the Park Hyatt Milan or the Westin in Florence...we actually had a nice bottle of champagne delivered to our room, only to find out it was delivered to the wrong room. The person came back apologetic and brought us a cheaper bottle of red wine (which was nice). We ate at the restaurant and waited a very long time for less than memorable food.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 23, 2018Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.
