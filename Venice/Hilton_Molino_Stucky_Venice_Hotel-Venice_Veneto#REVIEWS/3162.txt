My husband and I stayed here last fall on a trip to Italy. I was originally hesitant about staying at a hotel chain in Venice, but we loved it!  The hotel was beautiful, rooms were clean and updated and our bathroom was huge. We also loved the island of Guidecca and were happy to be away from the craziness of mainland Venice. There were several restaurants in walking distance and I recommend taking advantage of the local markets during early weekday mornings.  The free hilton water shuttle is also convenient and there are other docks nearby if you need get to a location it doesn't service. The rooftop pool was great and had amazing views. Definitely recommend and hope to stay here in the future if I'm ever in Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 12, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
