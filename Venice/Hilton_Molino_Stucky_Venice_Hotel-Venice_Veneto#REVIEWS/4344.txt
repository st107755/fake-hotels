An excellent modern hotel in a great romantic setting, in a restored 19th century flour mill. Really beautiful decorations. Great 8th floor pool, (although small) with an unbeatable view of venice. Only negatives are the (free) shuttle boat to venice which adds time and some complexity to touring, and breakfast which was not included in our package and ended up being 30 euro per person. Obviously we ate elsewhere, although I guess this is not too much by venice hotel standards. In general anything extra was priced too high.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing with us your positive comments about your recent stay at the  Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
