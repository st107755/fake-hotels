location not convenient to visit main Venice island. Area does not offer much to visit/do. Hotel is good, but not worth the cost. Reception chief behaves like ''we are hilton. Customer should not ask anything more!''. Other staff is OK. Lobby is excellent as it should be. Wide and relaxing atmosphere. View from the roof is excellent too.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting a review on TripAdvisor and for and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations. We also acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our Guests and please accept our apologies if a member of our Team was not up to the level of care and service expected at a Hilton property as this should never happen. We regret that you did not like our location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects.

We thank you for staying with us and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager  Read more
