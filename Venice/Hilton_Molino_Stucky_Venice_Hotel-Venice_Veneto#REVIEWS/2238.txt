I came to celebrate my wife's birthday and we were exceptionally well looked after. The hotel is beautiful in a delightful setting away from the crowds but with easy access into the centre of Venice with a regular boat from outside the hotel. Our room was a tower suite with stunning views over the Lagoon towards Venice itself. Breakfast was excellent with good selection to suit all tastes. We used the water taxi service arranged by the hotel to travel to and from the airport which was worth every penny. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Great advice from the Concierges and Riccardo the Guest Relations Manager really made us welcome. We hope to come back one day.
