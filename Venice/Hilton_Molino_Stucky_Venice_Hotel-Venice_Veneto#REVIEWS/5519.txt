We arrived in Venice after a long trans-atlantic flight and set off on getting to the Hilton, which is no easy feat. Once getting there, our room was ready and it could not have been better. We received an upgrade for my Hilton status and the mini-suite had a sitting room, large bathroom, and separate bedroom. They shuttle you into Venice every hour, which is nice, but can be a bit inconvenient coming back since you didn't want to miss the shuttle. Water taxis are very, very expensive so missing the shuttle is costly. The hotel is away from the action and we did not eat there except for breakfast, which was very good. If you want a hotel with very nice amenities and for it to be in a quiet location, this is definitely your spot!Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
