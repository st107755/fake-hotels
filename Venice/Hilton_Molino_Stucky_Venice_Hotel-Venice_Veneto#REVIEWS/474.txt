I am a Hilton Gold member, but I have never stayed at a Hilton Hotel outside of the United States.  My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel, and it was a beautiful experience.  We had a suite facing the canal, and the views were amazing.  The service was perfect, and the shuttle service to San Marco was very helpful.  The only downside of the hotel is the distance from the main sights of Venice.  It is 20 minutes from San Marco and about 20 minutes from the train station (by water bus).  Other than the distance, this is an amazing hotel.
