This is a beautiful hotel in Giudecca. There is a boat transfer across to the main part of Venice which costa about 5 euros each per stay. The trip is lovely and very efficient. There is a good buffet breakfast at the hotel although the porridge was interesting! The bars and restaurants are overpriced but there is a pretty bar on the roof top next to a swimming pool with an amazing view of Venice. The hotel staff are great and very helpful. The concierge helped us arrange a trip and there is an excellent computer room with a printer and card machine to pay for pre-arranged outings.
