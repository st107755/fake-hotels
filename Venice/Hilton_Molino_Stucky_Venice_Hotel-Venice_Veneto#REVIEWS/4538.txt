Thank you Hilton for a wonderful stay in a beautiful room with huge bathroom and amazing views! Cruiseships passing our window. We never had to wait long for the shuttle, breakfast was excellent as always in all Hiltons, the rooftop bar made us very romantic (sunset). One of the most beautiful Hiltons I have visited.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
