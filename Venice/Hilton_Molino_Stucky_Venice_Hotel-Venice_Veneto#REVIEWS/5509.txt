This is truly the 5-Star Hotel of Venice.  Targeted for business travelers with spacious conference centers, our family thoroughly enjoyed the accommodations and marvelous breakfast buffet.  Luxurious bed and mattress!  Glorious canal view!   We were fortunate to find a deal through Priceline, so value is difficult to rate.  The lobby staff went over and beyond during a rain storm, offering umbrellas and assistance while vigilantly keeping the lobby dry.  The breakfast buffet was 5-star in its own right.  The hotel's private water taxi makes visiting Venice as easy as stepping out the front door!  The famous Il Molino restaurant is here, and though we could not dine in Venice, the same in Las Vegas (Ceasar Forum) is truly a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
