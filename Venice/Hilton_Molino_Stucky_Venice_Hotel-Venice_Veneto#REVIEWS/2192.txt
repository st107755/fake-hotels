We had a fantastic time staying here while we were in Venice. There is a regular boat that takes you across the water, makes life easy! Brilliant roof top pool, over looking all of Venice. Can be a bit windy at times but it worth it. Breakfast was great, loads to choose from.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
