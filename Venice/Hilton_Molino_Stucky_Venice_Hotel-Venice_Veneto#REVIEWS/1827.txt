The best location in the city, away from the masses but just a hotel shuttle boat away from the main square. The hotel is just perfect if you want to relax or see the sights. Such a pleasure.  The rooms are comfortable and large there is a selection of restaurants and bars and breakfast is very good indeed (especially the coffee) The rooftop pool alone would make you want to stay here as well as the fact that all room are air conditioned and new.
