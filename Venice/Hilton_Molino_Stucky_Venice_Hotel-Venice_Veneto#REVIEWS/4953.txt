Just back from a long weekend at this fantastic hotel, the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Rooms large, clean and beds very comfortable. Lovely fresh food at breakfast and the skyline bar boasts fantastic views of Venice. Definitely the place to stay away from the hustle and bustle after a day's sightseeing. Would love to return one dayRead moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
