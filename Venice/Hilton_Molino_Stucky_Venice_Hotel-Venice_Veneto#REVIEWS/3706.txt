What an amazing hotel. Great location with complimentary shuttle to Venice which is across the canal.So you get to stay close in but still away from the madness and crowds. We had paid for breakfast in our package but overslept and missed it. They accommodated us and gave us a bread basket and juice etc, which was very courteous of them. we also had to pick up our car rental from the city and realized that the rental office closes in 30 mins. The gentleman at the reception arranged a water taxi for us within minutes and we were on our way. Loved the Hotel and service and would highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
