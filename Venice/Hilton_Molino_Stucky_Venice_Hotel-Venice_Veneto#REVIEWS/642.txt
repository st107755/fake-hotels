Hotel is just across the water from the city of Venice and is absolutely stunning. The hotel has everything you could imagine or wish for and even has a specialist at reception 24hours who Can book you amazing restaurants or find you anything you need to know.  The food and drinks in the hotel are EXPENSIVE but well worth it.  The pool on the roof is amazing and gives you a clear 360 degree view of Venice.  The hotel has its own shuttle bus service that takes u into Venice which runs up until midnight. It is 7.50 euros per person but lasts for the duration of your stay.  They have a fantastic Nutella bar inside the hotel which is DELICIOUS!   Would HIGHLY recommend. Absolutely worth every penny!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this nice review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
