My husband and I stayed in this beautiful hotel while on our 30th anniversary trip.  The staff was very welcoming and helpful in every way. We had a room with a lovely view of the canal. My husband is Hilton Diamond Status so we enjoyed the executive lounge daily.  The shuttle was quite easy to use also.  When we return to Venice we will stay at this Hilton again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
