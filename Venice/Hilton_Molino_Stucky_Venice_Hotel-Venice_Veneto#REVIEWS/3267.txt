For the money, this hotel was not worth it. It's has very nice rooms. The rooftop pool with it's view of Venice was beautiful. There are good local restaurants as well. The big downside of the location is that you have to take a shuttle from the hotel to the main part of Venice. They need to run more during the evening and peak times. We waited a long time to return with other guests who were not pleased with the lack of service. The hotel isn't managed to the standards of a Hilton. While we were there fire alarms were going off in one of the buildings and the staff were unaware at the main desk until we informed them. The concierge was very good at the hotel.

We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity while staying in a quiet and relaxing residential area. As regards our complimentary shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, may I take this opportunity to inform you that ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12'. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
