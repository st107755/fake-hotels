The hotel & grounds are Beautiful! The Hotel has an amazing view of Venice,you're right across from Venice,but this great little area has water taxi's leaving the hotel every 30 min.Check the schedule,It can change.   Breakfast is wonderful, And the fresh squeezed Orange juice,my BF can't stop talking about!  Room was also a 10!! Beds were great! Such a beautiful building & the pools on top,only problem was it was in repair when we stayed.They gave us a complimentary breakfast for the problem.
