Hotel is situated on Giudecca but is offering a water shuttle to St Marks square. From the hotel you have great views over Venice and top notch service. Rooms have all you need and there is a variety of restaurants on site including the Skyline bar with nice views. 2 nearby waterbus stops (3 min walk) are also easy to reach and use. To get from the airport we used bus 5 and waterbus 4.1 which only took 50 minutes instead of the waterbus taking approx 1 hour and 40 minutes.  Tip! is to buy a day or multi day pass for the water busses but which are also valid on the airport bus line 5, so got you all covered. (not on the waterbus from and to the airport which costs 16,- p.p. single way) highly recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
