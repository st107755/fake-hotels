On a recent trip to Venice, my wife and I were unable to reserve a room near St. Mark's. I was able to get a room at the Molino Stucky Hotel across the channel in the Giudecca District, and was greatly surprised at this Hilton affiliate hotel. From a convenient (free) shuttle provided by the hotel, to a very first class, attentive staff, our stay was very enjoyable. Stricken with a flu virus, my wife and I spent more time within the hotel than we would have normally, and enjoyed every minute.  Good food at the restaurants, and a fabulous roof-top bar/lounge helped to contribute to our expanding waistlines. Ended up canceling a reservation in another city to stay on at Molino Stucky for an additional few days. We can't wait to return and enjoy this level of hospitality again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
