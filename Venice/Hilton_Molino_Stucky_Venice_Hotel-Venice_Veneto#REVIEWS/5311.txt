The Hilton is a fabulous hotel with large rooms and a beautiful view.  Teh breakfast buffett was the largest we had on our entire trip.  I just wish the hotel was in a different location.  The is nothing right around the hotel so you need to plan you day and meals.  There is a boat that takes you to different stops but I think I would have enjoyed the convenience of just wandering around venice more freely.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
