Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend.   Room couldnt be better, clean and very spacious.   Evening meal wasnt cheap, but the food was excellent, as was the service. Breakfast was great - a buffet (as are most hotels these days).  Hotel provides a courtesy shuttle service to Zattere & St Marks Square.   Always on time, never any problems. Only problem was that although this is a non-smoking hotel there was a guest in the next room who did not follow this rule.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
