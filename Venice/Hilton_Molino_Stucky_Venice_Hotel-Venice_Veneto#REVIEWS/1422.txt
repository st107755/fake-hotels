Expensive, Wants extra cash for every little thing. You shouldn't have to pay for WiFi anywhere anymore. The mini bar is way overpriced, I got beer, water, and snacks at a little grocery store a few hundred feet away for 1 third what the mini bar charges were. The bath gel/shampoo are sized for a single person use, so bring your own. The room was hot, we were told the air doesn't come on till May.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2017Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel. You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton and we appreciate being advised of any breach in the usual service for which our hotel is noted. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism regarding the bathroom amenities and I would like also to take this opportunity to confirm that our property follows the Hilton International standards. Complimentary internet is therefore available for all guests in the public areas and for Hilton Honors members also in the room while non members can chose in between two different offers. May I suggest that you enroll to our Hilton Honors program on your next stay in a Hilton property in order to get free internet access also in your room. We acknowledge your comments on prices, though I can also assure you that prices of food and beverage in our bars and restaurants are in line with other 5-stars hotels in Venice. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
