We are pleased to hear that you appreciated the room upgrade and benefits that you have received as a HHonors Diamond member and that you enjoyed your accommodation. It was very kind of you to praise our Front Desk and Housekeeping Team Members and I will share your kind words with them all. On the other hand I am sorry if your stay with us has not been up to your expectations and we acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our Guests. May I take this opportunity to inform you that we do offer fresh orange juice at our Molino breakfast restaurant, maybe colleagues were just replenishing the machine with new oranges right when you were looking for it and I am sorry you could not enjoy your breakfast experience completely. We place great value on your opinion and we hope to welcome you with us again in the near future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
