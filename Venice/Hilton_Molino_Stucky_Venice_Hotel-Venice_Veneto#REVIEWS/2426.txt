My husband and I stayed at this hotel over new year and had the most wonderful time. The hotel itself is magnificent and the staff are extremely helpful, nothing is too much trouble. We were greeted at reception by Alessia who was very helpful and made us feel extremely welcome. The bar area was large but very cosy. We upgraded to the executive lounge which included unlimited tea, coffee, soft drinks and water throughout the day and then wine, bear and snacks between 5pm-7pm which was well worth it as it was very comfortable to sit and relax after walking around Venice all day. A special thank you to Vincenizo and the bar staff dor making our stay extra special.  The service we received was second to non. We ahve booked again for August as we were so impressed.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 8, 2016Dear  Madame, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience on TripAdvisor.
