I was really pleased to have such a comfort here in Venuce! The hotel is in Giudecca island, 20 minutes on the waterbus- vaporetto - from Train station. The hotel provides shuttle water buses to the main island and all the sights of Venice! You can also enjoy great roof bar Molino hotel. The rooms were clean and tidy, all the check in and out procedures were in time and easy. Cannot say anything for the people price as I used my Hilton points. But in general I would recommend to stay here for everyone who likes comfort as well as amazing city out of the window!Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 30, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
