Nice hotel with large rooms (and plenty of them) with good breakfast and a beautiful roof top pool and bar with excellent view of Venice. Unfortunately it was a big corporate event going on during our visit so the service seemed to be focussed on them only. Even though being a HHonours member I would probably stay somewhere else if going back. There is a complimentary shuttle boat to St Marcus square but would prefer to stay more centrally though since one anyway spend the evenings in the city centre.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comments.
