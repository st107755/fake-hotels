Decided to pop into the Skyline bar at the Molino Stucky hotel in Venice for well deserved cocktails - took the number 2 vaporetto and walked (through a not so nice part of town it must be said) to get to the hotel, then up to the top floor roof terrace.  One side of the bar was closed for a private function (the S.Marco facing side!), but our view on the other side was nice too, looking over the lagoon to the south west from the port round towards Lido. Good cocktails, not cheap but worth the extra for the views.  There is a champagne bar up some steps from the bar where you can lounge by the rooftop pool drinking Moet, although I suspect you need to be a resident to enjoy the pool.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
