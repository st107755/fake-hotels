We had stayed here 2 years ago before a transatlantic cruise and had a wonderful time. So we definitely wanted to return. Check in was easy and we were given a room overlooking the Giudecca Canal. What a great view! The hotel itself is richly appointed. As gold Hilton members we had a filling breakfast in the executive lounge every morning and a wonderful Happy Hour every afternoon with beer and wine. Service was excellent and friendly. Our room was well equipped and the bed very comfortable. No problem sleeping. We used the spa and hydra pool one evening after a long walking day. Wonderful. Wonderful. Ordered room service one evening. Prompt and good food. Love the free taxi service to St. Marks.  WOULD DEFINTELY RETURN.  If we return to Venice, will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for choosing again the Molino Stucky Hilton for your stay in Venice.
