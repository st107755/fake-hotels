We stayed at this beautiful property for 4 days so no pressure for us on the commute.  It is away from all attractions, which we like but it could be a hike if you have limited time to explore Venice. We knew about the hotel shuttle service, but we ended up getting our 3 day passes on water bus service. The stop is Palanca which is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Stick with Line 2, 4.1 and 4.2 , you will be able to get around anywhere on your own schedule. (Water bus has 24 hrs service and it is more frequent than the hotel shuttle.)   Room is good - Hilton standard.  We were on the 4th floor and it was facing the water.  I am a gold member, so no charge on wifi in our room. The staff at Business Center was very helpful and nice as well as the staffs at the front desk. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting an exhaustive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky. I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you mentioned some positive impressions during your stay. On the other hand I am very sorry with regards to your experience with the on-board staff, there is no excuse to the rudeness of the shuttle driver and I have personally addressed this to the management of the company as this service is contracted to a local major operator.  Feedback is always important as it is a vital way of reviewing the level of service and facilities we provide our guests so as to make improvement. Thank you for being our guest and I look forward to welcoming you back to the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
