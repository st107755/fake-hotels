This hotel is a great place to stay while visiting Venice.  While it's location is a bit away from all the "attractions", the free shuttle boat allows you quick access - and then when you are done touring, you can get away from it all.  The rooftop pool is a great amenity.  Lots of options on the breakfast buffet.  Room was very clean, bed was ultra comfortable, staff were very helpful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
