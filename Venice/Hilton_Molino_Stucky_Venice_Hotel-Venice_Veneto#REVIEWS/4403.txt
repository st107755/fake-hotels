Enjoyed a 5 day break in Venice and stayed at the Stucky. Not easy to find as its on the opposite side of he lagoon, but it is first class. Very romantic, ultra modern add ons but very traditional decor. It is expensive to stay, we paid â‚¬400 a night b&b and room service and drinks were very expensive, but excellent. Breakfast was wonderful and fresh and all round it's fabulous, not far away from action, but far enough to be private and quiet.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
