Stayed at this gem of a hotel for 3 days - one of the best Hilton properties I've been to. Was given the privilege upgrade for being Hhnonors Diamond member to an exec room with a view (breathtaking view!) Hotel location is ideal for exploring Venice, shuttle service is available to the main island. Being located away from the main touristy areas gives us access to local restaurants where food is much more affordable.  Food and beverages in the exec lounge can be improved but I didn't find that to be a big deal... Service was impeccable! Kudos to the entire team.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback, it is a pleasure to know that you found our property to be one of the best you have visited so far.
