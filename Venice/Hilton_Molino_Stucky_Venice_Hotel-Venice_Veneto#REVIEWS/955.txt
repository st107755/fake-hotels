We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. The Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the crowded city centre and it is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in town. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
