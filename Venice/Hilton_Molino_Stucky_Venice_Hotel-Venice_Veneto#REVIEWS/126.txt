Upon arrival the hotel is only accessible by boat (which is not usual for Venice) The stop at the bus station requires many stairs up and down to a specific boat.  We hired a lovely man to take our luggage so that was easy and he knew where to take us.  The hotel is old and dirty.  Like hallways are a not vacuumed and carpet was dirty in the room. The island closes early and wish you luck finding the spot to take you back to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2019Dear Madame, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
