It was nice to stay in a well-appointed, familiar hotel for this leg of our trip. The view from our hotel room was amazing, views from the pool were fantastic. It was also very nice that this hotel is so easy to find, as opposed to the smaller hotels buried deep inside the city of Venice. Room was spotless, staff was wonderful. The hotel is pricey and will charge for everything. The free shuttle was incredibly convenient.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
