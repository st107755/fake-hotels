Very nice, friendly, helpful staff. We stayed here in the beginning of October and had no problem at all with the shuttle transportation (btw, the Zattare stop is a pleasant and short walk to San Marco; it also is a good location to explore other parts of Venice from). Loved the design of the hotel and the view.   Upon arrival, we had Hilton Honors upgrade to a suite waiting for us. When leaving, we had an early train to catch and a 10 minute walk will take you to the public water transportation stop - from there approximately 15 minutes to train station.  We felt that staying across the canal at the beautiful Hilton Molino Stucky added to the Venice ambience.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
