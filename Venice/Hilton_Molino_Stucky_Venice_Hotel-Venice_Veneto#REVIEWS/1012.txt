We stayed here on our first holiday as a family with our three month old girl. Everything about the hotel was perfect. The staff, the room, the facilities, the skyline bar, the restaurants, the water taxi... it was great to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice all day and come back and watch the sunset from the skyline! Would certainly stay again!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 13, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your nice review on this website.
