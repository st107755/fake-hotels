We stayed there for 4 days, while enjoyed the vacation in Venice.  It is a nice hotel, good internal decoration, excellent roof pool, large room, and very neat environment.  It may took 5 mins walk to nearest ferry stop, if you don't want to take complimentary boat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
