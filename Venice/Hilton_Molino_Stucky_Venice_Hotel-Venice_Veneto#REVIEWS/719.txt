We spent three nights at this property before taking a cruise to the Greek Islands. We were on the sixth floor. Our room was nice, quiet, clean and they did a great job making a modern room out of such an old building. WiFi works great. Found the breakfast to be too expensive (27 Euros) for the options available (same options every day, no Omelette station, the only eggs available were scrambled eggs). Convenient location to the cruise terminal taking public transportation (Alilaguna). Perfect location to take a break from the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
