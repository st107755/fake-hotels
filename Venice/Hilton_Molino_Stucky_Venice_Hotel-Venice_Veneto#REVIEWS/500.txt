We stayed with our Insight tour for two days. The building is beautiful and the staff is first rate. Our room was spacious and kept very clean. One of the best features is the boat service to St. Mark’s Square. It’s free and keeps a regular schedule. Oh and don’t forget the rooftop bar and pool. A real gem in a city of gems.
