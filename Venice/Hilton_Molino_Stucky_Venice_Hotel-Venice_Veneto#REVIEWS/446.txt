We were booked into here after our original hotel on Murano was overbooked. Staff welcoming, spacious, clean & comfortable room. The prices at bar / room service were higher than elsewhere on our trip but to be expected. Some of the aspects of hotel common areas & rooms felt a little dated, couldâ€™ve been anywhere in the world as no real references to where we were. View across to Venice is stunning though & the island is a great place for a visit.
