This is a luxurious, top-quality hotel - lights years above your typical Hilton. Superb food, excellent night club, and beautifully appointed in all respects.  The only drawback is its isolation from St. Mark's.  Must take a complimentary water shuttle or water taxi (60 Euros!) to get there.  Free shuttle is great - but holds only 39 and does not run mush past midnight.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 26, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your kind comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
