We looked long before choosing a hotel in venice, but nothing was encouraging. After considering all the choices and reviews a chain hotel was the surest and safest option. We opted for Hilton Molino, and weren't disappointed. Service very efficient and amicable, rooms big enough for european standards (we booked a canal view room, which is a must, and we're upgraded to an executive junior suite, nice gesture), acceptable room amenities ( no complimentary water but coffee and tea available), very comfy bed. The hotel has history and the art in the lobby is fascinating. Decent breakfast, paid internet in rooms and a free shuttle to the principle island that stops around midnight. All In all a good hotel ( especially when u consider the fact that u're in venice)Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
