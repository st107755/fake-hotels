Very nice hotel located in the most ideal place. Cheap shuttle boat to Venice. Friendly attentive staff. Tips are to try to book an executive room to get into the lounge. Roof top pool has no shade / parasols so you literally bake. By 10am all places to lie have gone. The in house restaurant is very nice with good food albeit expensive. The Skyline bar has good parties on Saturday nights but drinks are Â£15 each. The rooms are lovely try to book a view room in advance. A lovely stay no complaints...Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
