Loved this hotel! The service is best I have seen at any Hilton hotel. As an Australian I was concerned with the language barrier however the staff understood everything I needed and catered for all of my needs. I traveled for a one stay for work it was extremely relaxing. When you arrive at the airport it is well worth spending the 120 euros on a private water taxi as the water bus takes 1 hour and 40 minutes.
