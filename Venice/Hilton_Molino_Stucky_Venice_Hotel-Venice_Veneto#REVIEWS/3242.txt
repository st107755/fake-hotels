I stayed here for 3 nights last Summer and had a great time! It was nice to be a boat's ride away from the busy centre, and the boats came regularly and could fit many people. They also offered a free boat service to visit the Murano Glass factory, which was a nice touch.   The rooms were clean and the service good. There is even a Nutella restaurant!  We didn't spend too much time in the hotel as we were sightseeing but did spend one afternoon on the rooftop pool. There aren't too many seats but it is beautiful up there and the view is fantastic.   We did get ripped off for a sandwich when we first arrived at the hotel, so I'd avoid eating there.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 19, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
