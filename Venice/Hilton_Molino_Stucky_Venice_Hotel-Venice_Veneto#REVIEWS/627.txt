We had an executive suite overlooking the water. That was a lovely view. The rooms are very nice and large enough to lay out for morning stretches, not common in European hotels. The breakfast buffet is the best I've ever had, and that is saying something. The displays are lucious, with all the usual fare, plus many unique items: fresh juicer for carrot/ginger/apple juice, a honey comb in a rack, dripping into a bowl for you to spoon out a serving, stewed fruits in addition to all kinds of fresh fruits and the usual fresh juice dispensers. This is a refurbished pasta factory, and we enjoyed reading about the history of the establishment and seeing pictures of the founding family members. A nice education that added to our appreciation of this establishment.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 8, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
