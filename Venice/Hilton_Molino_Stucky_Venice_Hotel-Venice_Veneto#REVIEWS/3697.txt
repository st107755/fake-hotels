We stayed at the Hilton on the back end of our family cruise.  This hotel is a beautiful old flour mill that has been turned into a top of the line European hotel.  This is a typical European Hotel so my family of four needed two rooms.  This hotel is beautiful, with a roof top pool and bar with amazing views.  The Hilton includes breakfast, and a very efficient water shuttle that runs back and forth to the tourist areas of Venice.  We took a water taxi from the Disney Cruise ship to the hotel, and then from the hotel to the airport to return home.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
