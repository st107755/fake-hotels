Lovely staff, beautiful room and extravagant bathroom with bath and shower, so much more than we expected for a freebie on points. Rooftop view from pool deck was amazing, wish we had time to enjoy it further. Easy transit on water taxi/bus right to the door, and shuttle to restaurants. Divine comfy beds! Only negative was that there a large rip in our quilt cover which I only discovered when I hopped in bed and my foot got tangled in it. Surprised that housekeeping wouldn't have seen this when they made up the bed. There is also an unfortunate (kinda septic) smell in the hallway, seems to be common throughout Venice, but the room was fabulous so the positives far outweighed this.
