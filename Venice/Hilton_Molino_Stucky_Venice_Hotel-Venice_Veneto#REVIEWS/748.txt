Don't know what your budget is for staying in Venice, but you should stay here regardless. Venice is crazy busy and crowded with tourists who want to see all the beauty of the city. Stay at this Hilton and get away from that at the end of your sight seeing day. We stayed here as an extension of a Viking cruise. As others have said it feels like you are off the beaten path as this is on a more residential island of Venice. There are frequent free shuttles to/from St Mark's square. Several very good reasonably priced restaurants are within a short walk from the hotel along the canal. This was the most relaxing experience for us in Venice: watching the boat traffic in the canal while we sat outside and enjoyed an excellent meal. Very good breakfast buffet at the Hilton.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 30, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
