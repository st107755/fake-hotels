Given the reputation of Venice hotels being insanely expensive and often lacking, this stay was a pleasant surprise. The location is absolutely gorgeous. We used points but were still upgraded to a huge and beautiful corner suite which was appreciated. Did not have much time to visit the executive lounge, but the food and drinks were high quality. Breakfast was similarly impressive.   The only downsides are the isolation of being across the water from everything (not far in distance, but takes a lot of time to cross), and the pool area was closed. Even so, we were taking a cruise from the port (which turns out to be very close to here) so this didn't impact us too much.  We tried another central hotel at the end of our trip, and would return here as our favourite.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 21, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
