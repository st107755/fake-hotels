Great hotel in a converted mill away from the main mayhem of Venice. Guidecca is much more peaceful with its own waterfront restaurants.

Also has its own roof top pool and bar with stunning views.......not cheap though.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 13, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Trip Advisor.
