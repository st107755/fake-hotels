We have visited this city in December and stayed for one night at the HILTON MOLINO STUCKY... Great architecture, beautiful property next to the main canal... Good staff, very friendly people! I am a Hilton Honor Diamond member and I always travel the world but I was very impress with everything. The Nutella Crepes were very good! love it! what a nice touch! also my son enjoyed very much and my wife... We had different rooms and the Hotel is not only romantic but a good place! The shuttle boat was awesome! And the Manager's reception. I would suggest you to put more items in the Manager's reception... The rest was excellent! Will come back soon!Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
