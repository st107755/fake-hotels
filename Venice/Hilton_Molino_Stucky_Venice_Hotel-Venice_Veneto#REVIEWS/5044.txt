My wife and I stayed here last August and they upgraded us to a king suite due to our HHonors status. The hotel is absolutely beautiful! You cannot get a more picturesque setting with it being right on the water surrounded by the most famous architecture in history. They have a shuttle Vaporetto that takes you from their dock at the hotel to their dock at the Piazza San Marco Square. The shuttle leaves very often and is free to Hotel guests. Make sure to check out the pool on the roof top - the view is outstanding! If you get in late at night, they serve food in the bar area until after 10pm. What a great place!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for such positive comments !.
