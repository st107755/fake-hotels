The location of this hotel is great and the views are incredible from outside the lobby. The hotel is located on an island across from Venice. They have a boat shuttle that drops you off at 2 locations in Venice which is very convenient given how expensive water taxis are in Venice. The hotel is quiet and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious.  I had stayed in a smaller hotel for the first part of the trip and moved to this hotel after a conference got over and rooms were available. I would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments.
