We really enjoyed our time at this hotel. We had been a little reluctant to stay here since it wasnâ€™t on the main island, however Hilton provided a boat shuttle back and forth all day long. They charged a small price per person, and you could come and go as much as you want. This was a great service, and very helpful. They pick you up right outside of the hotel.  The rooftop pool has an amazing view overlooking Venice. I would highly recommend this hotel.
