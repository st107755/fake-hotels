Disappointing. The concierge was helpful, but other than that, we were very disappointed. At 350 USD/ night there wasn't even wifi in the room. The shuttle boat service was unreliable - 40 minutes late (we had to stand in the hot sun) and they then changed their route and wouldn't take us to San Marco as they'd said when we got on the boat (presumably because they were running behind schedule). We apparently were lucky - they didn't have room for everyone, so the other people had to wait another hour in the sun.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 3, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we did not meet all your expectations. I do regret that you did not find our complimentary shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs, however we can offer a guaranteed maximum number of seats and we are sorry that during your stay you were experiencing some difficulties in finding available space. In some circumstances, as an alternative, we are pleased to offer tickets for ACTV public transportation. The stop is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and a regular service connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. Although you express some disappointment, I do hope that should your plans bring you back this way, you will give us another chance to serve you.   Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
