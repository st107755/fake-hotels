We booked in to the Hilton for last 2 nights of 6 in Venice Situated in La Giudecca, once a flour mill, this huge building is now a luxury hotel Our room overlooking Venice was perfect, large and very comfortable  The hotel has a rooftop pool and terrace, plus a cocktail bar with terraces both sides, so you can choose your view ! The executive lounge served breakfast until 10, then snacks and drinks until 9pm It even had ‚Äòhappy hour‚Äô 5-7pm where you could mix your own Aperol spritzer, or drink wine/beer at your leisure  Superb hotel with shuttle boat to San Marco for 8:50‚Ç¨ for the duration of your stay üëçRead moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 23, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on TripAdvisor.
