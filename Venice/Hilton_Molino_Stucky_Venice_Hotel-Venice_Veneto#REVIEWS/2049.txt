It is nice to read that you enjoyed the location on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, only a 12 minutes boat ride from the main crowded city centre which is especially treasured by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the safety of our guest is our first priority and I would like also to reassure you about the safety of our pool area.
