3rd time staying here. Hotel has always been great. My only complaint had been the re-location of the executive lounge from the 6thn floor to ground level with no privacy at all. They have done a good job improving that problem. Now if you can get into the lounge there will no longer be any hard alcohol..only beer and wine..5 to 7 rather than 6 to 8. Would like to single out Gloria who helped out in check in.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
