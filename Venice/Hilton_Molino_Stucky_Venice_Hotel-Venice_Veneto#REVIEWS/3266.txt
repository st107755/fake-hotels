We spent 5 nights here over Christmas and couldn't have been happier with our choice of hotel. It was our fourth visit to Venice and the first time we've stayed on Giudecca, which we loved. There are some lovely cafe/ restaurants and bakeries along the waterfront from the hotel where we went each day for breakfast and for a couple of evening meals. Our room had a view over the canal to Zattere and it was spacious, clean and comfortable. The free hotel shuttle bus to Zattere and St Marks was great and ran every hour - can't believe people are moaning about it in their reviews! We would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
