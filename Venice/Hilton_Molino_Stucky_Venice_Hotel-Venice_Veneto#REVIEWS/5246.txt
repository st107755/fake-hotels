In Venice even the crap hotels get a star just for being in Venice it seems. You will notice scummy hotels carrying four star ratings. This hotel wasn't an exception. Overall throughout the world dont expect much cleanliness in Hilton Hotels. The carpets were dirty and I haven't been to a five star hotel, junior suite without a shower before. They didn't have a turndown service, no complementary water in the rooms and the food is astronomically expensive (€18 for a sandwich and €8 a coke). The hotel is on its own island so getting around is an issue.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we didn't meet your expectations.
