We're in the hilton for three nights. Good points  Room was spacious great bed   The roof top bar is great. Prices are a bit steep but typical hotel prices really  The staff were all very friendly and helpful  I enjoyed the boat to go to St marks square. There was no queue and we got on straight away.

We are very pleased to see that  you had a great stay and enjoyed our boat service, rooftop bar, breakfast and all our staff.  We are sorry if you felt your room was hot; at the moment the temperature in Venice is still quite low (it was very cold over the past weekend), so we still have the heating on. Thank you for your feedback about the Murano tour, I will share it with the Concierge team.  We hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to our hotel   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
