This was just as nice as it was shown on the website.  They have continuous complimentary water shuttles to the main tourist destination (St Mark's Square), which worked great.  A couple of words of caution.  First, when you take the vaporetto (water shuttle) to the hotel from the train station, they may advise you that there are two stops on the island where the Hilton is.  While this is correct, the stop that has the longer name is FAR further away than the one with the short name.  I can't remember the names, but I do know that one was right in front of the hotel and the other was about a mile walk away, which was no fun with luggage.

May I confirm that the suggested stop for guests who reach the hotel with public transportation is “Palanca”, which is approximately 10 minutes walk away from the hotel door. Please also consider that there are two bridges to go through, which may be uncomfortable with heavy luggage, whereas water taxis will drop you off directly outside the hotel entrance. For updated and complete details on transportation options, I invite guests to check the hotel website at the transportation menu. In regard to internet, to improve guest satisfaction Hilton Hotels constantly review their pricing policies. With this in mind, complimentary internet will be introduced at the beginning of 2013 in the public areas of all Hilton hotels. Kind regards, Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
