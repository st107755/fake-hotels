Just returned from Venice,  after 3 wonderful days.  This hotel is class, class,class From the check in desk to the maids it is just perfect.  Staff are the best I've ever encountered.  Nothing is to much trouble.  We used the hotel shuttle boat to go over to the sights, 7 euros for 3 days each, regular as clockwork, time tables on check in desk. When you've  finished exploring the beautiful venice, this hotel is a sanctuary.  Food very expensive and drinks, but the quality is top notch, and of course the service.  Two spas, pool (seasonal), restaurant, bar it's got everything you desire!  rooms beautiful, fabulous beds!!!  Just book and enjoy this luxurious hotel, it's a gem!Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 9, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
