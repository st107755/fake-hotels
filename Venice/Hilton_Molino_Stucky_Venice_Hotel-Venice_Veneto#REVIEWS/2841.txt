We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. Please accept our apologies for the issues you have experienced, we will definetely improve our training programs.  May I take this opportunity to confirm you that the safety and security of our guest is our most important priority and I would like also to reassure you about the safety of our pool area. I am glad to inform you that we have no recent record of any guest falling and hitting her head and I would obviously had been informed. This said, a lifeguard as well as first aid trained team members are always present upon pool opening hours.

Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
