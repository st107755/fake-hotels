Pros: - Gorgeous hotel with beautiful views of the channel. - Very comfortable bedding and full amenities. - Restaurant on site, but average quality food. - Spa is nice, includes hot tub, sauna and relaxation area. - We had a view of the channel, so we would watch the traffic during the day and night.  Cons: - You had to take a water taxi (hotel provided) to get from the hotel to the main part of the island.  It runs frequent. - It has the feel of a business hotel and there are mostly Americans.   - Nothing is really around the hotel.  We tried getting dinner one night by the hotel around 9PM and the restaurants nearby where closing down.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
