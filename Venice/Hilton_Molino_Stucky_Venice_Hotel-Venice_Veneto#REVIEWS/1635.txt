Fantastic location right on the grand canal.  The shuttle service to San Marco is a huge plus.  Saved 8 euro per trip across the canal! Beautiful rooms, and an excellent staff. Wish the rooftop pool area has been open despite the pool being closed for the season.  It would have been a fantastic place to view the city from.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 9, 2016Dear Guest Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  We were delighted to see that our services met with your approval and that you enjoyed your stay with us. We are sorry if you were expecting the pool to be open, however winters are rather cold in Venice with freezing temperatures. For this reason, while our Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day throughout the year as of 5 pm, the pool area opens in the later Spring.  Thank you for being or Guest and for your feedback which is a fundamental source to evaluate our efficiency and determine areas of improvement in service.  We look forward to welcoming you with us again in the near future, maybe during the warm season in order to enjoy our famous rooftop pool as well.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
