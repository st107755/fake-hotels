This hotel is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to enjoy Venice without constantly fighting the crowds.  It is located on the Island of Giudecca which is a rod the Grand Canal from the main Venice island.  They provide a shuttle service to San Marco Plaza which costs 7.5 Euros/person per stay which is much cheaper than the public water buses.  It has a great rooftop pool with magnificent views of the city.  There is also a bar which was awesome for a nightcap.  The fitness center is open 24 hrs and has lots of equipment.  I would recommend walking the hotel grounds and Giudecca which is very charming.
