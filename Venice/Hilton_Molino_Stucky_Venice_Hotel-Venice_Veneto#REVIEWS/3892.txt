Stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel is grand and it's location offers panoramic views of the city. There is a free boat shuttle to San Marco, which was delightful and much appreciated. The room was small, but it had a great view over the canal. No bathrobes or slippers were provided (typically included in a 5-star hotel), but when we called to ask for them, they were delivered right away. The breakfast was good, though a bit overpriced, as was the appetizer we had at the lobby one day. I would have rated the experience as absolutely excellent, were it not for the fact that the hotel charges an outrageous price for wifi in the rooms. Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
