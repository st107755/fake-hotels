The hotel is nice and has good services such as the shuttle to the square. but there was a point that disappointed me as me travelling and reaching to my destination apparently the hotel does not provide water unless you're a member of the Hilton family... that was sad in my opinion I've been to so many Hiltons around the world and nothing like this ever happened.. overall nice but I feel for a Hilton it can do much better in terms of rooms decoration space is perfect. & the safe box was not working so we had to wait for the engineer to come and fix the issue. It annoyed me that this had happened where it is a must for the hotel/room service to check each and everything before the guest is in the room.Read moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website, we are sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at the hotel.
