We choose to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the Hilton Molino Stucky and are truly grateful we made this decision. Many thanks to Guest Relations Agent Elisa who was very kind and helpful with providing me with transportation options to the hotel and welcoming us with a lovely note and a bottle of champagne.
