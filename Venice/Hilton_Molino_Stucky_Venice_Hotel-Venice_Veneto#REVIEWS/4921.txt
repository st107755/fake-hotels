We stayed for one night prior to our cruise. The hotel in nice but the staff was rude.We had reserved two rooms for our family of four, two adults, two children. I had corresponded with the hotel prior to our visit and was assured to have two connecting rooms. Well, needless to say no one knew anything about our request and were given two separate rooms near each other. Not a big deal but the way they handled it was.
