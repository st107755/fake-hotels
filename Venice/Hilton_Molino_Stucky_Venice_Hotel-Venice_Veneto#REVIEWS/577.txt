This is a great hotel which is a perfect base for a visit to Venice. The facilities are modern and comfortable and the staff are attentive to the needs of their guests. The hotel is well situated for some peace and quiet after a busy day in Venice and the boat service is regular and efficient. There are a few restaurants around the hotel as well as those within the building. The rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2018Dear Sir, We are glad that you have enjoyed your stay with us and we thank you for taking the time to leave your review on TripAdvisor.
