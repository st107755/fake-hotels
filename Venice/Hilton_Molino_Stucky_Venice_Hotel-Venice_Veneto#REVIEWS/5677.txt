Using Hilton Points we stayed for a week - the best in the Hilton chain, in my opinion - everything was perfect!  Easy access via vaporetti, fantastic breakfast, quiet, beautiful rooms (airtight, which is important after sunset in Venice--mosquitos). The view from the pool is perhaps the most amazing in the world - nothing like swimming while you are overlooking one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  Save your points, PW's - it's worth every one!Read moreDate of stay: July 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
