We made a special vaporetto trip on Saturday afternoon to have a drink in the Rooftop Bar, and to view the sunset over Venice. Arriving at the hotel at 16.45 we made our way to the bar, only to find it closed until 17.00.  We went back to reception to wait for the bar to open.  At 17.15 we returned to the bar and it was still closed, although staff were working in the bar, they saw us but completely ignored us.  A very uninspiring hotel, no atmosphere and certainly not worth the trip.  It is extremely isolated from Venice and I would not recommend this hotel at all.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 18, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting a review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
