This is a beautiful property on Guidecca Island.  The hotel has a free shuttle that runs over to St Mark's square.  Just need to make sure you plan your day around the schedule.  Beautiful views of Venice from the roof-top pool and bar area.  Staff is very helpful.  I was surprised how big our room was for Europe and we were in an Executive King versus a suite.  Bedroom was about 15' x 15' and there was a half wall at the head of the bed with a 6' wide area behind it that was the "office" area.    Best way to get there from the airport is by water taxi which doesn't take more than 20 minutes, about 15 minutes to the cruise peer.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
