The Hotel is a short (free) boat ride away from the San Marco Square, it also makes a quick stop midway should you want to explore the rest of Venice.  The hotel, since is across the waterway, is located in what used to be a a big factory, so you have a waterfront view of all Venice from your window, not only that, they have the space to have multiple amenities, bars, a Nutella Kiosk (yes, its great!), a rooftop pool and skybar.  It's a luxury boutique hotel, in an city where you just don't have hotels of this size and this great amenities.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
