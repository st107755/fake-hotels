I was very happy with my choice. Located in Giudecca island few minutes from noisy San Marco square, but in total peace. I love it! Do not get scared is an island....Venice is 110 island everything is an island! The hotel was great and service also. Was great after walk thru the crowded street close to San Marco to come back to the hotel by 5 min water boat taxi (...there is no car taxis in Venice), and feel the peace of Giudecca streets and restaurants. Kid and us love the boat ride every day. The building is a beautiful palace with all the great hilton accommodation. My next visit to Venice I will repite the same hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
