A beautiful relatively new hotel.  Great rooftop pool and bar.  The bar service was awful and the drink was two sips, however it would not change my opinion on whether I would stay there again.  Room was very quiet (which I love).  Very elaborate - a chandlier over the bed.  Nicely decorated and nice bathroom.  Found the boat to take over initially, but it never came, ended up with the valporetto which worked wonderfully.  It did show up last night there and was fine.  The island itself is quiet, so nice change of pace from Venice proper.  I give it a 5 star rating.  Just put a little more drink in the glass and keep the waiters coming over, especially when no one was in there.  Check in people were great. 20% discount at the garage - thronchetta (sic).Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
