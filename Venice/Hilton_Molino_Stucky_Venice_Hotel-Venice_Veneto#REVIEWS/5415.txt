Lovely hotel, very comfortable rooms, and even though not within the main part of Venice, very convenient with the regular water taxis as part of their complimentary service. Internet service was outrageously priced however! The staff could not do enough for you, very helpful and welcoming! Overall, the hotel of course is a bit pricey and you could probably find something at better value, but we enjoyed our stay enormously.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
