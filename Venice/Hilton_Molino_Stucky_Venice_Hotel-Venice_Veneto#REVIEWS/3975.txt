Stayed here with my boyfriend and we had the best time. Hotel was amazing, staff couldn't of been more helpful. Shuttle boat was a must as without it you couldn't really get around but was very easy to jump on to st marks square and get it back to he hotel. ( boat was hourly to st marks sq )  Food was slightly overpriced but you got a lot for your money. The roof too bar was amazing, anyone who stays needs to go up there views are out of this world, drinks were also slightly overpriced.  Only negative was there was a lot of work going on with re doing the pool area and the noise was very loud from the builders which we could hear in are room but as soon as we told reception they moved us ASAP.  View from are room was just amazing. We also did the spa which again was amazing,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
