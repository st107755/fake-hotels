Truly enjoyed our 3 nights at this Hilton. Very up to date amenities (by European standard). Service was very good and good size room.  Might not be your cup of tea if you prefer the convenience of Venice proper. The hotel is on an island (Diudecca), directly across from Venice. Hotel provides free boat shuttle every 15-30 minutes until almost midnight. For us, it was a very relaxing place to stay, we took nice evening walk along the sea every night.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you liked the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, away from the crowded city centre, which is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice without loosing a fantastic view over the city from our spectacular Rooftop Bar and pool. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
