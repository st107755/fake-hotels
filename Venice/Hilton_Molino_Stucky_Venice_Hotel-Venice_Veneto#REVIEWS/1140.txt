The hotel itself is beautiful, nice rooms, and great amenities to include a spectacular rooftop pool.   The shuttle from the hotel to San Marco was a nice amenity and reasonable for 6 Euro for a stay.  The bad...towels not replaced, no ice bucket, asked twice for a cot to be brought to the room, etc...  In a hotel claiming to be tops, I seemed to be calling everyday for something.  Stay if you Hilton points...otherwise try elsewhere until they get their act together.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2017Dear Tom,  We thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky and for your loyalty.
