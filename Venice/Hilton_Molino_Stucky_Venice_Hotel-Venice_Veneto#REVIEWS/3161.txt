Very nice hotel, only downside is that you are off the main island so need to get a shuttle boat back and forth, this became a bit constrictive. The breakfast buffet was first class as always, the staff were vey attentive. Our shower too an age to run hot but got there in the end and the room was a nice size. There was a TV but we couldnt get any english speaking channels except for the news, we think it would have been nice to be able to watch a little light entertainment prior to turning in for the night.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 13, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your Hilton Molino Stucky Venice experience with us and for taking your the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
