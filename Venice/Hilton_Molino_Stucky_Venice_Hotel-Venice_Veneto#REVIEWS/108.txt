I stayed here back in April when it was slightly less busy. The hotel was beautiful and so grand. Excellent customer service and clean rooms. We had a view of the canal and it was very easy to get the boat to the main Venice squares.   On the last day (a rainy one) we had a spa day and it was worth every penny. Gorgeous sauna and changing area, and special chill out room with snacks. The massage was excellent and very relaxing.   The food was also great. 3 nights was just right, enough time to go into the centre and wander the local streets.  I would recommend and go here again, if you don't want a hotel that's super noisy and is away from main crowds.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2019Dear Madame, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
