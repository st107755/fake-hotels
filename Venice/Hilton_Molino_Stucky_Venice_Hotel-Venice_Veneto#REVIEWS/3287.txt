Stayed in the for 2 nights in Sep 2014.   Got a smelly urinated mattress topper, followed by an "upgraded room" shared with unwelcome mosquitoes, finally on being moved for the 3rd time got a nights sleep.  The next day had a very unpleasant time dealing with the manager, (who did not believe us)  had to prove that we were being truthful about our experience by going up and pointing out the urinated smelling mattress topper.   Then eventually offered a refund for the nights stay.  Will never stay in a Hilton again.  Premium price for 5 Star, urinated mattress, room filled with mosquitoes, Venice ruined.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 18, 2014Dear Sir,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel. You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton.  I very well remember the issue you have experienced on the 3rd of September. As you can imagine such unusual incidents are taken very seriously and we can only apologize again for it.  On the other hand we were glad to see that you appreciated our gesture for one night refund, compensation which you accepted upon meeting our Guest Relations Manager and afterwards during your email exchanges with him. We do hope that despite your disappointment, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
