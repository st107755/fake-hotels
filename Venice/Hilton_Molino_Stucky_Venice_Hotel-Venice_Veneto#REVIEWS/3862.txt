Do you want to stay somewhere nice in Venice?   Then stay here.   I am a Hilton Honors member and this has to be one their best hotels.  The rooms are spacious.  The bed is super comfy.   The view, if you can get one of the canal, is spectacular.   The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The reception staff were welcoming.  The breakfast was great.   And the shuttle boat back over to Piazza San Marco was the best.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
