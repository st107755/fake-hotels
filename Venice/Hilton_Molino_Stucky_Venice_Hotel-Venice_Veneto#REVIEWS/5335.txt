The Hilton was a very nice choice in Venice, it is a rather large hotel, so if you are looking for the intimate getaway this is not it. The rooms were very large, by european standards, and you could actually fit 2 people in the bathroom at the same time. The hotel does provide a shuttle boat back and forth to the other part of Venice. There is not much around the hotel, so the shuttle is needed.  The rooftop bar and pool were also very nice, but I don't think it would be open in the winter.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 22, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive comments on our hotel service and facilities.
