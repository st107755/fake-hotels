We stayed here for one night last Saturday night after a return from a cruise. The hotel itself was beautiful, lovely decor, very clean and the staff could not have been more friendly. The dorrman realised we were in a rush to get back into Venice after a delay in disembarking. He checked in for us and placed our bags in the room by the time we got back. All the staff were extremely helpful and polite. The breakfast had possibly one of the best spreads I have ever seen. The courtesy bus to St Marks Square was regular, quick and very convenient. I would certainly stay here again when I return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
