We caught ferry from Fusina, great way to reach the Hotel as they had at the same drop off point a shuttle ferry. Building very impressive outside. Checkin with Giorgio was very pleasant and set my expectations. Room basic & relatively small. No robes. I went to put curtain back on the wall holder and it started to fall out of the wall. 2 pictures in the room hung crooked and very obvious. Upon retiring for the night found a large rip in the worn out doona cover. We left the doona in a fashion that housemaid would see & reported to front desk. Upon returning to room still same. We went down to tell them & received an apology and they said we could change rooms. They did sent replacement - which really was not the point. Breakfast plentiful but they tried to charge 5euro eachâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
