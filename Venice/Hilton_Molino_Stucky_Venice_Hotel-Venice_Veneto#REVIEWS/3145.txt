Ignore the bad reviews.  This is a beautiful hotel with excellent customer service.  Girogio upgraded us at a amicable fee to a exec suite with view for our 25th anniversary.  This was very considerate.  The hotel is a converted mill an dis huge and its history is posted in th hotel in various locations.  Breakfast is fantastic with no complaints.  The hotel is locate south of the main islands and has a hotel ferry that runs approx every 30-45 minutes across to two points on main land including just outside eh main tourist square.  If you follow the. timetable you can't go wrong.  When arriving at the airport I bought a 72 hour act public transport pass inclusive a bus transfer to piazza roma terminal.
