When you return to a hotel after several years that you thought was excellent on a previous visit, there is always a little concern that it has gone down in standard. With the Molino Stucky I need not have worried, the standard was as high as ever and the staff as friendly and efficient as on previous stays.  It’s a beautiful hotel in a wonderful peaceful setting, the facilities are second to none and it’s always my first choice when returning to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 5, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
