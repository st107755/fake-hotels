I stayed here on business for one nigh recently, having previously stayed with my wife some years ago. Once you arrive at the hotel, which takes about 1.5 hours using a combination of bus and water taxi from the airport, you can really relax. I had a room overlooking the canal which is great. The executive rooms are very comfortable and offer everything you would expect. The hotel offers its own water taxi to saint marco on a regular basis which is great for site-seeing. Staff were friendly. The only negative point was the dedicated breakfast area for executive club members which was far too small to accomodate the numbers using it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
