The Molino Stucky is a stunningly beautiful hotel that is friendly, comfortable and has a wonderful view of "mainland Venice". Across the canal, they have a shuttle water taxi that brings you across and back in a pretty regular time (check schedules though, they do take lunch breaks, etc).  The breakfast was terrific and the rooms very comfortable and upscale.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
