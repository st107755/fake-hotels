definitely do not get what you pay for here...paid more than we wanted on purpose to have the best time for our first europe trip, that was a mistake...poor service overall, only beds made nothing restocked...had to call front desk multiple times a day to get what we needed that should already be in a room for 3 people, only offered us most expensive champagne and was told it was the only one they had so we got it and later found out that was a lie, the only nice people good service was the bartenders...will never stay here again Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 7, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for leaving your review on Booking.com.
