Well what an amazing stay. I love Venice. The private boat to the hotel was amazing delivered straight to your private jetty. The hotel was lovely and the breakfast caters for all tastes and was just delicious. As for the skyline bar ...wow.. the view is amazing and worth the visit for that alone. Lovely staff in the Skyline too. We had a super few days so Thankyou Venice. ðŸ˜˜Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 17, 2017Dear Madame, we are the ones who have to thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor!
