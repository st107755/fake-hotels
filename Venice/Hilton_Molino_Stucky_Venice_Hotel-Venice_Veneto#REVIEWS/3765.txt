We stayed here for just two days here back in August 2013, and we so wish we could have stayed longer. We got here right in the middle of our London-Paris-Venice-Florence-Rome trip and we couldn't have asked for more.  The hotel's location was well away from the tourist crowd on the other side but not too far away with the very frequent and free hotel shuttle. The rooms were just beautiful, the lobby, and other common areas were just great. The roof top pool was fantastic!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
