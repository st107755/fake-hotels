We stayed in this hotel for four nights and had a great time. The pool is situated right at the top of the hotel and the Skyline bar, although expensive is great! Rooms were a nice size, and we had a view over the canal. The shuttle boat they have was never too busy for us to get on and off and was always on time for us. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the location is fantastic for the ACTV (Public boat service). We travelled as a family and loved every minute of our stay!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 13, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review about our hotel.
