I was really impressed with the Hilton Molino Stucky and will definitely return to this great hotel. The staff simply couldn't do enough for you and the concierge's dining recommendations were second to none. Access to the executive lounge was also a real bonus. The Hotel was only a short ferry ride to all the sights and it's location allowed us to escape the masses when 6 cruise vessels were in port and thousands of cruise passengers inundated the city. The Hilton breakfast was also second to none.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
