This is my second trip to Venice within a year and I found this hotel to be just perfect.  It is located on the Guidecca canal which offers great views of Venice and lets you get away from the crowds on the main island. The breakfast was good, the rooms large and comfortable and the staff very friendly.  We will surely come back again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 17, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
