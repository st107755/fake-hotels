Great location.  The water taxi from the Hilton costs only 7 euros a day and it takes you near St. Marks Square in 15 minutes.  The food in the outdoor cafes on the way is wonderful.  The views from the water taxi are inspiring.  The hotel is 1st class.  My husband has a handicap scooter which we were able to load on the water taxi with no difficulty using the existing ramps.  The bathroom was spotless.  The staff were helpful and kind.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
