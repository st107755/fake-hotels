The hotel is located on an island Southwest of San Marcos Square. I mentioned that because it requires a waterbus or watertaxi to get there and that costs between $8 and $65. The hotel is in an old pasta factory and it is filled with history. The rooms were large, spacious and well appointed. Everything was clean and impeccable.  The breakfast was complex and had something for everybody, ranging from pancakes, eggs, croissants to fish, salami, and even Gongee for Chinese guests.  The staff was helpful and courteous. The only downside is that you need to use the shuttle boat to get anywhere. The schedule is odd, so it is not easy to remember when the boat will leave.  But, overall, a great property and I would certainly stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 1, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments about the hotel, I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
