We stayed at the Hilton having read the reviews and were aware of its location. I would just point out the ferries do not run as frequently and you would expect. There are ferries every 20 minutes from the hotel, but they do not all go to where you want to go. The ferries to San Marco only run every 40 minutes or so, and if the ferry is full when it lands at the hotel, or at Zatterre, you will not be able to board. One night we had to wait over 40 minutes for a ferry as the first one was not going back to our hotel and the second one was full and did not stop!!  The times are also less frequent on a Sunday. And when the weather is bad, windy and rainy, the last thing you want to do is stand waiting at the ferry stop, there are no shelters. I would definitely stay in Veniceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
