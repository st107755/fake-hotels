Travelling with a group of ladies for a 50th Birthday celebration we travelled across the water to the Hilton SKYBAR.  Wow we were not disappointed, on arrival the hotel was majestic over looking the Grand Canal.  The first area we visited was the pool area that has a stunning back drop of Venice and the Grand canal.  Lighting was perfect for some amazing photos.  Then we moved onto the equally swish SKY bar, cocktails on the expensive side but you are paying for the view. 17 Euros average price, but crisps, nibbles etc served as complimentary  snacks.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants to frequent in Venice, but do take the trip over the water it is most definitely worth it, you will not be disappointed..ially if you get there when the sun isstarting to set.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
