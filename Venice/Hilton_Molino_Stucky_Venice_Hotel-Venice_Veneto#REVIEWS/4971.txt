This hotel has lovely rooms, however our room only had a small window. This is a function of the hotel being an historic building.   There is a beautiful but small swimming pool on the roof with a rather surly attendant. Most of the service in the hotel was surly with little smiling or evidence that they would go beyond what you ask them.   The location of the hotel is good in that it is away from the crowds of Venice but this is also a hassle. The shuttle boats are infrequent - on weekdays, they go to San Marco only every hour, and often the boats get full even if you come down early. This is a major service shortcoming of the hotel - it needs to increase the frequency of its boats.
