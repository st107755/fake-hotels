You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton.  I am disappointed you did not enjoy the Executive Lounge which offers a nice canal view and is in general one of the highlights of our hospitality.  May I also advise that upgrades to our valued HHonors Gold and Diamond members are granted upon availability and being summer a very busy period we are not always able to offer it.  Be reassured we have taken your comments to heart and we will certainly take in consideration your points in our Department Heads meeting.   We are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.   Best regards,  Alessandro M. Cabella General ManagerRead more
