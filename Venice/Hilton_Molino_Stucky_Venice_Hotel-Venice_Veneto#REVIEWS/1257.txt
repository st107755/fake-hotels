Beautiful hotel.  Rooms were really nice, fairly large and modern and extremely comfortable.  Staff was phenomenal and helpful throughout our 2 day stay.  Concierge was especially helpful with dining recommendations (the couple we tried were great) & setting up water taxi to airport.  Taxi to/from hotel to downtown Venice was easy to use.  Enjoyed being away from the crowds at their location.  Pool is beautiful!  Only thing I saw that was negative (prices at Skylounge were high, even for Venice...but a beautiful view).Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 30, 2017Dear Guest, thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
