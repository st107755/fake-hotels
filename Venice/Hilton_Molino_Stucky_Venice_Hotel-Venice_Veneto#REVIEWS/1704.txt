We stayed here with our family for 3 nights in August and absolutely LOVED this hotel. The rooftop pool was the best feature of this landmark hotel. We booked 2 rooms and were able to use the Executive Dining Area which was so nice. Our kids were always able to go have a snack or drink when they were hungry. The Nutella bar was a highlight too! Such good crepes :) Our friends stayed in the heart of Venice when we were here but we enjoyed taking the boat back to our quiet island and being away from all the people in the evening. We went to a great restaurant one evening just a short walk down the main road by the water. Definitely will stay here again!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
