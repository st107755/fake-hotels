What an amazing place.  Got picked up from the airport in a water taxi straight to the hotel door.  The hotel is in a lovely location over the other side of the island, you need to get the hotel shuttle boat over to the other side to visit all the land marks st petes square etc.  Felt like being in a film set.  The roof top pool is brilliant although the prices for drinks are extortionate...The buffet breakfast was the best ive ever had in a hotel,  so much choice.  This bar on the top floor was very classy but empty...possibly due to the expensive prices.  This is a fab place for a special occasion.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
