We stayed at the Hilton Stucky for 3 nights in August 2007.  The hotel is an old flour mill and is huge.  The staff is amazing and our room overlooking the Guidecca Canal.  It is not on the immediate isle of Venice, but the hotel has a courtesy water shuttle taking you to two stops on Venice which leaves often.  It's free.  We ate at the restaurant, Il Molino, onsite which is more upscale.  The food was ok, but not superb.  Skytop pool is great and so is the skyline bar, but be prepared to spend upwards of 15 euros on a cocktail there.  Cheaper stuff in the lobby bar area.    Overall amazing experience, we'd totally recommend.  We also stayed in Florence, Milan and Rome, check out my reviews of them as well. Read moreDate of stay: August 2007HelpfulShare
