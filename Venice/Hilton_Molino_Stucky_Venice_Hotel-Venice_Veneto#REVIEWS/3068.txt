Just returned from a 3 night stay at this very good hotel.   Location: Yes it is a little further out of Venice on a little island of Giudecca but its only a 5 min (complimentary) boat ride from the busy tourist attractions.  We enjoyed this location as there are a few bars, cafe's an restaurants just down the road.  And its easy to find unlike some right in the center. We booked a private water taxi from the airport which was ideal straight to the hotel after a little tour of the Grand Canal on the way in. Staff: Excellent, very helpful, polite and accommodating. The concierge could not do enough and helped with bookings and items we needed during our stay. Rooms: Very clean, comfortable and a good size. Good size bathroom too.  rooms where better than expected.
