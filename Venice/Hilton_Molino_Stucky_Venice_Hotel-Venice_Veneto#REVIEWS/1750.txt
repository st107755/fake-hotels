We acknowledge your comments on prices, though I can also assure you that prices of food and beverage in our bars and restaurants are in line with other 5-stars hotels in Venice. The € 3 euros cover charge per person at our Rialto Restaurant is a standard charge for all dining guests, with the exception of children. It is a regular standard practice in restaurants in Venice and in Italy and it includes a selection of bread and rolls, grissini, butter as well as condiments like Italian extra-virgin olive oil and premium balsamic vinegar. I do hope that should your plans bring you back this way, you will give us another chance to serve you. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
