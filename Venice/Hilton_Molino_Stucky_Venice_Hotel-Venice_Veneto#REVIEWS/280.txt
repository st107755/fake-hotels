We came to Venice after staying in Vienna, Cesky-Krumlov and Salzburg.  We were so pleased to walk into our Hilton room and feel true air conditioning.  The room was gorgeous with a inset wood wardrobe, chandelier above the bed, and a bathroom with a tub and separate shower.  The true king bed was a welcome sight after being in twin bed Kings for the last week.  Check in was easy, as was the hotel shuttle to San Marco.  The roof top bar and pool offered spectacular views of the canals and city.  Everyone we came across was very helpful and pleasant.  The layout is a maze-like structure.  We had the breakfast buffet one morning...it was okay.  Most of the food was cold.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
