While the location means you have to take a shuttle to other places to visit, it wasn't that difficult and the boats run quite frequently - the Hilton shuttles are free. The hotel is made up beautifully with the lounge, while small, has nice views of the canal, the lobby lounge is very comfortable, the roof top bar has great views of Venice, canals and surrounding islands. They have an array of restaurants and 2 Nutella bars (that I saw, maybe there are more ?). Great service at reception. Our room was in interior room, so no views but it was very large and comfortable, great bed. For the price we found them to be a little cheap on the bathroom products - seems that many containers were half full, and couldn't get a wash cloth at all - even after specifically requesting one.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
