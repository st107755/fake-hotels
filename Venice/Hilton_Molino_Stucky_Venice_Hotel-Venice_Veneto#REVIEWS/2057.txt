Having stayed in Venice four times,Giudecca island looked perfect for our fifth trip.....away from all those tourists! Hilton Molino Stucky looks impressive as you approach it in your water taxi,our greeting was perfect,bags taken and we were shown to reception. As we waited to be checked in I took in the surroundings...tasteful,smart,up to date and comfortable. We were in our room in a very short time, a large marble bathroom,large comfortable double bed,TV,mini bar and two wardrobes, all was clean but there was no view to speak of, we had decided against this as we would be spending more time out than in. 'Stucky's' position is perfect for visiting St Mark's square etc,and for catching a water taxi to Murano and Burano,and the Dorsoduro area,10 mins max gets you to St Marksâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2016Dear Madame, thank you very much for your kind review and for sharing your experience on TripAdvisor.
