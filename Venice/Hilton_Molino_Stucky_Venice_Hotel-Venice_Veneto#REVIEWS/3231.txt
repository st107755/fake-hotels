I only stayed one night but from my experience I would stay again.  The hotel is beautiful.  It is out of the way and quite.  The hotel offers a free boat service.  It was always on time and plenty of seats.  I could see that during peak season it could get filled up quite fast.  Hotel staff were helpful and pleasent.  It's what I would expect from a Hilton.  The only complaint I had was the carpet in my room had multiple stains and was kind of gross.  It's not the end of the world but be aware.  I stayed in room 520.
