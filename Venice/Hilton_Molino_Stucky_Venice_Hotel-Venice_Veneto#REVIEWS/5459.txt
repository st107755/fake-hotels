We stayed here this week with friends for their wedding. What a fantastic hotel! the roof terrace has a great pool and sunbathing chairs along with the most panoramic views of Venice and its surroundings. The rooms are great with comfy beds and well appointed bathrooms. With exec rooms and above you get access to the exec lounge which offers food and drinks all day every day - a great benefit:) The spa is excellent and I enjoyed an expert back massage and them chilled out in the excellent sauna and relaxation areas. The hotel is excellently located and offers a free shuttle service regularly to St Marks. All in all excellent base and surprisingly feels non-corporate hotel in a superb converted building. Book it now:)Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
