We choose this hotel because of our Hilton points and it did not disappoint.  The hotel is very spacious and clean and the view of Venice is stunning.  The transportation via taxis and shuttle boats is fantastic - making it easy to get around.  The only thing that surprised us was how very BUSY the waterway is.  Our view was spectacular but it is definitely not quiet and relaxing.  A lot going on in that canal.  If you're looking for a quiet, quaint hotel - this is not the place for you.  However, if you want energy - good restaurants and great access to the water and the city - this is a great choice.  Lastly - the rooftop pool is very cool with an incredible view!  Just WOW.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
