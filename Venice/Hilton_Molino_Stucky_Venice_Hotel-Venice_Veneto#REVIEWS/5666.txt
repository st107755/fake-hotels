Hotel was beautiful on the inside.  I admit I was worried about the location for the last few nights of our Italian honeymoon, but it turned out perfect.  Got a room overlooking Venice and down the canal on the top floor - great view.  The hotel operated vaparetto was very convienant and always punctual.  It was January so the slow season but we loved it.  It wasn't crowded and for about an hour one day, it snowed!    The other day we were there was absolutely beautiful and we enjoyed a gondolier ride.  I recommend timing your ride so that you get your full money's worth.  It is a tourist town afterall.  Try to find a restaurant off the beaten path - it's better.  Enjoyed Cafe Florian too!  Also took in a string quartet concert one evening.  Took a water taxi to the airport onâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2010HelpfulShare
