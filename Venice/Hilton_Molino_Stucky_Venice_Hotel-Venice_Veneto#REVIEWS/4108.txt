Stayed here early November for my trip to Venice. I strongly recommend this hotel. For me, it's a very special hilton hotel - the old building feel with some class. Service and the room is top notch! Venice is a very special place and this hotel make our trip even better. It's just opposite the Zaterre stop and hilton provide a "on time" free shuttle. It's a perfect choice if u want to stay inside Venice. I doubt there's a better hotel that has more class then hilton inside Venice.  The only bad points is the breakfast room is very crowded in the morning so dont expect much service and also the free shuttle is not so frequent to my liking, u need to "waste" some time trying to arrange trips.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
