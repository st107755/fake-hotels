This is the hotel the cruise ships use but it doesn’t feel crowded because the hotel is massive. Each room must be very different because of the age of the building. The first room we went to smelled bad and had a low ceiling. We asked for a change and the staff graciously accommodated us to a larger room and gave us bellinis for the trouble. The lobby is exquisite but the basic rooms could use a carpet update. We were told the hotel shuttle was not free so we visited the gorgeous rooftop pool and wandered Guidecca. Solid hotel overall.
