I brought my Fiance here for her 40th birthday as a surprise. I paid a little extra for a Deluxe room and also asked if it was possible to get a room with a view due to the occasion. They certainly didn't disappoint. Had a great view looking towards the Basilica de San Marco.  At night we could sit and watch the boats zipping about. The hotels boat service makes it a perfect option to stay away from the busiest areas but very easy to get to.  the Sky line bar is classy but expensive but then there are a lot of expensive places in Venice.  Lovely stay and would go againRead moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 20, 2015Dear Sir,  We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your positive stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky and thank you for choosing our property for such a special occasion.
