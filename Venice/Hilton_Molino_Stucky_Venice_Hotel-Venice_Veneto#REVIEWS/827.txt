This was a very hotel! Did try the executive lounge and it was very nice right along the water. They gave me a nice upgrade with a super view of the canal. Staff was courteous and professional. Nice to see some African brothers working there too. All exceptionally well groomed and very fluent in English. Thank you all for a memorable stay, Iâ€™ll be back!
