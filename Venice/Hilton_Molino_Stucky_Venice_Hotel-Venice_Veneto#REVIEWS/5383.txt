Right from the start i liked this Hotel. Free shuttle boat from S. Marco to the hotel every 20 minutes until 1am. Excellent customer service and comfortable rooms. The best part was the panoramic outdoor pool located on the 8th floor with the amazing views. There is also rooftop bar and restaurant on this fllor hosting parties. Nice buffet breakfast in the morning and good relaxation in the spa. Planning to be back next summer to enjoy the pool and the views! xRead moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
