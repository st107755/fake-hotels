Not a particularly attractive hotel to look at but has been nicely decorated internally. Too large for a short stay especially after getting lost as you just have to use the right lift to get to your room. View from bedroom was a wall but if you stay make sure you go to the roof top pool area as from there Venice stretches out forever.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky on Tripadvisor.  We appreciate being advised of any breach in the usual service for which our hotel is noted.  We are sorry you did not like the structure of our hotel, a building which dates back to the 19th century and restored converting the original structure of the old flour mill Molino Stucky. The project was approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to this monumental complex, protected by local authorities.  Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.  Best regards,   Alessandro M. Cabella   General ManagerRead more
