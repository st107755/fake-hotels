Hilton Molino Stucky is a perferct place to stay during you vacay in Venice. Not only the view from the rooftop is amazing but also the staff, food rooms and everything else is to dream for. The location is also perfect as it is situated just next to the waterbus station - only two stops from St. Marcus Square. I will definitelly suggest You should consider this location when visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 30, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky I am pleased that you found the service great all over the hotel and I am so pleased that you recommend our property to other travelers, this is very kind of you.
