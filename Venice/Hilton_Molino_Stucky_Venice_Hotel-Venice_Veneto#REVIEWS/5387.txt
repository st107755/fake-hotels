Upside:  Quiet location on the island of Giudecca, away from the crowds of Venice.  Good breakfast buffet.  Awesome hotel bar on the roof of the hotel with great views of Venice.  The rooftop pool was also very nice, although very few lounge chairs. Downside:  Making sure you got in the shuttle line early enough to get a ride to Venice an back.  Some rude european tourists and asian tourists that would cut in line for the shuttle.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
