Had a nice stay here. This hotel was neither a wow nor a disappointment. Our room was ok although it felt a little dated. Food ok, pool on roof was great however tiles around the pool are very slippery. Our son slipped once and we saw several other guests do the same. Be aware: they try and add a 4 Euro charge per person to you bill for the water taxi which runs between St Marks Square and the hotel. After telling them i was unaware of this charge they removed this from the bill. Would we stay there again?......perhaps we would find another hotel at this level as it didn't really exciteRead moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
