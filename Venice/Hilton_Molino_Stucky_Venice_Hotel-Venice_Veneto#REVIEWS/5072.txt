The Hilton provides a hotel full of updated amenities just a free-shuttle boat ride from Venice.  The shuttle takes about 10 minutes and drops you right in the heart of the activity. The shuttle runs every 15 to 30 minutes. The rooftop pool on the hotel gives an incredible view and a nice retreat.  The buffet breakfast cannot be beat...so many choices...all taste great!  Book this as part of your room...it's well worth the difference in price.  We had dinner in the lobby bar area and enjoyed it immensely although it was pricey which we expected given the location.  Overall this is a great place to stay!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback !
