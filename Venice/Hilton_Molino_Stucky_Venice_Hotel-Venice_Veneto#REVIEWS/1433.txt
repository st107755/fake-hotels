This hotel is as beautiful as the pictures. The staff is attentive and helpful. The executive lounge was well maintained with a very nice breakfast and happy hour. It is away from the city center but the shuttle boat is very nice. The water taxi can bring you to the hotel but is expensive. We bought a 48 hour jump on/jump off water boat shuttle ticket and were able to go everywhere we wanted. Only disappointment was that the rooftop lounge was rented out for private events both nights we were there. We had been looking forward to the views.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 12, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
