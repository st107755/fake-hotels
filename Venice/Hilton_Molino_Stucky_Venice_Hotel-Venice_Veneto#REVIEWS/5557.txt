The Hilton Stucky Molino in Venice, Italy was an enjoyable stay. We were there for a few nights before leaving on our Mediterranean cruise.  I was able to converse with the hotel by internet and arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel.  The concierge and staff are amazing. Their complimentary shuttle back and forth to mainland Venice runs frequently. Our stay was paid with Hilton honors points and we were not treated differently than any cash paying patron. I would stay there again with no hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
