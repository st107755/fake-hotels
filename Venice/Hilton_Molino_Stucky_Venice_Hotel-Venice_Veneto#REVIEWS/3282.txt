A standard business hotel. Quit far away from the bussy tourist centre of Venice. A good shuttle service is provided. The hotel is vey big, you feel this at the entree, no personal feeling.  The rooms are standard. 2 great restaurants!!!! Aromi (my favorite) and Bacaromi. 2 must eat places!!!! The icing on the cake is the rooftop pool, a true dream!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 19, 2014Dear Sir,  thank you  for your positive comments.
