I've been to Hilton Venice for the first time this year. Lovely place. Really great venue, nice staff and awesome breakfast. Easy to reach eith their complimentary shuttle services. Totaly recommend it. Some people complains that it's a different island and this makes things harder... I'd say it is conplitely different. You can reach Zaterre in 5 min and San Marco in another 10, so what is the problem on that?
