First off, I'd recommend you be a Hilton member.  We booked with points and stayed in the corner suite.  It was amazing.  It was a bit of a walk to get to, but nothing to intense.  The skyline bar was great, but a bit pricey, and the roof top pool overlooking Venice was stunning, well worth it.

The fact that you could use the pool means that you stayed here during the summer period, which is a very nice time to be in Venice!  We look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations Manager Read more
