Big brick warehouse, on an island with view of just the large cruise liners..Venice is a long way off and you get none of the feeling for the city.. On the flip side its modern, clean and with lots of extras you don't find in Venice like a pool... Yes it is very expensive, however this is typical of Venice...as an example I paid over 7 Euros for ONE beer in the Hard Rock Cafe!!   Its a good location only if you need to be locked away on business and don't want to see Venice, but if that.s the case...why go to Venice, do the business trip somewhere cheaper..like Vegas, you could even stay at the Venetian hotel there which had more soul than this prison.Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
