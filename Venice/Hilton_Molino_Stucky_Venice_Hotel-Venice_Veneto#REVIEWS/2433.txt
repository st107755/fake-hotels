City tax that we did not know about cost us €7 per day we were here.

Our room was nice but with a view of a brick wall and the workers corridor who were always making noise even at 2am which made it hard to sleep.   Housekeeping woke us up everyday knocking on our door and even when we put the do not disturb sign out they were still very noisy in the corridor.
