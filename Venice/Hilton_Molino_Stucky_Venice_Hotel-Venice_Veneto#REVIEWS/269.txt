Must see if you are in Venice.  Hop on the waterbus across to Guidecca and it's at the top of the hilton hotel.  Cocktails little pricey, 18-20 euro. But you pay for the view.  Best to go an hour before sunset, get good seats at the side. Lots of people turn up 5 mins before sunset and miss out on the good seats!
