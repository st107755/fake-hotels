Great hotel and very nice staff. Rooms are large and very clean. The hotel is beautiful, it's an old mill entirely restored. The roof top bar is a must do at night. The breakfast buffet is amazing. Staff very helpful and the hotel has a complementary shuttle to Murano which is a great experience .Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
