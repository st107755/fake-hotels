This hotel was really nice. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel has a private boat stop and it was very convenient. They even got us a private boat to take us to Murano Island because we had a tour organised at the Glass factory.  We really had a good time! Too bad, breakfast was not included with the room.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
