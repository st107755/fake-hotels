Booked 2 nights at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice from early November.  If I had of know what a superb hotel is was I would have stayed a week! The building is a converted flour mill and is stunning inside and out.  The view from our room was wonderful. The room itself was quiet, large and luxurious. Beds incredibly comfortable as well.  Transport to St Marcos is via Hilton ferry, very convenient and efficient. Executive lounge is smallish and not a lot of variety on food but otherwise a couple cold beers or glass of wine after a day on foot around Venice is nice. Breakfast was also amazing.  Highly recommend this wonderful hotel and will be our first choice if/we we return to Venetia!Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 14, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
