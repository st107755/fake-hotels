We got a phenomenal deal staying at this very expensive deal. Our room overlooked Venice and was very clean. Hotel staff very accommodating. Easy to get to via water taxi and the hotel even offers their own free taxi to two other stops. The roof top pool is something to definitely enjoy. We had access to the executive lounge which was perfect after a long day of touring. Word of caution though! Avoid the free tour of Murano that leaves from the Hilton. It's very shady and just annoying.Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
