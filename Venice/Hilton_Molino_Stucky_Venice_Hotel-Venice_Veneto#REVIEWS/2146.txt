Great place to stay.  Room was a nice size.  Rooftop bar was phenomenal for pictures of the city (though pricey).  Check in was hassle free.  Staff was friendly.  I'm a Hilton diamond member, so the perks were nice to have (and wonderful for the pocketbook).  Definitely recommend!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 30, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your positive comment about Hilton Molino Stucky.
