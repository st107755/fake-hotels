The hotel is in a beautiful building with a top class rooftop pool.  Amazing views of the city.  The staff were attentive and we received a hand written welcome from the manager.  The Executive lounge was well stocked with a limited range.  Although the hotel is across the channel from the main city, there is a hotel shuttle boat service which worked well.  Just be early on the dock for the return trips as it has a maximum capacity.  Our room had a great view of the city and was spacious and very clean.  Only negative was the wifi was essentially useless for all 3 days we were there- which was frustrating.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.We were delighted to see that our services met with your approval and that you enjoyed your stay with us.
