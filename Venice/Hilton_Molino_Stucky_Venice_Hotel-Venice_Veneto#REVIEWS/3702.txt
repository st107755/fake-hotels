We loved the variety of options the hotel offered. The rooftop pool, bar and restaurant is just amazing with postcard ready views of Venice.  The hotel is very big - and seems to cater a bit to corporate functions (the rooftop restaurant was closed to private functions for two of the nights we were there), but we liked being off the main island, a bit removed from the large crowds - but with the convenience of the free and frequent water shuttle provided by the hotel to two key locations on the main island.  Our last night we treated ourselves to the fine dining restaurant option, and were not disappointed - the food was terrific and the staff could not have been nicer or more pleasant.  You can take the public water bus from train station, and walk five or six minutes to hotelâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
