The most comfortable bed that we stayed in within Italy, the room was lovely with a great view of the water looking towards Venice. The water taxi service absolutely cannot be beat! Also, we took advantage of the opportunity to tour a glass factory on Murano for free. The greeting was great, we were early and our room wasn't quite ready so we were invited to enjoy the hospitality of the executive lounge. Breakfast was terrific. The hotel was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad I listened! Even better that I was able to use my Hilton Honors points for the room. Everything was perfect!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
