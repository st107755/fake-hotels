I was really impressed with the hotel. Easy to find via the WaterBus and upon arrival and departure the staff were informative and very helpful which created a great first impression. Visually the hotel is great during the day and at night. With the location being away from St Marks, they provide a Hilton Shuttle. Best advice is get there early both in the mornings and evenings otherwise you will be waiting around for long periods to get back to the hotel or quickly hop on a water taxi. Still a great hotel and would def go back to this hotel. Breakfast and Hotel room were to good standard as well. Thanks for a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 31, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your kind and positive review on TripAdvisor.
