Wonderful hotel with large rooms and lots of amenities  (spa is great and restaurant was fabulous). My friend loved the rooftop lounge and the staff was perfect. The water shuttle was a set price and very reliable to/from the major attraction. I would stay here again and recommend to a friend.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
