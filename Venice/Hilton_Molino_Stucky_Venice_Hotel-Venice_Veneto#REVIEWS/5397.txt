The hotel was fantastic.  Their shuttle from St. Mark's and Zattere was useful but the Water Taxi line 2 also stops at Palanca which was nearby and occasionally was more convenient.  Would definitely use that line to and from the train station.   The location on Giudecca was also nice because it was a little quieter.  The service was fantastic and the room was also amazing.  Very nice and worth it.  The bed was the most comfortable of the whole trip.    The view from the hotel bar (Skyline) was also good.  The breakfast buffet was large and fantastic.    Overall a great experience.  If you are a Hilton Honors Diamond or Gold member, the perks were also great;  the executive lounge had great food and drinks.  If you have Hilton points, this is a great place to use them in Italy.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
