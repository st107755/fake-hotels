My second time in Molino Stucky and I enjoyed staying there. Very nice staff, good food & wines, good sized room.  Venice is a beautiful but hot and city, so it’s Nice to stay at peacefull Giudecca. Having drinks at the rooftopbar and a swimm. The private Hilton boat is a plus. It’s Just a short trip to Venice down town.
