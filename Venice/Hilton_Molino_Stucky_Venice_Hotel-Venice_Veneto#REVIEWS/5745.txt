We stayed at the Stucky for 2 nights before we returned home to Canada.  The hotel is modern and very clean and was refreshing after staying at a worn down 3 star hotel (Palazzo Ravizza) in Siena.  The rooms were clean and modern although somewhat cramped.  We had an Alcove Suite which had a very small sitting room a corridor and then the main bedroom with the bath off the corridor.  It was a tight fit all around for a suite.  My daughter's rollaway bed was really like an army cot and not a bed.  However, again the decor and cleanliness of the rooms made up for it.  As for the location, it is definitely more roomier in outside space than the other San Marco located hotels where everything is tightly jammed.  However, be wary of the shuttle service.  The staff was hit and miss. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
