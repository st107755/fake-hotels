Great hotel . Very friendly staff and its very clearn . Food was great and all the staff were very good. Breakfast was excellent there was a wide variety . The room is big and spacious . The staff at check in are particularly lovely . The fact that you do not have to carry your bags across Venice is a bonus as the public transport docks rights outside the hotel .
