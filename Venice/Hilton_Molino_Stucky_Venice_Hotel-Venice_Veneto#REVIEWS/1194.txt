This is an awesome hotel. The water taxi is very convenient, but most importantly the views from rooms overlooking the main parts of the city are incredible! Our room even had exposed beam ceilings- an awesome design feature reminding us of the historical flour mill this once was! Staff is world class and they went above and beyond to ease our departure by answering questions about the plentiful public transportation options. Lastly, the hotel is on a quiet island away from all the touristy attractions- but it's a quick boat ride over to San Marco (using the Hilton's own private charter). While we didn't use the pool, we enjoyed looking at it and the views from the rooftop bar. Thank you, we truly will recommend to family and friends!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
