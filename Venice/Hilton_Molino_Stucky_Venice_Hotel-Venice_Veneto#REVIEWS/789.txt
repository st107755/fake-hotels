Stayed for 2 days early April.  Rooms are nice but no A.C. & even this early it is warm.  This is not on the main Isle of Venice but right across the water. Of course everything is by water taxi which is fun!  Included breakfast buffet is good.  Hamburger was 30 euro & drinks expensive.  A few restaurants on this side as well, but not nearly as crowded as Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
