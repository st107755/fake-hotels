Beautiful modernised hotel, large rooms, clean, lovely bathroom. Friendly staff, breakfast was a large buffet catering for all tastes. Has its own water taxi to take you to town St Marks square.  Beautiful skyline pool area with a view and a bar. Would recommend to stay here if you want something a little more modern.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2019Dear Guest, It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel and we are very glad that you have enjoyed your stay in Venice.
