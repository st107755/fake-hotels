This was our first trip to Venice and this hotel.  We were not disappointed.  It is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff.  Rooms were clean with comfortable beds.  Staff spoke English and were eager to help with any need.  The diamond lounge was a little small for breakfast,but the offerings were good.  The rooftop bar had wonderful views, however they do not serve food and the drinks are a little pricy. Hilton water transportation was easy and always on time.  Overall a great place to stay!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 21, 2015Dear Madame, thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
