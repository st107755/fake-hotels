My husband, son (14 yrs) and myself spent 5 days at this property.  Everything about the hotel was perfect.  We were always able to get 3 loungers by the pool; the location/shuttle was so convenient; breakfast was very good; room was clean and beds were comfy.  Drinks were pricey by the pool, but, hey, you're on vacation!  So nice to go out at night and then just go to one of the two stops on the main island to be transported back to the hotel. Would definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 18, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor, I am pleased that your experience at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was positive!
