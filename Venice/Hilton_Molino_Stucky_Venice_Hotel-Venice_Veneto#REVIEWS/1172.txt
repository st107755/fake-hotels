The Hilton Mulino Stuckey on Guidecca Island across from Venice is a peaceful place away from the maddening crowds of Venice. The Hilton Shuttle service to and from St. Mark's Piazza is convenient and frequent. The view from the pool is fantastic and the breakfast is excellent. The Executive Lounge could use a new space as it is cramped and the choices for happy hour are limited. There are many restaurants within walking distance if you choose not to pay 8 euros for a soft drink.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
