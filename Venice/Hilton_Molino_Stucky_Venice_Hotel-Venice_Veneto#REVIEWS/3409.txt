Hilton Molino Stucky hotel, although being some distance from San Marco, has the benefit of being in a quiet secluded part of Venice. It is serviced regularly by hotel shuttle boats to San Marco. Our room (a king size double) was quite large and well fitted out. Very clean and all the usual luxury items. Wifi was free in the public areas of the hotel (chargeable in guest rooms) and was much faster than we have experienced in other Italian hotels. Breakfast is really good, one of the best we have experienced. There are a couple of good hotel restaurants but there are also nearby local cafes that are much cheaper. In-hotel food and drink prices are much higher than elsewhere but that's what you expect at such a hotel. All staff are friendly and helpful. Not much to complain about.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2014Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
