Our first stop on our family vacation to Italy over the 2013/2014 Holiday season was the Hilton Molino Stucky hotel in Venice.  We had flown DFW-ATL-AMS-Venenzia on KLM with our teen aged twins (long flight) arriving Venenzia after dark.  We opted to take the water taxi from the airport and after an fun but cold ride we pull up on a landing steps away from the hotel lobby.  Lobby was warm and cozy and we were greeted by a friendly knowledgable staff.  We spent three great days and nights in Venenzia and found the Hilton convenient, friendly, cozy, and a great welcome to start our vacation.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
