We stayed at this hotel recently for one night prior to a cruise. The hotel and surrounding property are a nice escape from the regular downtown Venice hustle and crowds. There is a complementary water shuttle service that provides direct access to the usual "spots" in Venice on a regular schedule. The hotel staff and concierge staff here are top notch professionals. After a long overnight flight, and arriving in Venice minus our luggage (thanks US Airways!!) the hotel staff provided us some extra items to make it through the night. The next day the concierge also worked to track down the luggage porter who was delivering our luggage and ensured timely delivery. Great hotel, we will definitely be returning (with our luggage this time hopefully!!)Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 16, 2013Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
