My husband and our 5 year old son stayed here last weekend, we had a suite which was very large and well equipped.  A very nice double bedroom, first class bathroom, big spacious living area (with sofa bed) and a small kitchenette area, which we didn't use but would be perfect if you had a baby.  The buffet breakfast was first class and all the staff were exceptionally friendly - I don't think our son has been given so many lollipops ever!!  There's a very nice roof top bar and swimming pool (shut during the winter) and a regular, reliable taxi service.  Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2011Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
