I stayed her before embarking on a cruise.  It was a great choice for a shorter stay.  The hotel has a free water taxi to St Mark's Square. Our stay included breakfast which was very good.  the staff was friendly and really helped us enjoy our short time in Venice.  The hotel is large and has some strange turns, but once you get used to it it's not a problem.  the room was a typical European room not large, but not small and included all needed amenities.  Next time I travel to Venice I will defiantly stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
