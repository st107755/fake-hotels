The hotel is not close to San Marco, you need to take a ferry to get there. The hotel is huge and the food is terrible and expensive. The room was very standard, and felt like a cave. Staff was not friendly and pretended our AMEX credit card did not work, then pretended to fix the printer and made us wait to get our room even if it was almost 3 pm and it was low season. It does not feel like you are in Italy at this hotel.  An interesting sight close to the hotel is the Church of Il Redentore built at the time of the plague.  I would not stay here again, the only reason we chose this hotel was because our cruise was leaving on the next day. We chose the Boscolo when we came back from the cruise and it was beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 6, 2016Dear Madame, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
