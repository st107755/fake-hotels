In all honesty, this is one of the nicest hotels weâ€™ve ever had the privilege of visiting. The staff are amazing, and the entire hotel is magnificent.   Breakfast was spoiled only by the abundance of badly-behaved children which seemed to be roaming freely around the dining room.   All in all, this is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location. We cannot wait to stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
