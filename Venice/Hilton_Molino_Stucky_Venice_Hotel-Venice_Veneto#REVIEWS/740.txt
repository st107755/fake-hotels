This is the second time we stayed at Molino Stucky Hilton property. The hotel is outstanding and the staff is great from checking in to checking out . I contacted the hotel prior to my arrival to check on my transportation options with concierge Carlo Perilli who was very helpful. He also booked a airport water taxi to take us to the airport based on my flight so we didn't have to be concern with getting to the airport. I also would recommend you include breakfast in your booking , it's really a great value ! Molino Stucky also has it's own water shuttle service that goes to San Marco on the half hour so need need to use public water taxi service. My only regret is we didn't get a chance to use the rooftop pool !  ( Just forgot ) Maybe next time !Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 4, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your positive experience at Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
