Hotel is not in the city centre - but that does not pose a problem since the hotel has shuttle services to and fro the city. Rooms and bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. Breakfast is superb! They offer a wide variety of breakfast items.   Service can be improved - a plate that was left in the room was still there when we came back. Room service is also very very slow (take 30 minutes to deliver to the room despite taking a ~8-10 Euro service charge).   But would recommend this hotel since it is not in the centre of the city and hence quiet.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 21, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky.
