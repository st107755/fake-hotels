Third time I'm back to Venice Hilton Molino Stucky and I simply love this hotel. Suite room on Giudecca is large with an amazing view. Breakfast is generous and more than enough to satisfy your body until middle afternoon until when you can be back to the hotel and enjoy the lounge with a good wine choice before indulge at the SPA ! Hotel is well connected to the Piazza San Marco with the free hilton shuttle. Please do remember the car park tronchetto is discounted for hilton customers. Suggest to use the free taxi to visit Murano where you can visit the glass maker . Overall experience is great. Do not hesitate to book it for your next trip.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for the positive review.
