These guys get it. Fantastic service at every turn, truly care, overly friendly and courteous as we only spoke English. They really are a 5-star hotel. Great rooftop bar and great breakfast too. Our honeymoon stay was great in Venice because of them.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
