This hotel is just perfect - try to get a room facing the canal if you can and definitely get the Executive Club access so you can drinks and snacks throughout the day. The rooms are great and in a great location with some really nice restaurants located just down the way on the canal. The hotel shuttle is great but we found it easier to just get the water bus as we had a travelcard and meant we could explore Venice easier. The pool top views are just amazing and although the pool isn't huge and it could get quite busy, it was wonderful. If you want to be in the middle of Venice, then this hotel isn't for you, but we preferred it. I can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
