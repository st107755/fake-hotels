We booked this hotel with points so hard to complain, but it’s pricey, costs a decent amount of points to book. Negative, it’s on the south little block of Venice across the water, so you have to take an extra boat out there. But there aren’t very many businesses / places to eat on that side. The room is ok, the carpet is a little old and musty. They did however have the best bed and sheets of our trip. Slept so well there.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 26, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We hope to have the opportunity to welcoming back in the future to experience this time a lovely stay in Venice. Best regards  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
