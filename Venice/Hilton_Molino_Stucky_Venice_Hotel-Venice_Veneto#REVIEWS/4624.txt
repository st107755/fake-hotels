Hilton have done a terrific, sympathetic conversion of one of Venice's landmark buildings.  Well sized rooms and for our anniversary we were offered a canal view.  Bar and restaurant staff very good.  A good hairdryer (unusual in Europe).  The Skyline Bar is worth coming over to Giudecca alone.  Slightly less good service at breakfast - hurried staff had little time to help (e.g. when a cereal dispenser wasn't working I was told to "try another one"!) and the menu options weren't at table so discouraging orders.  The shuttle to the main city could be more frequent (some quite lengthy gaps).  However, overall, would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us. I am glad to hear that you liked the Hilton Molino Stucky and that you appreciated the architecture and the restoration of this impressive old building.
