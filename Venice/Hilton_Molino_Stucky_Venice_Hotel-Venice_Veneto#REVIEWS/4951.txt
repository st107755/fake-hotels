My husband and I travelled to Italy for a few factory visits and decided to tag on a few days in Venice. I chose this hotel from loads on trip advisor and we were both very pleased. The Hotel is not on the main land, but a free shuttle makes visiting the busy side of Venice very easy. The hotel staff were great and the views from the hotel magnificent. One piece of advice would be  to book as executive if you can, as the breakfast if far more pleasurable in the executive lounge, plus free snacks and refreshments are a welcome extra.  We will visit again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
