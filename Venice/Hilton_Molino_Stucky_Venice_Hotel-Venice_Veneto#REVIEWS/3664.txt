You won't find a better view of Venice than from Hilton Molino Stucky!  Our hotel room is about the prettiest I have ever stayed in in all my travels around the world. The executive lounge (available to Hilton Honors members) is fantastic! The restaurant menus are a little limiting and the free shuttle service needs major improvements.  We waited at a designated stop and the shuttle never came at the designated time; we had to wait another half hour. If your time in Venice is very limited, I would select another hotel.  If, however, you have a few days and don't mind waiting for the shuttle, it is well worth the stay to have the view and the amenities (the pool is beautiful, as is the view from there).Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
