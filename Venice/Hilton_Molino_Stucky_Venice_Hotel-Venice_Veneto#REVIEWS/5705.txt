Late review. One of my closest friends and I stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky last fall for four nights. We arrived after dark following a long journey. We absolutely loved the hotel. The staff, especially in the executive lounge were both helpful and friendly. We loved the location and enjoyed the quietness of Giudecca.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
