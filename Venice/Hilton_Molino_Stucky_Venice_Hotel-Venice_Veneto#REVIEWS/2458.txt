Facinating access, great estate and really helpful and friendly staff. If you are looking for a really relaxing experience with all facilities I would suggest this at top option. It's worth the money. The only downside is that you have a 4-5 minutes walk for pubblic transport to Tronchetto parking (check in and check out accesses). The hotel has a private boat that takes you to San Marco square, so great for the rest of the stay.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
