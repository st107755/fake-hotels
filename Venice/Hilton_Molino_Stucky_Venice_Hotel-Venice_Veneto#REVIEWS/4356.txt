Used my Hilton Honors points on an extremely busy weekend.  The hotel is impressive and the standard room was of a good size.  The issue is the limited and busy shuttle services.  It added over an hour to two at least to our day.  Many people missed the shuttle due to it being full and for the price most people pay to stay here you would expect constant shuttle services.  For the high $$ the hotel charges I would rather spend the same or more and stay near St Marco.  We just wasted too much time staying at the wrong (but lovely) island.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2013Dear Guest,  First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  We are sorry if we did not entirely meet your expectations.   May I take this opportunity to confirm that our complimentary shuttle boat runs every 20 to 40 minutes from 8 am in the morning to 1 am in the night with the only exception of 1 hour break in the afternoon. In addition, Alilaguna public lines stop also in front of the Hotel, with direct connections to the Airport and the Cruise Harbour.  Also, the ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely.  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
