I spent two nights at this hotel  as part of a two week trip to Venice. As a Hilton Honors Diamond guest I was allocated a very generous upgrade with view of Venice. Staff were very helpful and friendly whenever approach. The Corona-style breakfast is OK, more generous than seen in other hotels and with their Corona measures. The Exxectuive Lounge "happy hour" sandwiches should be replaced by something more enjoyable, or simply deleted - they were pretty bad. - but much appreciation that the Lounge is open and not closed!Read moreDate of stay: August 20201 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2020Dear Guest,  Thank you for your nice comments on TripAdvisor, and for choosing our hotel for your stay in our romantic city.
