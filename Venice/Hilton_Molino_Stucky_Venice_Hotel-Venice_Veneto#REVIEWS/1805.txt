Arrived early morning and my room wasn't ready but was happy to hear that I had been upgraded to an executive suite because of my gold status. Not much of a view from the room but I was very happy with the room and access to the executive lounge.  The hotel was fully booked so I was afraid that it would feel very chaotic, but that wasn't the case at all. The hotel and shuttle service didn't feel busy at any time.  I have never been overly impressed with the service that I've received at the Hiltons in North America so I was pleasantly surprised at the helpful manner of all the employees that I encountered (with the exception of the female bartender at Skyline bar).  The property is unique and beautiful, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 20, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comment about the Hilton Molino Stucky.
