Wonderful hotel.  We stayed in Venice three years ago at the Antico Panada because of the location near St Mark's Square and we were so disappointed with that experience.  Don't be put off that the Hilton is not by St. Mark's Square.  It is a 5-7 minute boat ride and the hotel provides this service for free.  They come quite often - I think about every 15 to 20 minutes.  When we arrived, they upgraded our room since we are Hilton Diamond members.  The view from the windows in the room of the canal were unbelievably beautiful.  I could have stayed in the room forever watching the boat traffic and especially enjoying the sun rises.  The room was large and the king size bed was so comfortable.  The hotel was very quiet.  I loved the Nutella stand outside the door in the courtyard. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comment about the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
