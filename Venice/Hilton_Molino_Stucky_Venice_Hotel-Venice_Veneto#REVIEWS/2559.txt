We stayed in Hilton Molino Stucky for 4 nights and it was a great experience. Even we booked a normal room we've upgraded and had a room with sea view. Hotel room was big enough and cleaned properly. Also free shuttle available to reach San Marco. I highly recommend this hotel to everybody who hasn't decided to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2015Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post your kind comments about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
