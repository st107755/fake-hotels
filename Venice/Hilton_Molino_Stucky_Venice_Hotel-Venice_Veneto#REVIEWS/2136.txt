This beautifully restored 19th Century flour mill is Venice's largest hotel. It's located a short boat ride away from the bustle of St. Mark's Square on the banks of Giudecca island. The Molino Stucky has a rooftop pool and bar with spectacular views of Venice and the lagoon. It also features a spa and fitness center with all the conveniences and amenities you would expect from a hotel in this price range, as well as several restaurants to choose from.  The service is first rate and the rooms were spotless and well-appointed. After spending the day in the throngs of people in Venice, coming back to the relative calm and quiet of the hotel was welcome.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 3, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
