venice is so busy, with ever one rushing and hectic, it is a pleasure to remove one's self and just rest up at this great hotel. the staff are friendly and efficient. we stayed in the tower suites which i rx to everyone. the suites are pricey but with 2 bathrooms, it cannot be topped. the roof top pool is wonderful and has beautiful views of the canalsRead moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
