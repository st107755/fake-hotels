We took our two teenagers away for a quick two night Venice trip.  We loved the location of the hotel as going anywhere involved the free boat -built in entertainment!  The weather was absolutely awful while we were there so the crossing was someone choppy and getting on and off the boat although not strictly tricky was a little wobbly so might not suit people with mobility or balance problems or even the morning after the night before!  We were given an upgrade upon checking in even without asking!  The upgrade also entitled us to use the executive lounge a nice free addition but not sure that I would have paid extra for the privilege!  Staff were great, rooms were very nice in a Hilton way which was perfect for us and breakfast was everything that you could have asked for! â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your comments on this website.
