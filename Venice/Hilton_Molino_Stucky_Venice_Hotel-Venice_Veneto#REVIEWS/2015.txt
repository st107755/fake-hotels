The hotel is in a lovely old building and the rooms are beautiful. It is a long journey from the airport- approximately 1hr 45 minutes by boat (unless you arrange a costly private transfer). There is however, a direct Hilton only shuttle service from the hotel across to San Marco. Do not expect decent wifi unless willing to pay for the premium service. The pool is stunning, definitely worth a visit to the roof (if only for the views). If breakfast is optional, I would give it a miss. Very conventional buffet style food that you would see at any hotel. The service is also very slow. I had well and truly finished my breakfast before my coffee arrived. Overall a lovely stay but it would be more beneficial to stay somewhere closer to it all.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
