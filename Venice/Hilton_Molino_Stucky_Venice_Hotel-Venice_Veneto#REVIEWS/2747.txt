My wife and I are checking out this morning.  We've had a wonderful stay. Location...we definitely liked that this property is separate from the main island. It was nice just to walk.  Our room on the 6th floor had a wonderful view. The hotel shuttle did fill up and I was impressed that the property called for water taxis to take us over. Excellent move.   We enjoyed the executive lounge.  Breakfast was excellent.   All in all excellent stay.  One minor hiccup at check-in.  Our gold status was not reflected correctly. Reception took care of it in a friendly and professional way. Moral of the story is to confirm your status.   We stayed in Rome 3 nights then Venice  for 3. In Rome the Waldorf-Astoria was fantastic but we both liked the Molino Stuckey a bit more.
