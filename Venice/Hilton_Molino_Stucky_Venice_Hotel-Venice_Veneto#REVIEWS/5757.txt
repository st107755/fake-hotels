Arrived at hotel from our cruise in the morning so our room was not ready yet.  Decided to have tea.  For 2 cups of tea 16 euros. Not a good first impression. We went for breakfast on our 1st morning which was a sunday.  Chaos.  They did not seem to be able to cope with the volume of people.  Tables were not cleared, you asked for tea etc.. but they would forget to bring it as the staff were running around like headless chickens. Service did improve on the week days so may be a good idea to avoid the weekend rush! We also found some of the staff sharp and unhelpful. Rooms were lovely with a great view and the rooftop swimming pool was great. However we would not go back to this particular hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
