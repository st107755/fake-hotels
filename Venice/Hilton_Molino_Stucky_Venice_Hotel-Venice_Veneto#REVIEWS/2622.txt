Stucky put us in a room which had a stronge odor, similar to manure.  The carpet was stained. We requested another room.  We had to wait for it to be ready. It also smelled and had a stained carpet. We called down to the desk to complain but did not get a response.  We opened the windows and got a can of room deodorized from housekeeping.  Later we ordered room service and it was delivered by Enrico, Room Service Supervisor.  We told him how unsatisfactory the room was and he immediately got on his phone and moved us to a lovely, odorless room.  We were quite impressed with Enrico's gracious customer service.  He is a true asset to this hotel.  Stucky is lucky to have someone like him on their team. He truly cares about the comfort and satisfaction of guests.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 1, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time and trouble to share your experience with other travellers on Tripadvisor.
