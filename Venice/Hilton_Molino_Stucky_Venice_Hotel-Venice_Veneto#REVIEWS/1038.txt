Visited this HILTON location for business.  Transportation was arranged by hotel and was efficient.  Check-in was efficient. Rooms are comfortable and nice but nothing extraordinary.  The service is attentive and professional.  Great view from top and pool was ok.  Overall great experience in a quiet part of Venice that is only 10 mins by the free hotel taxi to San MarcosRead moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
