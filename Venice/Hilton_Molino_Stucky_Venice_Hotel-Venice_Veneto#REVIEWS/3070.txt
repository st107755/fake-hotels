We went to the hotel for my birthday weekend in April, the hotel is so impressive, historic and opulent. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the shuttle boat makes getting about in Venice so convenient. I'd recommend getting a taxi boat from the airport to the hotel for the best views of Venice en route to the hotel!! The skyline bar is just amazing - the best views of Venice you'll ever see and cocktails to die for!! Would definitely recommend!!
