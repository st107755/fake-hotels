I honestly loved this hotel. It's like 5-8mins away from the central square of Venice but they have a shuttle service. But the location is so good that from the rooftop of the hotel, you can see entire Venice town and it is so beautiful. There's a nice bar and rooftop pool to enjoy the view.   The rooms are very upscale when it comes to posh materials used inside the hotel. Lounge had very limited food to eat but none the less it was delicious and had great wines.   Breakfast had a very big spread. The food was very delicious too. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely come again and would recommend others too. The staff is also very good to help you with anything you need.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 22, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
