The Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel, located on the island of Giudeca, is a wonderful hotel.  The hotel water shuttle to San Marco makes it so easy to get back and forth in under 10 minutes for a nominal one time charge. We had a great view of the Giudeca canal and San Marco. The rooms were spacious and clean.  Hotel staff was very helpful.  Restaurants served excellent food. There is a very small shop for a few items.  It would be nice to have a regular gift shop to pick up some items during the stay.  Overall, it was a great stay and we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 2, 2017Dear Patricia,  We thank you to have shared your comments online and for recommending us.
