As Hilton Honors Diamond Members we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Canal of Guidecca.  The room was breathtaking and very large.  They provided a rollaway for our son at no charge.  The hotel itself is simply beautiful and lives up to its billing.  Certainly worth the four year wait for the opening.  The current management was brought in from the Rome Caviliari (which is the finest hotel in the Hilton Family for sure).  The Executive Lounge in very nice.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The food is good but could use some additions to the service to be a true five star lounge in the future.  But it is a real bonus for breakfast since the restaurant fare is 40 Euro and the lounge breakfast is free - great benefit when traveling with children!
