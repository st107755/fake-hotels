This is really a Magical Hotel with History as it was originally a flour mill and Pasta Factory, so you have to have lunch on the top floor with beautiful views and of course divine Pasta. If its a hot glorious day as it was for us a swim and a cocktail on the rooftop pool are a must, these VIEWS are BREATHTAKING. The rooms are hilton beautiful and clean and staff are informative and friendly. Ferries and water taxis stop here and its about a 10 minute boat ride to St Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments.
