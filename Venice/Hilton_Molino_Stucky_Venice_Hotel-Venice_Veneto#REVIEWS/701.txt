We stayed in connecting rooms at the Hilton. It is not in the main tourist area, but we wanted to be in a quieter setting. This was perfect. The conceriege were also attentive and helpful. The water taxis were always on time as per the time table. The only odd thing was we were charged extra for the water taxis even though it would be impossible to move around the city without using it. I’d recommend including that charge in the rate rather than charging customers extra at check-out. We are frequent Hilton members HH and enjoyed the complementary breakfast as well. Well done,  Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 27, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky. It was good to read that you liked the location as well as our facilities and the service levels. I would like to take this opportunity to inform also other travelers that besides our shuttle and private water taxies, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / lines 2 - 4.1 - 4.2) station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our Guests and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
