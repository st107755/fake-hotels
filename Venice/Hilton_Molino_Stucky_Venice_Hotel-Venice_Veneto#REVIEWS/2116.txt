This was a return visit to this hotel where I had organized a large international conference a few years ago. I was very impressed at that time and was delighted to see that nothing much has changed and the hotel remains as great as ever. Efficient check in, excellent rooms overlooking the water with great views of Venice. It is easy to get to San Marco by hotel boat which runs approximately every 30 minutes at minimal cost. The hotel restaurant is quiet and serves excellent cuisine, and the outdoor dining facility which only serves dinner is very nice. Staff are excellent, warm, welcoming, and very professional. The hotel is a converted flour mill and has a very distinctive and spacious ambience. Highly recommended for visitors to this lovely city.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 10, 2016Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
