When you save your money for a special night in Venice and splurge on a 5 star hotel, you expect more than a poor night sleep, no access to the rooftop bar and staff who don't really care. Unfortunately we experienced all these things at the Hilton. The rooms are average, more 4 star like, nothing special. There was a "private" event closing down the pool and the rooftop bar the night we were there. I would have understood if it were a wedding or private party, but instead it was a party the hotel had sold tickets for and was completely sold out. Because of that, party music thumped until at least midnight and then a wonderful group of loud party goers hung out in the closed cafe that sat between two buildings of rooms until at least 3:30. And there is no free wifi in the room.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
