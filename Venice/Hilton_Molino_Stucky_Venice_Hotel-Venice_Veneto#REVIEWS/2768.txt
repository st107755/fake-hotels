Stayed two nights - large clean lobby and ground floor plan.  Felt good after Rome where things were somewhat "tight".  Easy access through hotel ferry or Vaporetto from "Planca".  Room was decent/American sized and so was the bathroom.  Getting to St. Marks was no problem.  It felt good to be back in a more relaxing location at the hotel after the bustle of the main island.  We had Executive Lounge access and the lounge was well stocked throughout the day.  Big breakfast spread in the mornings.  Overall a very nice property.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 15, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for your kind review.   We are very pleased you were satisfied with your stay and "size" of the hotel and facilities.   The closest stops to our hotel are "Palanca" but also "Sacca Fisola", since you do not have to cross 2 bridges as you would do if you get off at "Palanca".   We are also glad that you liked our Executive Lounge and breakfast.   We look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
