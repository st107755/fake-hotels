We stayed at this hotel as part of our honeymoon and wow this place is incredible! The hotel is situated on the island of Guidecca and you really do feel like you are away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. We ate at one of the hotel's restaurants and it was the best meal we have had in the 2 weeks we have been in Italy. As Gold members we had access to the Executive Lounge and an upgrade we cannot thank the hotel enough for! We also enjoyed a few drinks at the hotels skybar which has amazing views over Venice. Thank you Hilton - we wouldn't stay anywhere else!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2016Dear Madame, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
