Hilton Molino Stucky is situated on the Giudecca island south of the main city of Venice on the Giudecca canal. It's superbly located for all areas of venice and the complimentary hotel shuttle boat provides an excellent service.  We loved the roof top pool and bar and the hotel is bright and airy with very comfortable rooms (request a canal-view room and side view is OK too!). Breakfast was great too with plenty of choice. There are some good restaurants on the island - otherwise it's 10 minutes to the main stop at Venice city close to St. Marks square. A must is to take a water taxi straight from the airport to the hotel to arrive in style!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear guest,   thank you so much for your kind review.
