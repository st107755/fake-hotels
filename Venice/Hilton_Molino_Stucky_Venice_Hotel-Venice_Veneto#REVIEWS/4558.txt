Excellent stay at this hotel. Upgraded to an executive room and use of the executive lounge. Both very good. Hotel is a short boat ride across from San Marco, provided by the hotel, and run every 30 mins. Will definitely return.  Only slight gripe - 9 euros for wi-fi & 25 euros to use the spa. You would expect in a 5* hotel to have these facilities included.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
