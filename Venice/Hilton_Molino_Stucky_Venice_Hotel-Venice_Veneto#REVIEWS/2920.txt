We only stayed here for one night as we were in transit to another hotel in Venice. The rooms are good and there are 4 restaurants with a rooftop terrace (not very big by the way). Standard are as you may expect from this kind of hotel but not my cup of tea. Too big and onpersonal. I prefer the smaller hotels that you can find plenty of. But still a good base to explore Venice, be aware that the shutlle boat to take you to the hotel is not for free! Which inmy opinion is really a no go. We paid 3,50 per person for every time you use the shuttle.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 1, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
