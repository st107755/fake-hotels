A great hotel - clean, comfortable rooms (the beds are wonderful) - with excellent breakfast choices and friendly, attentive staff. It's big but doesn't feel impersonal.  We enjoyed staying slightly away from the crowds, across the water. You have fabulous views of the city from the roof top bar, and the hotel's shuttle boat service was convenient and punctual, making travelling across very easy.

I am pleased that you found the service friendly and helpful all over the hotel and I am glad  that you wholeheartedly recommend us to other travelers. I would like to take this opportunity to inform that besides our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes, so there is no need to take private water taxis to reach the city centre. I hope to welcome you back to Venice in the not too distant future so that we can provide you with the high level of service you are accustomed to. With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
