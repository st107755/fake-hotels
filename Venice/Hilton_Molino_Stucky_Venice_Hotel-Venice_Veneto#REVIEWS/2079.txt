On a recent trip with my aunt to Venice the conference she was speaking was at the Hilton Molino Stucky where we stayed. What a beautiful hotel with so many amenities, restaurants, bar, incredible rooftop pool as well.  Complimentary shuttle service to and from the hotel to San Marco. We were even treated to a complimentary trip to Murano to see a glass blowing demonstration then back over to San Marco. If you didn't wish to eat in one of the hotel restaurants a couple of lovely places were just a short walk down the road along the water with amazing food and outdoor dining.  The staff was pleasant and helpful in arraigning sightseeing excursions too.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 29, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your positive comment about our hotel.
