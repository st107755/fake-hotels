We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice for 4 nights on a recent two week trip to France and Italy.  We stayed in 3 other hotels and this was by FAR the best hotel.  Everything was awesome from the room accommodations, American style breakfast, location, view and ROOF top pool on the 10th floor.  we loved taking day tours of Venice and then swimming in the pool after relaxing watching the sun set over Venice.  The water taxi were very easy and ran every 30 minutes all day long. No complaints here and looking forward to going back.
