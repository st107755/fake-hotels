We had 2 nights at this hotel before joining our cruise, as a diamond member we were upgraded to a Venice view, it was a nice room but when the bathroom door would not close we were moved along the corridor, a slight inconvenience but not too awful. Breakfast was one of the best and the executive lounge on the ground floor was fantastic!!! Open from 11am to 11pm with friendly and efficient staff and a selection of snacks and sandwiches all day.We will definitely stay at this hotel again. the one negative was the swimming pool, whenever we we went up we could not get a sunbed, it was extremely busy all the time!Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
