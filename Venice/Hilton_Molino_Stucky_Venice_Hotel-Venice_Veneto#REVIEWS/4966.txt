Front desk and Concierge was excellent. Very friendly and service minded but the rest of the staff, e.g. in the executive lounge never smiled and welcomed you. Same in the breakfast room, the waiting staff there were almost rude. We only stayed one night so I did not make any fuss about it but the hygiene in the garden where breakfast was served was terrible. There were pigeons there and when a guest had left the table the dishes and leftover were not quickly removed so the pigeons had a feast. Then to my my surprise and disgust, the waiting staff just brushed of the table cloth and made the table for new guests. Haven't they learned that birds can spread all kind of diseases including salmonella?!?!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 10, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Molino Stucky Hilton Venice.
