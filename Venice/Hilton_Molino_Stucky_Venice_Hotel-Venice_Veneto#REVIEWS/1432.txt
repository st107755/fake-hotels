Couldn't use the skyline bar x2 nights as conference booked, then couldn't use downstairs bar as private function. Air con very noisy and didnt work well. Very busy 9.30 at breakfast and no room, food finished etc. Had to wait for service. Nice area but not 5* service. Booked twin room for our teenage boys but given double bed. Made to feel it was our problem and they did us a big favour changing.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 12, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time and trouble to share your experience with other travelers on TripAdvisor.
