We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel.  The location is on a large chain of islands just across from the main action in Venice.  The views towards Venice are incredible.  We enjoyed escaping the hustle and bustle of Venice and retreating to the general quietness of the Molino Stucky.  I recommend taking the water taxi from the airport directly to the hotel, 130 Euros.  If you don't, you'll have multiple transfers which could be a bit painful if you're not familiar with how things work in Venice.  The slight downside of this location is you need to either grab public water transportation or take the included Hilton water shuttle, leaving from close to St. Mark's square every 40 minutes or so.  We didn't find this burdensome.  However, at peak times the shuttle boat reaches capacity. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
