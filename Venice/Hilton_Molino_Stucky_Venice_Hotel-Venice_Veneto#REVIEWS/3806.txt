Really nice hotel that's "away from it all" but not difficult at all to get over to St. Mark's Square or the Zattere taxi stop.  I thought the location was great - Giudecca Island is much more quiet and residential so appreciated getting back to that after dealing with all the crowds in central Venice.  The Hilton water taxi is very efficient and is easy to catch to/from either the Zattere (close to Accademia and some other off the beaten path restaurants) stop or St. Mark's Square.  Also there is a Venice Water Taxi stop just a few blocks away from the hotel where several (IIRC) lines stop that will get you to/from the train station (takes about 20 minutes), St. Mark's Square, etc.    The property itself is beautiful, both inside and out - especially the common areas.
