Lovely hotel, immaculate.  Great free transport from the hotels door to Zatarre and San Marco (easier to go to Zatarre and walk to San Marco through very pretty streets as not all boats go to San Marco). Service lovely at all times and breakfast excellent and very varied choices, if you gluten free they have a small corner with amazing chocolate cake! Great views from roof top terrace and pool.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
