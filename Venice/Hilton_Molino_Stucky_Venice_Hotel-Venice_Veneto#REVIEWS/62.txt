It was a flourmill. The building itself is beautifully restored, huge and amazing. Located right at the waterfront. Some parts of the hotel are renovated, some still has old corridors and rooms. We stayed at the new wing and everything was just perfect for us. It has a rooftop bar and pool, but we couldn't enjoy sitting outside as we went there at Christmastime. Easily accessible from Troncchetto - just one vaporetto ride.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 15, 2020Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
