We stayed at this hotel from December 28 through December 30, 2010 and then again from January 1 to January 3, 2011. Of all my hotel stays around the world, this has to be one of the most beautiful hotel. By the beautiful river in Venice, ship dock right in front, free water shuttle bus to the St Mark's Basilica, very courteous staffs, good value for breakfast buffet. Upon our arrival back on January 1, 2011, we actually got the King Executive Presidential Suite with Separate Living room and Kitchenette. I wished I could have stayed longer....I love that hotel and especially the suite. Love Love Love.Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare
