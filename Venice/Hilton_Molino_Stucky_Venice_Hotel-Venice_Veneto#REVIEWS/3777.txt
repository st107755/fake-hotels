I stayed here couple of nights for business. The hotel is on a separate island, where there are not many other businesses, hotels or restaurants. However you can be in S. Marco in about 15min with the shuttle boat. The reception and lobby area is very stylish, and provides for good chance to meet people after work or meetings. The roof top bar is good too. The rooms are classical and clean, however not that big. I had to wait to get warm water in the shower each time. Breakfast is very good in quality and variety. It is very quiet and calm in the hotel due to the location.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
