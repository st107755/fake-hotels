We had an executive room with a view and what a view it was!  The hotel is enormous with a boutique feel.  Has every amenity you could ask for including a roof top pool with the most amazing views.  There is a shuttle back and forth to the main island of Venice for a one time fee of EUR 4.5 per person And you can use as often as you like for the length of your stay.  It is EUR 60 from the S.M. Train station to the hotel So keep that in mind.  Lobby is very comfortable and the service staff outstanding.  Room was very comfortable and of a good size.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 10, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
