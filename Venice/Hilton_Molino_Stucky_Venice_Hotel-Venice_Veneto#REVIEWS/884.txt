Though we are sorry for the inconveniences you are experiencing with the pre-authorization amounts charged to your credit card (which should be considered as temporary transactions and not sales), we are pleased to confirm that these are always automatically released on check-out. The procedure is an international common practice which is applied by major brands, as well as in all Hilton hotels worldwide. Please do not hesitate in contacting us directly at VCEHI_Reception@hilton.com if the amount is still blocked as we can get in contact with the pre-authorization office to process a request to release it. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
