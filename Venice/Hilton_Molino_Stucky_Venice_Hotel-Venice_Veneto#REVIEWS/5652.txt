Stayed here 2 nights after skiing trip. Booked on Priceline. Com and had a great deal. lovely room with all facilities. Excellent boat service to the main island. Extras are v. expensive but this is Venice Italy not Venice Beach Ca!! They need just to up their game on a few service issues as this is a 5 Star hotel. Room not quite properly prepared---old towels left in bath--no choice of pillows (v.hard) and coffee and tea bags not topped up. Also the courtyard tables were not being cleared and cleaned as on would expect for 5 stars plus litter in corridors. This is a management issue and they need to be on top of it all the time. That said I would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
