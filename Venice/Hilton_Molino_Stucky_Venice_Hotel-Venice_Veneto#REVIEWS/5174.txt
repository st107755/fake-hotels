Please accept our apologies for the lack of service you have experienced from our Magic Customer Service: your comments have been forwarded to the Head of Department for action and review. As regards ironing facilities, for safety reasons,  these are available on every floor in appropriate spaces for our guests but not in the guestrooms. I would like to confirm that information on the seasonal opening of our pool is indeed available in our website, where it is specified that opening is seasonal, from 15TH May to September.  Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
