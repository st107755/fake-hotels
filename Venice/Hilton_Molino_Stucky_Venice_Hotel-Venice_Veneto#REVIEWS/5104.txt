A nice transition to Italy from North America. At first thought staying at Giudecca was a bit of a hassle having to be dependent on the shuttle and Vapporetta, but after the first night real enjoyed the quiet  village feel of the Island as a getaway from the crowds at San Marco.Concierge was very helpful in assisting with travel booking and restaurant recommendations, Only complaint would be the outrageous price for internet and the loud techno music and lackadaisical service in the Skyline bar...but am quibbling...we enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 3, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your comment on Trip Advisor.
