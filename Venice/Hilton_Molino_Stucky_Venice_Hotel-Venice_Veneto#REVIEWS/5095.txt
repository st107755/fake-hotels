After flying all night we took a private water taxi to the hotel. We were greeted by a doorman in a tux and he helped take all our baggage off the boat and into the lobby! The hotel staff was wonderful and all spoke English fairly well. They up graded us to the 6th floor, top floor and facing the canal. What a view!  We had the executive lounge privileges  and had wonderful food, wines and bottled coke!!!!!! The room was big and the a/c worked well!!!!! We will stay there again on our next trip!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 3, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments.
