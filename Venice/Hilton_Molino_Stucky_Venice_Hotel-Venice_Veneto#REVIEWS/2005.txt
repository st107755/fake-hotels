The hotel is exquisite, service is great & is located on the island opposite St.Marc's Square. This makes the hotel more exclusive & less crowded/noisy versus hotels located on St.Marc's Square. There are frequent boat shuttles, exclusive to Hilton, to bring us across conveniently. If you do not wish to go St.Marc's Square, there are also several quaint little cafes & restaurants alongside the hotel, few minutes walk. Excellent dishes too. Additionally, there is a supermarket on the opposite island (3-5 mins by boat ride), which was great to grab some stuff.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 22, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your feedback!
