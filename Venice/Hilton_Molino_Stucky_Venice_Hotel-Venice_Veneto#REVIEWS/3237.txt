The architecture of the building and the views of Venice make this a wonderful place to stay. Thus shuttle service works well, but you do have to attend to times. Staff are wonderful. The executive upgrade is worth the price, as are rooms with a canal view. Rooms lovely. Terrible wifi - its an embarrassment for a hotel of this stature to charge as much as they do for room wifi, though they do provide free lobby wifi.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 26, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
