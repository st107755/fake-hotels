This Hilton hotel is located on a separate "working man's" island separated from the main Venice islands.  Even though a direct shuttle to San Marco square is provided, don't automatically use it.  The best dining that my son (who is a professional gourmet chef) and I encountered was on that island down at the vaporetto  stop.  Try it.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2017Dear Guest, we thank you for the time you took to post your comment on TripAdvisor. We are glad to hear that you appreciated our location. The Giudecca island is a nice and quiet residential area, away from the crowded city centre, which is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. Visitors can discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants and we are happy that you had a lovely experience in one of them. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
