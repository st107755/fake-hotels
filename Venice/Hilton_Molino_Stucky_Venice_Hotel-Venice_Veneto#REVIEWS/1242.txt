We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you appreciated our restaurants and the famous Hilton breakfast. It is nice to read that you liked the location on the Giudecca island, a lovely and quiet residential area, only a 12 minutes boat ride from the main crowded city centre which is especially treasured by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. I am disappointed that you did not not enjoy your SPA experience as we keep receiving lovely feedback from our Guests. In order to better our offer and give you the best possible service upon your next visit at our property, it would be really useful if you could give us some more details about what went wrong.
