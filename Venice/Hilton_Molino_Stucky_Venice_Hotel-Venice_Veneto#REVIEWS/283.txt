Stayed here the night before we left on a cruise.  Regent Seven Seas picked the property for us.  The hotel was clean and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and the breakfast buffet was plentiful and tasty.  The location may be a bit out of the way for some, but there is a free water shuttle to San Marco Square, and it was a quick water shuttle ride to the Port of Venice.  My only complaint was that they did not recognize my Hilton Diamond membership, so they would not honor my request to check out at 100p.  Not a big deal, but the woman at the front desk copped an attitude with me, which I did not appreciate.  Also, while the rooms were clean and comfortable, the hallways had a musty/moldy odor, which probably is not uncommon in a city like Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for choosing to stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky before your cruise.
