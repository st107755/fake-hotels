My wife and I stayed 2 days prior to the start of our cruise. The staff was outstanding meeting all our requests and providing excellent service on all accounts. Our suite was extremely well appointed and facing the courtyard. The pool/bar area had an amazing view and was the perfect venue for late afternoon cocktails after a day of exploring. This property does not disappoint.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
