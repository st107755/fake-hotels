The hotel is amazing! The staff are amazing! We stayed here 3 nights and loved it back in March! Please note: it can be hard to get to at night by public boats. If you do take a public boat, I'd recommend getting off at the 4th stop (sorry, forgot the name) and walk along the beach--It can get quite windy though.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
