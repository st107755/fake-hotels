The pleasure of visiting Venice was enhanced by our stay in the Molino Stucky. We arrived in darkness but could see the welcoming ediface of the hotel from miles away. A room with a view across to Venice was awesome providing a picture book start too each day. The staff and standard in the hotel were exceptionally high and access to Venice was easy and a joy to travel each day. This must surely be the finest hotel in Venice with the best view, great facilities and a friendly welcome, keep up the excellent work.
