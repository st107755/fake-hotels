We've been to Venice at Easter for more times than we can remember, but this stay at the Molino Stucky was fabulous.  We had a wonderful suite overlooking the Giudecca Canal (with cruise liners at the window) and Fortuny lamps in the sitting room.  The Executive Lounge provided everything from breakfast to supper - with Prosecco.  The private launch shuttle service took us to Zaccaria (near San Marco) whenever we needed it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
