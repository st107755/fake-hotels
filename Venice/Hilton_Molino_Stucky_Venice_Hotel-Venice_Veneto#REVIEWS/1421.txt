First time to Venice and this was the perfect location. Beautiful hotel, right across the canal from Venice. We're a Hilton Gold members so stay with them frequently, this was one of the nicest and friendliest as well. Hotel runs a shuttle every 40 minutes across to Venice for a $6 per stay charge. Good breakfast in the morning, our room was spacious and they have an Executive Club that was well-stocked and staffed. We loved being in Giudecca and ate dinner on the island every night. Also enjoyed walking the promenade and exploring the streets and alleys, quite a few small shops, cafes and bakeries. If you want a slower pace and don't want to deal with crowds this is the perfect location. It was quiet enough that we slept with our windows open!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
