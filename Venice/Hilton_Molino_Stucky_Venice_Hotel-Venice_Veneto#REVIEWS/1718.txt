My only regret about staying here was that it was only one night!  Stayed here after a Med cruise and absolutely loved this hotel.  The "free" shuttle (there's a one-time small fee per room to use it) to Piazza San Marco is convenient and frequent, only a short ride away.  The hotel is definitely luxurious.  I need to read up on its history, to see what this building was in the past.  Large wooden beams across the ceiling of our room.  Had a lovely view of the canal right outside our window, which was a French-balcony style.  I definitely intend to stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
