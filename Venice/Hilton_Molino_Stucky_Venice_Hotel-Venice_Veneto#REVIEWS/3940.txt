The Hilton is not on the main island of Venice, but instead on the neighboring island of Guidecca which is not an issue because the hotel runs a complimentary water shuttle to 2 stops on the main island all throughout the day.  Guidecca is definitely quieter than main Venice which for us was perfect, because we spent most of the day in Venice and it was nice to retreat to the Hilton at the end of the day and eat at one of the restaurants close the hotel.  The hotel has obviously been recently renovated and is much more modern on the interior then the original industrial exterior would lead you to believe.  The staff is very good, and Carlo the head concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2014Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
