Part business, part pleasure I/we found our stay here very agreeable. Service was impeccable.   We had a room with a view (604). Good size, Great bed. Nice sized bathroom with shower and bath. And a lovely view of the Venice skyline. All the gadgets you can need in the room, although the tv was a bit frustrating having to go through the Hilton menu EVERY time you turn the tele on! A small gripe.  The skyline bar was fabulous, pool sadly closed (but we knew this before we went), and concierge and room service very helpful and attentive.   Once you get used to taking the shuttle everywhere it is easy to manage. The vaporetto are painfully slow and crowded, and the taxis are lovely but hugely expenive. Don't be late for the shuttle, they don't wait and if they are full, tough.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for all your positive comments.
