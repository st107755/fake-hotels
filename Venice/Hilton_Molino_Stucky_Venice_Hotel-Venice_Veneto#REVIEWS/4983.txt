We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations. While it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  May I also advise that the area hosts a number of bars and a couple of supermarkets as well as a few good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  We regret the incovenience your have encountered with bringing food and drinks in the pool area, however the restriction is applied exclusively for hygiene reasons and for the safety of our guests. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely, Alessandro Cabella - General ManagerRead more
