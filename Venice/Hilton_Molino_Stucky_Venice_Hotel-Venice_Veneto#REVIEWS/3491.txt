We stayed here recently with a 7 month old baby and nothing was too much trouble for the staff here. We got an upgrade to a lovely suite/room and the place itself is a very interesting building. The best thing was a swim and sunbathe in the rooftop pool overlooking venice. Stunning! The hotel shuttle service is also very good across to St Marc's square. The only downside was not the best executive lounge I've ever stayed in but not bad at all. I didn't get to try the spa or the gym but I'm sure that would be great too. I would definitely stay here again...an amazing experience and nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 12, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive a review about us.
