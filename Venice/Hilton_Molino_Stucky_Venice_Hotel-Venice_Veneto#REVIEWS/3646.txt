My wife, son and I spent three nights in Venice at the Hilton Molino Stucky. We had a tower suite and the view was wonderful. The suite was very nicely decorated, and it had plenty of room (large bedroom, large master bathroom, 2nd bathroom, dining area, and sitting area). The staff was very attentive. The rooftop pool was a great place to hang out at during the morning. It also had a great view of Venice. We didn't get a chance to check out the bar but it looked very nice. Although we didn't eat at the restaurants, (as we preffered to eat in the local restaurants in town) we did order room service for our last night and the Stucky burger was delicious.
