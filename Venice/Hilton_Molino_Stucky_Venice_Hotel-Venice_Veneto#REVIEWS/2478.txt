Probably one of the best hiltons I've stayed in, overall everything was amazing!! Hotel room, pool, restaurants,  breakfast and shuttle bus service for guests available on the regular.  They also have a Nutella bar, so if your a huge fan then you will be happy to try out one of their amazing crepes!
