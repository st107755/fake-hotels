You will find what you expect from Hilton's quality standard but this hotel could be in any part of the world. It has nothing to do with Venice (exept the fact that it is in Venice). Because it is not on the main island there's a shuttle service to cross the channel and to go right to San Marco square. If you go to Venice (and you have to go once in a lifetime!) I suggest to choose a local little hotel in the centre of the city. Surf Tripadvisor to find out it.Read moreDate of stay: December 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
