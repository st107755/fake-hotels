Although the hotel is not in the main area of Venice, it's only a short ride on the complimentary boat across to all of the action! The hotel itself is great, Skybar and restaurants are sensational with some of the best food and service in Venice! Staff are there for all your needs and some, if you want to stay in a great hotel away from the action but still close enough to be there within 10mins it's the place to stay in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 17, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Staff.
