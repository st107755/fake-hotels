We loved staying on Giudecca Island, as it got us away from the crowds within Venice.  The hotel shuttle was great to get back and forth to San Marco.   The hotel is very large with lots of great rooms over looking the lagoon over to San Marco.  We loved watching all the boat traffic even the big cruise ships coming and going.  The rooms were very nice and typical comfort to any of the top hiltons.    You could not beat the view from the 8th floor pool across the lagoon into San Marco.  Awesome.     The breakfast was true huge buffet each morning.     It was great to walk in the open fresh sea air along the promenade viewing San Marco.  Made a great place to stroll or run each morning or evening.  There are many good restaurants on this island as well to view the city & boatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
