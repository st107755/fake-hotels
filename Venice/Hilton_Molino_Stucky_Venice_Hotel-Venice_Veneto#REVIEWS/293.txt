I travel around the world and stay in 4-5 star hotels for the most part. This is one of the top 3 hotels in the world in my opinion. The staff is outstanding and very receptive to your needs.  The hotel itself is gorgeous inside and has this amazing scent in the hallways.  Its unlike anything I have smelled before and it is one of my favorite scents in the world.  Absolutely a must stay if in Venice!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your extremely kind review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
