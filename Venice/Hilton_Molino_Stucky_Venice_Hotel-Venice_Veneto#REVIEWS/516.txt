Loved this hotel! Building looks amazing from the outside and is even better on the inside. We had a lovely suite and the room was massive. Loved the service we received and the food was amazing too. Defo worth it. They also offer a shuttle service for free which we used every single day. Stunning hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 8, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your nice comments on this website.
