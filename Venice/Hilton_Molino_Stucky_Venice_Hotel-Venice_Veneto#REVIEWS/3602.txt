We recently stayed at the Hilton as part of an Arthur Murray dance competition.  Had modest expectations given our prior experience with Hilton as a solid if unremarkable chain.  The Molino exceeded most of our expectations and provided terrific service.  Many very helpful employees - from the bell folks to Enrico, the Guest Relations Manager - all were extremely pleasant, helpful, and delivered on any promises made.  Room was good size, nice bathroom, clean with adequate closet space. The water shuttle to Venice proper and to Lido worked very well.  All in all, a good experience, and really did not miss not being in the thick of things.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
