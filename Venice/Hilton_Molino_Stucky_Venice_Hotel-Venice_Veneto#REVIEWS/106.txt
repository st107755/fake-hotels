Amazing hotel located on the grand canal with fantastic views of Venice. The hotel was a large factory built in the 1800’s and has been wonderfully restored, see my photos that I took. One plus is that the hotel offers its guest FREE water transportation directly to San Marco Plaza about every 20 minutes. Rooms were large, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large. The buffet breakfast had a large assortment of both hot and cold items. He entire staff was very friendly, helpful and provided directions to places of interest. One last thing the roof top bar on the 8th floor has fantastic views of Venice as well.Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
