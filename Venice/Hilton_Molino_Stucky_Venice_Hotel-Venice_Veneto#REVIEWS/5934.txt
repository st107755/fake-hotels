We had been given a written confirmation for a Venice view but were given room 627 facing ruins of buildings. We had to struggle with guest relations manager to get a venice view room and finally manage to get room 109 but did not realise it was just on top of Rialto bar with piano music going on till midnight disturbing the sleep. Luggage from room 627 to 109 took 45 minutes and reason given was group arrivals. Though a written apology and a complimentary bottle of champagne was sent to our room but it did not make up  too much a pleasureable way to start with. especially  as it was a surprise for my wife.  The concierge sent us in wrong elevator to room 627 at check in and we had to come down to ask for help again while still expecting a nice view which we were gonna have !! â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
