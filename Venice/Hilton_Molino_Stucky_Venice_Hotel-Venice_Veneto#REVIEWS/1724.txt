Not quite sure why there are negative reviews for this Hilton. It was beautiful!  The rooms were large and clean. Food and drinks are expensive but that's the way Venice is. You need to take a shuttle boat to st marks square since the hotel is across the lagoon, but they run frequently.   Would definitely stay here again. Loved the fresh squeezed OJ.
