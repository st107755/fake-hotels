When we arrived we were kindly upgraded to a two-room suite (Hhonors Gold card might have helped) which had a great view back over to Venice. Only problem we encountered was that we had to chase our bags after they were taken from our water taxi by the staff and dissappeared for a few hours. Rooftop pool great with fab views and breakfast very extensive. Free water taxi to St Marks ran on time throughout with no problems getting a seat. Concierge helpful and arranged water taxi to airport. Eating within the hotel a bit pricey but access to exec room gives some free food and drink. Overall, a great stay, and the staff were very kind to us. We'll be back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 7, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website. I am pleased to read that you had a nice stay and enjoyed our hospitality Please excuse the lack of service with your luggage delivery, which was certainly due to a misunderstanding with the bell staff. I have addressed the issue with the Front Office to improve the service and please rest assured this remains an isolated incident. I look forward to welcoming you all back to the Molino Stucky Hilton Venice very soon Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
