I can't complain about much of this hotel, yes the location is on a separate island away from the main part of Venice - but Hilton do provide a shuttle boat which is extremely efficient and convenient (there is an extra charge of 3.50 for this added to your bill).  We did not eat at any of the restaurants, apart from the main breakfast, which was really great, everything was catered for (including gluten free, lactose free etc.)  The gym (space wise) is a bit small - 3 treadmills, 2 bikes and 2 orbital machines, but it was empty every time I went.  The staff were really friendly, and I can say went out of their way to please.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 2, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
