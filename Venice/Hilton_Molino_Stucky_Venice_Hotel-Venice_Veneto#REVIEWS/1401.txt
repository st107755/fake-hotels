After much research we decided to stay off the main island of Venice for two reasons, the fact that this hotel looked really nice and a bit more of an adventure having to get the boat across to Venice. We made a very good choice! Hotel was beautiful, room was first class and the staff excellent. The breakfast at the hotel was also very good. Don't be put off by the fact it isn't on the main island there is an excellent boat service back and forward to St Marks Sq which costs â‚¬6 per person per stay and can be used as often as you wish. This hotel is a proper 5* and when we booked it was at a sensible rate. If you are going to Venice I would highly recommend it and I am a fussy traveler.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 28, 2017Dear Guest, We are glad that you enjoyed your stay with us and I thank you for taking the time to leave your review.
