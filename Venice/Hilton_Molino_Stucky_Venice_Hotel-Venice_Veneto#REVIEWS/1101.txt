We stayed at the Hilton for two nights and three days. The staff was friendly, helpful, and sweet. The room was spacious and clean, with air-conditioning. We were grateful it was located on Guidevva island across from San Marco on Venice island because it was a refuge from the insane amount of tourists.  The hotel and Venice is not cheap. Breakfast was not included and is â‚¬23 per person, including children. I was a bit disappointed that the pool was closed for maintenance 2 out of the 3 days we were there, but the staff tried to compensate by giving us a 4pm checkout the last day.   All in all, I would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
