Beautifully restored building, a former mill, now a hotel.  There is a pool on the roof top with stunning views, although not very large and no sunbeds next to the pool as you have to go to the lower deck to sun bathe. The rooms are adequate, nothing special decor is dated, but the hotel is under going refurbishment, we didn't get a refurbished room. The executive level lounge is good, and there is a wide choice of breakfast buffet. A few problems with getting transport to and from in the evenings due to the Venice Film Festival using all the taxi transport but otherwise its value for money.
