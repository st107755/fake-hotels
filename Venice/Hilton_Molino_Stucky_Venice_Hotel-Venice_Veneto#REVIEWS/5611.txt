We only stayed for one night and were using Hilton points, yet the staff at the Molino Stucky treated us extremely well and gave us free breakfast and access to the executive lounge. Their shuttle boat will take you from their island over to the other side and the hotel is just a beautiful restoration.  We booked massages in the spa and they did a great job and were super nice. Well run and completely beautiful setting.  Gets you away from the hustle and bustle of Venice but just a 10 minute boat ride away so you can hop over if you miss the crowds.  Otherwise explore Giudecca island and stay away from every other tourist.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
