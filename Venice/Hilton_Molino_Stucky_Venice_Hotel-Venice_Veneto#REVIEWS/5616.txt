My wife and I have just returned from a fantastic 3 night stay at this stunning hotel. Everything about this hotel is breathtaking, not least the amazing views from the lovely roof top pool and terrace. Sure, the hotel is not cheap, as you would expect, but we have stayed at lots of 5 star locations all round the world, and would rate this hotel, and its location just across the lagoon from the crowds, extremely highly. You get what you pay for!Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
