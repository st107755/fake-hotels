We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of a tour group. We were assigned a large room with great views across the canal and along to Piazza San Marco.   The room was spacious, very clean and had good bathroom amenities.  The hotel is large with a Skyline bar which would give great views over Venice. At the time of our visit the bar was not open due to the weather conditions. All staff were friendly and always available to help. We did not use the complimentary water shuttle service so cannot comment on the service or timetable.
