I stayed for a week and expected a quality accommodation but that is not what I got, what i got was even better, nothing was too much trouble for the staff here.  The room was incredible with 15 foot ceilings and the most comfortable bed I actually slept on in all my travels in Europe.  The food, service,  bar and my complete stay was 6 out of 5, exceptional that all I can say.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 19, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky, I am delighted that you enjoyed your visit with us.
