Amazing hotel with a great view and an amazing super bed. The hotel staff was very nice and effective. We had a great stay for our new year's eve. They also provided for dinner options for the NYE from 180€ to 420€ per person that is recommended to be scheduled in advance. At midnight, we had access to the rooftop and saw the fireworks launched from the Piazza San Marco.   2 downsides: the rooms on the top floor are very very noisy and the hotel was clearly understaffed. We saw a bit of chaos during the breakfast time. The staff was doing their best but they were not enough people to serve so many guests at the hotel. For me, this is not acceptable or excusable from a Hilton hotel and this is why I'm not giving a 5 star review.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 8, 2018Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time over New Year at our property and we thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
