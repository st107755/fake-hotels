Spent 5 nights in Venice for wedding anniversary celebration. Daughters arrange the trip and we stayed in the Hilton Molino Stucky which was absolutely superb. Great location a little away from the bustle after a day of walking the backstreets of Venice. Our room overlooked the front of the hotel with San Marco in view in distance. Hotel apparently was full, but during the 5 days we never encountered anyone else travelling the lifts, in bedroom corridors or heard doors banging during the night. Breakfast room plenty of tables. Facilities second to none with friendly staff. Skyline bar and roof top pool giving panoramic views across Venice. Hotel has shuttle boat to St Marks (and back) every 20 mins. Very punctual and won't wait so be on time! Small charge of 7.50 euros eachâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent and detailed review which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
