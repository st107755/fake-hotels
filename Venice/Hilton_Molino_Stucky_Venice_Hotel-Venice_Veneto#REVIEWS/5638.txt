We stayed at four hotels in Italy including the Molino Stucky.  While the "star rating system" is not on the same level as other places in the world (such as in the U.S.) this is truly a 5-star property.  The entire place was classy, rooms were appointed well, the service was highly professional and it was a great choice for us.  Check out the roof bar for an incredible view.  Our only complaint was the very expensive daily Internet charge (28 Euro).  This unreasonable rate is a bad decision on the part of management for those that only want two minutes per day to check their emails from home.  Other than that we enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
