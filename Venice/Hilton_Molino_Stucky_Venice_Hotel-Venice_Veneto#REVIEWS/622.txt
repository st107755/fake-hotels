We stayed here prior to a cruise. The hotel is beautifully decorated with spacious rooms according to European standards. The disadvantage is the hotel is across from San Marco and you have to take a water taxi to get there. The good news is they offer a free shuttle service usually every 30 minutes. However we ditched plans for a jazz show in the evening as the shuttle ends at 11:00PM.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2018Dear Guest, thank you very much for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
