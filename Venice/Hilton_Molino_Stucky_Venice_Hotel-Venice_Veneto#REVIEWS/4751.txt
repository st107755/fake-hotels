This is the most amazing hotel, situated in Venice on L'isola della Giudecca.  Excellent food...breakfast selction was never ending and great coffee, and dinner was of a very high standard.  The view from my room was breathtaking.  The decor was devine, combining old world charm with modern.  I had the best view from my bath tub.  Friendly, welcoming and help ful staff, with our very own vaporetto to take us to San Marco....
