Made what was probably our 12th or 13th stay here in July for the Redentore celebrations. Yes, the food and drinks are a little on the expensive side, but within a short walk there are plenty of other options available on Giudecca Island. A very small charge per stay for the shuttle is neither here nor there, and is good value. The staff are exemplary in their service and attention to detail, and Abdel who manages the downstairs Bar area is more like a friend now we have met him so many times. Just love the place, and can't wait to get back there, probably in about 18 months time.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for your loyalty to Hilton Molino Stucky!
