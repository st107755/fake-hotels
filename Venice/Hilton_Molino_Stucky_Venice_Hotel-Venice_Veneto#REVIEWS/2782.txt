Stayed 2 nights here in Venice and got upgraded to a room with canal and city views so that was great.  The staff are helpful and friendly and the shuttle boat to town centre was an easy and cheap transport option to explore Venice.  Wifi in room was weak at best if not functioning so that was a disappointment. The other complaint I had was the housekeeping. On our last morning we had housekeeping knock and open our doors 4 times before 12 noon which was check out time! The over eager service was not appreciated considerkng the first knock came at 8am!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 8, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for your review.
