In Venice this hotel offers the space and comfort which I craved after walking through the narrow streets. Swimming pool is a bonus. Arriving in Venice : The quickest way around 60mts i.e,, is by bus to Piazzale,de.Roma and take route 82 to G.Palanca. DO NOT get off at ANYOTHER stop... otherwise you will suffer with luggage and bridges. Fro Palaca straight walk to hotel.  Noice pollution is high. Meaning.. you hear deep breathes and sighs from next room..... not ideal if you stay with children.. Venice is IDEAL for couples.. leave your children with grandparents... enjoy..
