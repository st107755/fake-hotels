Loved the location!  Not in Venice proper, but a few mins from San Marcos Square.  We really enjoyed taking our boat ride to and from the hotel into town.  Rooms are great! The suites are basically two rooms with a small (unequipped) kitchen and dinner table.  My daughterâ€™s favorite feature was the Nutella Crepe station in the restaurant. Breakfast is pretty good and the lounge is functional.
