I stayed on business in this hotel for 4 days in May. It is a great 5* hotel in Venice. I was impressed with the free shuttle boat throughout day from the hotel to San Marco, the popular tourist destination, every 30 minutes or so. Guest room was spacious with a separate living room and bed room. I had two big LED TVs as well. Free wifi in public areas was fast in my iPhone. There is a scope to improve buffet breakfast. Being a vegetarian I didn't find it impressive. Didn't get a chance to see pasta or pizza in the buffet...:-) Also I found the gym being smaller than expectation in a usual 5* hotel.  Its a hotel I would definetely recommend for both family and business travel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 4, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
