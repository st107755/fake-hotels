There's a lot to be said for staying right in the middle of the action.  This hotel is across the channel from the heart of Venice, but the cab ride to get there is free...and it's a boat.  Who couldn't love that.  We've stayed "outside" the tourist area at Hilton properties in Paris and Florence and were very disappointed with the commute to the historic centers of those towns.   Similar situation here, but the commute is NO trouble and honestly, it's nice to be able to look back at Venice for the great view.  If you're burning up Hilton points and trying to save some money, I highly recommend this hotel.  Very clean, very nice, great staff and it's not your typical Hilton property.  7th floor restaurant/bar has an exceptional view.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 15, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
