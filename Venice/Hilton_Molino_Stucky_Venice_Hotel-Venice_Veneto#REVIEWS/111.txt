We stayed for two nights as a family of four. We had been booked into a family suite which was extremely spacious and well appointed - 2 bedrooms (second being a sofa cum bed) and a dining cum living room. The kids were thoroughly enchanted by the spacious room!  The hotel itself was quite expansive with an imposing waterfront facade. They operate a regular shuttle service to go to St Marks Square which is where most of the action is. So if you are looking for a quiet stay and yet be able to access the key tourist spots quite conveniently, then this is the one to go for.  The breakfast spread was quite adequate as well. We did have dinner on one of the nights at the hotel which was delicious. The reception staff were quite helpful and welcoming. All in all a very good experienceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
