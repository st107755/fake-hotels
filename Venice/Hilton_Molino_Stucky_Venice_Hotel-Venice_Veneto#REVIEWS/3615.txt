So when we were told that this hotel would be the first accommodation on our company convention before our Mediterranean cruise, I searched on the internet and was blown away by the pics. That could not prepare us for exactly how amazing this hotel was. It's location - nothing short of breathtaking. They even offered their very own water taxi to San Marco and other stops. The rooms were straight out of a Venetian palace. We had an awesome experience and would love to return someday. SaluteRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
