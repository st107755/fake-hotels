This hotel, an old mill, is a delight with free shuttle water taxi to St. Marks Square across the water and a near by stop too for the water ferry if the times are not convenient. It is more manageable  with local restaurants as well as very good hotel restaurants.  The view from the roof at night is fun! There is a pool on the roof too!  Watch the Ocean Liners arrive from the front of the hotel.   The rooms are appointed well and very comfortable.  Take a look!
