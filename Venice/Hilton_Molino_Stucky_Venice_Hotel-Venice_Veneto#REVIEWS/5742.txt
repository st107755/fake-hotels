We stayed for four nights arriving early (1100) so are room was not ready, we left bags and went exploring. We found the shuttle very reliable, but we also used the public water buses just a short walk away.   We stayed in room 646 it was compact but very nice as you would expect. We booked through hotwire and got a really good deal (room only) we heard the breakfast was great so we though we would try... 26Euro for continental or 40Euro for cooked each .... we looked through the window instead. we went to use the Skybar... its was expensive but it is an excluisve bar...  All in all the hotel is very nice, the location is great for views and only a short hope to the main island.. if you get a room cheap its great if you win the lottery then you wouldnt care anyway.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
