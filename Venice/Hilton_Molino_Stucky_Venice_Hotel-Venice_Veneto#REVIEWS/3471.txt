Venice is a wonderful city and one that must be experienced, however the Concierge Service at the Hilton Venice makes you wish you had never bothered to visit. On asking advice on where to eat or listen to live music we were told we should have gone elsewhere. I am however glad to say they were wrong, we used Trip Advisor to find a great Japanese Restaurant and found a number or bars playing good live music. Hilton do lay on a free ferry to and from the main city but it does come at a cost, if you are as unfortunate as us and get the same captain as we did, you will have to put up with his grumpy attitude and maybe even shouted at! I would have thought Hilton could have done better.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 22, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for posting a detailed review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
