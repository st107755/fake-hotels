Pros: Nice room, great view from room and roof, great bathroom, bottle of Bellini in the room, free shuttle. Cons; Shuttle takes breaks, you need a schedule, the public vaporetto stops at Palanca and is a five minute walk, you need this or transportation can be sketchy,  assigned us to a room that had not been cleaned and when we told them, they did not understand at first, when the bellboy brought our luggage, he called for us and they moved us right away,  This man was one of the nicest employees, we almost got left in Zattare one night because the shuttle stops at around 12, be careful.    I would stay here if I ever went to Venice, but I won't because after Rome and Venice I won't ever go back.  I feel traumatized by the attitudes of the Italians.  They were always cheatingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
