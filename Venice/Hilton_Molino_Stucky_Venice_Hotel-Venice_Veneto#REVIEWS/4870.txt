We stayed here four years ago and gave it a terrible review.  We were reluctant to give it another try but we wanted to stay in a Hilton.  We're so glad we did.  It has been completely turned around. The staff were helpful, polite and friendly.  The buffet breakfast is one of the best anywhere; a very wide choice served in an enormous marbled and mirrored room with bottles of Prosecco chlling on ice. And the free regular water taxi ferry to and from St Marks is lovely.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review.
