The hotel located not in the main part of Venice but just in front of it. There are hotel water shuttle and public transportation that will take you to any place in Venice. So the place is not very crowded.  The beauty of the location, it is not far from the port so easy to access about 10 minutes ride to the cruise point, if you are there for a cruise.  The hotel itself is quite big and nice, it is a historical building, if I am not wrong, it used to be a mill.   Swimming pool on the top, so some time for relaxation.  Rooms are good enough.
