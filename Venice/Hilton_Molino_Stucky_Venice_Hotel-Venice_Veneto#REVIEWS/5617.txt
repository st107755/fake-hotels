The room was small with no view whatsoever and the bed  was above average.  The drain in the shower was very slow and we had to be careful not to let it overflow onto the  bathroom floor. The room safe was broken and was never fixed even after I pointed it out on the first day of our stay. In my opinion it does not deserve a 5 star ranking although it has 5 star prices.. The value just wasn't there. We thought the staff was mostly good but even that was a hit or miss.  I not sure I would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
