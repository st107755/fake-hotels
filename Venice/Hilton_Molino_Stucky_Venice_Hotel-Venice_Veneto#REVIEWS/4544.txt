Despite our initial concern of the hotel being a (very) short boat ride away from St. Mark's square, this was not an issue at all when we were there.

The breakfast has a wide and complete selection.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2013Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
