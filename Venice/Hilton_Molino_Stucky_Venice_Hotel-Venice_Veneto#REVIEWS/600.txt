Spent a night with my wife there on our way to Genova. Hotel is very impressive building  at the entrance of laguna in an old industrial building beautifully refurbished into classy hotel. Room we got was overlooking the channel on 3rd floor and was spacious with all features and amenities you expect. We did use spa and fitness- both are modest in space but offer all the functionality. Executive lounge is actually a small separated part of lobby- a bit lower level than expected. Service is high class and breakfast is excellent.  Highly recommend for Venice visitors.
