I visited the Molino Stucky Venice in late June and found the hotel to be in a great location, on a seperate island to the main tourist attractions which ensured that the stay was peaceful yet getting to the main St Marks Square area was easy with the free shuttle service which was very frequent and made multiple stops to ensure you got to your chosen destination.  The staff were friendly and happy to help and made the stay very easy and pleasant.  I stayed for only one night for a work meeting and really wished i could have stayed for longer to use the amazing rooftop pool which has great views of the canal and the city.  I would recommend getting a private water taxi into the hotel as it adds a touch of glamour to your arrival and its nice and quick.  I will be returning againâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
