Stayed here 3 nights in March. This is one of the best Hilton;s (and largest Hilton;s) I have stayed at. The rooms were beautiful, especially the bathrooms and very spacious. The people that work there are great. The Venetian restaurant on site, at 1st I thought was expensive, but then when I saw the size of the meal and the quality, it was well worth it. Everyone that worked there was kind and gracious. Going everywhere by boat in the rain was quite the adventure, especially going to the airport at 4 in the morning. The one thing that struck me about Italy, is that they are sooooo appreciative when you tip them. They really do not expect a tip and a few times refused my tip. I would go back in a heartbeat if I ever get the opportunity againRead moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 26, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your positive feedback on TripAdvisor.
