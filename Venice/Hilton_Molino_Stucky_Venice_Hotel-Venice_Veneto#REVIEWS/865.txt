This hotel is absolutely amazing when we checked in the staff were very friendly and helpful the room that we got first wasn't great so we switched rooms and the room we got was amazing 3rd time lucky! We had lunch and the food was amazing. The pool on top of the roof had an amazing view and was very lovely and there is even a free shuttle bus into main Venice.  This was one of the best hotels ever I would defiantly come back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 1, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
