As a Hilton Gold member, we were upgraded to the lounge and an executive room. Ignore the review that says the lounge isn't worth it. They now control access. It is near the lobby but there is a key access door. Nice beverages and evening snacks/wine. Room was lovely with view of the water. We left our window open all night. Want to go back. ONLY downside is expensive airport transport. But that is true everywhere in Venice. Shared shuttle reasonable. Private taxi was 140 euros.   Thank you staff!! Loved our visit!! Thank you for the informative email the week before our arrival.
