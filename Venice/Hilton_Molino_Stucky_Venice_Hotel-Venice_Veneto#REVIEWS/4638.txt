We stayed here over the weekend of the 9th of February 2013. It is a large hotel, a very large hotel (it used to be a flour and pasta factory) and is situated on an island, just off Venice. The staff are very good and I couldn't fault them. The hotel supplies a free water taxi to Venice (a five minute trip) up to three times an hour. The hotel food in the evening is average but then you'd be better off eating in Venice town centre. The breakfast on the other hand was wonderful with free Prosecco! I wouldn't say that it is the cheapest hotel but then that's Venice for you!Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
