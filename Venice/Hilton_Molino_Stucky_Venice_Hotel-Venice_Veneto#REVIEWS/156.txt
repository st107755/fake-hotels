We stayed at the Molino Stucky Venice in August with our two children (4 & 7). The hotel itself is lovely and is across the grand canal from the main area with st Marks etc. That really works as the boat trips are short and frequent and you escape the crowds of central Venice.   The Service was amazing from start to finish (shout to Marco on front desk for his recommendations on where to go) but overall can't recommend this hotel enough. The view from the pool/roof top bar is also amazing !
