Service was outstanding. Room looked very cool, with a mix of old (mill history, wooden ceiling) and new. Breakfast buffet very diverse, with lots of healthy options.  If you come to Venice by car you can park at Tronchetto and take water bus 2, from just outside the parking, to station Palanca. 15 min trip. 5 min walk to the hotel from the station.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor and for the detailed information about how to reach our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
