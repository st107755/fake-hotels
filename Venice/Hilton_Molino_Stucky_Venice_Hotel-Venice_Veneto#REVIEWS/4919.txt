We stayed here for two nights as part of our tour.  The hotel, rooms, food and service were superb. I found the staff very helpful.  We couldn't fault it.  The location was so special...beautiful!.  I loved everything about it.  We would definatly stay there again and highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
