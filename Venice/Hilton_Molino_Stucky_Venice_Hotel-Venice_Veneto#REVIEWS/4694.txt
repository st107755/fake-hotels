Everything about the trip was seamless. Shared water taxi from the airport was simple. No lugging suitcases trying to find your hotel. The free hotel shuttle made getting across the canal easy to do the usual sights. We had a canal view room which gave us a beautiful view of Venice. The breakfast was outstanding. My daughter and I got a 50% discount booking with Expedia, so excellent value for money. I don't know I would go back to Venice only because we exhausted the sights, but would recommend Venice and this hotel highly for a city break.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
