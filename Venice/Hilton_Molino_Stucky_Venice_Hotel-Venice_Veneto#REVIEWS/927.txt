The hotel is all you expect from a 5 Star Hilton hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and big more than usual. The view from the window was so special . Breakfast was very good we were very satisfied. Ask for a room on a high floor facing the canal even if it costs a little more.  Don’t worry about the shattel boat to piazza San Marco it is very efficient . And it you come from the airport take the blue line. It takes a little longer but it stops right in front of the hotel. I  hope you’ll enjoy your stay in Venice as we did.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 5, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
