Wasnâ€™t sure what to expect since the hotel was not in the heart of Venice. I should not have worried. The island and views were inspiring. You are away from the crowds and can enjoy the small town feel of Italy.  Rooms were beautiful and well appointed. Service was impeccable. Staff was wonderful. Breakfast should not be missed. Everything you could possibly want. Amazing.  Travel to and from the hotel was easy, as was trips to St Marks.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2018Dear Sir, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky! Heartfelt thanks from all of us, it was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you have enjoyed your stay in Venice. Receiving such an excellent feedback really motivates us and pushes us to do our best every day to make sure that all our Guests are as happy with our care as you are. We are also pleased that you have enjoyed our location on Giudecca; the area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and the Island is something of a romantic idyll that attracts many travelers. With old squares, churches and wonderful views of the sea and of St. Mark's Basin it is easy to see why many artists are also drawn to Giudecca. Thank you very much for staying with us and we hope to welcome you soon again to give you other amazing memories to bring back home. Kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
