Thank you all for our wonderful stay at your hotel for our anniversary. Our room was truly amazing looking out onto the canal watching the world go by. The roof top swimming pool just added to our luxury after a hot walk into St Marks Square. The pool staff guys were lovely and so attentive.The private water bus was fab and so easy to use if you have the timetable you will have no wait at all. We used the restaurant for the evening of our anniversary and sat outside, lovely food and very romantic. Thank you again and we cannot wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
