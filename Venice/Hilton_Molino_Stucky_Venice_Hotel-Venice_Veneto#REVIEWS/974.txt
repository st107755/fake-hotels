Everything about this hotel is great except the rooms are a bit small,  its a ferry to most of the sites, and the restaurant is pricey.  It was over 50 euro for two cokes and two club sandwiches.  The rooms were well appointed and the whole hotel was beautiful.  Go to the rooftop pool for a great sunset shot of Venice.  Ferry to mainland was complimentary and frequent.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2017Dear Sir, thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
