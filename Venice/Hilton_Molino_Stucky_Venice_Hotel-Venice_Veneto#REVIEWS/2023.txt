This hotel exceeded all of our expectations!!!! We were traveling through Italy with a tour group and this site had been booked by them. After a disappointing stay in Florence just prior to this, we were overwhelmed with the accommodations, amenities, and surroundings of this hotel! The rooms are large and have every touch necessary to make you feel like you are at home. We slept the best out of our 10 day tour while at this hotel. The bathroom was large, had great lighting and was so clean! The grounds are just exquisite and the breakfast spread is out of this world! The view from the rooftop pool is absolutely breathtaking!!! I don't know if we could ever afford to stay here on our own but I am so thankful that we were able to end our tour with this deluxe stay!!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
