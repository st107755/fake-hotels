We stayed here 3 nights in October, pre-cruise of the Greek Isles. We flew into Marco Polo airport and took a private water taxi to the hotel (booked at the airport for 100 Euro for 4 of us), took about 30 minutes. My aunt took the public water taxi and it took them close to an hour and a half. It's way cheaper but takes a lot longer.  The location was excellent, right on the waterfront of the Giudecca. We didn't find a whole lot to do on this strip of land, but it's just a quick 10 minute water taxi ride across the lagoon to St Mark's square and the city side of Venice. The Hilton has a free water taxi that goes across the lagoon about every 30 minutes, with 2 stops, one near St Mark's and one a little further up the waterfront.  We opted for a room with a view, no regretsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
