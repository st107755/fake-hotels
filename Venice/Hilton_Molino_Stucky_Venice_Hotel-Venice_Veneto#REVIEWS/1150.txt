What to say.  This hotel is just perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Location is amazing, boat across is super.  Staff are lovely, all very helpful and the food is super.  We had a king suite which was fantastic and the executive lounge facilities although small were good.  Pool area was very busy but we would not have used in any case but its very pretty.  The stand out is the Skyline bar.  View is AMAZING! (and the cocktails are not bad either).  In summary, fantastic can't recommend highly enough.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 21, 2017Dear Lesley,  Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor related to your recent stay at our hotel.
