Very nice hotel with great rooms, a pool on the roof, an unforgettable SPA and the splendid Venice view from the restaurants terrasse! Despite the very active nights during the Venice summer, the room was very quiet. The hotel is located on the Giudecca island which is right below the Venice center. The complimentary shuttle to Venice is very appreciated to get to the San Marco place in no time.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
