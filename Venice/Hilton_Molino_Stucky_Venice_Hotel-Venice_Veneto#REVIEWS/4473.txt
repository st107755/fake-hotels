The Hilton Molino Stucky is a large, beautiful hotel in a fantastic location on the opposite side of the Canale della Giudecca from the main islands of Venice.  The view from the hotel of Venice is spectacular, especially at night.  The hotel has all of the amenities someone would expect of a luxury property.  The rooms are well appointed, clean and very comfortable in a style that you would expect in Venice.  The service from the staff is outstanding, from the bellman to the desk staff to the supporting staff in the restaurant and housekeeping.  For those guests that are part of the Hilton Honors program, you will find the usual benefits including the Executive Lounge, internet access, etc.  We found the breakfast in the Executive Lounge to be quite good and very convenient. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
