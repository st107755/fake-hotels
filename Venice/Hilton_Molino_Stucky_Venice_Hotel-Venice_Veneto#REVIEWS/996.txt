My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed out stay at this hotel. The staff from check-in/out and everyone in between were fabulous. The hotel is in a great location with transportation outside the front door. Our hotel room was very clean and (I travel for my job and visit many hotels), fresh. I didn't have to wipe anything down before I used it. Great views from our room (Room 418). The staff may great suggestions on attractions, food, and transportation. The food at the restaurant and executive lounge was fresh, tasteful and good size portions without being too costly. Overall, I would highly suggest this hotel for your next stay - It will be ours.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
