De luxe but lacking in a few aspects. The bars often didn't have the range of beers they advertised (no artisan beers, for example) and the choice was in any case poor for a hotle of this category. The private boat transfer to the main town was good, but ther access from the nearest vaporetto stop was poor with stepped bridges to be negotiated with baggage and no help (apart from at the last bridge before the hotel). Not entirely the hotel's fault, of course. Accommodation good rather than excellent.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Sir Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Molino Stucky Hilton on Tripadvisor.
