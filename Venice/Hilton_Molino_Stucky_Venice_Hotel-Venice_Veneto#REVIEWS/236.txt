Nice old building hotel with rooftop swimming pool over looking Venice. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable.  The club lounge is just an average but the breakfast at the restaurant was really great. We would enjoy the property more if the service was nice and friendly.  We never get Hilton service standard from this property.
