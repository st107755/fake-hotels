We arrived at the Hilton in Venice by private water taxi which the hotel kindly arranged. Even the trip from the airport to the hotel was magnificent and we saw all the small canals of Venice. On arrival the hotel staff we all very friendly and professional. Our entire stY at the Hilton was fantastic. They were very helpful at giving us information and transfers of places to visit, a And our room was very good with the most comfortable bed. The rooftop bar has great views with wonderful sunsets and the rooftop pool is lovely.  I would recommend this hotel and destination to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor with regards to your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
