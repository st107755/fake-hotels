We stayed at this hotel on Easter weekend.  The nice part about this newly renovated hotel is the fact that it is a bit apart from the oppressive crowds around St Mark's Square.  The hotel shuttle is very convenient, but if you want to have a quiet dinner away from the crowds, Harry's Dolci is a few minute walk away.  HOWEVER, watch out for the concierge. We had to meet our cruise ship and needed a taxi to take us.  he ship was docked DIRECTLY across the canal from the hotel. It was docked about a 3 minute walk from the hotel shuttle stop across the canal. However we could see barriers on the dock, so we were concerned we could not simply cross the canal and get to the ship.

I apologize if your stay with us has not been up to your expectations. Nevertheless we would like to point out  that our concierge team act always in a very honest way and tries to suggest the easiest way to travel for our guests. Going with our shuttle boat the opposite site and walk to the harbour (more than 500 meters) can be very difficult if guests have luggage. On the other hand, the public boat service doesn’t provide a boat stop at the little harbour in front of the hotel. This is the reason why we suggest to travel by watertaxi from the hotel to the harbour. You have paid the official public rate of 60,00 euro. I know that taxi’s are very expensive in Venice but the rates are determined and approved by local authorities and are not under our control.  I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to Venice very soon. Best regards, Mario Ferraro.Read more
