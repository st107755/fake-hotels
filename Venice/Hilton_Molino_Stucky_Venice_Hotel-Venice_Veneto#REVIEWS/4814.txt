End November 2011 I stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights and the Hotel was beautiful. Got a upgrade to a suite which was nice and big with lovely furniture. Also liked the size of the bathroom with the big shower. Staff was very friendly and organized a fabulous tour for me and some of my guests. Breakfast for good, just didn't like the restaurant where it was served, it was very confusing and too big. Had lunch there ones and that was very good. The executive lounge also served some nice food. All in all a very nice Hotel in Venice but a boat ride away from the main locationRead moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
