A very comfortable stay with good size rooms. Roof top pool and bar great and fantastic views. Highlight feature of the hotel. Hotel very clean and good service with friendly staff. Shuttle boat to san marco and restaurants from hotel frequent and very convenient.  Takes a long time on the public water taxi from the airport to the hotel. Over an hour.   Overall had a lovely time here and good location.. 10-15 mins from main hot spots.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for all your positive comments.
