Our family stayed at the Hilton Stuckney for a few nights before heading on a cruise.  This was our second time to Venice but first time staying at this hotel and have to say we were very pleased.  The hotel itself is very nice and well maintained , the service was very good from the front desk, bell men and restaurant staff.  Our favorite part though was the hotel pool and lounge area. A fantastic view of the grand canal and venice area both by day in the pool and night at the lounge. The free ferry service was as promised and very easy to use , a very quick trip to San Marco. I actually preferred staying across the canal as there are several nice restaraunts  near the hotel and a little but of reprieve from the crowds.  Overall great stay for a couple of days.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
