This is my second stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice, Italy.  I love this place!  You are treated royally and the convenient, complimentary shuttle to St. Marks Square makes it so handy to go back and forth during the day/evening. The hotel is lovely & the staff is so helpful with every request. You will never be sorry you chose this hotel. The aliaguna boat begins going to the airport at 6:30 am and is so much less than a water taxi. It takes a bit longer but the ride is beautiful. The Molino Stucky Hilton is one of the nicest hotels you will ever find. I loved my visit and I look forward to my next visit, already.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
