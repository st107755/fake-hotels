Great location. Great water taxi service. Breakfast a bit manic. Bar prices inc SkyBar unbelievably expensive. €33 for 2 drinks, €24 for a burger. €11 a bottle of beer. Some good restaurants to the right when you leave the hotel. Overall we had a good experience but only stayed for one drink in the SkyBar as it was ludicrous pricing.
