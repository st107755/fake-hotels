This hotel was booked for us by Viking as part of our stay before our upcoming Viking cruise.  The hotel is beautiful - it is an old flour factory that has been remodeled to be a hotel.  I enjoyed reading the information about the factory that was posted on the hallway as you walk to the breakfast buffet.  We had dinner one night in the Italian restaurant at the hotel - excellent but a bit pricey.  I wish there were more restaurants in the area around the hotel, but it is primarily a residential area.  Staff at the hotel is friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor. We glad to hear that you have enjoyed your stay with us and it was kind of you to mention a positive experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. The hotel is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the city centre and it is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good and excellent restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.
