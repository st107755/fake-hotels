We stay at this hotel a couple of days and found it to be wonderful. The layout of the hotel is and will confuse most anyone, so don't be afraid to ask someone to escort you to your room, its a maze to the unfamiliar.   The one night we ate at the lounge it was very slow, the crowd came in due to the rain and it over-tasked the kitchen, but that shouldn't have caused a salad and soup to take upwards of 40mins.  There is no concierge desk that is knowledgeable of the area, so when asking for detail on restaurants or boat activity you're left to your adventurous side.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
