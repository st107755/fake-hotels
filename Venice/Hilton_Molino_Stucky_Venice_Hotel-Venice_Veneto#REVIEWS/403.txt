We stayed at the hotel with 9 people (including 5 children) and had a great experience.  the staff was friendly and helpful, the water taxi was quick and convenient, and the view from our hotel and the roof top bar were amazing,  The breakfast buffet had a great selection and the on-site restaurants were fantastic.  You can't go wrong with this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 26, 2019Dear  Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience on TripAdvisor.
