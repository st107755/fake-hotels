During a recent trip to Italy ( including Venice)we stayed at the Hilton Stucky. Having stayed 5 star for the previous couple of week I would still recommend the Stucky as a notch above others we have stayed in. Great rooms, service and location. Travel from the hotel is by boat ( as you would understand), however the hotel has a free boat that crosses the waters to the main areas.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
