Six of us stayed here for a pre-cruise extension with Viking.  I was a little concerned about the hotel being on Guidecca but that turned out to be a blessing.  With the heat and the crowds on San Marco, it was wonderful to catch the boat (never had long to wait) and return across the water to our "refuge".    Our room was good size and well kept (our view was a brick wall, but we only slept in the room so didn't care).  We spent much time on the rooftop and watched  the traffic on the canal and the beautiful skyline of Venice. We usually ate our meals on San Marco but really did enjoy the rooftop bar food. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was very good.  The front desk was always pleasant and helpful.  If we make it back to Venice, this would be our hotel of choice.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 23, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
