We stayed here for 2 nights pre-cruise. You couldn't get a better view of Venice. It's a very short water taxi ride to St Mark's Square and all the other beautiful attractions of Venice. Getting from the airport couldn't be easier. The hotel itself is very impressive & the view from the rooftop pool is a treat. Would return & recommemd without hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 15, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your positive comments.
