We had a nice room, comfy bed and huge bathroom,after deciding to not pay the 100euros extra a night to have a canal view. Food was expensive so ate out most of the time as there was plenty of choice on the main,ad of Venice. The rooftop bar was fantastic at night with the views, they only open in the evening but it was fab. Do beware that the only way on and off the island is with the hotel boat which you pay for when checking in but which is not very big and you can queue for over an hour at busy times .. or a water taxi that is about 15 euros each way.
