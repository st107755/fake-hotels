We stayed with my wife 3 nights in Hilton Stucky in Venice. Hotel might be alittle bit far from airport however, Hilton stucky is amazing.Location and hotel is fantastic. Also From the day we checked in until the day we checked out all the staff was very very helpful especially Concierge Irene and carlo they are amazing and Irene knows everything about Venice. Also Alessandro in front desk is very friendly. The F&B staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet was excellent,service is the best service I saw in Hilton chains. I strongly recommend everybody to stay in this hotel. There were only 1 problem the carpent in our room seems like not been vacuumed almost like a month.This was a little problem but overall amazing.
