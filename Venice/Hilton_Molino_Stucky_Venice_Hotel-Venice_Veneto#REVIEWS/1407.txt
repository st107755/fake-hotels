Really enjoyed this hotel even though I'm a bit biased as a loyal Hilton customer. Our room had a fantastic room and was beautiful. I didn't mind the location since the shuttle service was very efficient. They do have a 39 person max per trip, so get there a few minutes early if you want to guarantee a spot. The only thing I feel like they could improve upon is offering (dont believe they did) a direct service from the Parking/Cruise terminal. I do believe they offered a direct service to the airport. We will definitely be back to Venice and will likely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear Sir, thank you very much for your excellent feedback on TripAdvisor.
