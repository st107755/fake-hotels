This hotel is right on the canal across from Venice.  The views at night are fabulous from your canal side rooms.  The building once housed a flour mill and you can see the original beams in the hallways.  The rooms have high ceilings, a big bathroom, comfortable beds and awesome maid service.  Anything we needed, they were right there for us.  The breakfast buffet had a wonderful variety of fruits, yogurt, breads, meats, lox, cheeses, bacon, pancakes and freshly squeezed juices.   You do have to take a water taxi to anywhere.  The hotel has one that has a generous schedule.  The other water taxis have a stop about 3 blocks from the hotel if miss the hotel taxi. The rooftop bar is impressive and worth a trip up to enjoy a cocktail.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 27, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
