We have read with attention and genuine interest your comments: it is only with the help of guests like you that we can maintain and improve our high level of service and quality.   We have carried out a special inspection in the room assigned to you and we did not find - at this time - that the carpet was dirty and not in proper conditions. We also carried out an accurate check in hidden areas and in the corners.  Also, in regard to your comments on the sheets and comforter, I would like to assure you that we always use shells / coverings for our duvet / comforters, which are regularly changed for every guest with the complete set of bed sheets.  Please accept our sincere apology for the inconveniences caused and if we failed to extend during your stay with us the level of service for which we praise ourselves.   We have taken in very serious account the comments on the room status and please rest assured that we have taken steps with the Departments Heads in charge so that these incidents do not happen again. Thank you for praising our Team Members with whom we will share your positive feedback on their work. We do trust you will forgive the lack of service you have experienced this time and we hope to welcome you again at the Molino Stucky Hilton in Venice. Kind regards. Mario Ferraro General ManagerRead more
