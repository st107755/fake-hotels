We spent three nights at the Molino Stucky on Hilton points.  The staff is trained in amazing service!  We took advantage of the Executive Lounge in the evening and the fabulous breakfast each morning.  It's easy to take the complimentary water shuttle into Venice - running every 30-60 minutes.  The view of the city from the roof-top bar is amazing!  We spent a wonderful evening relaxing and having drinks there.  The only difficulty we had was a young waiter who kept asking to be paid in cash (without presenting a bill).  We insisted on charging to our room and asked for a written receipt.  He did oblige when we insisted.  If you can get a good rate on the rooms - it is worth it to stay here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
