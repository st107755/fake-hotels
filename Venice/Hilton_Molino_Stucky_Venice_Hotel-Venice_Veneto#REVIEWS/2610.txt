If you read several reviews, you'll see some complaints about the free water shuttle.  I'm amazed at the number of people who are "penny wise and pound foolish."  The shuttle does not run every 30 minutes 24/7.  So we bought unlimited travel passes on the vaporettos.  If the free shuttle was available, we took it.  If no shuttle was available, we just jumped on the vaporetto.    We spent 40 Euros each, but used 120 Euros each worth of trips.  This was really valuable for short hops along the Grand Canal.  Since it was already paid for, we took transit for only two or three stops saving us a lot of walking.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Guest, thank you very much for your positive feedback.
