This hotel has everything, style, ambience and good food. We stayed in April 2014 for a long weekend, bed and breakfast and the buffet was exceptional. Staff were very pleasant and the location ideal. A short FREE boat ride across the canal and you are in the heart of Venice.  We decided not to visit the cocktail bar as the drink tariff was expensive compared to the UK.  We look forward to visiting again soon.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website with regards to your stay last Spring at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
