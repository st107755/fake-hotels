The Molino Stuckey is a great hotel set across the channel from Venice. The views are fantastic, especially if you go to the rooftop bar.  Rooms are spacious and estremely clean and nicely decorated.  We had a great view from our room of the old Vencie downtown. Restaurants were excellent. We also dined in the mornings in the business cafe next to the lobby.  There is also a sitdown restaurant in the back of the lobby area that is also excellent. If you can get a room facing Venice, you will not be disappointed!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 16, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky, we are delighted that you had a pleasant stay with us!
