We were moved to the Hilton Stucky by our booked hotel because of a fire and wished we could have stayed for the duration.  It looks onto the main island with St Marco Sq and has a regular free shuttle service to and fro. Lovely bar and fantastic breakfast. Room was good (not fantastic) but overlooked another building. A room with a view would have been superb.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
