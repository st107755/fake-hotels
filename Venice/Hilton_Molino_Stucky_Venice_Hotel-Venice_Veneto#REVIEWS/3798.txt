My experience in Veneza was great from the beggining till the end. This Hotel is very charming, was built in an old factory and is very well preserved. Although the hotel is not in the main island, you can easily catch the free boat to the city center in every half an hour.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
