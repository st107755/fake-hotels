This hotel was absolutely wonderful just one flaw.. the beautiful rooftop pool closes at 730 pm. I was so looking forward to relaxing  in the pool and gaze at the city lights. The pool door was locked and when I asked why I was told I could come back in the morning well I had to leave for my flight by 700A   It was such a let down.  Do not know why the  pool closes so early?Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
