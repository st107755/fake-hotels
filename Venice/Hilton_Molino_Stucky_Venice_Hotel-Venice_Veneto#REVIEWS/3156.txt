This was a very nice place to stay! Rooms had an interesting ceiling and wifi was only available in lobby. They had a free shuttle to the main island which was great but they do charge €2,5 per person! Hotel was located on the quieter island which was nice but harder to find place to eat. The staff was very nice and friendly!
