We arrived at the hotel and were amazed by the building itself. It is absolutely beautiful and what an architectural treasure.  Gloria at the reception was absolutely wonderful, and checked us in with no problems at all. The room was great and all hotel amenities were absolutely perfect. Breakfast was very good with a little bit of everything for every taste. Hotel kindly provided free shuttle (not free I suppose, it's included in your city tax) to the main drag and location was no problems at all, in fact we enjoyed peace and quietness and being away from the crowds after long walks in Venice. The only disappointment we had - some staff, they seem to be a bit rude for no reason. There were few experiences when we didn't even understand why they even had to be so rude.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
