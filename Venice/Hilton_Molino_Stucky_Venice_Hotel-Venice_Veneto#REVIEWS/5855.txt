Stunning views from the roof top bar and pool area although drinks in these areas are very very expensive. Had room looking over water and the cruise ships going by were an amazing sight. Rooms good size and well furnished however housekeeping service not as expected.   The hotel is on an island with a free water bus across to St Marks and runs every 30 minutes which is a bit of an inconvenience if out sightseeing all day and back out again at night for dinner.
