I just read of a fellow Diamond member and was disappointed to find that the hotel took points for OUR upgrade and it was to a room with only ONE view of Venice (the other member mentions TWO views? - corner suite? )  I would have thought that if they were going to give an upgrade, they would NOT have taken the points, and we are ALWAYS given an upgrade, being Diamond for many, many years . This definitely puts a dampener on what was otherwise a pleasant stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.  We are sorry that the room upgrade was not really at your complete satisfaction, which perhaps was due to a high occupancy level. As you know, we are always glad to upgrade our Diamond members according to room availability. As the hotel offers a number of room types, we cannot always guarantee the highest category. Nevertheless we hope you enjoyed your stay at the Molino Stucky Hilton and that you will visit us again. Sincerely Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
