Spent 3 days recently at this hotel. It is a rather unique hotel both as far as location and architecturally. We were given a suite during our stay which was beautiful and looked directly onto the canal. Fantastic service from all staff, ladies in the restaurant (Hyrie i think!) deserve a mention. One point regarding the executive lounge. The location of the lounge in my opinion is not great, it is very small and each night of our stay we had to wait for a seat. Food and drink choice was great, just move the lounge elsewhere the hotel is big enough to have another somewhere else!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 18, 2017Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review on TripAdvisor.
