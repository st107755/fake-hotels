We were booked into the hotel with a group so we had no choice. The location is inconvenient as you have to wait for their water taxi shuttle to take you back and forth to the center of Venice. We also had a problem at check-in. We were assigned a room with twin beds instead of king size (or at least a double!). It took a long time to convince the manager that this was not acceptable and we wanted the room that was requested. He finally "found" a king size bed for us in Room 432. Don't take it. It's much too small. And like so many of the 5-star hotels, the free WiFi is only in the public areas. Luckily we were only there only two nights.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 13, 2015Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12' minutes. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
