I loved our stay at this beautiful hotel.  I loved being on Giudecca Island away from the maddening crowd in Venice proper. The hotel is modern, clean, beautiful has a great rooftop pool (although not enough seating at the pool) overlooking Venice and St. Marco basin.  Nice dinner at Baccaromi.  Both front desk help and concierge were top notch.  The only complaint I have is that the woman who checked us in told us that breakfast would be 15 Euros and when we went to breakfast it was 30 Euros per person (which we bargained down to 15 Euros).  It was one of the worst hotel breakfasts I've ever had.  It would be better to get a continental breakfast in the bar area as we did one day.  Better yet just a few doors away is very reasonable breakfast food.  They should be ashamed…Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 21, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotel’s facilities. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you appreciated our Staff and hospitality. It is nice to read that you appreciated the location on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, only a 12 minutes boat ride from the main crowded city centre which is especially treasured by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. I am disappointed that you did not not enjoy our Breakfast experience as we keep receiving lovely feedback from our guests. In order to better our offer and give you the best possible service upon your next visit at our property, it would be really usefull if you could give us some more details about what went wrong. We place great value on guests’ opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
