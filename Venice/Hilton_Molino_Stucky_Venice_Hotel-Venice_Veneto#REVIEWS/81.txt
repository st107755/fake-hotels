Excellent hotel. Beautiful views of Venice across the canal. Easy access to the city and St Marco Square via hotelâ€™s water shuttle for one minimum fee for the entire stay. Breakfast buffet offered a nice variety and was delicious. Rooftop bar offered spectacular views of the city. Service was wonderful.
