I would highly recommend this hotel. It's in a fantastic location with regular shuttles in to other parts of venice.  All of the amenities are spotlessly clean and the whole hotel is beutifully decorated.  A little expensive perhaps but worth the outlay for a very relaxing night's stay.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
