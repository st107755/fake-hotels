Great hotel, it is the second time I have stayed here. Hotel is clean, comfortable and provides a wonderful breakfast. The boat service is very efficient and free to a couple of stops over the other side of the water. This time it was winter so I missed out on the rooftop pool, I remember this being a very welcome part of the day after walking around Venice in the sunshine. There is also a lovely cocktail bar on the roof with great views. Find the food a bit expensive so tend to eat in Venice before returning to the hotel. Free wifi in reception.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 11, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you so much for taking the time to write a review on Tripadvisor and for coming back for the second time at our hotel!
