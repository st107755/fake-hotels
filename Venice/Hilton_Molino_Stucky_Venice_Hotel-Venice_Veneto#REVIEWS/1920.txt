It's a large hotel and the location is perfect, away from the busy downtown Venice.The hotel has it's own transfers(charged to your room) to go to central Venice.The lobby is newly refurbished and we had a large sea view room with a view of Venice on the opposite side.The room was clean with all the amenities but dated but I heard they are refurbishing the rooms which will be very good.It has the best breakfast in town,The vast choice and variety offered is better than any other Hilton's I have stayed. Staff very welcoming and helpful. It's not cheap to stay but I would recommend  this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your positive review on TripAdvisor.
