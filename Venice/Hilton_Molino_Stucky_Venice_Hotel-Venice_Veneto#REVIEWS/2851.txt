First time in this Hilton although we've been to Venice many times before. This is a fabulous hotel. They 'picked us up' at San Marco Airport, drove us to the water taxi pier and we enjoyed the 20 minute journey to the hotel pier; couldn't have been easier. It was pricey at 225 Euros but it was worth it for no hassle. Our Room - 624 was spotless and equipped with everything you'd expect from a Hilton. We used the Hotel's water bus (small charge of 7 Euros added to your bill) to get back & forth to St Mark's Square. It would have been more convenient if it was more frequent (hourly) but it was slightly more frequent to Zattero (Academia).
