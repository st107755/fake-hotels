This hotel is across the waterway from the city centre - it's good for me, as the city centre can get extremely crowded. There is a water shuttle that goes every 40 minutes between the hotel and the city centre. Staff are friendly and helpful. Good wifi reception throughout the hotel. Breakfast is good.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your excellent feedback on TripAdvisor, it is important for us to know that you enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
