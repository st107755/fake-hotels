One of the best 5 star Hilton Hotels we have had the pleasure of staying in. The staff in all their respective departments, knew exactly what is required in a hotel of this grade, so I take my hat off to the General Manager who is doing an excellent job. We had a room on the 6th floor looking over the river, which gave us an excellent view. The hotel has a very relaxing feel of openness and cleanliness. The food in the restaurant is good, the choice of food for breakfast is excellent. Highly recommended. You will not be disapointed.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 31, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
