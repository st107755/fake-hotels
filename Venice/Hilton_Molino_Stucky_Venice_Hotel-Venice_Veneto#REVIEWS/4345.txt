Beautiful hotel and excellent water view. Very nice mixture of food to choose from with 4 different restaurants.  They have several pieces of Venetian glass on display that are gorgeous. The room we stayed in faced the water so we had an excellent view of the city and all the water traffic. Several cruise ships sailed by and we could open our window and wave to them. Our room was always very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful answering questions.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
