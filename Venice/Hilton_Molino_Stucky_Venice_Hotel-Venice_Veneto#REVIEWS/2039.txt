My wife and I were in Venice for the first time before going on a cruise.    We arranged through the hotel to have a water taxi and greeter meet us at the airport.  Everything went smoothly.  Getting to see the Grand Canal and some of the smaller canals was a great introduction to Venice.  We were upgraded to a Family Suite since we are Diamond.  Very nice.  The breakfast buffet was superb.  Everything you could ever want.  The hotel's water taxi to San Marco was convenient.  The concierge gave us a couple of great recommendations on places to have dinner that were a short walk from the hotel.  Will definitely stay again when in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 13, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
