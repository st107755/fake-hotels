Starting our vacation off in Venice, Italy, we stayed at the Hotel Molino Stucky.  It was everything we expected and more.  Rooms are so lovely and service is excellent.  The restaurants in the hotel are very good.  The spa area was a real treat.  We were also very pleased with the excursions through the hotel.  They have only one small gift shop and I think they would do well to offer others or even a larger shop.  It truly is worth staying here.
