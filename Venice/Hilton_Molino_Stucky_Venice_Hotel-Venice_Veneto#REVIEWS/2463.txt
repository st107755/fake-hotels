I must say the Hilton Molino Stucky ticks every box starting from checkin by the very professional Silvia, she made the complexity of the layout of this big building so easy, the room very beautiful loved the beams on the roof, lovely great Canal view, the shuttle to main Venice runs on time regularly and breakfast just great food and service and executive lounge I didn't like its location but the offering and staff were great. Only small thing the gym could be bigger in such a big building.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear Mr. Gassim,   thank you so much for your positive review.
