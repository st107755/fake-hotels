Excellent position on  Giudecca island away from the maddening crowds of Venice in august. Historical building with the comfort of today. Well suited to our needs for the 2 day stay. Our room was on the 3rd floor with a view of a small  joining canal overlooking neighbouring gardens. Not as picturesque as a view of Venice but quiet. Several canal side restaurants offering local fare at reasonable prices within a few minutes stroll from Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
