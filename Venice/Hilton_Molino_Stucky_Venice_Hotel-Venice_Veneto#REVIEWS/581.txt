Just returned from a four night stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Itâ€™s on Guidecca Island, which is just across the bay from st Marks Square.  The hotel provides a shuttle boat too and from St Marks Square.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff very helpful.  As Hilton honours members we were upgraded to an executive room, which was very spacious and comfortable and also included use of the executive lounge where we had breakfast.  Guidecca is a quiet haven away from the crowds of Venice and we ate at restaurants along the front in the evenings with beautiful views across the bay but in peace and quiet and at a quarter of the price.  This is the best Hilton we have ever stayed at.Read moreDate of stay: August 20183 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2018Dear Madame, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
