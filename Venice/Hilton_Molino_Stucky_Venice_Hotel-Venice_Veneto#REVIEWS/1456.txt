Spacious room with two wall to ceiling windows, giving a lot of natural light. Only a cupboard under the TV to put clothes in, and nowhere to hang coats/jumpers. Beds are very comfortable, with soft pillows. Could have done with a hairdryer in the room. Beds were tall but bery comfortable. Staff were lovely and helpful,  although they did try and get us to pay the shuttle boat fee, when we specified we didn't use it. The hotels position may seem a tad inconvenient, but you have a lovely view of the rest if Venice. You can get regular boats between the island and St Marks square/train station from a few hundred meters from the hotel. There is also the hotels shuttle boat between the hotel and St Marks square at the cost of â‚¬6.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
