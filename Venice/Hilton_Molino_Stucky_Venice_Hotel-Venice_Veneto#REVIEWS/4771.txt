Myself and my husband have just visited the hotel for a short honeymoon break. This hotel is large but very well presented and staff members are very polite, professional,and extremely well organised.  We were upgraded to a king suite with a lovely view over the water at the front of the hotel We had a bottle of prosecco and chocolate strawberries waiting for us on our arrival. The room was lovely and clean and lovely furnished. Breakfast (buffet style) was really great with the best choice I have ever known/ experienced in a hotel. This hotel is worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor.
