This is ana amazing hotel away from the crowds. The service is excellent, the breakfast is great and the prices are reasonable. If you go to Venice you must stay here, at Guidecca island. The best part is that next to the hotel there are restaurants, an art gallery and the hotel's private ships that take you to Venice. Would recommend without doubt!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear  Guest, We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and thank you for taking the time to leave your review.
