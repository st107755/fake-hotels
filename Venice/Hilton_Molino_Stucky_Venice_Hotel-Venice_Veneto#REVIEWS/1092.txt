Personally I like the small boutique hotels within Venice proper...the charm and wandering the alleyways day and night.  However, my husband and I are Hilton Diamond Members so we stay at this hotel when we are in Venice.  It is lovely, charming with a rooftop pool and incredible views of Venice.  The hotel has a boat that will take you to St. Marks Square easily.  The service is excellent and the breakfast buffet is incredible.  I do not care for the executive lounge and would like it in a more private setting with better selections. The location is wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
