We stayed here in December and before I arrive I was slightly apprehensive regarding the hotels location. This actually turned into being one of the main positives of the hotel. The views were totally amazing! It was nice to come away from the hustle and bustle of an evening and we went to some lovely restaurants on the island at night. Although you can still use the shuttle till late.  The hotel itself was stunning. As it was near Christmas they a beautiful tree with lights all around the hotel.  I would certainly recommend this hotel for a stay in Venice! We also used the private water taxi service directly to the hotel from the airport! This is definitely a must do for arriving to this amazing city!! Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
