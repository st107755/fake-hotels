Four fantastic days in Venice the hotel was magnificent, lovely room great service, fantastic buffet breakfast.  The staff were very helpful they had a courtesy water taxi which was a great way to get round Venice.  The hotel is situated over the canal from St Mark's Square but in a great location.  The vacation was lovely and the hotel couldn't have done anything better.  This is a great place for couples, family who are touring Venice.  We arrived at the hotel by private water taxi 100 euro and left the same way it was a great way to arrive and leave Venice.  A memorable holiday indeed.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
