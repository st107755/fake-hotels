Loved the site, very secluded and that's why you have a view of venice from far. All I wanted was to see ghee view from the pool even though its nkt the season, but you are not even allowed in the area. So the pool isn't closed, its the WHOLE rooftop. Also wish the tubs were a little bigger and the maids walked in twiceRead moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Guest Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that information on the seasonal opening of our pool is available on our website where it is specified that opening is seasonal, from mid May to September. We are sorry if this was unclear and that you were expecting the pool to be open. However winters are rather cold in Venice with freezing temperatures. For this reason, while our Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day throughout the year, the pool area opens in the later Spring. Once again thank you for being or guest and for your feedback, which is a fundamental source to evaluate our efficiency and determine areas of improvement in service. We look forward to welcoming you with us again in the near future.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
