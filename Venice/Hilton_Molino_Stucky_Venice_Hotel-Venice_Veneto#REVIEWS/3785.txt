The location is spectacular, right on the Grand Canal.  Service was efficient and rooms an excellent quality as we have come to expect from Hilton.  A really sympathetic conversion of a historic building, great pool on the roof and our son loved being able to watch the cruise liners passing right by the window.  Breakfast service was a bit chaotic but it didn't detract from our stay at all.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
