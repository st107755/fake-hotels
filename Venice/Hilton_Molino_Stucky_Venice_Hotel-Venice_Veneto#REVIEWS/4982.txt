spent three nights here.  staff was friendly and very helpful.  regular shuttle boat to get to the main part of venice - easy access and timely.  rooms were clean and comfortable.  pool on the roof has spectacular views.  pool area is a bit tight - but the water was great.  would definately stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
