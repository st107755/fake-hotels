We just left this hotel after 4 days following a cruise.  I was basically jumped on by a strange man in the hot tub and when my husband insisted that I bring it to the attention of front desk Staff, I was basically ignored as no follow up occured whatsoever.   The waitresses in the main dining room couldn't possibly have been more rude.  The room was nice as was the hotel, but definitely not nearly nice enough for the very heavy price tag and absolutely aweful service and client care.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 5, 2016Dear Madame, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
