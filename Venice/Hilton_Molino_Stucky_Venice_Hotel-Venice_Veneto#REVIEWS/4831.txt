I reserved a room in this hotel primarily because I love the Hilton brand and of course i am a HHonors member.  It is my first time in Venice with my husband and we wanted to stay at a luxurious hotel. We arrived via the train terminal in S. Lucia and decided that we should walk over to the free shuttle pick up location. Bad idea when dragging 2 luggages each. The location in Zattere was easy to find. Make sure you look for a big blue sign that says "ZATTERE" since its almost impossible to see the Hilton sign unless you are right in front of it. Shuttle was efficient and I received help with my luggage 'Yes!'  :) Upon arriving at the hotel, our luggages were immediately taken off our hands which we were absolutely thankful for and we were directed to the front desk to check in. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting an exhaustive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your positive comments on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
