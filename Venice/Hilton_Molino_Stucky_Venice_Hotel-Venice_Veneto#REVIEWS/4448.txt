We had a wonderful holiday experience in Venice, which was made even more perfect by the high standards of your superb hotel and staff. Our Suite was spacious and was serviced every day.  The free shuttle boat was very useful to get to the mainland.  The only thing to be aware of is, it seats up to 40 only so if you need to get to the mainand by a certain time then get there early.  Also it only stops at San Marco every hour and Zaterre every half hour which was perfect for our needs.  It pays to read the timetable. The views from the rooftop bar are amazing. Everyone was warm and friendly.  Particularly Matteo, Bar Manager and Enrico, Barman.  The food was expensive but then so is everything in Venice so either accept that or book elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
