We spent 2 nights (3 days) at the Stucky and loved it. It's a unique and amazing city, even better than all the movies and pictures portray. And the Molino Stucky made it even more memorable. Lovely roof top bar, great cocktails on a warm evening. And during the day a compact sun lounge area and swimming pool. Very popular but we managed to sit either on a lounger or sofa area. As the hotel is off the main island they offer regular (and free) boat travel to San Marco throughout the day and into the evening. Which of course is super helpful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
