In Venice the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel surpassed previous experiences at Hiltons.  ELENA & CARLO our Concierge team, assisted us continuously before and during our time in Venice to create an exceptional itinerary.  The highlight was our evening visit to San Marco with a tour in the Duomo by our exceptional guide, ELENA. It was a magical night with a gifted storyteller.  At the hotel we very much enjoyed our dinner for 13 in the AROMI Restaurant.  The food was delicious and the service was attentive and never intrusive.  Many in our group enjoyed their time on the rooftop relaxing at the pool and/or enjoying the panorama of Venice before us.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 18, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments and exhaustive review on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay.
