The view is magical, the room is great, but the hotel is quirky,  For example signs to their restaurant led us in circles. While relaxing in our room the mini bar attendant let himself in (did not allow us to answer the door). The Hilton Honors lounge was pale compared to other Hiltons.  They allowed us to check in early which is always a plus.  The room was clean, the elevators while very small were quick. The free launch often times would pass you by ( but hey it was free).   The dining was also expensive but good.  The area around the hotel is great for a quiet evening walk.  You can ask for the shuttle ( 8 Euros ) to take you to the cruise ship.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
