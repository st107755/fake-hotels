The hotel was amazing, spotlessly clean & really couldnt ask for more. The staff at the front desk were very helpfull with directions and places to eat. The Rooftop bar unbelieveable, gorgeous views of the whole of Venice.   Only issues i had with this Hotel was they took Â£200 out of my account once i got there, I'm aware as to why they did but they dont tell you how much they're actually taking and it wasnt put back into my account untill 3 days after i had checked out. Also the room tax is not explained untill you get there, which isnt the Hotels fault thats down to the website i booked with but beweare of this.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 15, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
