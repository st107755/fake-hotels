We booked direct with the Hotel and got an upgrade on check in to a Junior Suite; It is the biggest hotel room we have ever had, with fantastic views and facilities.Very comfortable massive bed and bath and shower with his and hers sinks etc. The Hotel staff are excellent and the rooftop pool is amazing! Food inc breakfast in the executive lounge can be repetitive and not that hot but again service is excellent and we saved a fortune on Alcohol because Beer and Wine are constantly replenished between 5 and 7 pm (happy hour..oh yeah!).  We entered a competition on check in and Won! 2 glasses of Prossecco in the Skyline Bar. Prepare to be amazed by the Views especially at night, worth putting up with the slow service during busy times! We dressed up and ate in the Bacaromi(?)â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Staff.
