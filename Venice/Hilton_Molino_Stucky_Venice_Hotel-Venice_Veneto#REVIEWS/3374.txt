The receptionists were not helpful and made the quality of the stay low. They should be more attentive towards the guests and not charge Money for a room that was prepaid. Still I have not received my money back on my account. They preauthorized two amounts from the credit card even though they said they shouldn't. After they noticed that an error was done it took one week to release the first amount and the second amount is still not released. The building and the room were nice enough, but customer service is most imortant concerning a vacation. Arrogance does not sell rooms!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 4, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we didn't meet your expectations.
