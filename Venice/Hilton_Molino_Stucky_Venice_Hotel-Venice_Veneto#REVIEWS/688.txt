We, a family of four, stayed here for four nights in a king family suite which was very clean and spacious. The hotel has a rooftop bar and pool, both with a marvelous view to Central Venice. The staff is very nice and helpful. Especially  at the pool and rooftop bar they take very good care of everything. The hotel operates a boat which leaves for San Marco and in the evening also Zaterre every 20 ( sometimes 40) minutes. We enjoyed our stay very much and really recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 5, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
