The rooms were very nice as well as the bathrooms.  The pool on the roof had a great view and was a great place to be on a hot Venice summer day.  Breakfast was amazing and luckily included with our room.  Wifi was average (Hilton honors member so it was free - maybe the one you pay for is better?) which is not unusual in a Hilton hotel.  Food in the hotel was very pricey but good.  Water taxi was well run and on time in our experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your positive feedback and for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community.
