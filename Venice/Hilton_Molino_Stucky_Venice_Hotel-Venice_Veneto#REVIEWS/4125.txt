This is a great hotel with a beautiful roof terrace and bar. Very comfortable room with amazing views. There are regular free water taxis as a the hotel is a couple of minutes from the main part. Highly recommend. Would definately  stay again on next visit to Venice. Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
