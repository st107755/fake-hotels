This is an all modern hotel refurbishing an old mill that was on the site. Facilities are excellent, bedrooms and bathroom are first class and lounges, restaurant and bar are lovely and what was on offer in terms of food was very good.  The downsides are that being on Giudecca it is not a hotel where you can simply stroll down the street and be in centre of Venice historic area. There is the water taxi that the hotel runs but it is somewhat time consuming going back and forth and there is some waiting also. We also experienced a slightly musty smell which may be a from the old mill or possibly because it is on the waterfront. Also the food, coffee, drink etc is expensive - but then this is Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 5, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
