Beautiful setting, history, service and views. Was worried it would be too far out from the main island. It was a short free shuttle across the river which ran frequently all day and evening. Rooms were spacious and decorated in Venetian style. Would recommend and stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
