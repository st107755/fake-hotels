Excuse the title but having stayed in a lot of Hilton finest in london and elsewhere I was expecting overpriced averageness but got a pleasant surprise. This is a high class hotel. We were there just as the hotel opened and I think there were a couple of teething problems but nothing important. This was a mini honeymoon for us and we enjoyed our time in Venice very much. Don't be put off by the fact that this hotel is away from the main part of Venice, it takes literally a few minutes on the hotel launch and I'd rather be here than stuck in the melee around Piazza San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
