We are very tired from the long travel when we arrived here. My friends are really hungry, so we ordered foods immediately. After 10 minutes the foods are served. It's very delicious.  It's a nice hotel with great facilities. A fantastic view with great foods. I love how they treated their guests. They treat us like a family, with so much care and love. Thanks for the great services.  A 5 star rate from me.
