During my monthlong trip, this was the only "American" style hotel I stayed in. My rumpled clothes were ready for an iron and I enjoyed the large guest room and bath. The breakfast had an enormous number of offerings - by far the largest buffet I've come across in Europe. Truly something for everyone. Nice lobby bar and restaurant. I was worried about getting from Giudecca (where the hotel is located) to the more central parts of the city, but it was easy with the water shuttle service provided - even late nights after the opera. Staff was helpful and friendly. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to beautiful Venice!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review, we are delighted to read that you enjoyed your visit at our property.
