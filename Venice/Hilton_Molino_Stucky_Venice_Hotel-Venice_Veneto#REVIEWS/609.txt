Beautiful CLEAN hotel. Food  and service was amazing. Highly recommend this hotel for everything it has to offer. Shuttle service provided by the hotel was consistently on time and it’s just a short water taxi ride away from St. Marks square. After staying here I wouldn’t even consider another hotel. This one was a winner in every way imaginable.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 30, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
