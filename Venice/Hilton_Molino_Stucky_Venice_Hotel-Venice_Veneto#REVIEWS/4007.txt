As we age, it seems like there is less and less "magic" to be found in life, so this hotel was a fantastic surprise in the midst of our European trip.  The hotel has a rooftop pool and elevated restaurant overlooking Venice and it is a fantastic place to watch the sunset over the city of romance. The rooms are gorgeous, very artistically appointed and the service from staff is phenomenal.  The hotel even has its own water taxi to shuttle you from the hotel around Venice; since traveling here, my wife and I have seen their water taxis featured in many movies filmed in Venice, so it is a very special memory.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
