I have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and it was superb!  The location isnt ideal if you want to be in the centre of all the sights, but is perfect if you want somewhere away from all the crowds at the end of the day.  The free shuttle boat runs at approx every 30 mins or so which is good. One thing i would advise is to check the times of the public boats and try and tie these in with the hotel boat as if you miss it you can be left waiting for 40 mins which can be a pain!  The hotel is large but the staff seemed to have time for everyone.  The hotel is pricey but thats to be expected in a 5* in Venice.  Overall a lovely stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience.
