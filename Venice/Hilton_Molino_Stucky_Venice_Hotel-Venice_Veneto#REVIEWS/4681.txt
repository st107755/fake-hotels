Received a nice email from concierge before arrival and took up the offer of a water taxi ( there was a special rate which is cheaper than the walk-up rate).  Check-in was efficient and upgraded to a suite which was large and very comfortable.  Bed linens and towels of a high quality.  Turndown service at night.  There were many windows in the room which open.   The hotel is huge and made up of many buildings and we did get lost a few times!  Friendly staff pointed us in the right direction.  There is a shuttle boat to the main Venice island.  Breakfast was standard Hilton offering and nothing special but served by friendly, efficient staff.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your kind comments about our property.
