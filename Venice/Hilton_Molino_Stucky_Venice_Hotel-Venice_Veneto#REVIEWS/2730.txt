Convenient shuttle available for a one time fee of 7 Euros. Nearby laundry center, no need for detergent or fabric softener. Close to all the action in Venice. Offers quiet time amid the many tourists in Venice. The rooms are lovely! For breakfast you can order cappuccino instead of coffee and eggs can be made to order if you don't want to scrambled ones in the buffet. Free wifi was very helpful to keep in touch with family. If a Hilton member, free wifi available in the room. Include the breakfast unless you only want coffee at a nearby location. Remember to add breakfast at the reception area in order not to be charged double the price if not included in the initial reservation.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website.
