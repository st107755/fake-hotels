Was wonderful to be able to take a water taxi from the  Venice airport to the front of the hotel.  Where a porter was ready to help you with your luggage.  Almost all of the rooms have a view of the water.  Enjoyed spending time in the roof top pool.  With spectacular views.  Specially in the evening with all the lights of the city.  Staff was very helpful and polite.  One day it rained they provided umbrellas for all the guests.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for your positive review on TripAdvisor.
