Stayed here with friends in March 2013.  Great hotel - fantastic views and we loved the location as you were not on the main island of Venice but only a short 10 minute free shuttle boat ride away!  Room was well finished (loved the wooden beams), very clean and service was great.  Nothing was any trouble to ANY of the staff but the concierge guy on the Friday (his name is Cristian) deserves recognition as his professionalism and friendliness was amazing.  Thank you Cristian.  Breakfast was plentiful and tasty.  Free trip to one of the glass factories was..........OK!!!  Something to do that was free........  Anyway a great time was had by all and we would certainly return to the Stucky!Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest,  thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
