Hotel was clean and comfortable.  Boat trip to get to main square.   Check in was a nightmare as something weird had been done to my reservation. We booked this hotel because of the pool but when we tried to go use it we were turned away because it was closed for private party use the whole time we were there.  I was not told this when booking nor at check in.    My children were very disappointed and considering the only reason I picked this hotel was for the pool I was not very happy.  Being a Hilton Diamond member I expected  more.  If traveling to Venice to board a cruise this is a great spot for a one night stay.  If staying longer, I would stay around the main San Marco area to avoid having to always toke the shuttle boat.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
