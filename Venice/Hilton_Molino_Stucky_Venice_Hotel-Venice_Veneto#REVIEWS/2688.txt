We recently took a family trip to Venice, Florence and Rome.  My son and daughter-in-law had booked the hotels but wouldn't tell me what they were because they wanted to surprise me. We were met at the airport by a private boat transfer and taken to the beautiful Molino Stucky  Hilton. The hotel was clean, the rooms very nice and the staff helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning but were so busy sightseeing and dining out at some of Venice's nicest restaurants that we never did get to see the pool or use the spa because it was so late when we got back to the hotel.  We did use their shuttle often.  It was a beautiful hotel and I would definitely stay there again if I returned to Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 20151 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your positive comments on Tripadvisor.
