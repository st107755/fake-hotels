This hotel was just awesome to deal with they took good care of us we would stay again in a heartbeat. Location is accessible by water taxi across to Venice. They offered great service and upgraded our room as well. We did get a lot of rain while in Venice. Still a great trip.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 27, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
