Hilton Molino Stucky was just breathtaking! We arrived by public water taxi and were blown away, we felt like we were arriving to a castle! Our entire stay was wonderful, the rooms were traditional with all the modern features. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. The shuttle over to San Marco is a great idea and made staying off the main island really convenient. Unfortunately the Nutella cafe didn't open during our stay due to the weather which was a shame. Will definitely recommend to everyone! The perfect hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 13, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your positive review about your stay and for your kind comments on our breakfast and the hotel services. It was nice to read that you also appreciated the atmosphere and style of our property. The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy and, though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
