Nice hotel located away from the crowed of Venice on an island in front of the city ) a shuttle boat is available). The view from our executive room was incredible. The staff was really helpful. They recommended a very nice restaurant on the island and booked a nice table with a beautiful view.  The swimming pool is small but very enjoyable.  We experienced some little problems but the staff has done miracle to help us.
