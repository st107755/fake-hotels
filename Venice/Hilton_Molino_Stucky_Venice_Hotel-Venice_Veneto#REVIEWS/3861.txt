The hotel is a swish renovation of a flour mill and runs a courtesy boat to Zettere and St. Mark's Square. The rooms are good but not for the light sleeper as you can hear a pin drop in the adjoining rooms. Be prepared to pay 15 euro for a sandwich with an 8 euro tray charge. It's 25 euro to log on or to use certain TV deals and another 25 to use the spa. It costs 14 euro for a film and two coffees will cost you a blistering 16 euro. Don't be surprised at the 10euro a night city tax that's added onto the bill either. Venice in general is expensive and crowded but nevertheless, wonderful. If you leave behind the usual tourist areas, there are a number of interesting sights such as the original Ghetto and Jewish Museum.
