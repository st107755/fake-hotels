What a gorgeous hotel! It looks fantastic from the water, especially at night all lit up! The reception area is very luxurious, with plenty of concierge on reception for quick check in/out and enquiries. There is a hilton shuttle boat to St Marks square which is very handy! If youre travelling by waterbus, just be aware of a slight walk to the hotel with two bridges, but not far at all! Our room with a view overlooked the water, and was a great size! The rooftop pool has the best view over Venice and the skyline bar in the evening is pure luxury!Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 3, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
