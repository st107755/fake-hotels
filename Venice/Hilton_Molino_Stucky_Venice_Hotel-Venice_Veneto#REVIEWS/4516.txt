Extended our 7 day cruise by staying at this location. A superb hotel, wonderful staff in a most enjoyable setting! From arrival to checkout, Hilton managed to "raise the bar" and exceed our expectations. Service from a caring and professional staff was excellent; concierge was an absolute treat and we will, when the circumstances allow, return!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
