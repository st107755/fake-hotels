Though rooms are not really up to the expectation for the well reputed brand, but one can really enjoy the views of Venice city and grand canal from the Sky Bar (evening till late night) and swimming pool (morning).   Amazing breakfast with decent spread.  Prompt room service.  Shuttle boat service really good (one need not really depend on this, as public transport boat stop is 5 mins away by walk) One can really enjoy the sunrise and sunset with a canal view by just sitting in a quite relaxing environment right in front of the hotelRead moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
