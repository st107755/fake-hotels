Hotel lovely and rooms very clean although there was a lack of lighting. Nutella bar a little disappointing and at breakfast we were told that there was no Nutella left! Gym equipment was mostly out of order.  The staff could not make coffee, coffee was really really bad as was the food in the bar â‚¬26 for a club sandwich which was below average. Sky bar service was very slow.  Would stay here again as it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle but would avoid restaurants and bars within the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
