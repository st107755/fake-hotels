Unlike most hotels in Venice (which are small), this is a large property located on the Giudecca island, offering different types of restaurants, large meeting facilities, a roof-top swimming pool, etc. Whereas the location is a bit remote from the main attractions in Venice (St Mark's square, Rialto bridge), the hotel offers a boat shuttle service to St Mark's square (1-2 times per hour).  Overall my impression is very good. Service was very attentive. At times slow and rude, but the hotel was fully booked and I imagine the personnel was a bit over-stressed.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
