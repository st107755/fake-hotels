On it's own Island across from St Mark's Square sits an old paper mill that has been converted into a lovely Hotel.  Huge and hard to navagate at times but enjoyed our stay very much.  Water only Access but that added to the experience.  I also ran the short length of the waterway early a.m. (2 miles out and back) and so enjoyed the morning action of the locals.  The boats with supplies, people going to work by water taxis, the fish market, the produce being delivered by boat, the school kids.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel.
