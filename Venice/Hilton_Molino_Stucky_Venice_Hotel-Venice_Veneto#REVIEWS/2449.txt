I could not believe how absolutely gorgeous Venice was! My eyes just drank in every Cathedral, every restaurant , the building's architecture was amazing! Visited old haunts of Ernset Hemingway and got lost in my imagination of how it must have been for him too! I wAnted to travel to other islands, but just could not leave Venice! I did however , take the train to Florence for one full day of shopping! And shop I did, bringing home with me, Prada, and other luxury leathers such as Lous Vitton! I really enjoyed this particular bucket list adventure! The Hilton - Molina Stuckey, met all of our needs! The restaurants were excellent! The pool area was to die for and the cocktails poolside, were delicious! Yes... I would do it all over again!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2015Dear Ms. Ledger,   thank you for your enthusiastic and kind review!
