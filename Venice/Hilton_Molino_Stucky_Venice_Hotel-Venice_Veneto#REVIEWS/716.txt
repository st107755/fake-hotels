Heartfelt thanks from all of us, it was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you have enjoyed your stay in Venice. Receiving such a detailed and excellent feedback really motivates us and pushes us to do our best every day to make sure that all our Guests are as happy with our care as you are. We are also pleased that you have enjoyed our location on Giudecca. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and the Island is something of a romantic idyll that attracts many travelers. With old squares, churches and wonderful views of the sea and of St. Mark's Basin it is easy to see why many artists are also drawn to Giudecca. Thank you very much for staying with us and we hope to welcome you soon again to give you other amazing memories to bring back home. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
