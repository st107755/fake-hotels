Hilton did not honor pre-arranged early check-in (traveled over-seas from US to Venice on the red-eye flight).  Waited in the lobby for over four hours.  When we finally checked-in the sofa bed was broken and we had to wait for roll-away beds.  Lastly, there was a horrendous Oder in the room, which we were told later was a dead animal (mouse).  We changed rooms the next day.  When we shared with hotel MGMT. they did nothing to remediate except change room the next day after four managers validated the Oder.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We always endeavor to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. With regards to the smell that you experienced unfortunately being Venice in a lagoon and also due to low tide, the odors can sometime be beyond control. I am glad that our Team managed to move you to another room and and we would like to inform you that we have a project to improve this in order to avoid the recurrence of experiences you have highlighted, although we cannot change the fact that high and low tides are part of our city. We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your review and you can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
