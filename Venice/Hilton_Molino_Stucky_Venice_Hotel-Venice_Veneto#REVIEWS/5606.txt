The rooms are excellent and the hotel is top notch.  Had some issues with our reservation and they were quite amenable to a change of rooms although the rollaway didn't arrive until 10PM. Even though it is across the lagoon from San Marco Square, they have their own shuttle boat that came quite frequently and went to two stops. Never a problem getting on. Excellent breakfast buffet included in our rate. Would like to see them have a casual dining for dinner with light bite offerings. The only restaurant open there for dinner is a very upscale restaurant. Had to go out into the community to find something on Guidecca Island. Great pizza parlor down the way. The pool closes at 7:30. Disappointing as would enjoy a swim after a long day sightseeing Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
