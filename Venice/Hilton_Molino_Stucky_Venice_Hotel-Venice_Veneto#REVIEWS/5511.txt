The building is a stunning refurbishment of a rambling brick flour mill "Molino Stucky" a listed building at the far end of La Giudecca, so a good way from San Marco and a 1.5 hour public boat transfer from Marco Polo airport. It's huge. Internal layout confusing - have to find right lift to get to right block of rooms - had to ask four times  - very friendly staff - before I finally found mine after arriving late on a very rainy night having missed the last boat connection over from Zatere.  Rooms nice and quiet if a bit chilly in mid February.  Pricey wifi connection. Good conference facilities and about the hotel in Venice large and modern enough to hold a big professional congress. But don't expect to just pop out for a quick stroll around town without planning your boatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare
