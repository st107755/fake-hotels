We are delighted that our services met with your expectations and that you have enjoyed your stay with us as well as the facilities and services offered in the hotel. Receiving such a detailed and excellent feedback really motivates us and pushes us to do our best every day to make sure that all our Guests are as happy with our care as you are. We are also pleased to know that you have enjoyed the location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous cafés, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager  Read more
