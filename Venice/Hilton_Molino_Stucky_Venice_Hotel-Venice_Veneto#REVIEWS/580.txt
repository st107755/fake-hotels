We have just returned from 4 days at the Hotel, one word, WONDERFUL, the facilities, the location and the staff made the break for us so much better. The shuttle is a great positive as a normal return St Mark's should be â‚¬15pp per trip, so â‚¬7.50 for the duration is a steal. The Exec lounge is just enough, the pool and rooftop bar is to die for and the corner suite was amazing. The only thing that annoyed me was pulling all the time backs off the curtains each evening ðŸ˜‚. We ate out throughout our stay, the restaurants near the Hotel are perfect and we ventured across to eat on Zaterre too.Read moreDate of stay: August 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
