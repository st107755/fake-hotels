On Guidecca, across a canal from Venice proper, the Hilton Molina Stucky requires a 10 minute ride on the Hilton shuttle or another transport for a small fee to cross. It is s lovely facility away from the action so it is quieter than many places. The rooms are nice and the staff and services are top notch. An unusual feature we used more than we thought was the roof top bar and swimming pool for a welcome break from the record breaking heat wave. A fine American style breakfast with European touches was another feature.
