I came with a family of four, all grownups. I shared that in my reservation. I selected the family suite that sorrow four, I ended up getting t a room with two cots placed inconveniently in the room. Well I guess you could sleep 10 in that room if you try hard enough. For all I paid for a larger room to have it taken away with additional sleeping beds!  I was not happy.
