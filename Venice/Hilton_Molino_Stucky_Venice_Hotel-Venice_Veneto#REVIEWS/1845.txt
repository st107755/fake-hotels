My wife and I spent two nights at the Hilton Molino, the hotel location was suitable with regularly available water shuttles to the main island. Some very nice restaurants are located on the hotel's island which I really recommend. The hotel's staff were friendly and the gym was ok for a hotel. The room however was not very comfortable with a big bathroom but little room for the bed and movement. Also no free wall sockets were available to use for chargers or so as all of then where used for side lamps and other devices.  The Hotel offers a Nutella cafeteria which we really wanted to try but did not have time to. All in all a good experience.
