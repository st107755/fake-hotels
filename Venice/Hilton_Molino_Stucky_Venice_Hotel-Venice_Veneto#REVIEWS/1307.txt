Great hotel, I just wish it were on the other side of the island. They offer a shuttle for $12 per person all day to the St. Mark's Square. The water taxi to get to the hotel from the airport is 120 EURO EACH WAY!! The hotel is nice and the Nutella muffins are delicious for breakfast. Gold/Diamond Members that get complimentary breakfast IF you choose it in your MyWay preference, highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 5, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
