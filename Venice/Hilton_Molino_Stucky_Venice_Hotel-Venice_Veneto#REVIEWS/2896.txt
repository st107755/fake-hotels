I stayed here recently for a corporate event, and found it to be a great hotel.   The rooms are nice, mine had no real view - but the hotel was full. It is huge, and you can get quite lost, but its a lovely building. The food was good, and rooftop bar is great - amazing cocktails!  The rooftop pool is why we decided on the hotel, and it was a lot smaller than I thought. It was very busy, and closed early both nights when we stayed which was disappointing as we only found out on the trip that it would close at 5pm.   The hotel offers a shuttle which was great!   Its in a great location, 10 mins from St Marks Sq which was lovely also.   I dont know if i would pick it again, it could have been anywhere - but it was a nice stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
