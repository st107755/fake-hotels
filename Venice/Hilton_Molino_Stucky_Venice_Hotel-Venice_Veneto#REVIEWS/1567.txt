I stayed at this hotel for a few nights during a work trip and it was one of the best spots I've ever stayed at in the world. It was extremely beautiful, clean, and organized. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay exceptional. Aside from having a room that was modern yet reflected a certain Italian charm, the hotel also offers an unbelievable rooftop pool with a view of the city center. I highly recommend this hotel for a full Venetian experience.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
