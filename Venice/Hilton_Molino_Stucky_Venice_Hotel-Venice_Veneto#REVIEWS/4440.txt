This hotel was not only beautiful inside and out, but the bed and linens were of top quality.  After a day of walking, we enjoyed the rooftop terrace overlooking the city.  The view from the pool area was stunning.  We slept well each night in comfort.  There is also a private boat shuttle that will take you to two locations making it easy to see the sights without having to take the public water taxis.  We took those as well with no issues and enjoyed our time immensely!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
