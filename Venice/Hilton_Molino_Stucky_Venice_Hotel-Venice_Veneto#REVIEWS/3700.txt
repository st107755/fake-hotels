Spent our first night in the Hilton before sailing on to Greece. Beautiful, modern, clean, large hotel. They provide a water shuttle about every 30-60 minutes which was very convenient. The only downside is that the last shuttle is around 10PM, if you are having a late dinner or strolling and miss the water shuttle, it can easily cost 80-100 euros to water taxi back to the hotel, so be sure to check the schedule before heading out.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
