This was my second stay at this stunning hotel only this time it was a family trip.We had a fantastic time.We had a beautiful room but had noise from the lift shaft which was disturbing so we were moved to a family suite which was outstanding.Staff were very helpful and polite.Breakfast was plentiful.The executive lounge is very small for the size of the hotel and we sometimes did not get a table straight away.We did not have any issue with the shuttle and just timed our days around the schedule.The pool is a nice bonus to come back to for a family to relax.All of my family can not wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
