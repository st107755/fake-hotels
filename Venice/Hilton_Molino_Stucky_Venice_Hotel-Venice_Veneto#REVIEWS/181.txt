Venice has many typical italian hotels with small rooms and adequate service.  The Hilton has a greater room size, very friendly staff and a great location to look into Venice Island.  If you can get in to the lounge the happy hour (5-7) is very enjoyable and helps manage the costly drinks in Italy.  I would stay here every time rather than the main island!
