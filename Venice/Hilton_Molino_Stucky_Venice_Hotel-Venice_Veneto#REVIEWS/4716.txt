Gold HH member upgraded to gorgeous suite nov.15-17.   Shuttle boat from hotel to venice very efficient. And quick. Executive lounge wine all day and food. Staff very polite and helpful.

Worth it.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
