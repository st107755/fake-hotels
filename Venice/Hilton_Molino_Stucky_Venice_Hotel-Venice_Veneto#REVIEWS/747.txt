Myself and two friends stayed for three nights and absolutely loved this hotel!  Our rooms had a beautiful view of the canal and Venice.  The rooms were comfortable, quiet, and spacious.  The lobby of the hotel has many beautiful examples of Murano glass on display. Overall, the d√©cor in this hotel is sophisticated, elegant, and comfortable.      But, the shining stars of this hotel are the employees!  Without exception, they were attentive, solicitous, and friendly.  They made us feel right at home and were like new found friends.  Special thanks to Sergio and Rocco at Aromi Restaurant; Diego in the Executive Lounge; Elisa and Cristian at the Front Desk; for making our stay so memorable.  I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience with your friends and for sharing your positive feedback on TripAdvisor.
