Out of the way, luxury hotel with amazing views and great connectivity to Venice by 6Euro per stay frequent water taxi. Luxury rooms, clean and very quiet.   We stayed on 7th floor below busy bar and next to elevators. Room was silent the sound proofing was amazing, I am very picky re quiet rooms at night and this passed it. Hotel staff were very pleasant. I would definitely stay there again   Water taxi is Euro 130 each way to airport.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 5, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
