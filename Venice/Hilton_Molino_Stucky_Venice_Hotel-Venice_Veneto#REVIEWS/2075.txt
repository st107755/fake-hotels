The Molino (mill) Stucky was a working mill where more than 1500 people used to work.  They were famous for their pastas and breads but, modern days brought an easier, cheaper way of selling pasta in supermarkets and Molino Stucky was closed.  Hilton converted the place into a magnificent modern hotel keeping the flavor of the old days while offering comfort and magnificent views to the water.  They also offer transportation to and from the San Marco Piazza every 20 minutes. Very convenient with restaurants in the hotel and close by a few very good ones.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 4, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your excellent feedback on TripAdvisor.
