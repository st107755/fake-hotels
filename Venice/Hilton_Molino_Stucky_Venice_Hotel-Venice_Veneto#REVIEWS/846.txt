I was attending a medical conference and the hotel services was first class knowing that it is Hilton. It was an old mill and I loves my stay there as it was not crowded and away from the touristy areas. Nevertheless , they have an exlusive hilton water taxi that can take you to the next island in just 10 minutes. The reception staff were very polite and check-in/check-out were very effecient. The breakfast has plenty of choices . My favorite was the black olives and the delicious creamy hot chocolat. Thanks to the breakfast restaurant staff. They were all amazing and hospitable providing us a warmth welcome. The rooms were very spacious and very comfortable bed and pillows. I will definitely stay there again.
