Expect a good, but not terrific, over-the-top-fantastic room and service.  For starters, the directions to get to the hotel from the Venice Train Terminal, as listed on the hotel website, are not helpful.

I was pleased to read that you you tested the efficiency and comfort of our shuttle service but on the other hand I regret that our general service and Executive Lounge were not up to your expectations. Please accept my apologies for the lack of care and attention from our SPA and housekeeping Staff, I have informed the Department Heads in order to make sure such issues do not occur again. With regards to the music at our Skyline rooftop bar, may I take this opportunity to inform that during Happy Hour time we usually play jazz music while from 10 pm onwards our Guests can enjoy their magical night with a background of deep house chill out lounge music. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
