The location of the hotel required a shuttle to get to the mainland and center of the city.  Although they advertised the convenience of the shuttle, they do not tell you, in advance, that there is a 7.50 Euro charge per day, per person for the use of the shuttle. Otherwise, it is a lovely hotel with good services.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 20, 2018Dear Madame, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
