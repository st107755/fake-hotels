Very hard to get to. This is the elephant in the room.  First clue...free water taxi to square. Would not ever stay here again.  The staff was great but the area around hotel is crumbling.  Do not pay extra for water view!  The boats run most of the night, noisy!!! The island is by itself.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
