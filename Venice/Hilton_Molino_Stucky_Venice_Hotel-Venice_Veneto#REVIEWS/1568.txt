Just spent a few days there. Excellent location and hotel with fab views. Children were well catered for and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The hotel is only accessible by water so there is a ferry service to San Marco for a nominal fee. Getting there is quite dear from the airport, either private water taxi 140-140 Euro 30 min journey or 90 min 16 Euro per person. Excellent Breakfast menu.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2017Dear  Guest, Thank you for your positive feedback on TripAdvisor.
