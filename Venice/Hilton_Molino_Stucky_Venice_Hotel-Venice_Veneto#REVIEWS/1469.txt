It was very kind of you to mention our professional and helpful Team Members for which we pride ourselves. They are indeed the Heart of our Hospitality!

Also, I am sorry that you did not like our Executive Lounge which offers nice views on the Giudecca Canal and Venice. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the selection of food and beverage is made available to Guests following the international standards applied to all hotels of the Hilton group. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as Guest feedback is a fundamental source to evaluate our efficiency and determine areas of improvement in service.
