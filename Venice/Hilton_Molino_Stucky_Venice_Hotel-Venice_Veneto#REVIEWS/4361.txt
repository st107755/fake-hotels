What a wonderful trip to the Molino Stucky Hilton.  The most helpful front desk staff I have ever met.  I travel 45 weeks per year as a Diamond and seldom do I see this level of service and attention that what I saw at the Molino Stucky.  We got a fabulous suite upgrade with a fantastic view.  Dinner was incredible on the first floor and everyone was delightful.  The pool and spa was very relaxing and the couples massage was especially nice.  When in Venice, this is the place to visit away from the hustle of the city and a short boat ride from San Marco plaza.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 22, 2013Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
