The hotel is located across from the main island, but it has a dedicated shuttle boat every 20minutes. The beautiful Pool is on the roof top with a GREAT view of the city. The pool itself is a good size, and has a bar. The room is great, but air conditioning could not keep us cool through the 90+ degree heat. Breakfast was quoted as €30 per person, so we took a stroll down by the water and found a lovely cafe with city views (and under €10 for 2). Overall, a great stay, and would recommend this place.
