My wife and I spent 3 nights in Hilton Molino Stucky in October 2011. It was a romantic and relaxing  week end. Rooms are great with luxury bathroom, good bed and nice view on the channel! The hotel is located on the Giudecca island across the channel. This location is great as it is very quiet and good place to stay after a day of visit in crowded places.  Very convenient Private shuttles that go to St. Marks and stop at the Zattere vaporetto station. Also useful direct vaporetto shuttle are available  from and to  the Airport. I would easily recomend this hotel to anyone. Special thanks to Mr Mario Ferraro,  General Manager of the Hilton  for his very nice and appreciated welcome.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 10, 2011Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on the Tripadvisor homepage.
