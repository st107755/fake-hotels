Stayed at this hotel when I went to Europe for about 10 days to visit my niece who was living in Slovakia.  The hotel is in the former site of a factory and the restoration included leaving beautiful old beams visible even in the rooms.  Visiting Venice is marvelous and this hotel felt equal to the greatness of this great city.  I used the spa and loved it.  The only other thing I wanted to add is that I am on a gluten-free diet and one afternoon, we were in the lobby for a late lunch and politely asked the server to take back the full basket of rolls and just bring two for my husband, since I couldn't eat any; within minutes, our server returned with not only gluten-free rolls, but crackers also!  Amazing.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
