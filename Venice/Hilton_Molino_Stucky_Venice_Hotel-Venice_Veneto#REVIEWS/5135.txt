Much much cheaper than the cipriani and almost as good. Rooftop pool is adequate size with gorgeous view, fitness center is very clean and small but quite adequate. The free shuttle boat goes often and only takes 15 min or less to San Marco.  Great perks for Hilton honors members: even if you're not upgraded you get the executive lounge food and wine at all hours on the main floor; free Internet etc. Also there is a 16 euro shuttle boat to the airport.  I am coming back here in 5 days and can't wait. This is much better than the Danielle where we had a very disappointing experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments.
