This is the second time I have stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice. I came back to use some of HHonors points, and was upgraded on upon check-in to a massive suite - definitely a value-for-points Hilton. Great check-in experience (courtesy of Franck) and really great service at Breakfast, and in the Skyline bar (courtesy of Enrico).   This hotel is decorated well, yet maintains some of the rustic charm from it's flour-mill past. The shuttle boat to the main islands is always on time and runs regularly throughout the day. We were unable to get on it due to high demand at one point during the stay, however the helpful concierge booked us a complimentary taxi to Zattere.   I definitely recommend this hotel - feel free to ask me any questions!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review.
