We just spent 2 nights at the Sorrento Hilton. The only way to get here from the train station is to walk just about a mile but over cobblestone and extremely extremely steep inclines Or pay 20 euro to have a taxi take you and your luggage  one mile up the hill. It costs 20 euro even if you ask a taxi to take you half way. There is no hotel shuttle service or golf cart. It is disappointing.  The only reason to stay here is the view. When we arrived at 330 pm, our room was not ready. We had been travelling the entire day. Since we were only there 2 nights we didn't want to waste our time sitting around waiting on our room.  We were to have access to the executive lounge. We asked to at least be allowed to go up to the 7th floor lounge to get a drink, relax and take in the view.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful vote1 RepostHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 11, 2019Dear Guest, we are sorry that you feel this way and also on behalf of our colleagues at Hilton Sorrento please accept their apologies for any inconvenience you have encountered during your stay.
