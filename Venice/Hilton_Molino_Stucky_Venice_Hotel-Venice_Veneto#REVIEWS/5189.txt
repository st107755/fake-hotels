This is a super base to visit Venice - direct link to airport by water bus - hotel shuttle takes you to right in to St Marks square. The hotel is very comfortable, they have done a great job of converting the old mill. The rooftop pool wasn't not open when we were there but the views from the pool bar were stunning. The room we had was very quite so sleep was easy in the comfortable bed. The a la carte restaurant was excellent.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for writing about us.
