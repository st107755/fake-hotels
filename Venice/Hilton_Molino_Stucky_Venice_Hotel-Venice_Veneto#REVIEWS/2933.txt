5 Star Service and Property!  The staff was very attentive and remembered us from one day to the next.  If you are in heading to Venice this hotel is worth looking into.  The roof top pool is so fun and the pictures that you can get on the roof are better than the Tower in Venice :)  The Executive Lounge is easy to access and we were very happy with the selection and hours.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 26, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
