The hotel is in a fantastic position on the canal where all the cruise ships sail past.The staff were excellent and the room was brilliant. It has a great rooftop pool and bar with amazing views. Try and have a room on the front overlooking the canal. There is a private water taxi to San Marco until late at night.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
