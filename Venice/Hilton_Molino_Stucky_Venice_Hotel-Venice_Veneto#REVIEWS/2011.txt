Stayed here on recommendation, having just come from Hilton Dubrovnik and this hotel fell well below expectations!   Check in staff were not very informative, had to go back to the desk to ask about wifi, where the breakfast restaurant was and what facilities the hotel had.  Given its on Guidecca and not one of the main islands it is a little annoying having to wait for a ferry to shuttle you across and they are not always that frequent.  The highlights of staying at the hotel is the excellent breakfast and nice view from the roof top!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
