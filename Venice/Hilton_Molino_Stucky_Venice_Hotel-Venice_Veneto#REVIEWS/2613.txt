We stayed at this hotel in late June prior to boarding a Med cruise.We have visited Venice several times in the cooler months and have always stayed in an excellent hotel in Cannaregio.However as we were visiting in high season we chose the Molino Stucky because it offered a rooftop swimming pool.However when we arrived, the hotel and the area around it was swarming with police and security staff and it transpired that Michelle Obama was also staying in the hotel.At check in we were informed that the rooftop pool and bar (which have wonderful views over the city) were closed for the duration of our stay.When we enquired why this was ,we were initially told  that this was maybe because of the weather, which was extremely hot but a little stormy, but when pressed the receptionist…Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for your review on TripAdvisor. We are very sorry your stay was not up to your expectations and we do apologize if you could not benefit of all the amenities of our hotel. I confirm that the closing of the swimming pool was not a decision of the hotel’s management and, most importantly, it was not planned at all: the Police Authorities informed us we had to close the pool for the weekend because of security reasons, due to the important visit we were having in house. The decision was taken on Thursday 18th in the evening, therefore we did not have any notice at all and we tried our best to notify all the guests, both in-house and arriving. As you will surely understand, we could only obey the order and avoid going against the law. This is why unfortunately you were not informed beforehand about the closing of the pool: it was not planned and we were forced to do so with no notice whatsoever. The Skyline Bar was opened normally during Friday, Saturday and Sunday, it just closed a couple of hours earlier on Saturday evening due to a wedding celebration.  We always try our utmost to make sure our valued guests can enjoy a pleasant stay and we hope that although you express some disappointment, we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
