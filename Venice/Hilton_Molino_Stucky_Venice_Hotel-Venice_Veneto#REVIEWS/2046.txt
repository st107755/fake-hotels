My partner and I had a great stay here. The rooftop pool is a fab touch at the end of a long day exploring Venice!  The hotel is on a separate island with a free shuttle service. This worked for us as our stay was only short, however if we were staying longer than a few days I think it would be better to stay on the main island to get a better experience! Private water taxi's are also very expensive!  Clean, comfortable and everything you would expect from a Hilton.  Only negative from our point of view was the wifi which was awful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor.

It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. In regard to Internet connection, I am pleased to confirm that we are making progress in improving the service for our guests.
