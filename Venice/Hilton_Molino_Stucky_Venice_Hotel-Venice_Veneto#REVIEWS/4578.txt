We stayed in a Junior Suite. The room itself was nice and functional with good views over Venice. The hotel was a great building with good services. The free boat was really handy and got us everywhere we needed.  We had exec lounge access which really enhanced our stay as the hotels restaurants were far too high priced. I payed 26Euros for a club sandwich one night?! We would highly recommend the hotel but advise to eat out as the restaurants in Venice were actually reasonably priced. We also did not use the Spa as they wanted 25 Euros per person per 2 hours use and after a day walking the Jacuzzi would have been great!
