We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky for 2 nights in May 2010.  The hotel was fairly accessible via vaporetto and we found the free hotel shuttle to be on time and convenient to the “mainland” of Venice and was not too crowded, however, for the price of the room, the inconvenience of having to take the shuttle everywhere wasn’t really worth it.   Our room was fairly small (not the 5-star quality we expected, even by European hotel standards) and our view was of a wall of other rooms, forcing us to keep our curtains drawn at all times. Since the hotel is built in a renovated mill, the room shape was awkward and the size was pretty small.    Overall, we had expected a luxury hotel and found it to be a run of the “mill” chain hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
