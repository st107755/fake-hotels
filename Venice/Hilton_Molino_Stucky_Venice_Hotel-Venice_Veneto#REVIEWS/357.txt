Room was great. Hotel was great. Did not like treatment by staff on rooftop bar although the view was fantastic but because I was by myself they would not set me on the patio, I had to sit inside even though there were empty tables. Apparently the outside tables were reserved but it was easy to tell that they weren't. Hotel is not on main Island of Venice but Hilton provides a very convenient shuttle boat with multiple trips throughout the day/night. I would definitely stay here again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
