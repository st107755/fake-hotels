My wife and I stayed three nights at the Hilton Venice earlier this week and to be absolutely honest could not find a fault with facilities or service. Although the hotel is on the island of Guidecca, the regular shuttle boat to San Marco was excellent. Always dead on time and pretty convenient. However, to be aware the Alilaguna (public water boat) from the airport takes about one and three quarter hours to the hotel. This is not at all unusual in Venice but travellers to the hotel may wish to consider the Number 5 bus to Piazza di Roma and the 4.1/4.2 Water Boat which is only three or four stops and much quicker. Alternatively, you can catch a water taxi for 100/120euros.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 18, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
