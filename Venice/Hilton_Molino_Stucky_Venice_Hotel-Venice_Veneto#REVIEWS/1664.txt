This is a beautiful hotel with a gorgeous view from the rooftop, unfortunately we had poor treatment from a staff member (within 3 hrs of being in Italy). Immediately I sent a complaint to Hilton customer service and within 10 mins the hotel manager call to apologize and resolve our discomfort. Upon return from touring we came back to a bottle of champagne and a letter of apology.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 18, 2016Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time and trouble to share your experience with other TripAdvisor users. I am pleased that you liked the Hilton Molino Stucky on the Giudecca island in Venice. From time to time, unforeseen issues do arise in the world of hospitality, and I am delighted that we were successful and remedying the situation.
