A very large hotel with very attentive staff and an enormous selection of self-serve breakfast items. Very comfortable. We enjoyed drinks in the open-air bar area at the top of the hotel with great views! Our trip was continuing by train, so rather than take the hotel's water service vehicle, we had the concierge order a private water taxi. It was expensive, but worth having the private service to transport us to the train station.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
