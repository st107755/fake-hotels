What a great hotel!  We were on the 7th floor with views of the lagoon.  The chandelier was Murano glass, bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast had a large variety of choices for any travelers' taste.  In the evening, there was happy hour in the lounge with appetizers, salad, beer, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages.  Hotel staff were wonderful.  We ate at 2 of the restaurants, one inside the hotel and the other adjacent to it and the food was excellent!  They also have a water taxi to San Marcos and across the lagoon in the evening.  Would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
