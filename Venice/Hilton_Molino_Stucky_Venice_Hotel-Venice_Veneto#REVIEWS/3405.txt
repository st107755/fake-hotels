Second time visiting this hotel. Comfortable and elegant, the breakfast is superb. The  rooms are very comfortable and  well appointed.  The quieter side of Venice, the hotel has a shuttle boat to take you to St. Marks or other destinations.  The Hotel is worth the money they command . I will always stay here on every visit.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review, I am pleased you decided to stay with us again and that your experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was positive also this time.
