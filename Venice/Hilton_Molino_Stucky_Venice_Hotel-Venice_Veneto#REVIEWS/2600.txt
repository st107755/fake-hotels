Just across the water from the Zattere station, this is an excellent hotel that will not disappoint any traveler looking for good, reliable service. The only downside is that you have to take the vaparetto (they run a free shuttle service every hour) to Zattere (3 min) or St Mark's Square (15 min). If you are not in a hurry, and want to avoid the crowds, get off at Zattere and walk towards St Mark's Square. The espresso here is excellent and the overall service too - though at times the concierge can be mobbed by arriving tourists from a cruise ship. Wish they didn't have the two hour gaps during the day and evening on the shuttle service and also wish it started earlier (like 6 or 7 am) rather than the 8 am by which time Venice begins to get crowded. Otherwsie excellent hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
