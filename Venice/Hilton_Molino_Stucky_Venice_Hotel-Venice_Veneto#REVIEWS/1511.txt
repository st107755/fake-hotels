In recent years I have developed a taste for the Giudecca - must say the place was off limits when I went to school. Not anymore. Now the opposite is true: good restaurants, few tourists. I think Hilton did a great job with the Mulino (or Molino) Stucky, an otherwise stodgy, ugly building. The hotel has everything you may need, and then some. The bar offers a breathtaking view over Venice, but it could easily improved (which is the reason why I give it a 3 instead of a 4). It faces East: how about sipping coffee and watch the sunrise in all its glory? No, the bar opens late in the afternoon. This is the city of Vivaldi and Benedetto Marcello. No, the bar plays disco music. Other than that, you will enjoy your stay!Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky. This ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture and usually quite appreciated. On another note, I am sorry that you were not able to enjoy a sunset from our Skyline terrace as both our terraces (Venice/Giudecca side and back lagoon/Marghera side) are open every day of the year from 5 PM until after midnight and the sunsets from there are one of the highlights which are so appreciated by our Guests. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
