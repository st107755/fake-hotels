The location on the lagoon, coupled with the ease of the shuttle boat service, made the Molino Stucky an absolutely perfect spot for our week long stay in Venice.  After exploring Venice all day, going back to Guidecca, which is more tranquil, but being just across the lagoon and a 5 minute boat ride away from everything, was perfect.  We also loved exploring the more "local" areas of Guidecca, from a high school Futbol game, to the local pistacceria and salumi shop.  The peacefulness of Venice is truly special.
