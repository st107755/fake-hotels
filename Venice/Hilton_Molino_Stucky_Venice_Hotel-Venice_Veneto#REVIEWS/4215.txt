The Molino Stucky Hilton is a wonderful hotel to stay when in Venice. Great views of the city of Venice & the free shuttle will get you to the other 2 main islands. Although always busy at reception we had no wait at breakfast or in other areas of the hotel. You get great views of the cruise liners passing by the hotel from the roof.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 24, 2013Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for your positive comments on our hotel services and facilities.
