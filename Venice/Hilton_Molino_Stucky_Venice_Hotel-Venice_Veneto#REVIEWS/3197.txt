It is always a special experience to go directly from Marco Polo Airport in Venice by boat to the hotel. The holiday mood begins there already at the airport. The checkin was fast and friendly. The room was very comfortabel, but the outlook from the windows was a bit limited. We liked the quite Island Giudecca and the great outlook to venice when walking around. There is a complimentary  shuttle service by boat directly to venice and the schedule meets our requirements. If you want to stay longer than midnight than it could be difficult or at least expensive to get back to the hotel. The rooftop pool was closed due to our date of stay. There is a stylish bar on the top level.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 25, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
