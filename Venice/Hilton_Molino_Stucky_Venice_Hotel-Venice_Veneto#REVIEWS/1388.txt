We stayed here for one night before a cruise, and I would definitely return for a longer stay.  The room (a corner Tower Suite) was large, comfortable, and had gorgeous views.  The check-in staff were friendly and helpful, as were the staff when we checked out.  The breakfast was delicious with a large variety of options.  We enjoyed being on Giudecca where it was calmer and quieter.  Our friends took the hotel shuttle over to Saint Mark's Square and found it very convenient.  The Executive Lounge was small and most of the tables seated only two.  The Rooftop Bar, on the other hand, was large and comfortable with great drinks and beautiful views.  I hope to return soon!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
