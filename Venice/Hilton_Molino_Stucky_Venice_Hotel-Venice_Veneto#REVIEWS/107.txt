Excellent service, great breakfast, a lovely building.  Family suite was just super for having a bit more space with 2 children.  A great base to explore Venice, and the shuttle service to and from St Mark's Square was very useful.  Would definitely love to stay again!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2019Dear Sir, thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
