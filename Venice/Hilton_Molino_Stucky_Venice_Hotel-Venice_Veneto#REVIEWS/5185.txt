From arrival to departure the hotel service was excellent with very polite and helpful staff all the way. The room was great, well furnished and with superb views over the canal. Breakfast was enjoyed in the exec lounge with a great selection of food (the sausages are superb) and drinks. The water shuttle worked really weel and ran to timetable. Venice is like Disney for adults and the Hilton put the icing on the cake.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
