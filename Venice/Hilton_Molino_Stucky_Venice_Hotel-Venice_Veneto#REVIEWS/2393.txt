Hilton Moino Stucky is a good choice. Staff is friendly. Rooms nice for the price. We were there during the start of "Carnival" on 31 January. It was busy and line was getting backed up a little bit for the shuttle to St. Mark's Square. Hotel called in a watertaxi at their expense to deal with this problem We were on our way in 10 minutes rather than a probable 40 minutes.  The Skyview bar has 2 bartenders that are no doubt professional, well trained and amazing the pouring drinks. We sat and watched them on 2 consecutive nights (about an hour each), chop fruits, paint rims with lime peal. This is a poor portrait of  what they were doing.  Worth the 15-18â‚¬ per drink. The drinks themselves were excellent as well.  Worth visiting this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 8, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
