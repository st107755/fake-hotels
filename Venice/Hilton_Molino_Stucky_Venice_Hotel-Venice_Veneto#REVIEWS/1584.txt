Although it is on another island away from St Mark's Square-transportation provided by the hotel is great!  The service was good, as was the food.  I would recommend the bar on the rooftop for hors d' oeuvres and a fantastic view of Venice in the evening.  Very quiet hotel.  The rooms could use more light as we found the rooms to be very dark.  The TV offerings should be expanded.  It took a little getting used to the funnel-snapped ceiling over the bed.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 12, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
