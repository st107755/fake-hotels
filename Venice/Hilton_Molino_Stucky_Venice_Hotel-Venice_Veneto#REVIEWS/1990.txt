Fantastic location in a residential section only a 10 minute water taxi ride to St Marks Square. I gave it a lower than expected rating on sleep quality and room due to the fact we stayed in a family room and the pull out sofa mattress had a huge depression in it and we had to get a roll away for one child and the other would sleep the other way on the mattress as to not sleep on the metal bar from the frame ... The Internet service was shoddy at best. Overall a great hotel with a pool for the hot summer month of JulyRead moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
