We stayed in the Hilton Molino Stucky for 3 nights in November. Although the public areas of the hotel are lovely, the room was very disappointing.  See photos of carpet attached!  When we commented on the cleanliness to staff no action was taken. Housekeeping kept removing half empty shampoo/shower gel bottles but did not leave replacements. When reception provided more, housekeeping removed them again!  The roof bar is lovely, the shuttle across to the main island is a bonus. But on the basis of the rooms I am very surprised at the 5* rating.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 17, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your review.
