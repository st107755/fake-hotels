A beautiful hotel right on the waterfront where you can watch cruise liners sail into Venice. Room was clean , shower and also bath / shower. Good size bathroom. 2 sinks.  Breakfast is extra at 25 euros / per person.  Swimming pool and bar on the top floor (8th) with stunning views of Venice.  The Vaporetto (water bus) stop is about 5-10 mins walk from the hotel.  Best to get a multiple day vaporetto ticket as it is 7.50 Euros per journey and the 48 hour ticket was 30 euros.  The majority of the attractions are on the other side of the water (12 min away on the water bus)  Would highly recommend this hotel.
