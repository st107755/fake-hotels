This was our third stop on a whirlwind tour of Italy, and we very much appreciated such a large room and luxurious accommodations after traveling so much! The hotel itself is huge, beautiful and very comfortable. The history of the building was interesting and unique, though it still felt a little on the corporate side compared to other small boutique hotels that we had stayed at. A few weeks before the trip, I had emailed to let them know that we were celebrating two big milestones on this trip and they not only upgraded us to a view of the water (which was STUNNING), but they also left us a special dessert as well! It was wonderful!   The location of the hotel was also very nice. The water shuttle was ALWAYS on time and it was very easy to get to and from St Mark's Square.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website and for the transport information which will be very useful for other travelers.
