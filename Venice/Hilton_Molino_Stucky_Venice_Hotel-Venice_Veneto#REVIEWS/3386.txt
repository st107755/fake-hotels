Stayed as part of a Globus Tour, but not sure if I would pay for the experience normally.  It was not a bad hotel but expected more with the Hilton name.  Room was very large.  Bathroom huge but the toilet was on a lean, marks on the walls where tradespeople were lining up for fixtures and fittings and the shower head was stained - bath was great though. Hair dryer would not work in the bathroom but did work in the bedroom.  Bed was quite comfortable but the pillows were too soft.  View from the rooftop was fantastic.  Breakfast was very good, much better choice of food than most places offer. Staff were ok, not friendly but not nasty either. Not right in the middle of everything so you do have to rely on the water taxi.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Guest,   thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
