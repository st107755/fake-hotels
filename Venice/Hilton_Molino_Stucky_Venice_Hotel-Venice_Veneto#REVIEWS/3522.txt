Me and my husband just love Venice! It's a very romantic place. When we went to Paris in 2012, we thought Eiffel was just amazing. But now, we've added Venice to the list.  And... Hilton stucky Molina just made it more perfect .... Free boat shuttle to St Marks Square, Free buffet breakfast... Very nice room with a view of the canal;  very good service in the front desk and wait staff in the restaurant. I can't say anything more. Really very happy and will definitely come back in 2016!Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 3, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your positive experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
