We stayed 2 nights in early August 2014. My husband has a Hilton Honors Reward card, which was a perk because we could use the executive lounge that had snacks, drinks and breakfast. Our upgraded room had a  window with a perfect view of Venice. The staff service was professional, polite an helpful. Our only complaint, was one night we went up to the rooftop deck for some drinks and the waiters were rude and disrespectful. They told us it was last call on drinks and they were closing so to hurry up. Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
