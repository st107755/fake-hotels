We spent two nights and enjoyed the views and hospitality. The transportation to St. Marks Square was reliable and on time. We were able to see all of the main sights but have the privacy of a secluded retreat away from the crowds upon returning to the hotel in the evening. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The service and assistance in guiding us to our scheduled tours and events was excellent.
