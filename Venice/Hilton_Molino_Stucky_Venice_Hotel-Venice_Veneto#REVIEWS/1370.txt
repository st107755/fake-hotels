Excellent hotel if you are a group and would like to be based away from the busy part of Venice. A frequent shuttle service to Piazza S.Marco is available from just outside the hotel. The hotel,though not luxurious, looks new and contemporary and was more than adequate for our get together in Venice! The staff were excellent in helping with organizing our itineraries.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 10, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
