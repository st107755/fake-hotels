I had researched many hotels in Venice and I wanted to find a quiet hotel after a transatlantic flight with our kids. I was so glad a picked this hotel! It was the quietest hotel is have ever stayed at- and we travel a lot! The hotel is located on a separate island- close to St. Marks Square by water shuttle. The rooms were comfortable and clean. We stayed in a family suite, which I was hesitant at first since our kids would be sleeping on a pull out couch, but the mattress was the thickest I have ever seen on a pull out and extremely comfortable! We paid extra for access to the executive lounge which included breakfast and snacks. Very nice option away from the huge crowds of Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 5, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
