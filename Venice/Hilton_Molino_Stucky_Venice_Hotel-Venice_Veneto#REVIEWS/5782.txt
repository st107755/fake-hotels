Ill try to keep this short. The Hilton Stucky was a beautiful hotel.  We used our Hilton points to stay and were treated like royalty.  The taxi made everything so easy to get to.  We thought we would miss out on Venice by staying on the outskirts of the city, but by the end of the trip we wouldn't have it any other way.  We took the taxi over during the day and walked all over Venice, ate dinner, and "escaped" back to our hotel to relax on the roof top overlooking the city with a cocktail-----incredible.  This is a must stay hotel or at least go have a drink on the roof top----O one more thing---we heard of Venice being smelly, but we did not experience any of that during our 3 day stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
