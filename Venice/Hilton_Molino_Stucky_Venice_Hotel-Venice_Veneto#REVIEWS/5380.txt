My husband and I stayed here for one night after a 7 night cruise that disembarked in Venice.  Overall, a great looking, comfortable, and convenient hotel.    We stayed in a king room, which was gigantic by Venetian (or even European) standards, with a huge bathroom, modern furnishings, and a charming view of the Giudecca Canal where we could see the cruise ships coming and going.  The hotel itself was very large, modern, and well decorated.  It had a boutiquey vibe that is probably not too common in Venice.  Even though the hotel is located on Giudecca, the convenient shuttle boat made us feel like we were still in the middle of the action.  The boat was always on schedule (both departing and returning to the hotel) and took only about 10 minutes.    The hotel staff was fair. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
