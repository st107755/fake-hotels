Arriving at the Hilton Stucky is a wonderful experience . Hilton Hotels have done a wonderful job in transforming a beautiful building which was originally a flour mill into an outstanding looking hotel . The facilities are extremely good as is the frontline staff at reception . My only negative critique is the staff at the Champagne Bar . They could have been serving me a glass of free water . No customer service . If this was corrected . The hotel would get a full 5 stars from me .Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
