This was my second time to Venice. Wouldn't recommend staying here if you have limited time in Venice but it is definitely a great place to stay to get away from the more touristy side of Venice. Limited but fair amount of local food and wine places on Giudecca. Loved waking up watching the sunrise from the roof of the hotel. It was peaceful and quiet. It was nice to be away from it all while still being able to watch Venice wake-up from a distance.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 25, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
