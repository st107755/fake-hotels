The most outrageously overpriced hotel at which I have ever stayed in the world. The rooms are tiny and not very aesthetically pleasing. Couldn't get the air conditioning to properly cool the room. The food items sold by the hotel were beyond ridiculous as far as price. My wife got a very mediocre caprese salad appetizer for 20 Euros. Only good feature is the free boat that periodically takes people from the hotel to San Marco. Found that very convenient. The view from the top of the hotel/pool is also pretty amazing. Otherwise, I was not impressed.
