Fantastic hotel - brilliant location in the middle of the sea and the canal. A free shuttle boat is put on by the hotel to take you to the main part of Venice. Really friendly and helpful staff who went out of their way to help you even though English wasn't their first language. The best thing about the hotel was the roof pool - amazing! Fantastic views and brilliant hotel, would love to come again but might need to remortgage my house.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
