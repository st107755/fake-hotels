I left Hilton Moline Stucky as a satisfied guest. I wil not hesitate to go back again. The staff was friendly and welcoming. There is plently to do at the hotel. The pool on the terrace has a great view of the city. What I didn't like that much is that there aren't many places to go around the hotel. In other words, the hotel isn't walking distance to much.

We are delighted that our services meet with your expectations and that you enjoyed your stay here in Venice. I would also like to thank you for praising our staff who always try their best to welcome our guests and make sure their stay is a memorable one ! Though our location in Giudecca is not at walking distance from the most famous local attractions, the hotel offers great walks and sights of Venice just outside the door and guests can stroll until the end of the island with a fantastic view of the city “skyline”. Thank you for staying with us at the Molino Stucky Hilton Venice. Kind regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
