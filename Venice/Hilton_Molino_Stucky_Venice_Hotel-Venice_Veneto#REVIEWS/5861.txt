I recently stayed here for two nights with my two friends.  They rolled a cot into the room since it was a triple.  This made the room feel very small.  Other than that we really liked the hotel.  It was very large.    We overheard a couple people say that the hotel had their reservation wrong.  But nothing wrong with ours.  The breakfast is very expensive.  I would recommend taking the free water shuttle taxi they provide to get breakfast.  The Rooftop bar is very nice and has an extensive cocktail menu.  It is pricey but they give you fresh fruit and nuts with your drinks.  Great views from the rooftop pool.  We went to the spa one day which was nice, but I seen much nicer.  All in all this was the nicest place we stayed on our trip.   It is pricey.Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare
