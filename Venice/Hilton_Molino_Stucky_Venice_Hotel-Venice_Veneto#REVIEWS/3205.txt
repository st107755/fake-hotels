This is the best 5* hotel in Venice. More like 7*. Good points:  Staff - this either makes or breaks great hotels. Molino simply has professional, friendly and good staff. Ms. A Cova at reservation is a star. She took care of all the last pre check-in request to the most minute of details. Thank you so much. Carlo the concierge and all the rest of the staff - simply the best.  Room - The Tower suites are simply the best suites in venice. Amazing views. And the best suite in  one of the best hotels in the world.  Facilities - Amazing building. Spa, gym , lobby etc.  I recommend this hotel to anyone who is interested in having the best time in Venice.  Thank you very much Hilton Molino Stucky.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 17, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to leave such a positive review on Tripadvisor.
