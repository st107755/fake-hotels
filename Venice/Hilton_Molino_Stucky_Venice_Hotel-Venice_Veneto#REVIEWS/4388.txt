I went to the Molino Stucky for a conference. It is a large hotel (not everyone's taste maybe) and a bit of a trip away from the main part of Venice. However, this slight inconvenience and the size are worth it as the hotel has everything you need; good, modern, quiet rooms, a great roof top bar and pool, and a handy and free shuttle boat service to Piazza San Marco to name a few. The business faciltiies are good and they are quite separate from the main hotel, so workers and holidaymakers dont impact on each other!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
