Everyone from the front desk, concierge and restaurant staff was helpful and had a positive attitude.   The property is beyond words. We stayed in Nov when some of the restaurants were closed because it was off season.   No regrets!!    Can't wait to come back again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 19, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive comments about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
