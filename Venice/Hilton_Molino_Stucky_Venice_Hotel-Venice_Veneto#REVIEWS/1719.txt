Spent two nights before cruising at this hotel.  Amazing hotel with shuttle service to St Mark's square that runs day and night.  Water taxi from the airport stops at their pier.  Enjoyed the buffet breakfast and dinner one evening.  Staff was very courteous and made our stay wonderful.  Concierge made dinner reservations at a local restaurant that was outstanding.   Room faced the Canal Grande.  Had cocktails at sunset at the rooftop bar.  Amazing place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
