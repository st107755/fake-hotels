Our suite at the Molino Stucky was one of the best we've stayed in. The decor was contemporary and stylish, the bed superbly comfortable and the view to die for! The main feature is the rooftop pool and champagne bar, how chic. If you don't mind the shuttle to the main areas of Venice, then do stay here. If you want to walk to St Marks Square, stay elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 17, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
