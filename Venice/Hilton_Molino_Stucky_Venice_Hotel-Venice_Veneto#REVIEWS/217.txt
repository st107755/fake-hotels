I travelled to Venice and stayed in this great hotel during the first weekend of August. Let me start ny saying I think i got a bargain on the room and probably couldn't afford to stay here again. As with everything in Venice - it's expensive! Breakfast is â‚¬30 per person and the drinks are very over priced. However, there is a lovely rooftop bar with pool (towels supplied) and that really made ny holiday. It's beautiful. The location was great for me, just a short boat shuttle to the hustle and bustle of the centre whilst enjoying the quieter side of Venice next too some lovely restaurants on the water.Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 5, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your nice comments on TripAdvisor!
