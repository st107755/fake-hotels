This is the perfect hotel from start to finish.From the time you arrive you are welcomed by eager to help staff. If you are a Hilton Honors member this is the best place to use your points. We were here during Christmas and it was the most beautiful setting. Don;t worry about getting to St. Marks Square. The Hilton shuttle is very convenient and it makes it a nice ride everyday. I would like to give a big shout out to Victoria in the breakfast room. She made our day with her wonderful, warm smile every morning. Thank you! We will return again some day.Read moreDate of stay: December 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 11, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay a tour property.
