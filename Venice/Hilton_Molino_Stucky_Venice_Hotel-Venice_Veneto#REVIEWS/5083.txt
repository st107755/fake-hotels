Such a quiet, beautiful hotel.  Wonderful spotless, new rooms, bedding.  An incredible find.  So glad we stayed away from St. Marks square.  Plenty of shuttle bots to com and go when you want.  Most beautiful views from the rooftop pool.  Great sanctuary after a long day with kids.  ONLY compliant is pool closed at 7:30pm!  we just got there!  LOVED this hotel.  Best part of 3 countries we visited.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
