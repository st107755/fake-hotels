The hotels layout and location is fine with the shuttle service they provide. There are a few resturants at the island that are great for brekafast and lunch. The sofa beds can not be regarded as beds, we booked the King Family suite for our family of 4, however the sofa bed was in a horrible condition . with a noisy steel frame that was damaged, and the matress itself was only a few cm thick, so no sleep possible . We only stayed 24 hours , so not able to tell anything about the faccilities. The pool however seemed a bit small, and there was very few sunbeds.  There was also used shampoo and conditor in the bathroom when we arrived, which does not give such a nice first impression.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2017Dear Guests,  Thank you for sharing with us; we will definitely look into the bedding inconvenience mentioned in your review.
