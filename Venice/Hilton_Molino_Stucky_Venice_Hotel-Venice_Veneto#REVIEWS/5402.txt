Best rooms of our month long trip across Europe. Great staff and service. The shuttle service is a budget and lifesaver.....water taxi's are not cheap in Venice as nothing is. The hotel was a bastion of cordiality which I could not say the same for the rest of Venice. The executive lounge was nice....you just ask for espresso as opposed to the self service machines everywhere else. If I had to find something to pick at....the business center computers werent up to snuff....one wasnt working and the other was slow...but this is a reach.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
