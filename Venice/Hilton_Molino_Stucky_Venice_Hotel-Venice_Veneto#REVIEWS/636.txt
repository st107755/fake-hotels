From William (10 years old) I stayed at this place this July for my first trip to Italy. First I’d like to say this place is in a great location. They have a great breakfast and dinner.  They have a great pool, free water shuttle and more.  They even call taxis.  But the thing I really wanted to say is that when I was going to the airport, I realized I forgot my bracelets.  The taxi driver sensed something was wrong and asked if he could help.  I explained that I left my favorite bracelets on the table at breakfast.  He said he would call the Hilton.  The staff looked for them and found them.  They had a great idea to send the bracelets with the next taxi to the airport and we got them back.   I would like to thank the Hilton staff for going out of their way to look bracelets…Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 2, 2018Dear William, Thank you for your kind review on this website.I am delighted that you have enjoyed your stay with us and that you had a lovely vacation at Hilton Molino Stucky.
