Nice view, cool historic building. Unfortunately the service is bad. Room was dirty and understocked for days, nice shuttle boat, got denied to borrow scissors, had to stand in front of receptionist and cut..! I'm pregnant with severe morning sickness 24/7 with wedding invites that has to be cut and go out. Thanks for lack of help dear receptionist. Could not make an exception could you? Last time we are coming back here! Blonde lady at executive lounge is very nice btw.
