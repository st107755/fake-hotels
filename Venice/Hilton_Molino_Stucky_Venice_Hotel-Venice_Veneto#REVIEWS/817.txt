I am an experienced traveler, but this is my first trip to Venice.  This Hilton was converted from a flour mill recently, so everything is new and modern and well maintained.  The hotel is not centrally located, but the hotel water shuttle takes you to St Marks Sq in 15 mins.  The water taxi from the airport dropped us off and picked us up at the front door of the hotel.  I would stay here again.
