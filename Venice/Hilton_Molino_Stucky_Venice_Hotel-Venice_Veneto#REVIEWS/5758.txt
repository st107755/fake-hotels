Being a Diamond Hhonors member we received an upgrade to a canal view Suite - great view over the canal & venice. Would throughly recommend the waterbus if the hotel shuttle is not available - No.2 waterbus goes down the grand canal * No.41 goes to Murano for the glass factories. Food at this hotel is extremely expensensive on UK standards (30 Euro for a hamburger & fries), but the breakfast is up to the usual Hilton standard - plenty of choice and of a good standard. Water taxi from the hotel to the airport is 100 Euro and takes about 30 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
