This hotel was really nice, but Venice was a little disappointing.  The people there don't like Americans and we found that many were quite rude.  Not to mention that everything in Venice is extremely overpriced, including the hotel.  It's a great hotel, but the Hilton in Rome was much nicer and 1/3 the price.  The bar in the hotel has really nice people, so at least we know that not all people in Venice are rude.  :)Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 27, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting a review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
