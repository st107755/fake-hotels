It's a great experience, Venice & the new Hilton five star hotel in between! And there is a great view from hotel to Venice.  Everything can be reached easily by public transportation, bus & ship(vaporetto) day and night. If you arrive by car just stop at parking areas before the bridge connecting Mestre and Venice. It's much cheaper(€4 against €25 per day). The bus station is very close to parking area. Bus No.6 gets you easily to water bus station 'Tronchetto'. Vaporetto No.2 takes you to stop 'Palanca' close to Hilton hotel. Hotel stuff is very friendly. If you need to complain something like we did during our three day stay (there was only cold water available in our bath tub) don't worry too much if it won't be fixed.  You are in Italy, Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 20091 Helpful vote1 SaveHelpfulShare
