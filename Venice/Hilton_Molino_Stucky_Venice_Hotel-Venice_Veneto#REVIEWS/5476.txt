First off, this is a great hotel but an AMAZING hotel if you get the canal view. You can't beat the views of Venice from your room. I would be disappointed if I was not facing this view though. The skybar is great and gives you a view of San Marco Square. Transportation to this hotel can be difficult as you have catch a private taxi from the airport or really know what you are doing and get around to the free transport at San Marco. I'd recommend but know that you are boating it to and from the main island. This can be difficult if you are tight on time.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 25, 2011Dear Guest, thank you for your kind comments.
