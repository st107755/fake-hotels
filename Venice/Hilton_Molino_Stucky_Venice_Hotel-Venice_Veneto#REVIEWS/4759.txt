I stayed for four nights to attend a Conference.  It is a stunning building and the hotel is modern, clean and friendly.  My room was ideal for my needs and I found the large shower and a separate bath great to have.  Breakfast was plentiful and full of choice.  To eat at other times in the hotel is so completely overpriced so even if you are tired make the effort to walk to one of the small restuarants nearby.  I liked the family run Pizza place which is found about a 10 minute walk away.  When you leave the hotel turn right and walk over several bridges until you come to a square.  It doesn't look too grand however the food was delicious and the service was so friendly.  The rain was pretty bad at times and we had some flooding however the locals are so well equipped to cope…Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website. I am pleased to read that you had a pleasant stay with us and enjoyed the hotel services and facilities. I am sorry you were not able to catch the Shuttle boat on one day. The capacity is of 40 seats and we usually suggest our guest to be on the dock at least five minutes before leaving hour. May I take this opportunity to inform you that the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. I look forward to welcoming you back to the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
