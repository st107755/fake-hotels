We stayed there for 3 nights and it felt like home away from home, the hotel shuttle boat takes you conveniently right to San Marco and back to the hotel all day long, great views from the hotel, especially on the rooftop, took a private water taxi to and from the airport, great restaurants on site. There is a pool as well on top of the hotel and a spa which we didnâ€™t use but a nice thing to have. We also decided to take an island tour, there was an agent on site close to breakfast where you can buy the tickets, the tour boat picked us up and dropped us at the hotel again which was great too, very efficient. Will stay there again.
