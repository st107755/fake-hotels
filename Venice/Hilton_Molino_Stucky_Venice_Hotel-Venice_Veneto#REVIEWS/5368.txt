We spent two nights at Molino Stucky before boarding a cruise to Dalmatia and one day (day room) before flying back home in the evening. The two nights were in a suite thanks to a kind complimentary upgrade; the day room was a basic queen size room, which is quite spacious. We chose this hotel because it is just in front of the cruise terminal (however, the cost of a water taxi to cross the Giudecca Canal is around 60 euro ... for some 800 meters; but this is Venice). The pros : Hilton standards : kind reception, efficient concierge, perfectly clean room; very quiet location on Giudecca, free shuttle to Zattere and San Marco, smiling service; above all, great restoration of an industrial building, unique rooftop swimming pool and bar with fantastic views; one can really relaxâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
