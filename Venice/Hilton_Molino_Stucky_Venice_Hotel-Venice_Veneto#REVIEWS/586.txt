Amazing weekend home.  The hotel is huge, but it always feels friendly & intimate as a result of an incredible & sensitive conversion from its original life as a flour mill.  The free boat to St Marks Square made it easily accessible, but it's location on Giudecca means it is away from the tourist throngs.  The roof top pool & bar add a touch of real film star glamour.  The staff were genuinely pleased to help, & managed our requests with efficient smiles. Can't wait to go again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
