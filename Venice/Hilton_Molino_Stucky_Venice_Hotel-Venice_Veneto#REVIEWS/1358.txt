Wonderful hotel, staff very attentive and worked very hard to satisfy all our requirements, friendly and courteous at all times. Our room faced the canal and we were able to watch the boats sales by, truly a wonderful sight. Taxi across to St Marks was prompt and we never had a problem with getting a seat. The best of restaurant's were found by turning right out of the hotel and walking past Harrys bar to the next restaurant, sorry forgot the name, but much bigger than the frontage would suggest, food was excellent and gave us 20% discount when we waited 10 minutes for the bill. We didn't mind the wait, but they found it unacceptable. Amazing. Pool lovely, but it was a bit cold for a dip, skyline worth a few drinks, only issue I had was smokers!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 17, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
