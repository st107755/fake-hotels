I stayed 3 nights at this hotel. I stayed at a lot of hilton hotels around the world and they stay is always amazing. This hotel was different, I paid 400 dollars a night in order to sleep horrible since i could perfectly hear whatever the people in the rooms next to were saying . I could hear the TV from the person form one side until 1 am. Finally, when it stopped, a couple form the other side started arguing and it was like having them inside the room. If you want to relax, i don't recommend this place.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 22, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
