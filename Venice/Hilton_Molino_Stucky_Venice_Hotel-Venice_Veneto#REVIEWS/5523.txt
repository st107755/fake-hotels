This is a large modern hotel. Rooms and service are top notch. Of course, because it is large hotel run by an international chain, it lacks the charm of a proper Venetian palazzio. But at least everything  is smooth from checkin to breakfast to newspapers... Another upside is that rooms are larger than most hotels in Venice. The shuttle to go back and forth to the San Marco is also very reliable.   Tips: The hotel restaurant is convenient but soulless. There are some nice trattorias along the canal (turn right as you leave the hotel)Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare
