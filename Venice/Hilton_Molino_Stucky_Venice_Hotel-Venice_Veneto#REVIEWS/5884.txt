Absolutely fantastic location, beautiful rooms, amazing view (upgraded to Venice view). The crowning glory is the rooftop swimming pool which we got to ourselves every morning at 8.30 for at least an hour! We could not fault the cleanliness, hospitality & facilities. We can't wait to return for a cold glass of wine in the rooftop cocktail bar at sunset. Highly recommended by me as a hotel professional.Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
