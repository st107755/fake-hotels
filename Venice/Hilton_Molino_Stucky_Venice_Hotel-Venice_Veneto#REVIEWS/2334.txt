Better than expected. Staff was very polite & Helpful. Restaurant Bacaromii was a real culinary experience with good reasonably priced wine. Breakfast was usual but the ingredients were fresh including the Juices Cheese  the salmon etc. I could go on. Dinner was at Bacaromii & the signature dish was exceptional with a broad wine list to cover all pockets. On any future visit I will be going back to this restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 10, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Staff.
