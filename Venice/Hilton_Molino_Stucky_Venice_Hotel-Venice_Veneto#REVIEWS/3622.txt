Loved all the history with the hotel and the family that owned it as a mill. We were staying here for two nights after the cruise and had booked two rooms some where along the line they messed up the hotel reservations they only had one room available so they upgrade it to suite but let me tell you the pull out sofa is not comfortable. So yes a beautiful hotel but I think they over book alot we were not the only family having problemsRead moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
