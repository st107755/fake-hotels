We had a family suite and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel was lovely though everything was really expensive. The pool on the rooftop was stunning but quite small and sunloungers/ space ran out quickly (though the water in the pool was fairly chilly so there was always plenty of room in the water!) The views over Venice were amazing. Our room was spacious (we had a family suite) but fairly bland. The housekeeping was not really up to standard as there were a few issues with marks on the wall/ smelly bathroom which we raised with the hotel but is a little disappointing at this price. The boat to St Marks square was great and very regular.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
