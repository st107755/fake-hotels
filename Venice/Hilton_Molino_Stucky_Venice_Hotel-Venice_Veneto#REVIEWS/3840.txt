We stayed 2 nights, my boyfriend and myself and had an amazing experience. The hotel is very well situated, on the island "La Giudecca", only 15 minutes by boat to the piazza "San Marco" to which the hotel offers a free private shuttle. The staff was very helpful, especially in the restaurant "Bacaromi" where the waiter was able to communicate in many languages and had a very friendly and personal approach. The room was spacious and very clean; the bathroom had a bathtub and a walk-in shower however there was no bathrobe, which is a small detail but still a little bit surprising for a 5* hotel. The breakfast selection was extraordinary with a lot of different kinds of breads and a large choice between sweet and salty dishes.  We will definitely come back on our next visit.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
