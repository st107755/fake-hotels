We were here for three nights par of our 10 night holiday in Italy. Let me start with the location, we loved being on Giudecca away from the hustle,of venice proper. The ferry runs very regularly and is a short 15 minutes from San Marco.  Just being able to get way from the crowds for a few hours was a huge plus for us.   We paid for executive rooms (we had two connecting rooms with our teenagers) the use of the lounge for drinks and snacks was great. We also had a promotion that made the second room 50% off so our two rooms were pretty reasonable.   The breakfast was pretty good (eggs were runny) but was spot on for the price of free in the lounge. We didn't use the pool but did go up to see it. It was very nice and the views were spectacular.
