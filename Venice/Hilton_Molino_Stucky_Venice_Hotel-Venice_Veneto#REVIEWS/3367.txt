Our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice was wonderful.  Staff were very helpful with water taxi recommendations and restaurant reservations.  It was great to be a little apart from the hustle and bustle of the main island of Venice and the convenience of the Hilton water shuttle made getting back and forth very easy.  The room was very comfortable and had all the amenities we could have asked for.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your extremely kind review on this website.
