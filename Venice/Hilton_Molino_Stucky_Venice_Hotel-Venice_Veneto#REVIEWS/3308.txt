Very nice hotel, service was good, however you must use the Hotel's shuttle to and from Venice, or hire a water taxi. We had no problems getting to Venice, but at the end of two very long days, the shuttle was full and did not stop, or there was a very long line and we had to wait another hour to an hour and a half for the next shuttle. We paid for a water taxi back each night. It was such a hassle that we would not stay at this hotel next time.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 2, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor. I am pleased to read that you liked our property as well as our service but on the other hand feel sorry that you did not enjoy our location. I also do regret that you did not find our shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs as the feedback from our guests is in general very positive. The capacity is of 40 seats and we usually suggest our guest to be on the dock at least five minutes before leaving hour. May I take this opportunity to inform you that besides our complimentary shuttle and private water taxis, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / lines 2 - 4.1 - 4.2) Palanca station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12/20 minutes.  We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
