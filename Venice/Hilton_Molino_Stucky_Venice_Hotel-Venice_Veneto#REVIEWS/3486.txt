Enjoyed my stay, they have their own water taxi that takes you straight to San Marco Square or you can walk down to the local water taxi's.  Rooms were modern and nice.  I would opt to stay at the local hotels however trying to find them going through mazes of walkways can be frustrating. Lots of  other tourist navigating through between buildings and going up and down the bridges would have been frustrating. Hilton was perfect, boat drop off in front of hotel. It made it much easier going to the train station also.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
