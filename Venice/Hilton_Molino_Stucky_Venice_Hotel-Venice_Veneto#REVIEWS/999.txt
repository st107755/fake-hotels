This place was so nice! Good restaurant, nice size rooms. It had character as it used to be a flour( I think) mill. The spa is a must visit and the rooftop pool with amazing views of Venice. Staff was very nice. You can take their water taxi over to the city, for a charge but not much.  Will definitely be back.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 19, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
