Luckily my family only stayed one night in this place. It is so far from St. Mark's square if you are doing a quick trip - allow an hour to get there from the train station. By the time we got from the train station to the hotel and then back to St. Mark's all dining was closed. $100 room service to eat a light snack dinner. The shuttle was hot and took so long to get to the hotel - it makes one stop and waits....then I was told I would be charged extra for using the shuttle to get to the hotel. We requested to check out 1 hour later so our teens could use the pool   - since we had such a late night checking in -  which was not honored. Instead they had us go to the spa (which is far from the pool) and leave our stuff to go to the pool.  Another waste of time.
