A good Hilton hotel in an amazing location - the room was sizeable but a little disappointing, not looking too much like what was advertised.  Breakfast was good but not great, also quite expensive.  The hotel is situated between 2 water bus stops - 10 mins walk approximately to each. The hotel water bus shuttle was great but for most of the day it only goes to the Piazza San Marco ...  The rooftop pool was very nice after a tiring day exploring the city. Loungers were not easy to get though.  Staff were really helpful and nice offering to help whenever they could.  Venice is an amazing place to visit, but travel around the city is very expensive - use the bus from the airport to the bus station (15 euro return) and get a 24, 48 or 72 hours pass for water buses to get around…Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 10, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
