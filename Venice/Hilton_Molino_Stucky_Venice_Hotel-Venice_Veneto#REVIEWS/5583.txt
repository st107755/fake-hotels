The hotel is located on a separate island, just opposite to the city center of Venice. Therefore it has a very quiet environment (not as hectic as most hotels in Venice). There is a complimentary ferry service to the city. But also the public transportation service is worth to be used (unlimited use of the "vaporello" = bus-boats for 72 hours: 33â‚¬). Rooms and service are excellent.Read moreDate of stay: August 20101 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
