As I was traveling with my 3 kids, we booked a suite.  There was a mini kitchen and a sofa bed in the living room.  Request for a room with a view, as we overlooked other towers.  The sofa bed was a little old as it sunk in the middle.  We put the mattress on the floor - problem solved!  Breakfast was sumptuous with assorted breads, hot foods, saucisson & cheeses, and fruits.  There is also a Nutella stand in the hotel! My kids ordered crepes at least 4x!  To die for!  Hotel is great for families.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
