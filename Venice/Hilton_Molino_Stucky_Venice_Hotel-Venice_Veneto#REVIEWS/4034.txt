Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights before embarking on Celebrity Silhouette.  Excellent hotel and breakfast.  Staff very helpful and especially the concierge who even gave you maps of the restaurants to eat at in the area.  Was also brilliant for getting on the waterbus over to the port for embarking on the ship.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 28, 2014Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
