I stayed here for a conference. I was lucky and was upgraded. Being on Giudecca it is some distance (10 mins by boat) from the main attractions of Venice, but that was not a problem.   My only complaint was that the transfer boat to the main islands departed two minutes early resulting in me missing a tour. I was actually standing next to the boat as it departed and friends on board failed to persuade the captain to stop. So I missed my city tour. Did the hotel care? I'd say "not much" as I was passed from person to person who said my complaint would be dealt with. After the stay I received an email asking me to rate my stay so I mentioned it again. Still there was no response. So sadly they get low points for service.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your comments on this website.
