This is a great place to stay for a trip to Venice. The fact that it's not on the main island meant that you could get away from the hustle and bustle of the tourists and relax as well.  The roof top pool has stunning views and is the perfect place to relax after all the walking.  The hotel has a timetabled shuttle service that runs to St Mark's Square and when we were there it ran to the minute - so efficient. It's not particularly cheap, but then, not much is in Venice but the quality of the breakfast and food was very good. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
