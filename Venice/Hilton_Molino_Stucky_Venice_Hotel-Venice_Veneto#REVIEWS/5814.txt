Got a room for $149 on Priceline. This was a great hotel. If it wasn't for the Venice public transportation strike while we were there (which made its location a bit inconvenient) it would have been perfect. Ask Priceline for a 5-star venice hotel and you are likely to get the Hilton Molino Stucky. Best value in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: May 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
