My husband and I just got back from the Hilton and thought it was terrific.  We found this hotel by doing hotwire and were delighted with the results.  When we arrived we asked if there were any upgrades and were able to get a room overlooking the canal for only 60 euros more which was a fantastic rate.  The room was very clean and was great.  The staff were very helpful!  This is a great place to stay. Don't miss having drinks at the rooftop pool!Read moreDate of stay: March 2010HelpfulShare
