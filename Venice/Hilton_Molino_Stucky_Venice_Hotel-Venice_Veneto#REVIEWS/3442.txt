Stayed the night prior to boarding Celebrity Silhouette the following day. Our room had a beautiful view of the waterway and the passing boats and water taxis were a constant fascination. The room was large as was the bathroom, comfortable beds, peaceful and quiet at night. The rooftop pool has a lovely view of Venice and large enough to accommodate all around the pool. Breakfast was as good as any hotel of this calibre with good service. Front reception was efficient and pleasant. Would love to stay again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
