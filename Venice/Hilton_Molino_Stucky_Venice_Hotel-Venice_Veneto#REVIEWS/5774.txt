Nice hotel, in good locations with excellant amenities, very clean. Gym, Sauna, best I have ever come across in a hotel.Breakfast, too good. Roof top bar, definately a place for a few sun downer drinks with great views across Venice. Only one gripe, waiting staff of all levels seemed over worked and stressed, made us sometimes feel like we were a pain and not welcome, unfortunately, this alone would probably make me go elsewhere next time.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
