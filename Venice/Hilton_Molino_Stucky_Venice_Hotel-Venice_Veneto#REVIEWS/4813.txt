The Hotel is adequate the rooms where a good size and the stay where helpful. The bathroom was a large marble with both a shower and a bath. Overall the hotel was clean but its location was a bit isolated, as it was not set in the main part Venice. The Hotel did offer shuttle service to 2 Main locations in Venice. My biggest disappointment was the Internet. The hotel offered 2 options and Economy and Business Internet. The Economy Internet was slower than my first dial-up (taking 15-30 to open normal pages) for 9 Euros and the Business for 27 Euros.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest,  thank you for posting a review on Tripadvisor.
