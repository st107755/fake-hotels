Great hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the 'main' island. Guidecca is a great little island with some great restaurants. We stayed in an awesome suite for our honeymoon. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries and prosecco for the occasion!  Good shuttle service from the island. This hotel was a flour mill in a previous life.  Beautiful, clean, comfortable and great location.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 28, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
