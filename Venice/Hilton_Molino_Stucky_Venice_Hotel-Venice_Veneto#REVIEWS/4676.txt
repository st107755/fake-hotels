Nice hotel with shuttle boats which are useful.  Had a lovely stay, rooms pleasant had courtyard view.  Unfortunate did not get interconnecting rooms requested but got rooms very close in an alcove, so not too bad as out children older.  Views from sky bar are fantastic, shame its not open in the day in winter as was lovely and sunny and daylight view would be fantastic.  Very good with the children and sophisticated restaurant was quite happy to do burger for the kids while we ate lovely meal.  Got entrance to the spa free as diamond members, but dont think would have paid as, was just a jacuzzi and steam room with single sex sauna.  Indoor pool would have been lovely or heated outdoor in winter would have been lovely again in the day.  Cocktails were gorgeous too in skybar. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for posting an exhaustive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your positive comments on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
