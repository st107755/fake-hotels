great value overall. if you are a honors goldmember. you get executive lounge access, spa access and can avail to an upgrade if available as well as late checkout. Lisa from front desk checked us in and was very thorough and explained all our benefits and access and even gave us a map for Venice. transfer to and from is 6 euros pp/stay. you can arrange transportation to and from airport via the hotel through private taxi. yippy can also use the blue line ferry which stops directly in front. mini bar was fully stocked.Peter Thomas Roth toiletries. room on the small side so is the case for all of europe. We got a deluxe queen with a view of the grand canale/Venice. hotel has great amenities. the gym is a bit small. free weights are up the stairs. breakfast had very good service.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 21, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
