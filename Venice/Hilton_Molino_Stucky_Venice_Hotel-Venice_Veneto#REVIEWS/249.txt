I visited the Hilton yesterday night with my wife for redentore and had a lovely experience. We had dinner on the 08th floor of the hotel by the rooftop pool with an incredible view. The food was lovely andbso tasty and we managed to have an incredible view of Venice and fireworks. Definitely suggested to everyone for a special occasion. The only thing that I wasn't impressed about was the shuttle boat service as I found it quite disorganized..staff didn't know where the boat was going and didn't inform the guests correctly either.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for leaving your kind review on TripAdvisor.
