This is a lovely hotel and Venice is amazing. Molino Stucky is well located and the boat shuttle service is very good, and frequent. Very nice hotel, rooms are comfortable and well presented. The bar drinks are expensive but not surprising for a 5* hotel, and the Spa is spacious with lots of facilities - it would be good if the jacuzzi water was warmer though. The only let down during our stay at Molino Stucky is that the rooftop pool is not open until 15th May, despite the fact that the weather is already hot and sunny, and it' not like you can go out onto the terrace and even look at the view, it's all closed off, and that is a real shame, I think it could open earlier than it does in the year.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
