We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
