For a large corporate hotel the Hilton Molino Stucky was a good choice for our recent trip to Venice. We knew the hotel was on a separate island so that wasn't a problem for us although it might be for others. The shuttle to and from the mainland worked fine. It was nice to be able to retreat from the busy mainland back to Guidecca to recharge.   Any member of staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room to a front facing with a great view and access to the exec lounge. The room itself was a fair size with high ceilings. The minibar contained a shelf for storing our own drinks which is nice. There was no free water in the room but the water supply is safe to drink and tastes great. An ice machine and an ironing station were on our floor which was handy too.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 20, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the detailed information about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
