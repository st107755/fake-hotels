Away fro the hustle and bustle but just  10 minute (free) boat shuttle back to St Marks. Lovely hotel of high standards where some of the group have slipped in recent years. Roof top pool to cool off in the heat of the day or just to relax and take in the amazing views of Venice. A must of an evening with a glass of champagne!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
