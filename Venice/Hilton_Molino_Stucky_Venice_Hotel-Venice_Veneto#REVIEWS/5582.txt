This is a beautiful hotel about an hour from the airport by water taxi. It offers a regular complimentary water taxi service to and from St Marks Square among other places, and they arranged a free boat for us to Murano. Our room overlooked the canal so we could see the cruise ships coming in (our's included). The breakfast was amazing, wonderful coffees, lovely staff, and even sparkling wine and chocolate cake. We had a wonderful time at this hotel and is perfect for anyone about to go on a cruise in Venice as it is close to the port.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
