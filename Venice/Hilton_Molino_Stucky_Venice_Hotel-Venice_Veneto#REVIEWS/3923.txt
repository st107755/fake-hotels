we had the most perfect stay in this hotel thank you so much Hilton, for such a memorable stay. Beautiful room with added touches chocolates etc made our anniversary very special. We were not expecting such a spectacular room with views to match.  we loved the executive lounge and found the breakfast delightful.  Only good things to say about this hotel. Shuttle water bus brilliant no problems at all. Shame rooftop pool was closed as we wold have lie to have taken some photos fom there but none the less a great stay. Thank you to everyone in the hotel who made us so welcome.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 7, 2014Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
