Stay here!! We are Hilton Honors members and upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite! It was the most amazing surprise.  Our suite had two bedrooms with the most magnificent views of Venice. The room was so clean with beautiful orchids in each room. The water taxi provided by the hotel is so easy to jump on and get back from and the staff gave us umbrellas one day it rained.    There are great dining options at the hotel including a nutella bar!!! Bonus! But we only ate at the bar one evening.  The rooftop pool and bar is worth the stay alone as it is probably one of the most amazing views I have ever seen.   The only downside is getting to and from the airport.  On the last day we ordered a water taxi to the Venice airport which was very pricey but is expected.  It worth itâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 7, 2017Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time at our property and we thank you very much for your loyalty to Hilton and for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
