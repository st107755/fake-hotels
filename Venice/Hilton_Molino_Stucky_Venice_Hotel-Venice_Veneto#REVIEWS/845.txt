This is an amazing hotel on do many levels. It is a short boat ride to St Marks Square. We were there in February when it was very cold. The hotel was warm and welcoming.Breakfast is well worthy of note. The rooftop bar is worth a visit. Bars in the hotel are not cheap!Would definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 2, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you have enjoyed your stay with us.
