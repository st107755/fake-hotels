This is the perfect hotel for pre or post cruise traveller's. This hotel has its own dock and the Alilaguna Blue Boat stops here to/from the cruise terminals. No hassle with the luggage and walking all over Venice looking for your hotel. The hotel is beautiful and the staff could not have been any nicer. They run their own complimentary shuttle to and from St. Mark's Square, since this hotel is on Giudecca Island across from the main part of Venice. The rooftop pool/bar area is great for looking at the lights of the city!!  We loved it here and would stay here anytime!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments.
