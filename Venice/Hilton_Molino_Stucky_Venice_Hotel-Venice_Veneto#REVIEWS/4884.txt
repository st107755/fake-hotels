We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and we had a fantastic time!  We stayed in a executive room with a view and it was lovely, we had a fantastic view of the canal and saw some magnificent cruise ships. The rooftop pool is gorgeous, but quite busy. However sunbeds do become available as people generally do not stay all day. The drinks are very overpriced but expected for a Hilton. We had use of the executive lounge and this supplied us with unlimited drinks, wine, beer, soft drinks and fruit juice. Spirits are only available at certain times.  The breakfast is lovely, just a nice amount of choice.  The only down side is there is no shower at the pool, and no shower room for after you have checked out. Very surprising for a Hilton!   We would definitely stay again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive feedback I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hotel and our services and you enjoyed your stay in our property.
