Spent two nights here July 2016.  Staff could not be any friendlier.  As a Diamond member, we were upgraded to a canal view.  Room was not large, but ample for the 3 of us.  Bathroom was huge by European standards. Shuttle ran every 20 minutes, was easy to get familiar with. The pool felt a little cool initially, but really was quite comfortable once in.  The views were excellent, as it was on the rooftop overlooking Venice.   The bar prices were fairly expensive - 15 Euros for a Mohito, $8Euros for a beer.  Still felt like you were in a luxury resort.   Totally enjoyed stay and the super friendliness of all the staff.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 4, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your positive comment about the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
