As you’d expect with a Hilton in Venice this hotel is grand, plush rooms are of a good size and well decorated but for me it’s the wrong location as you need to either use the vaporetto water bus service and a 5/10 min walk or the hotel shuttle (good value at €7.50 per stay) which only goes to St Marks in the day plus Zattere in the evenings. Venice is a walking city and I’d prefer to be able to walk to and from a more central locationRead moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2018Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca island was not entirely to your expectations; it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
