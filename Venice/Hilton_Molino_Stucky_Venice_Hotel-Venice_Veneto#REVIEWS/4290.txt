We stayed here the 2nd week in July for 2 nights prior to our cruise. Normally we would stay in a smaller hotel in center of things, but decided not to drag our luggage through all the streets and canals of Venice this time.  We were so happy with the decision. The Hilton Molino is a beautiful hotel, with a fabulous roof top patio and bar.  The views were endless and breathtaking.  We had a suite with a full living/dining room, 2 bathrooms and views of the waterways.  A cruise ship sailed right by our windows.  We ate at the hotel's waterfront restaurant and had wonderful food and outstanding service.    This hotel started our holiday off in the right way.  We would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
