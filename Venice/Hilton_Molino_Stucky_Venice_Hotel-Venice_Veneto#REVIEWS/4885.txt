Venice is crowded and pretty commercial....probably because gigantic cruise ships disgorged huge throngs of tourists in the morning.  Things settle down in the evening.  Venice has good restaurants and plenty of sights to see.  The back canals of Venice are smelly (at least in the summertime).    The Hilton Molino Stucky is outstanding.  Cleanliness, service, rooms, and appointments were very good.  The fact that this hotel is located on Giudecca (far from the maddening crowd) is really nice even though it required the free water taxi to the main areas of Venice.  The water taxi operated frequently.  Room service was excellent and the AM breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Rooftop pool and bar were really cool.  I loved this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
