We took the public water bus to Stucky when we arrived. The stop was 2 bridges away so try not to carry heavy luggages.  We were upgraded to a suite with great water view as we wanted to have daily breakfast... very lovely classy spacious rooms with great soft mattress! The hotel standard was of a higher than usual Hilton standard. The bathroom is rather large and pampering  The Breakfast buffet was amazing... good spread and value for money!!!   Tips- next time drop one stop earlier- the walk is shorter.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
