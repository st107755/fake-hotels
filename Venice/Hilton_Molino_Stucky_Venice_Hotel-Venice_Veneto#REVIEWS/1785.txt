This is a fabulous hotel in a great location. The roof top pool and bar have fantastic views of Venice.  The hotel is spotless clean and staff very helpful.  Recommend to book breakfast ad cheaper than eating out for breakfast and it has a great selection.  There are some nice restaurants nearby which are worth considering as main island very busy and more expensive.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 26, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
