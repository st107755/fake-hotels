Nice hotel, but with a few drawbacks. The service on the reception and concierge was perfect. We had a standard Kings room that was OK, good bed but the room was not quite clean, the bathtub had some hairs probably from the previous inhabitants. The view from the room was on the wall of adjacent building and construction works. The breakfast was very good with an excellent service. There were two main problems: the hotel is located on Giudecca Island - away from all attractions and you will be confined to the shuttle or vaporetto which is inconvenient and tiring. The second problem are mosquitos - we were unable to open the window because of them. Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
