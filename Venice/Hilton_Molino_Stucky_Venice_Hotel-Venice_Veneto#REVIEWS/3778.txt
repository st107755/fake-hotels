Great room, ask for a canal view!!  The higher floor the better. Staff was very caring and gracious.  One of the best Hilton's I have ever stayed at.  The sky bar is awesome and the MoÃ«t Chandon mojito's are truly amazing.    Exec lounge is good free breakfast buffet is very nice as well.  Drinks are pricey but when everything arrives by small boat.....  Water taxi service is first rate.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
