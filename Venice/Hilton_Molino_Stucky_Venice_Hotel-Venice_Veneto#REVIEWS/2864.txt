We loved the Hilton Molino Stucky. Our room was stunning; the bed was amazing, separate lounge room and views over the Canal back to Venice. We spent an hour sitting in the window ledge drinking wine admiring the view.   It's a nice spot on the little island with a couple of excellent restaurants just along the water within a short walk. The roof top bar has outstanding views of Venice!   The ferry service is easy and very convenient and the service was fantastic. Exceeded expectations and loved every minute of our stay. Highly recommend to anyone.
