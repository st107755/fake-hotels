Having stayed in many 5* hotels around the world, it is natural to compare the ways in which each hotel justifies this status. The Hilton is quiet and away from the tourist hub of San Marco. The room is nice and well air conditioned, which was very much needed. However, this hotel falls down in the same way many Hilton hotels do. They overcharge for everything (!) and rely on the brand to justify its ‘quality’. No free bottles of water in the rooms (€6 per bottle). A shuttle boat to San Marco, which was really helpful but was an extra charge. The price for food, particularly breakfast, in the hotel was particularly extortionate (€27pppd). Disappointing and needs rethinking otherwise this will simply attract business folks and rich cruise-going holiday makers.Read moreDate of stay: August 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky.
