Large hotel with only a few rooms that actually are truly "facing" Venice.  Be aware and book carefully.  Great staff and facilities.  Frequent "Hilton waterbus" to and from St. Mark Square (10 minute walk).  Don't plan on a Hilton Bus to Zattere, like most web sites state.  This only happens in the evening and thus is of no use for catching a train using this route.  Upgrade to the "Executive Lounge for no more than 50 Euros" if you can and are a coffee drinker.  A couple of morning coffees in the restaurant will set you back more than that alone plus you get a full breakfast, afternoon and evening snacks and beverages as well.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor.
