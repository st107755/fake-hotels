I would describe this hotel as a good 4* hotel. Pool was lovely, roof terrace nice at night to enjoy a quiet drink. The down sides:-  Tea and Coffee in the room were never refilled. Drinks were expensive. Not enough sunloungers at the pool. Breakfast was dear for what it was.  All in all though I would stay here again as its location was perfect for Venice and trips. I would also recommend a private speedboat from the airport as it comes direct to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
