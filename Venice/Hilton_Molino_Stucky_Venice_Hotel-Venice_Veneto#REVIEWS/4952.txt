Hotel on Guidecca. Excellent - wonderful views from room, staff very helpful and friendly - stayed for 4 nights. Glad it was away from the crowds of San Marco. Hotel had own water taxi which was free and very regular. Roof top pool was a bonus but usually very busy. Would recommend this hotel and would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
