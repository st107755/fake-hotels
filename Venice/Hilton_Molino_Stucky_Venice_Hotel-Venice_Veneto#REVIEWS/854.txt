Posh but unpretentious, this hotel is beautiful...and the view from here is a signature view of Venice.  The rooms were very nicely decorated and comfortable, the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly.  The rooftop bars and pools were very nice with stunning views over Venice.  Nice spa and gym that is free for guests.  The city water taxis stop right at the hotel dock and Hilton has there own shuttle boat to take you across the canal throughout the day.  Wonâ€™t hesitate to stay here again on our next visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 19, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
