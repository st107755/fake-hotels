Stayed at this hotel with my son and daughter in one of their suites. On arrival there was a lovely welcoming bottle of wine,on ice, waiting for us.   We were also upgraded to a superior suite with breathtaking views.  The hotel is beautiful and staff must be all hand picked. Nothing a bother for them, ever so helpful.  When I saw the hotel on the map I thought it would be a hassle getting to it but it was perfect and the boat service from the hotel is so easy to use. A few minutes walk up from the hotel there are a few restaurants which serve delicious food,we dined at three of them and were not disappointed.   I would definitely stay at the hotel again as I said perfectRead moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
