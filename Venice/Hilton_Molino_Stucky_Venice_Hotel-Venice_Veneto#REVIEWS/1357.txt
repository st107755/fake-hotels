We stayed here using Hilton points. The hotel has a water taxi for a one time small fee that runs on a schedule to take you to San Marco square. This was a huge plus. The hotel is not on the 'main' part of Venice. The hotel rooms are a little dated in the bathroom, but served the purpose. The building is an old flourmill and has been nicely restored. The staff was friendly.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 19, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
