Enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. The food and drink package was well worth the cost. The only drawback is that it is away from the city center - you have to go back and forth in a water taxi to get to San Marcos and the other Venetian islands. Our room had a spectacular view, but could hear the dock clanging all night. A Norwegian cruiseship woke me up one morning at 3am. Exciting though to see it stream on by.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 14, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your kind review on TripAdvisor.
