This is a perfect hotel for a romantic trip to Venice.  I'm not quite sure what some of the other reviews are on about - YES it is a short boat trip to the mainland but that just adds to the charm and uniqueness of the place.  We found boats were always on time and were very easy to use.   Rooms were very spacious, beds super comfortable and showers were amazing!!! Best of all however, was the fact you can book to use the spa area on first floor absoutely FREE. they had a jacuzzi, turkish bath, relaxation area and saunas. We used it everyday to soothe our tired legs and feet after hours of wandering around Venice.    If i went back I wouldn't stay anywhere else - the hotel was just perfect!!!Read moreDate of stay: December 2009HelpfulShare
