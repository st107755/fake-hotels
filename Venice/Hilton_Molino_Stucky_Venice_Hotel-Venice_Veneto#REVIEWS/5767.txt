My review is probably coloured by the fact that we were in a tiny room overlooking the back of the hotel... no view at all. Only good point was roof top bar - even there, you need to stand up and look over the wall to know you are in Venice. Ordered room service at 10pm, delivered at midnight and cold. No atmosphere, big empty lobby and bar... could easily be a shopping mall. So disappointed that we left the hotel at 8am every morning and went back as late as we could.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
