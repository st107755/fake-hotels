It's certainly got the wow factor when you arrive by night. Once inside it's pretty much standard fare. The room was comfortable enough, but the air con is only operational from May due to local laws so I was told - making it a little uncomfortable if you aren't acclimatised. The service was a little lack lustre but that may just be that we expect good service as minimum. One exception has to be the young waiter in the bar - tall thin chap - very accommodating. The water taxi is a bonus but less frequent that you'd probably like. The location is a touch 'away from it all' but it depends what you want.  All in all not a bad place to be, maybe not quite as authentic as staying more central. Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
