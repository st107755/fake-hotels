The Hilton Molino is the best place to stay in Venice.   Away from the crowds.  My family had no complaints at all.   They loved the friendly staff and so helpful.  Amazing executive lounge with happy hour 5 to 7.  The pool and Sky lounge has a specature view of Venice.   So Beautiful.   I will definitely stay there again when in Venice.   LOVED LOVED it.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website!
