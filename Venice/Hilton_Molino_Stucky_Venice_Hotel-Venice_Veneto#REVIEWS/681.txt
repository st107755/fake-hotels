I took my daughters to Venice in early June.  The hotel is beautiful, location is fabulous, rooftop pool and bar offer stunning views!  The staff was not terribly helpful except for the Roberto who was on the rooftop and Cristina in the lobby bar.  They made all of the difference.  Rooms are a little tired, especially if you don’t have an outside view.  But bathrooms are fully renovated and wonderful.  Shuttle service incredibly convenient.  Nutella bar a favorite for my girls.  And the island away from the crowds has some lovely restaurants with real local flavor for reasonable prices.  Can’t wait to return!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
