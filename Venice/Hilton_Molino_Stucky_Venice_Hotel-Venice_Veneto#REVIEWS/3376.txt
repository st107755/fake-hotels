We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations.  The Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, which is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions.  May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned trattorie and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
