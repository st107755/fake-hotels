This is a stunning building in a great location. The view from the rooftop pool is awesome. The water shuttle works very effectively so being away from the centre doesn't matter - in fact it's probably a bonus.   But - it is on such large scale that it felt quite impersonal. The room decor is dark, heavy, and a little baroque. Probably appropriate for Venice but not to my taste. The pool area is ridiculously small for a hotel this size and in the height of summer only a lucky few got beds. The sky bar is lovely, though the drinks are typically Venetian prices. All in all not quite as nice an experience as the photos had led me to expect. And 20 Euros per room per day for Wi-Fi is shocking!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir, dear Madame,  thank you for sharing your experience with us and with the TripAdvisor community.   We appreciate being advised of any breach in the usual service for which our hotel is noted.  In regard to your comments on the size of the pool, may I say that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient building and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which has certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal, including our rooftop pool area and Spa. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our guests.   We place great value on your opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.  Best regards  Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
