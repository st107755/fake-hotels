This is a beautiful hotel, looks new yet it has the "Venice feel" - we would surely come back again.  As usual the staff at Hilton are always very good "speaks good english, friendly and helpful"  We were at Hilton Milan before and to us "the concierge at most Hilton is always the best" - Thank You.     Shuttle boat hours are excellent that runs till very late at night and convenient   Overall very good  Tan HuatRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
