We stayed only for one night at the end of our cruise in this hotel and it was one of the best hotels we have stayed in for a while. The Breakfast was good, very clean and large family room, and though it is not cheap I don't think it is that much more expensive than the other hotels in venice. The boat to St Marks is frequent. Unfortunately we didn't have time to explore many things in the hotel and would definitely recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest, We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
