I came here 3 years ago and was here now for my anniversary,  I emailed researvatons to see if I could have the same room.  They emailed me back saying they noted my request.  When I checked in they mentioned my anniversary but did nothing extra.  The hotel room was smaller than last time and this time I used 30000 extra points.  Also this time they charge 450 euro for the water taxi and there is no hard liquor.  While it is still beautiful and I recommend it,  As a repeat customer I am disappointed. On a side Note, no ice came out of the ice machine.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
