This hotel had great service and Frank was very nice when checking us in. The rooms were comfortable and big. I loved the ceilings wood work and the fact it was an flour mill at one point. The big windows that open in the room are lovely. The pool on the roof looked amazing but was closed.There are some pretty nice restaurants in the hotel and the lattes in the lobby were yummy but expensive. You do have to take their free water taxi anytime you want to go somewhere; some people may not like this. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the pricing :( 7 Euro for a can of coke from the mini bar is a little extreme and the wifi is not free (except in the lobby) and was 20 Euro a day in your room . To watch a movie was 14 Euro! Venice or not that is costly. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
