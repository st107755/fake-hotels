We are disappointed that you did not like the structure of our hotel, a building which dates back to the 19TH century and restored converting the original structure of the old flour mill Molino Stucky. I am also sorry that you did not enjoy the quality of our coffee as we receive a lovely feedback from our guests. We acknowledge your comments on prices, though I can also assure you that prices of food and beverage in our bars and restaurants are in line with other 5-stars hotels in Venice. In regard to internet, to improve guest satisfaction Hilton Hotels constantly review their pricing policies. With this in mind, complimentary internet will be introduced at the beginning of 2013 in the public areas of all Hilton hotels.  We thank you anyway for your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our guests. Sincerely, Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
