We stayed here for a couple of nights mid July and were very happy. We got a big room with a view towards the water and enjoyed everything that the hotel had to offer. The pool was great since it was close to 30 degrees celsius and we spent a lot of time walking around in Venice which can be pretty exhausting, having a swim when you get back is very pleasent. The breakfast was tasty and had most of the things we wanted, it was a bit disorganized since so many ate at the same time. The staff was helpful and the boat service very much needed. There are of course both pros and cons with having the hotel in Giudecca instead of central Venice. I can imagine coming back here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
