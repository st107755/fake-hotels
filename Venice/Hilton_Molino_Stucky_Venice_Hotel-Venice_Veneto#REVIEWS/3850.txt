Starting from getting on the hilton water shuttle from zattere to the property which is majestic and finally the awe inspiring view of venice from our room, the hotel was special in every respect. The servers a pleasure to speak with.  The buffets very wide in their range. The property is a heritage pasta mill and they have preserved much of the original look. Being on the water front was a delight and reminded each time that we were in Venice. Overall a very good experience with a familyRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
