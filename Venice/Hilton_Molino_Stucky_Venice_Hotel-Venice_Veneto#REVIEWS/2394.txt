We stayed here for 2 nights during carnival and it was a great location, just a short shuttle bus ride from St Marco Square, a lovely peaceful hotel away from the hustle and bustle and all the madness.  Room was lovely, staff were fabulous, the buffet breakfast was very good but a bit busy and staff there were rushing around.  We ate in the lobby bar and the Bacarami restaurant and the food and service were good in both.  We also had cocktails at the Skyline bar and again the service was excellent.  The shuttle bus to St Marco square was very easy to use running every 30 minutes.  We were very pleased we chose to stay at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 7, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
