We had a 2 night stay at this hotel in June. This hotel is very outdated. They upgraded is to a room with a view. But the sofa in the room was falling apart and just looked old. The ceilings were very low. The smell in the lobby of the air freshener is very overwhelming. The pool is very small.  The concierge was helpful and the executive lounge was nice for the kids to grab a drink after a hot day. It was also nice to be away from the crowds in the center of town. The beds were comfortable.  However This hotel was not worth the money we spent. We told the front desk how we felt about our room and they just didn't care at all.

I am sorry if your stay with us has not been up to your expectations and please accept our apologies if we were not able to offer you a move to another room due to very high occupancy. In regard to your comments on the size of the pool, may I say that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient building and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which has certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal, including our rooftop pool area. I am pleased to inform you that we are in the process of reviewing the rooms designs and I do hope that should your plans bring you back one day in Venice, you will give us another opportunity to serve you.  Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
