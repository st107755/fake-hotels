The views of Venice from the roof are amazing. The pool is not heated but was ok (refreshing!!) at the end of September! The bar offered very good cocktails at a reasonable price. The bed was very comfortable. I rarely sleep well in hotels but I got a solid 6 hours here. Bath towels were huge and luxurious.  Breakfast was very good. I'd definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
