This was a great hotel in a great location.  Away from the hustle and bustle of St. Marks a really good hideaway.  Fabulous roof terrace and although it's not a cheap hotel - most things in Venice are not cheap!   We did have a problem with a noisy party on the roof going on into the early hours but when we spoke to the front desk they were very apologetic and did compensate us without any hassle.  They did warn us but it did go on longer than we though. Lovely weekend.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Madame,  thank you very much for your positive comments.
