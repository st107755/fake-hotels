First impressions of a very imposing hotel are eroded by niggling shortcomings which should have been dealt with years ago. The "executive lounge" which is tiny considering the size of the hotel and which has one very poorly positioned coffee machine which often meant a 10 minute wait for a hot drink each morning and no access to the breakfast buffet due to the coffee queue directly in front??? The hotel which must accommodate 100's of people has a boat service which carries 39 people which is hopeless during busy periods both too and from the hotel and  certainly spoils the magic of Venice when you stand in line for 30-40 mins to get in or out of your premium hotel. Lovely staff but come on Hilton, get your act together.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor and we are sorry if we did not entirely meet your expectations. I do regret that you did not find our  shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs, however we can offer a guaranteed maximum number of seats and we are sorry that during your stay you were experiencing some difficulties in finding available space. May I take this opportunity to confirm that our shuttle boat runs every 20 to 40 minutes from 8 am in the morning until late after midnight. In addition, Alilaguna public lines stop also in front of the Hotel, with direct connections to the Airport and the Cruise Harbour. Also, the ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
