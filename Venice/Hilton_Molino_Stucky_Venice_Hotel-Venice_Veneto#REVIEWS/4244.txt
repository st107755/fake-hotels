My husband and I recently stayed at the Hilton. The facilities were excellent. It was very easy to take the water shuttle back and forth to St. Mark. Being a Hilton Diamond, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  I would highly recommend this hotel. We were taking a cruise after our hotel stay. It was very easy to take the water bus to the cruise port.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
