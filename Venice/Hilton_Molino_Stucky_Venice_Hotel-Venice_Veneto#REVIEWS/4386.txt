Stayed for two nights before our cruise. After a bad flight, lost luggage and a rough ride on water taxi due to bad weather we were feeling very stressed on arrival at hotel. We given a lovely welcome and the help and support given by the reception staff was amazing. Our room overlooking the lagoon was lovely, fascinating to watch all the boat activity and especially the arrival and departure of the cruise ships.  Loved the location, as other reviews have stated its so peaceful after the hustle and bustle of Venice. Unfortunately due to the weather we were unable to use the roof pool, but the Sky Bar was amazing. Would defiantly return and would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
