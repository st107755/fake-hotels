Stayed here in November 2013 as part of a secret escape deal. Rooms are small but well appointed. The hotel itself is a superb building with a smart if a little functional interior. The rooftop bar is well worth the visit, it gives fantastic views of the city. Excellent value compared to other hotels in the city, particularly when you're really only using your hotel as a base whilst touring Venice. The location is superb, you can be in st michales square within minutes on the free water taxi. Don't expect the opulence of somewhere like the danieli, but if you want a really smart hotel in a super location at a decent price, the molino stucky is for you!Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 10, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel.

We really look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.   Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
