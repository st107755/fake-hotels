The Hotel was at a great location, away from all the very busy areas.  It was our own little private Island.  The water taxi provided by the hotel took only 5 minutes to get across the canal.  Excellent Breakfast.  The only thing we were bummed about was that the pool was closed during our stay, May 12th and 13th.  The roof top bar was really nice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
