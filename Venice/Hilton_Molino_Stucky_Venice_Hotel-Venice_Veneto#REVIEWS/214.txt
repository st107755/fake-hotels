The check in process was painful. Waited almost 30mins. The room was okay. I guess I was going for their discounted offer so I got what a paid for: a room that needs refurbishing. Carpets along the corridor looked knackered too. I have to request for things or you won’t have them in your room. I was woken up by a kid running down the hall. Breakfast was okay. This hotel is in the most beautiful location with the best canal views and yet they serve breakfast in a room with no windows. The hotel is beautiful however the quality of the experience wasn’t there.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website.
