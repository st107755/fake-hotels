This is one of the best Hilton hotels in the World. Views to Venice downtown are great (from rooms with view and from rooftop bar). This is good place to spend holidays. Only problem with this hotel is location. It was hard to find complimentary hotel shuttle boat docks from downtown and other boats are quite expensive.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 27, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback ! I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hotel and our services and that you enjoyed your stay in our property. We also thank you for taking the time to let us know your opinion on our complimentary shuttle service: we are sorry that you have experienced some difficulties in locating the stop of the boat at San Marco. Unfortunately signposting and advertising in Venice is extremely restricted. From our side, we are trying to give the most accurate and precise information on the Venice City Map provided from the hotel, where the stops of our shuttle are well marked. Also, our Concierge Team is available round the clock to assist guests with information and any other additional services.  Thank you very much for being our guest and we hope to welcome you soon again. Best regards,  Mario Ferraro General ManagerRead more
