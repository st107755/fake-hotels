We are happy to have stayed here!  We are Hilton Honors members, and are always happy to receive the personal attention that Hilton provides.  The service here was excellent. Every staff member did his or her job cheerfully and promptly. Since we were there on a layover between our cruise and our flight home, there were many details to attend, and the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice went out of their way to help us. The restaurants were top rate, Bacaromi being our favorite, and we ate better there than many other places on our cruise.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 15, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for sharing your Venetian experience at Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
