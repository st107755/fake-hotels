This is a really beautiful hotel. We paid a little extra for access to the executive lounge which includes breakfast and snacks/beverages all day. The food was good and it was worth the extra cost. The hotel has a great rooftop bar and pool with beautiful views, but limited seating by the pool. The design and artwork in the hotel is lovely and our room was also very nice. Service was great and everyone was very helpful. So glad we stayed here!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 17, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
