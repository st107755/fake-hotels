We visited this hotel because prices were apparently discounted Could not complain about the outstanding service at reception or the superb breakfasts.. Rooms were well soundproof d and beds very comfortable. Two minor gripes were 1. the filling of the minifridge  so we could not use it for our own needs ( there was no price list to the bottles in there).and 2. the armchair, although comfortable was short in the back so could not be used for full relaxation.. Free boat service was excellent and reliable.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your positive comments on Tripadvisor.
