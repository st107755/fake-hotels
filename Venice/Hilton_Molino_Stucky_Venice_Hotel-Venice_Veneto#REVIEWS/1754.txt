My husband is a Hilton Diamond member and we were treated royally at this hotel. I had inquired about obtaining some distilled water for my husband's CPAP machine, and they had the local pharmacy deliver it and it was waiting for us at check-in!  We were upgraded to a lovely mini suite, which was very comfortable. Everyone is very professional. I highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
