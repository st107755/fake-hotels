We enjoyed a long weekend in Venice and used the Hilton as our base.  Loved being away from the crowds and the rooftop bar and pool were awesome. It is big and I mean a big hotel but kept really well, staff all very polite and friendly. Drinks were expensive though.  Regular courtesy water bus worked really well, you do get charged €7.50 per stay, I’d say it’s well worth it.  I’d recommend the place for sure and I’d happily stay again myself Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
