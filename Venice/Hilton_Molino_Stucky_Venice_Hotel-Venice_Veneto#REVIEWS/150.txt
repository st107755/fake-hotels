The hotel is situated in an old factory which has been completely refurbished. Small entrance in relation to the size of the building. Very helpful staff. Great breakfast. The room was very nice, however without a view due to the structure of the building. Nice rooftop pool with a splendid view on Venice. Good watertaxi service to San Marco.
