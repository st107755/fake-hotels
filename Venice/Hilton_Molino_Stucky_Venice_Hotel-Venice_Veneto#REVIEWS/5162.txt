Excellent accommodations!  I was contacted ahead of time to confirm my reservations and was provided with many options for my visit.  Beautiful room on the canal and an endless pool on the top floor that overlooks all of Venice.  Easy transportation on the blu line from the port and they have a private shuttle that runs where you need to go.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Trip Advisor.
