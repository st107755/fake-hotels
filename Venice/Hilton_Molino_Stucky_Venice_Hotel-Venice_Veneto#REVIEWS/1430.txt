Disappointing for a Hilton which are usually very good, the check-in was a trying experience... they didn't know all of our booking details, forgot that we had asked for upgrades and weren't very helpful. The room was okay, the bed was great and we had a good nights sleep. However several lights weren't working, there was mould in the shower room, no extractor fan, the T.V kept freezing. The concierge service was good and the ground floor of the hotel was lovely, restaurants were nice, well priced and good food. the transport to the St Marco was regular and easy to use. We ordered the couples package (champagne and chocolate strawberries) horrible cheap chocolate and sub-standard champagne (not worth 50 euros)Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 12, 2017Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.
