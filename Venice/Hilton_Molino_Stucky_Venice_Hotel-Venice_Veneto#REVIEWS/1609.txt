This hotel is situated in an old flour mill. While it is modern and classy, there are photos of what the building once looked like and parts os the buildings that hint at its past.   We stayed for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our time.  Our room was just the right size, the breakfast selections were varied and delicious, and the spa was excellent. The views from the roof-top pool deck are amazing!   We are glad we upgraded to a room overlooking the canal. It was fun to see all the traffic go by. There is a vaporetto stop at the hotel which makes it easy to get to San Marco square especially since it is free.    Staff are accommodating and pleasant. We would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 29, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
