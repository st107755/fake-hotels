This hotel is not on the main island of Venice, but close enough.  We took water taxi from train station to the hotel for 70 euros.  It took about five minutes.  The check in process was quick and easy.  We had one bedroom suite (upgraded I guess).  There is a king bed in the bedroom and queen size sofa bed in the living room.  The window is facing the canal and the city which is great.  We tried public water bus which work out very well.  There are two stops near the hotel, one on each side,  The executive lounge is in a L shape , next to the front desk.  It kinds of odd.  The food and drink there are in good quality.  The rooftop swimming poor is not very large, but the view there is great.  The breakfast has a large varieties of offering.  Overall, a great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. We are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and we thank you for mentioning the room upgrade as well as some hotel facilities like our Executive Lounge. It was also important to know that you have appreciated the great views from our Skyline Rooftop Bar and Pool which have no comparison in Venice. In regard to your comments on the size, may I say that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which has certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal, including our rooftop pool area. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
