Third visit stayed four nights from 19 Th June to celebrate special birthday.Special functions caused pool to close at 15.00 Saturday and Skyline Bar to be closed Saturday and Sunday,Prior notice not received as TV and hotels messaging service not working Concierge rude when we pointed out prior warnings of closures would have prevented us being seriously inconvenienced,Even Guest Services  Manger not aware of second closure until the morning it occurred.On Saturday there was anther large Private Function under our first floor window involving very large amplifier,shouting cheering,yelling and what seemed like bingo numbers being called until at least midnight.I understand there were a lot of complaints received from guests.Verdict Customer Relations in need of improvement.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
