First tip travel from airport on waterbus not taxi. Much cheaper the Hilton has its own stop right outside. Allow plenty of time transfer takes approx 1 hour 30 mins. We stayed in room 605 top floor canal view worth the extra and gave access to exec lounge free soft drinks and snacks available through out the day. Hotel has a roof top pool for a welcome dip after a days sight seeing. The skyline bar not to be missed for a cocktail and views. The staff are very helpful and cannot do enough for you. Hotel is not on the 'main' island but with the free shuttle boat only minutes away. I love it here and would definitely stay here at the Hilton again Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
