A great hotel, built from a pasta factory into one of the most delightful hotels I have ever stayed in. The service was excellent, the concierge helpful and the restaurant produced an amazing meal. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the views are amazing, especially from the roof top spa.  I would recommend staying here, but be aware that there is limited public transport access.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 14, 2015Dear Madame, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
