A bit pricey even on the low end of the scale but Venice is expensive and its a one shot deal to see the sites. Call to ask them about their shuttle service and route so you don't have to pay the high end of a water taxi. Fabulous skyline view, restaurant was excellent too. Great night sleep. Open terrace pool area-can see the whole city. Loved everything about it. other then the Wifi service only in the public areas and not in your room? seriously?Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
