On a girlfriends trip through Italy in September 2012, we booked into Hilton Molino Stucky for 3 nights. Although we were initially concerned about the location not being on San Marco, this proved completely unfounded. The hotel is absolutely incredible and its location was perfect allowing us to visit nearby San marco but escape the maddening crowds and retreat into calm serenity. The hotel staff were incredibly helpful, breakfast was definitely the best we had by far in Italy and we enjoyed the spa, gym and rooftop pool. Definitely the hotel of choice when we go back to Venice!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotelâ€™s facilities.
