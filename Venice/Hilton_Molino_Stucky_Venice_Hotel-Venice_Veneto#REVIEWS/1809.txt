This hotel is away from the crowds.  Hilton does provide a free water taxi into St Marks Square, about a 10 minuet ride.  This runs on time, every 20 minutes.  Room was large, very nice.  Bathroom had separate tub and shower, double sinks.  Furnishings were nice.   Only negative for the price, free wifi should have been included.  There was free wifi in the common areas.  Lots of places to sit in the lobby, nice bar.  Breakfast has all the usual choices, plus they will make a custom omelette.  The server discouraged this saying it would take 30 mins.  The staff was helpful and friendly.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
