A Hilton that is unlike any I've stayed and beautiful in every detail. Service was excellent (Front desk, Concierge, room cleaning, restaurants). Water taxi service is complimentary to key drop-off points in Venice. As we had several bags we took a private water taxi service to and from the airport (120 Euro each way). The Hotel arranged a private water taxi for a business meeting. Excellent arrangement. The complimentary was very convenient for bopping around. Away from the crowds which was very appreciated. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here agin. Highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 18, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for your very positve review on your experience with us.
