Stayed here for four nights- this place is pretty fabulous! The room was beautiful, comfy and spotless. We also booked a meeting room and the service was amazing - thanks Chiara! Rooftop pool (infinity pool with bar service) is extraordinary and it was nice to stay in Guidecca - just a stones throw from the throngs of tourists in Venice itself. I would absolutely love to go back and would highly recommend it to anyone.
