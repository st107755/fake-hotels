We have stayed at the Malino Stuckey several times and have never been disappointed. The staff is always ready to help. The pool area with the overview of the canal and Venice is great. The breakfast area is large and has a great variety of food. The hotel is across the canal from Venice butch they have frequent shuttles.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
