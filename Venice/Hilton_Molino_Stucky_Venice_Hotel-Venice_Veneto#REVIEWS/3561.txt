We stayed here for 3 nights as part of an Italian tour.  This hotel is across from the main tourist area of Venice, but offers a free shuttle to and from.  The pool has a beautiful view of the canal and was a relaxing place to spend our last afternoon.  The prices of drinks and food are a little crazy, but it is Venice!  We were disappointed that the Sky Bar had private parties the first two nights we were there so we couldn't check it out until the end of our trip.  Rooms were large, bed was heavenly.  Bathrooms are bigger than the hotel we stayed at in Rome!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
