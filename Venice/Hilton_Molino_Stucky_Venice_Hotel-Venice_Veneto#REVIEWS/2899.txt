The Hilton is a very large hotel but represents a nice reuse of an old industrial building and is located on Giudecca across from Venice proper, only a 5 minute ride by free shuttle. Rooms are large, clean, beds comfortable. Nice breakfast buffet. Nice restaurants within 5 minute walk along the water.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor, we are glad to hear that you liked the Hotel and our services!
