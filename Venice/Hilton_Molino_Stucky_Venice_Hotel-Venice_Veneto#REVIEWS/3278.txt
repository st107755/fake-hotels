It was our second time to the Molino Stucky and it was once more a stupendous time!  A beautiful executive suite with river view, great breakfast and very welcoming staff!  Our experience at the bar was once again very pleasant and relaxing and I recommend a dinner at the Bacaromi restaurant! The food is awsome! This time we had our baby so we didn't have the change to go to the roof top bar, but I fully recommend it, because the cocktails are realy tasty!  I have to mention Mr. Maximo, our shuttle driver. He was very attencious and very kind at all times. A great asset to our stay!  Once more thank you all for another great stay!Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 29, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review.
