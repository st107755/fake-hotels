We enjoyed staying at this very large hotel. We had managed to get a good deal one of the comparison websites. Our room was deluxe. It was spacious and had a lovely view of the gardens. The breakfast, which was included in our deal was brilliant. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The downsides were that you have to pay for wifi and you have to access in the hotel lobby. Snacks, meals and drinks were expensive. A highlight was the roof top pool and it's magnificent views.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
