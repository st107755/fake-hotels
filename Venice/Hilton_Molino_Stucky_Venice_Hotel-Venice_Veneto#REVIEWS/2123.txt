Private boat transfer to the hotel was a wonderful experience! We found this generally to be an excellent hotel in a wonderful location. The hotel has lots of character. It proved the right decision for us to stay out of the centre of Venice. The shuttle boat runs regularly, so San Marco is within easy reach.   Our first room on the first floor had an excellent view of the canal and was very spacious. Unfortunately, we had to move rooms to the fourth floor where the room was not as big and the view not quite as nice. This was a little disappointing. Nevertheless the two small bottles of Bellini were a nice touch as way of apologising.  The concierge (especially Carlo) was absolutely fantastic at booking restaurants for us and explained the timings and best way to get there. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 6, 2016Dear Guest, It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you enjoyed your stay in Venice and appreciated our hospitality.
