Spent 4 days in this beautiful hotel and absolutely loved it! There isn't really anything around the hotel but the hotel provides a water taxi service regularly to and from San Marco. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed eating at the hotel restaurant and the Nutella bar is delicious! Didn't get to enjoy the sky bar as it was too cold. Looking forward to visiting again in Spring. One thing I must say is please check your bill at the end as we got charged for things we didn't eat and drink.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you for your kind review.
