Nice hotel opposite main islands. Free 5-10 minute boat shuttle every half hour I San Marco or Zattere.  Staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms good size, clean & comfortable. Most rooms laid out in pairs, quiet unless you get next to a noisy Italian family. We did - but were instantly upgraded free upon request.  Exec room/lounge highly recommended. Paid for itself with free breakfast, nibbles, hot and soft drinks and wine in the evening. As well as lovely view over the water.  Recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2014Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
