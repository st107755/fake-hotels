Good hotel with a great view. The hotel boat was very convenient as it went every 40 minutes to two different stops until 12am.  The staff was exceptionally kind and helpful.  The executive lounge did not have a good view, but it seems that they saved the best views for actual rooms along that side of the hotel.    Wireless internet was very expensive in the room: 27 Eur for 24 hours.  In the exec lounge and in the business center it was .35 per minute.  Drinks in the Skyline bar were between 6 - 10 euro each, not too bad, I thought.  I think during busy times it could be hard to get a room with a good view, but still a good place.  I would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare
