The building is exceptional and we were looking forward to a wonderful two nights.  Somehow the hotel made a mess of the reservations and charged me 1,560 Euro for three nights which were cancelled.   Over a day and night and on check out they insisted I was wrong, I showed cancellation and they were dismissive and utterly unwilling to :MAKE IT RIGHT"  Shame on them to treate someone this way.. I returned today and got the smallest worst view room in the hotel possible which says to me never complain for they will punish you.  I will never stay here again and tell anyone who asks , go somewhere else.  As far as Hilton is concerned I have 7 reservations in the next two weeks in Palm Beach Gardens. Houston, Baytown and more but never again at this hotel with attitude.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for posting a review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
