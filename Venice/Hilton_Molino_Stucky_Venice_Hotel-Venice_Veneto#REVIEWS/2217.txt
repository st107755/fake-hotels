This hotel was amazing! The location was perfect because since it was on isle of Giudecca, it was so quiet at night. And they offered a complimentary shuttle to St. Mark's square area so often, it was never an inconvenience. We ate breakfast there every day, and it was delicious. The staff were all so nice. The roof-top bar overlooking Venice was amazing!! We will definitely stay there again if we visit Venice another time.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
