This was my third stay in Venice and best by a long way (and I have stayed at the Cipriani previously). Spent a long weekend with my family (wife and 4 children) and hotel was perfect. Great location - close enough to the main city sights (boat service was very good) but slightly set apart to give time to relax and recharge the batteries and enjoy the view of the Giudecca Canal. Roof top pool area is fantastic. Only slight aggravation of the weekend was that the check-in was not quite as slick as it might have been but everything else was faultless. Will almost certainly be back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
