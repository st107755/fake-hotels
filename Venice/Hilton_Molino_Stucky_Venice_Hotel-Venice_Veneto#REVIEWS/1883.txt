I stayed with my friends and their kids at the hotel for holiday for 4 nights. The hotel looks pretty modern, with spacious rooms and 2 restaurants with outdoor-seating. The food is quiet good but a bit overpriced (e.g. a freshly squeezed orange juice 9 €). The hotel has a rooftop pool with a stunning view over Venice, unfortunately they having far to less sun beds. They have 2 or 3 different breakfast rooms, the one where we were sitting looked a bit like in a hostel but service and food selection as well as the food quality was very good. Overall the service in the hotel from reception to the bar is outstanding.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
