Great Hotel on Giudecca. Staff are friendly and really helpful. Shuttle bus (boat) service over to Venice reliable and appreciated. (It's 'free but you pay just 6E per stay to kind of offset the cost). LOVED the Nuttella Piazza. And the sky bar is beautiful at night. The pool area is breath-taking and the view unbeliable but can be a little overcrowded in July/August. The Spa facilities are great and I had an amazing massage there. Will definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 21, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review and for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor.
