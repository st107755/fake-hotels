We are staying at the moment and I have to say my overall impression is one of disappointment. The lobby and general areas are fairly acceptable, however the rooms are extremely tired and dated.

The rooftop pool and bar area is very nice. What I also don't like about the location or this hotel is that you are reliant on waiting around for the water bus to take you to and from Venice. A real pain if you're tired and want to head back.   The executive lounge is a farce. We always pay for lounge access however this time haven't bothered as it's a joke.
