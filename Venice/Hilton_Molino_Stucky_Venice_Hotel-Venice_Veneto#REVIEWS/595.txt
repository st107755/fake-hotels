This hotel is the perfect hotel to visit Venice no matter how long your stay is. This hotel is not on the main island of Venice, which is a big part of its appeal. This location makes it closer to the airport and train station, while also keeping you out of the overwhelming tourist areas in Venice. The hotel offers a free shuttle service that runs all day approximately every 15 minutes to and from the main part of Venice. The executive lounge is great free upgrade for Hilton Honors members, however is not worth paying for. The rooftop pool and bar were both very nice, and offer the best views of Venice. The accommodations at the hotel were spacious and luxuriously appointed, including large marble bathrooms. All staff at the hotel was extremely friendly.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.

It was very kind of you to mention our friendly Team Members and we all are looking forward to welcoming you soon back again in Venice. With kind regards  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
