Stayed at the hotel the day before we were to board a cruise ship.  If you look on maps it says it's 0.5 miles from the port.  It is not but it's still a nice place.  Good shuttle service and excellent helpful people to get you a transport to the shuttle service.  Bed was a uncomfortable and too hard for me, I like a softer bed.  Other than that really about it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
