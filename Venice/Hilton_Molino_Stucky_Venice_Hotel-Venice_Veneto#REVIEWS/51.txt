Thank you so much for a wonderful stay at your superb hotel this week.   From the charming welcome from Chiara to the beautiful suite, everything was perfect.  The petals on the bed were a lovely touch.   We loved the executive lounge, breakfast and dinner and all of your team members.   The water taxi to and from the airport worked perfectly and what a way to do it!  In 40 years of being a Hilton guest, this was the best ever - we hope to return!Read moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 3, 2020Dear Sir, on behalf of the entire Team at Hilton Molino Stucky a big THANK YOU for your kind endorsement.
