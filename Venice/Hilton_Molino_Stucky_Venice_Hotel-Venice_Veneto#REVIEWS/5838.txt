This hotel thoroughly impressed me. It was once an old flour mill and the Hilton has transformed it into a luxury hotel while still keeping all its historic charm.  We booked just a standard room which was far above standard. The hotel staff were friendly and they even had a free and regular shuttle boat that took guests to the mainland and picked them up again.   Even though the hotel is not on the main island of Venice, it did not prove to be a hassle at all and in fact proved to be far more relaxing being away from the crowds.   I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!Read moreDate of stay: January 2009HelpfulShare
