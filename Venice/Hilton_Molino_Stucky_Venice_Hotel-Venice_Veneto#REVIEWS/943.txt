Be prepared to need extra time to get anywhere else in Venice. It is an easy six minute walk to the vaporetto but study the schedule so you don't spend too much time waiting. We purchased tourist vaporetto passes and used them all over town, but you could also pay a one time fee for unlimited use of the Hilton shuttle boat if you only want to go to San Marco.  Our room was enormous, had a great view, and was super quiet - the benefit of staying here away from the busy overcrowded main parts of town. The breakfast buffet was huge with many choices. The sky bar (the only rooftop bar in Venice!) was lovely and probably even better in warm weather when the outdoor area is open.
