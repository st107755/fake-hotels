My husband and I were upgraded to a suite, a lovely nice big room, as we are Hilton Gold Member’s.   Among the valuable Gold perks, was the buffet breakfasts, free of charge.  Located away from the main area of San Marco square, the hotel provides ferry transport to and from for 6€ per person for the entire stay.   I would recommend this hotel to anyone.   While it is away from the “action”, the ferry transport makes it easily accessible.
