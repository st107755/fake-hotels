Stayed for 2 nights just after New Years. Beautiful hotel, has a lot of history to it as well which was nice to see some of the plaques for walking through.  The only faults I can say is that the ferries break at lunch and dinner time is highly inconvenient as it always seems to be when you need them! A water taxi at 60EUR to go anywhere is highway robbery. 20EUR a day for wifi is also a bit ridiculous  Rooms are nice and comfy with some excellent views of Venezia (being as the hotel is not on the main island) Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
