Took all our children and spouses on a trip of Italy. All had rooms on the executive floor. Executive lounge was very nice. Hotel could have taken better advantage of the views that could have been offered there. Bar and views on top floor breath taking. Enjoyed being on Guidecca Island away from San Marco Square. Had the chance to see how real people lived in Venice. Not so touristy.  Try to get a room overlooking the Guidecca Canal. Free shuttle to the heart of Venice, prompt and enjoyable. Would go back tomorrow.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
