Excellent service, breakfast was very good. Rooms bigger than we expected and executive lounge also very good. I like the fact the hotel is situated across from the main hustle and bustle of St Marks square as after a day of sightseeing and lots of walking you can then catch the 'Hilton' boat back to the hotel to unwind, relax and then have a drink in their skybar which has some breathtaking views over the Venice. The 'Hilton' boat is 8.5euros per person and covers as many journeys throughout your stay. I would want to stay here again if I came back to VeniceRead moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor, we are really happy to know that you have enjoyed your stay with us and that you loved the location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
