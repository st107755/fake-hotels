Beautiful building. Hotel location is nice and quiet.  The hotel shuttle makes it very easy to get across to Venice. Totally worth the small added cost to the room. Ate dinner one night at the hotel restaurant baca romi, and it definitely was one of the best meals of our stay. Recommend the stewed cod fish on polenta.
