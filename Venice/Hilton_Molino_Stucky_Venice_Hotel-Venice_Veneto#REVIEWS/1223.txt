This is a great hotel.  I enjoyed the experience.  The hotel staff was wonderful.  I stayed at the Bauer for the initial part of trip and moved to this hotel.  Bauer was nice, but not as this hotel.  The hotel boat was helpful and always on time and drops you right where you need to be.  Then you walk as you are required to do in Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
