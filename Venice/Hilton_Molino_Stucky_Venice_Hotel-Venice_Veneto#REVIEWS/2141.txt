Located on an island away from the "main" part of Venice, this hotel is located in a very impressive old building. The room was nice, as per your standard Hilton, with an expensive mini-bar. I found the service so-so: a lot of staff standing around or talking, while one or two tried to handle the guests, with the check-in/check-out counter being the best example.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 30, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
