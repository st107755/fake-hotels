The Hilton in Venice is a bit out of the way beimg in Giudecca, but the hotel offsets this by offering shuttle service to and from San Marco.  The rooms are very comfortable, and the hotel is very clean.  There is a rooftop pool, and a rooftop bar.  You should try the bar at least once because the views across Giudecca Channel are amazing.  We had an executive room which gave us access to a continental breakfast and drink and snacks through the day and evening.Read moreDate of stay: August 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for your positive comment about the Hilton Molino Stucky!
