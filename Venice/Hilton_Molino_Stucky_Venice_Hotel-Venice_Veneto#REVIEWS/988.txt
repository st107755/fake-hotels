We stayed one night on this property last week on points. As a diamond member we were upgraded to a suite with Grand Canal view....and it was amazing. The location of the hotel is a little tricky especially if you are traveling with luggage from Piazzale Roma or the train station. We took the wrong vaporetto and wasted some time getting to the hotel. The staff were very accommodating and the property is very clean, room was nice. Breakfast buffet was typical Hilton as it had everything from fresh fruits, juices, pastries and all the essentials. The executive lounge is a little small but it comes with a cool view of Venice. Overall, we loved the property and would stay there again.  There are some restaurants near the hotel but we chose to eat near Rialto Bridge and St. Mark'sâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive review about the hotel.
