We stayed at Hilton for 3 nights. Took water bus which was 15 euros each and drops you right outside the hotel. Check in was easy and quick. Our room was very nice. And thanks to reservations for putting a nice card and drinks in my room. That's very impressive. Service at the Rialto bar is brilliant. They do table service which makes you feel special. Staff if polite and professional. We wanted to see roof top pool but it opens from may so we missed it. May be next time when we will stay again. They gave us complimentary tour to murano glass factory. Venice is Very beautiful city. On 25th they gave us rose during the breakfast because there was something to do wth st.mark. Another good touch. Breakfast in a bit limited than other hiltons but theres enough options to eat.
