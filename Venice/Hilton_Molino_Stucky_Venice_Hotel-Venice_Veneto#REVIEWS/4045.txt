My husband and I used Hilton reward points to book a night here in early November.  We would've stayed 2 nights at this historical and recently renovated hotel, but they were completely booked the 2nd night due to a convention.  From the moment we checked in until we departed, we had a superb experience.   The hotel's vaporetto shuttle takes you to Piazza S. Marco with a regular and convenient schedule.  I would most definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
