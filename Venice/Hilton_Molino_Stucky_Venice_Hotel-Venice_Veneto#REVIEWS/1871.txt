Don't let being in Guidecca put you off, this hotels service is second to none. Helpful staff at reception and the con serge. The shuttle is frequent and easy to get, but be warned to get to the return shuttle early as they fill up quickly for a return trip. The rooms clean, spacious with comfy beds and pillows. Beautiful bathroom. Great selection of food at breakfast and good coffee too. It was nice to see helpful happy staff at breakfast and the restaurants. Great dining too although a bit on the pricey side. Great pool for cooling down after a day of sightseeing. Be warned that the pool fills up and is a bit crowded during summer, but still a nice place to cool down with a drink. There are a great selection of places to eat nearby too.
