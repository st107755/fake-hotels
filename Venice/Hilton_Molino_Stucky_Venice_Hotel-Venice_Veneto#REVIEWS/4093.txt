I hesitated to stay here because of some of the reviews, because of the location, etc.  Nonetheless, because I am married to Hilton as a brand, I chose to book at this hotel and was very pleased I had done so.  The location is superb - the view is priceless.  The complimentary shuttle runs frequently across the canal or to San Marco.  The staff are, for the most part, very friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious, grand, and well appointed. My only complaint is the Executive Lounge (off the restaurant and bar and visible to all) makes one feel a bit caged in and all around offers a bad impression to guests that do not have access and feels odd "on the inside".   Nonetheless, the hotel gets high marks and I suggest you stay here!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 10, 2013Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us.
