A large hotel but with intimate service and comfortable rooms that makes it truly 5-star, yet probably without Venetian 5-star prices of some properties. It is located in Giudecca off mainland but with convenience of a waterbus stop in 5 minutes, and another waterbus to airport and Cruise Terminal right at hotel's door. Great for pre-cruisers. Very well managed property in the international style.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 16, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review.   We are pleased to see that you enjoyed your stay here and were satisfied with the service and location.

We thank you and look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
