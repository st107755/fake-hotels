We stayed here for our honeymoon! We had a great time!  The shuttle boat to take you across the canal works great!  You get a great view of Venice from the roof top pool.  A very lovely hotel.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for a fancy stay in Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
