We found the hotel and it's staff excellent especially 2 of the bar and restaurant staff in particular, Vito and Enrico, both really made our stay very special! It was my girlfriends 30th and I had also proposed whilst we were there, these guys went out of there way to make her feel very special and I cannot thank them enough! Enrico makes a mean 'Old fashion' not a cocktail on the menu but one of my personal faves! He also upgraded us so that we could enjoy the executive lounge! Legend! Vito brought out a tiramisu with a candle in it after we had finished our meal singing happy birthday, something we had not requested and were not charged for! Food was delicious setting was beautiful couldn't have asked for a better trip!
