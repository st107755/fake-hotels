This hotel has to be one of their best!  Upscale decor.  Not only are the people  at desk are multi lingual, they seem to enjoy helping you. Rooms are well maintained and immaculate. If you are going on a cruise the location is great!  Take the Alilaguna Vaparetto from the airport and get dropped off right in front of the hotel.  The hotel probides a shuttle bus to take you to San MarK Square for tourist sights and shopping. Tomorrow we will again take the Alilaguna bus and be dropped off at the cruise terminal,  No steps or bridges except at the end.  This benefit is very important in Venice.  The hotel is not cheap, but the convenience far outweighs the cost!  Only downside is cost of Internet.  18â‚¬ for 24 hours seems a bit steep.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
