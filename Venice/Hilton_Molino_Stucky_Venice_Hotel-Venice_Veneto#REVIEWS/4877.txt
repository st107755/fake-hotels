The Stucky is a converted flour/pasta mill and located on the other side of the Grand Canal to the heart of Venice.  Don’t let this put you off though, the hotel provides a free shuttle across the water to either St Mark’s Square or the Vapereto station opposite.  It is in a really quiet area away from the bustle of Venice and yet really on the doorstep.  The roof-top pool is something special with fantastic views over Venice.  The rooms and breakfast are as you would expect from a hotel of this standard – first class.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
