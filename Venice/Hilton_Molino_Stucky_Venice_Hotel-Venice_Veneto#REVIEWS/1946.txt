Hotel and room fantastic. Breakfast worth having. Pool area zero stars small and not enough seats very poor. Do plan to use unless you are out of season  Food in restaurants looks very good however over priced. Suggest going to Zattere station. Fab food and very local. Great prices. Sorry Hilton still liked your hotel though   Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.  We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and you mentioned some positive impressions during your stay. In regard to your comments on the size of the pool on the rooftop terrace, I would like to confirm that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which has certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal, including our rooftop pool area.  We place great value on your opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
