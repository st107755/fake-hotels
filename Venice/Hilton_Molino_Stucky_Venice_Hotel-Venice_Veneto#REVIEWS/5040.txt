This hotel was perfect.  After a day of sight seeing returning (on the free shuttle) to the hotel for a rooftop swim was amazing.  It was a modern Italian chic hotel with cool interior.  Clean fresh new!  Rooftop bar was another great "get away from the crowds" place to enjoy.  Gym small and limited surprisingly for such a large hotel but easily overlooked for the rest of the amenities.  They also gave us free transportation to Murano.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
