The Hilton in Venice is good choice, for it is across the canal from the main part of Venice, and in a quiet location.  The free water shuttle provided by the hotel is excellent, and walking around the main section of Venice is easy.  The rooms were large by European standards and quite comfortable.  I would say the staff could be a little more friendly and helpful.  The service in the small restaurant in the lobby area is very slow, and the food is very expensive.  Our granchildren were looking forward to using the rooftop pool, but it does not open until May 1 (their web-site should tell you this.)  Overall, though, a good choice for Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
