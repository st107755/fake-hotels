The hotel is located in the Giudecca, and not in the main island of Venice. The rooms are very good and have big space. It would be difficult to have all this space near Piazza San Marco. BUT the hotel should provide enough boats to make the transportation of the clients. Imagine that you have to wait 40 minuts after dinner because the last boat couldnt carry all the guests that were in the line in the last 10minutes... We complained to the captain, to the manager, but all of them said they could do nothing about it. So, I can only conclusa it is not worth the value.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
