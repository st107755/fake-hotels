This hotel is located on an island quite a ways from San Marco Square.  However they do have an hourly shuttle boat that drops you very close.  The rooms are very nice and the breakfast is wonderful.  A wide array of choices in a lovely room.  The staff is excellent and attentive to your needs.  The one downside is that the connecting doors in the rooms are very thin and the conversations, or whatever, comes through quite clearly.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 6, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website.
