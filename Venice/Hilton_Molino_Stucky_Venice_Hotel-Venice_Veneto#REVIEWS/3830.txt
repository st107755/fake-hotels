When we arrived at the Hilton Stucky I was so impressed......so clean and spotless and reception so welcoming......my husband was slightly disappointed in our room as we looked out onto another building ...he had requested a nice room for our anniversary! However the bathroom was lovely and the bed so comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic ....and we both stay at hotels regularly. The only down side is that to get over to the main part of Venice....St Marks Square etc you have to get a comp water taxi....this was not a problem in April however in the height of the summer it would be as the taxis only carry 39 passengers....... Although some guests might enjoy being away from the crowds! Overall we had a great stay and loved Venice!! thank youRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 19, 2014Dea Madame  thank you very much for your positive review on Tripadvisor.  We are delighted that you had a good time and enjoyed your anniversary at our property. We are also pleased that your enjoyed the accommodation and the comfort of the room as well as  the efficiency of our complimentary shuttle service.  On the other hand am sorry if you were disappointed with the view from your room which was not the one expected. Complimentary upgrades to rooms with Venice view are not always possible during high season and high occupancy. May I take this opportunity to inform you that  that our hotel has various and different levels of rooms, from standard to deluxe and executive rooms and suites with and without view.   Whatever the occasion may be, I hope to welcome you back in the not too distant future. Best regards,  Alessandro M. Cabella General ManagerRead more
