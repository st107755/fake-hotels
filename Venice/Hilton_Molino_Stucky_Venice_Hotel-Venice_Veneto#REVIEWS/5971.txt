We already knew that hotel is recently opened and we expected some problems.  Generaly hotel looks nice and have wonderful rooftop bar and pool. Because of quite remote location shuttle service is convieniente and noise is limited. Buffet breakfast was plentiful as well with wide offer of fresh fruit. But here good things stop. Rooms did lack simple things like glases or sink towels. One of our group had first problem with leaking water, then all night drilling and was refused acceptable room - had to change to another hotel. Internet charge is exorbitant: 25 euros per 24 h. Last surprise was on Sunday when we left for airport - it was close to impossible to order taxi, some people waited 1,5 h. We had to overpay 3 times to get in time!
