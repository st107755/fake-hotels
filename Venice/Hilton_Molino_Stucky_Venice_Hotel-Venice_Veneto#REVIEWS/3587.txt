rooms were nice, dont open the windows at night though, as there is no screen and a lot of mosquitoes...  nice and quiet at night at this location.  We stayed here thinking they had a nice view of venice on the rooftop pool, but the doors to the pool were locked during our stay and we couldnt enjoy the view.  being located on giudecca was kinda annoying too, as you required a shuttle to get from the hotel to the main venice island.  The shuttle is very infrequent, and takes lunch breaks as well, so its possible you might get stuck in the hotel waiting around for it to come back...  I've stayed at the Pennisula in Bangkok, and whenever I needed to cross the river there, they just called the boat to come pick us up... i guess labour is cheaper there i suppose...Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
