This is one of the nicest Hilton properties I've been to.  The staff are incredible. The food is good and the amenities are great.  They have though if everything such as a boat into San Marco square that leave directly from the hotel even thought public services are available 5 min walk away.    If you have access to the lounge you won't be disappointed either, we'll stocked throughout the day and with a happy hour in the evening.   I'm already looking forward to returning.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 20, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
