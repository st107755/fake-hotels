The location of this hotel on the calm island of Guidecca, but only a stone's throw via the hotel's free boat service to the hustle and bustle of St Mark's Square, made our trip really special.

I can't wait to go again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments.
