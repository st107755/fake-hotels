We stayed at the Molino Stucky for 5 nights. Its a lagoon hotel on a tiny island just across from the main island of Venice. The hotel has a small boat which regularly takes you back and forth ('public' boats also make a stop on the island incl at the hotel). The hotel is huge and as a result its not a romantic or atmospheric Italian hotel however the staff are great, there's a lovely (busy) rooftop pool and bar and as its recently been converted into a hotel (it was a factory) its modern. One thing to note is that a lot of large groups stay here including cruise ship groups (mostly American). Breakfast is nice but not amazing.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2013Dear Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
