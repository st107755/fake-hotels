Though this hotel was wonderful, my only negative comment is that you had to take a water taxi which the hotel provides for free which only runs every 30-40 mins and ends at 10pm. Hotel not for someone who wants to be in and out throughout the day. A huge plus is their bathrooms. I never thought I was a bathroom person until I saw theirs.
