I had a great trip here, Great hotel and location. Brilliant connections to the airport and to the mainland. Lobby areas, restaurant etc. still looked fresh but the bedrooms where becoming to look a little tiered.  It was flooding while I was there and the dreadful siren that went off one morning was rather distressing as had no idea what it was! To add to that there were lots of noises from the water such as that siren and horns from cruise liners docking. Overall great location and would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 2, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
