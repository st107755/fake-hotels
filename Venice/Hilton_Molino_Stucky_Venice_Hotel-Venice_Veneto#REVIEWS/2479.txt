This was my second stay at the Hilton Molino in Venice and I will continue to return. I enjoy that it is on Guidecca and not the main two islands, as it is very peaceful and a relief from the massive tourist crowds. The hotel shuttle runs frequently and is very convenient. There is also a public water taxi stop near by as well that we used to get around. Both times we had a suite with a view of the canal and it was just magical! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The first visit was slightly better than the last. The first time we had gifts in our room on checkin, not sure why but it was nice. This time our room didn't have a tea kettle, not a big deal but minor inconvenience. Can't wait for our next stay!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Direttore generale at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 7, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
