Absolute pleasure to stay there. Arrived by private taxi and service upon arrival was quick and courteous. Room was decor was great but very little storage space. Staff helpful whenever we needed advice. Only moan is the price of food and drink. However, it is the same in all hotels but why should it be? Shuttle service was really useful. Would we stay there again, definitely yes!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
