I absolutely love this hotel not because of the luxury it offers but because of the history that you encounter as soon as you step out of the shuttle boat. The hotel had been a flourmill mill a few decades ago and you can still see the beams inside and many other original features. The building is an art masterpiece itself and looks stunning from outside. The atmosphere is very romantic and gives a cosy "home" feel. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are clean. The view from our window was stunning, the room was facing Giudecca canal and it was wonderful watching big cruise ships passing by early in the morning. The breakfast was a typical Hilton breakfast, great variety, good quality, helpfull staff. Definitely worth visiting, especially if you like being spoiled:-)Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
