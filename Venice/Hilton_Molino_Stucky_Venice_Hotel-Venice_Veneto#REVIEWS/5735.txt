My husband and I stayed one night at the Hilton prior to departing on a Med. cruise.  We shared a water taxi to the Hilton which saved us paying 115 euro (paid 54 instead).  The hotel is lovely and the rooms while small are very nice.  We had a great view.  The bed was very comfortable and we went upstairs to the rooftop pool and sat out for a while in the early evening.  The cruise ships came so close it seemed you could touch them and the view was lovely.  We didn't find it crowded at all.  Check in was a snap and they had our room ready at about 11:30.  The complimentary shuttle was great -- there was always room and it was like clockwork (always on time).  There was a great pizza place close to the hotel so we ate outside and enjoyed dinner before walking back to the hotel. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
