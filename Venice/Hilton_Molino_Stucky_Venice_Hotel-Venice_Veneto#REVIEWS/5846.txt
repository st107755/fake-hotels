Great deal via priceline.com for the hotel.  Hotel room was small for family of 4 with 2 young children.  Service was excellent.  Location was ok, it was not the most convenient to take the ferry to the main locations, but ferry was very regular and always on time.  If we were without children, the ferry would not have been a problem.Read moreDate of stay: April 2008HelpfulShare
