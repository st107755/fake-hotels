 Having looked at the reviews after my husband said we were booked into this hotel I was a little unsure about our forthcoming stay. Just goes to show that sometimes you need to keep an open mind. I cannot tell you how helpful, polite, friendly and nice the staff were. In particular the young lady who was on the concierge desk on the evening I spilt red wine over my white jeans. Really enjoyed the executive lounge. Fabulous views. Pool wonderful, especially as it was at the right temperature. Thanks for a great stay.
