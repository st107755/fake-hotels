We stayed two night as part of a post ocean cruise. The hotel is gorgeous but not convenient for visiting Venice. We found the water taxi service too time consuming when you have a short period of time to visit Venice  The concierge, Carlos, however was exceptional. He arranged an English speaking guide and water taxi for us to visit Burano, Murano and Torcello, got us wonderful dinner reservations and water taxi to the airport. He is a true asset to the hotel. We were disappointed the wifi was not free. The only hotel out of six European hotels that we visited that did not offer free wifi. Breakfast was very nice. Bathrobes and slippers should have been included for the price we paid.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 4, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
