Room was really quiet which is exactly what we wanted. Shame no complimentary mineral water , unusual for Hilton & 5 star hotels, did have tea/coffee making though. Free shuttle is great, works perfectly to get to main island. Staff at Hilton excellent, very accommodating. Skyline bar great feature. Would definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Molino Stucky Hilton Venice.
