Located on the island of Giudecca, this Hilton is madly overpriced. Thought I had booked a room with a city view and through a booking error, found ourselves in an 'executive' room for an extra 90e a night. For that we got breakfast-underwhelming--and access to a very bizarre 'glassed-in-like-zoo-animals' executive area off the main bar area/sitting room for a glass of wine and some olives at happy hour. Pretty expensive olives...  Our 'executive room' had an oblique lagoon view, not toward the city. It featured a stained rug upon entering, no bedside reading lamps, and a shower it was impossible not to flood the floor with. We were welcomed later in the evening with 2 bottled & warm Bellinis with no ice. Beds were very comfortable and the front desk staff as nice as can be. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
