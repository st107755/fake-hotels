Great location I believe even a better location than on the main island of Venice. The staff was excellent and after letting them know we were on our honeymoon they upgraded our hotel for free to a hotel with a view! I could be happier with this hotel. Both my wife and I really enjoyed this hotel and although we would probably never stay that long in Venice again if we were to visit Venice there is no other hotel we would stay at, but this one! Free shuttle service to the main island is great too!Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having spent this special event with us.
