In the first place please accept our apologies if a member of our staff was not up to the level of care and attention expected at a Hilton property as this should never happen. All Guests should receive the high level of service and respect for which Hilton hotels are renowned and we will for sure investigate the matter.  With regards to your comment on the room we confirm that the Deluxe room which you had booked was for two adults and upon check-in you informed us that you your 2 children were with you as well. Unfortunately our Deluxe rooms can accommodate no more than 3 people and therefore it is correct that the front office agent asked you to change the reservation to a Family suite. We are sorry that you feel this way and we hope that you will give us another chance to serve you in the future.  With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
