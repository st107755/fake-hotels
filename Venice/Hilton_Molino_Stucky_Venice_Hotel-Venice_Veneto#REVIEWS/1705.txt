We stayed here previously, and had such a good time that we chose to stay here again this time too.  The hotel is in a magnificent old building, looks like a cathedral!  Lovely hotel, modern and classy, with a roof top bar and pool, and another bar and restaurants on the ground floor.  Great never ending breakfast.  Located on Giudecca, the hotel runs an regular shuttle boat service across to St Marks Square, every 20 minutes, its a great way to experience Venice from the water.    Great place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
