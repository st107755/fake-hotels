An extraordinary fine hotel altogether:  - Service in the breakfast room was stunning  - The breakfast itself offered a great varity of treats, fresh, nicely presented & spacious (no cueing!) - The architecture inside this old mill simple and most appealing - Room nicely decorated and very italian - Location accessable by boat only (but not much of an issue). Hotel offers regular shuttles, easily connecting with the public boat to/from the airport (15 € one way/ 27€ return) - Free internet in the lobby - Promotional room rates offer good value for money - Restaurants in the neighborhood: Much cheaper than THE Tourist Centre. And Restaurants next stop from the hotel the same.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
