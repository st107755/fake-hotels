We have been to many Hilton properties across the world. This one is particularly impressive. The building (previously a mill) is stunning and unique, across the water from the centre of the city. The hotel provides a shuttle boat to the city at regular intervals and offers a peaceful retreat from all the noisiness of the city. The staff are great, the room is clean, the bed is comfortable, and the breakfasts are good with a plenty of choices. The only drawback we found was in the executive lounge, which sometimes was overly busy and with a limited amount of snack and food items. But overall, it was a great experience and we certainly would return.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
