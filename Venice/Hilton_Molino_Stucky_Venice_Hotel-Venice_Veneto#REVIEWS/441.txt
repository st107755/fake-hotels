A second honeymoon that turned into just a fabulous trip.  Breakfast buffet was super, check in was easy and we had an awesome view in our suite.  Granted we had ultimate status with Hilton Diamond but recommend joining club when traveling this chain.  Hotel puts new retro style on historic building. Very classy and away from main island  Note you will be on water taxi to and from this hotel.  We did walk around a bunch but the hotel is on an island.  We think it added to privacy and ambiance if hotel  The cost of hotel is not cheap however affordable and a top notch service group.  Very easy to San Marco's square and shopping.  Will be back.  Very nice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 17, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
