Great property, large rooms and great service. It is a large hotel. It provides an executive lounge and a boat shuttle to the old city and stores. Shops on the island itself for wine, etc. and a nice walkway around the island. I would highly recommend.

We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you appreciated our service and hospitality. It is nice to read that you liked the location on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, only a 12 minutes boat ride from the main crowded city centre which is especially treasured by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It is very kind of you to highly recommend us to other travellers and we look forward to welcoming you soon again in Venice.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
