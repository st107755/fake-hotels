This is one of the hotels you stay in and you remember. It is located on an island opposite old town Venice and has a very good private shutle boat connection to two central points. Unfortunately it has no direct boat going to the central car park, so plan 30-45 minutes. Hotel is quite big and the lobby is quite croweded, but staff is very friendly.  A hightlight is the roof top pool - offering a view over the canal and the old city. Truely amazing! Pretty crowded on a sunny day though and the pool could be double or tripple the size to allow a proper swim, but it is perfect for refreshing before or after visiting the city. Also to remember is the buffet breafast: great choice and really delicious breakfast, including sparking wine to kick off a lovely day.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
