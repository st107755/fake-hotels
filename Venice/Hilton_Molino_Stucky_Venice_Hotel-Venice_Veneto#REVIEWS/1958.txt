We had a free night here provided by our cruise line.  The hotel is exquisite, but has a hard time providing ice.  My husband was sent on a wild goose chase to an ice machine on the 5th floor that didn't exist - the ice machine that is...there was actually two parts to the 5th floor..  On a second call to the desk, they had a bucket  of ice delivered.  The restaurant was hard to find, but the food was excellent.   The hotel is huge and not easy to navigate, but we had a very romantic dinner canal-side and it made it all worthwhile.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 5, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
