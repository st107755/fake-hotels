Making our 11th stay at this Hotel since 2008, we were treated superbly by the staff whose attention to detail is unquestionable. Nothing is too much trouble, and to reward our loyalty we were offered an Executive suite for our 3-night stay. Great to see some of the staff we met 18 months and even 4 years ago, and their welcome on recognising us was warm and sincere. Food as ever was excellent, albeit on the pricey side, but sharing is accepted and the portions are more than adequate! Just love the whole atmosphere of the place, not had a bad room yet, and the history in which this old mill is steeped, for us makes it such a unique experience. Tried once, this hotel will never be forgotten, and always for the right reasons!Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 29, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your loyalty and for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky again for your 11th Venetian experience.
