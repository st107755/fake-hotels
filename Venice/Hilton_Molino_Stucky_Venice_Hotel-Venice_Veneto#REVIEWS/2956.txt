Nothing very good and a number of problems. 1. Our room had about 10 ants crawling on the bathroom floor, after complaining was initially asked "but what is the problem?". Insisted on moving to another room. 2. Booked restaurant at 1 for lunch, on arriving at exactly 1 no table was reserved and had to wait 10min for a table, was given some free drinks as recompense. 3. Our first breakfast was slow to arrive, and when it did the French toast was nothing more than fried cheap sliced bread, 2nd day's breakfast (omelette) was better. Overall poor for a 5* Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 16, 2015Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
