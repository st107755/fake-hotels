Stayed on a travelzoo deal with a free upgrade to a room overlooking Venice. Our  three night visit was delightful. Nothing was too much trouble for staff and they recommended family run restaurants on Giudecca. Would highly recommend and as for the breakfast - excellent.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
