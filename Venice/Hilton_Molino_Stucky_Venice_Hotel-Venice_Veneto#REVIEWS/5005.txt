We have just returned from this fantastic hotel! The building both outside and inside is absoulutly stunning! Staff were extremly friendly and helpful! The sky bar and restaraunt is amazing but very expensive! Our room was one of the standard ones and it was lovely we had canal views, it was very clean and included everything you need including toiletries, tea & coffee, hairdryer, bath robes and slippers and th large TV even had english channels (BBC & ITV!). The breakfast is amazing, lots of choice, really fresh, constantly replenished so even if you go down at 10.30 there is lots of food left!

It was nice to read that you liked the location as well as the service levels and facilities. I do regret you did not find the pool area up to your expectations. However, may I take this opportunity to remind that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient building and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which have certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal. Nevertheless, we are proud to be the only hotel offering in Venice a rooftop pool with a breathtaking view over the city and its lagoon. Thank you for staying with us at the Molino Stucky Hilton. Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
