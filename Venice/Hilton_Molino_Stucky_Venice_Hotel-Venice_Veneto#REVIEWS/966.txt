Hilton Molino Stucky is special in so many ways I might as well list them- 1. Shuttle to St Mark’s- imagine staying in a great hotel in NYC and having your shared limo to Times Sq every half hour. Look out for the charger under the seat. Came in handy when I was coming back on the last shuttle. Can’t get any better than that  2. Spacious rooms with great decor- loved the wooden ceilings and chandeliers 3.  Roof top restaurant and Pool- pool is closed after Sep but the views from here are stunning 4.  Probably one of the largest hotels in the City but check in and out was a breeze and room service was spot on 5. Breakfast was amazing! 6.  Staff is always smiling and very helpful.
