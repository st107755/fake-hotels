Staying at the Milino Stucky was one of the highlights of our trip. This Hotel has been lovingly rebuilt and provides a luxurious place to stay. The shuttle service to St Marks Square worked well and made this the perfect location to experience Venice.  The roof top pool has a wonderful view and is well worth seeing.
