Lots of character in this old mill turned hotel.  My suite had charm with wonderful old wood ceiling beams, cute arched windows and a big bathroom.  My view was stunning to look across to Venice.  The breakfast buffet has a large variety of healthy choices and heartier choices.  The scrambled eggs are way too runny for my liking so I figured out you can order an omelette.  The free shuttle from the Hilton to San Marco Square is easy and runs late so you can enjoy the city at night.  Lots of great meeting space when on business.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 22, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website. I would like to thank you for your positive comments on our famous Hilton breakfast and for your kind comments with regards to your room. The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. We are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
