We reached Venice late in the evening and took a private water taxi to the hotel. It was such a delight to see this gorgeous and HUGE property! Absolutely stunning view! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was lovely but did not have a great outside view as we were expecting. The staff though extremely helpful did not speak English too well and it was a slight challenge trying to explain to them. The breakfast buffet was lavish and the best spread I have seen so far!  On the whole the property is great but it was a pain traveling around via water bus/ taxi.  Room - Clean but not a great outside view Staff - courteous and helpful Accessibility - Decent with a regular shuttle to the shopping areaRead moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 13, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
