A wonderful hotel with wonderful views of Venice.  Good rooms and very well furnished and very good breakfast.  Lovely pool area and Skyline Bar overlooking Venice at night is a must.  Free water transport every 20/30 mins to St Marks Square until 1am.  A quieter location to stay with all the atmosphere of Venice to be enjoyed.  Take water taxi from airport to the hotel direct - worth the extra.  Hotel organised a private water taxi tour which was cheaper than organising via the internet.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
