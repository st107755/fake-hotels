Last time I visited Venize there was no Hilton there. Now there is and what a place! The Molino Stucky is by no means a cheap hotel and even with a HHonors upgrade to an executive room we did feel a little cramped. So although the hotel is fascinating and given that Venize is an expensive city, I cant help concluding that this hotel is overprized. The staff is extremely helpful and the view from the rooftop pool is spectacular. The hotel is located on the island of Giudecca which was fine for us, but others might be annoyed by the dependency of the (free) shuttle service to and from Venize.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
