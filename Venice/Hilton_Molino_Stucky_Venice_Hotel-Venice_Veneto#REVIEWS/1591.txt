Beautiful hotel, an old mill restructured with care and taste.  The interior design very much in keeping with Venice, the rooms extremely clean, great lighting, beautiful marble bathroom, closets with enough and varied hangers, a bureau, safe,  very comfortable beds, and the staff was enormously courteous and caring.  I did not try the spa or gym but sure they are on the optimum level along with everything else.  The breakfast buffet would suit every taste... I could not recommend this hotel more.  In addition, it is located in a quiet place but very well served by frequent boats to everywhere.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
