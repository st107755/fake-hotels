My family loved this place. I was across the water but hilton provides a boat every 30 min or so, as an executive member, the breakfast was wonderful with fresh blood orange juice and it was quiet when it needed to be. Only comment is food and drinks served in executive lounge need to be served longer than 2 hours. This was very disappointing.
