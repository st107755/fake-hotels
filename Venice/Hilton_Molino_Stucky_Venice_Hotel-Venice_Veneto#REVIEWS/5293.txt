What a great staff!  The hotel was lovely.  It's location is not in the main area but between the hotel boat and public transport it was easy to get where you wanted to go & it was quiet/relaxing.  I look forward to going back when it is a little warmer and the pool is open.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Molino Stucky Hilton Venice.
