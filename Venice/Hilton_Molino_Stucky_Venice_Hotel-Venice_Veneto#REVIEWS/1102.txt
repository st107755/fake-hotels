Stayed here while on a Disney Adventure Tour.  one of our 3    5 star hotels we stayed at.  our rooms all had a view of the canal. beautiful. we love the skytop lounge and pool area although the pool doesn't have really enough seating for the size of the hotel. Beautiful sunsets.  Drinks are about 17Euros.  Their breakfast was the best we had all trip lots to choose from the rooms were nice. our carpet could have used an update room 404 the shuttle was great to have and they have a tour and trip kiosk by the lobby.  you can pay for your trip to another island or to airport great time thereRead moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us. We acknowledge and appreciate your comments on the famous Hiltonâ€™s breakfast and on your accommodation with canal view. In regard to your comments on the size of the pool area, may I say that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient building and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which has certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal, including our rooftop pool area. We thank you for being our Guest and we look forward to welcoming you soon again in Venice. With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
