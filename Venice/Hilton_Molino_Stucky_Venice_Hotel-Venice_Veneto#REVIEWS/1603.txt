Just off the main island of Venice is this unique hotel.  If you're looking for public transportation, the water bus is just a 5 minute walk; however, the hotel offers a free shuttle to St Marco Square. Rooms are very clean - they seem larger than most European hotel rooms. The breakfast buffet is amazing, and there are many restaurants onsite.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
