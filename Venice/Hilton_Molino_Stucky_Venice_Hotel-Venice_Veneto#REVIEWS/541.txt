Great hotel, Carlo the concierge is probably the best we have ever encountered in our travels.  Shuttle to St.Marco timely and efficient , the executive lounge, sensational.  AC IN ROOM, just OK.  Bathrooms modest, rather small but neat and clean.  Overall, very good value.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 26, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay with us.
