Simply put, this hotel is excellent. In all aspects. The facilities are wonderful, the hotel staff and management are professional, helpful and courteous, and the location is perfect for planning and seeing other parts of Venice. It is also just a short water taxi ride from the airport so that you don't have to carry/roll all of your luggage through the streets. Based on our experience there, we would definitely stay at the Hilton again and recommend it to all of our friends and family. .Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
