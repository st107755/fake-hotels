Nice sized rooms, tub showers are a bit small but standard for Europe.  I understand the building to be a previous manufacturing building that was renovated.  This makes for a very interesting and beautiful look.  Courteous staff.  Quiet rooms.  Beautiful views.  The pool area needs to have more seating and lounge chairs. The hotel runs a shuttle across the canal to Dosuduro and San Marco.  It would recommend to the hotel to run additional shuttles in the wee hours of the night, maybe just once an hour, otherwise it costs 80 euro to get across the canal with a water taxi (expensive!).Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 20, 2015Dea Madame, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. We are  pleased to hear that you liked our property and your accommodation. The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and pasta factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy and though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. I regret you were not completely satisfied with our Shuttle boat service. The capacity is of 39 seats and we usually suggest our guest to be on the dock at least five minutes before leaving hour. May I take this opportunity to inform you that the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12'. I look forward to welcoming you back to the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
