Felt like living in a palace. Although it still maintained its original structure, it didn't look old fashioned at all.  Room was nicely decorated and spacious. The service lived up to Hilton standard.  Located in a separate island gives you more privacy yet you still can get to the "city centre" in no time.  Breakfast was excellent, lots of selections of high quality food. Simply the best breakfast we had on our entire euro trip.  two thumbs up for this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 11, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
