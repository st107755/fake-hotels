Really enjoyed the stay and we'd a great view across to Venice Port.  Breakfast was great.  Nice to get away from the busier island and see local activity.  Fee for the Hilton boat was €7.50 not what was advertised on the website, €6- but definitely worth it. ( check the timetable before you arrive to avoid the lunch break!!)  You can get the water bus to Planca, 5 min walk to hotel. There were a few restaurants on the same island if you don't fancy eating in the hotel or in the dense tourist areas. As everywhere in Italy there was the city tax €3.50 per person, per stay and a charge to sit in a restaurant/ bar, €5 for the hotel's rooftop bar.
