We are just back from Venice where we stayed at the Molino Stuckey for 6 nights.  We took the water taxi to and from the airport (100 euros each way) - I have to say it was the only way to go.  We are Hilton Honors gold members so when we arrived we were escorted to the executive lounge on the 6th floor for check-in.  The lounge is very nice.  We spent lots of time there during the week as they always had drinks available (we mainly had water/oj/coffee, but there was alcohol) and during parts of the day there were some good snacks.  We were originally assigned room 612 which is on the executive floor but not overlooking the canal.    The room was nice sized.  The bathroom had a shower over the bathtub that wasn't enclosed but instead had a glass partition that was about 3 feetâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20072 SavesHelpfulShare
