Great place to stay away from the hustle of central Venice. The staff all gave excellent service & went out of their way to exceed your expectations. The hotel provides a regular free shuttle to & from St Marks Square. Loved the rooftop pool & Bar with panoramic views of city. It was fun to watch the cruise liners sail by. Wish we had booked our water taxi arrival & departure through the hotel as the Venicelink company we booked were terrible.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
