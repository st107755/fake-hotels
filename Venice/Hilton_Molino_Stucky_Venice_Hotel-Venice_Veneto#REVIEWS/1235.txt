The Molino Stucky Hilton is a creative reconstruction of a former flour mill and there are reminders throughout the hotel of the original structure. It is a large and spacious property with a great rooftop bar that has 360 degree views of Venice and its surroundings. Hilton efficiency is evident in all its operations from excellent housekeeping to restaurant services. It is a pleasure to return to this property time and time again for a homecoming welcome.Rooms are varied in size, location, and views. Rooms overlooking the port of Venice offer the best views of the city. The mornings start with a sumptuous breakfast buffet and fine dining by the waterside is available at the Aromi restaurant which I will be reviewing separately.
