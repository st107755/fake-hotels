My husband and I stayed here for two nights in May at the end of our cruise. Hotel was good, but our room was quite dark with small windows. However very comfortable. The hotel provided a water taxi to St Mark's Square every hour. On the roof was a lovely pool, and marvellous views. Breakfast was good, but we did not eat at the hotel in the evening, as one night we found a restaurant nearby, which was a lot cheaper!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
