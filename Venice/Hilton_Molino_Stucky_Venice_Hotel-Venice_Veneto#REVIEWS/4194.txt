My wife and I stayed here on a two day visit to Venice for pleasure.  The hotel does not have a public vaporetto (water bus) stop but is easily reachable by a 10 min walk from one of the nearby stops.  The restaurant and bar seemed pricey, which is expected for Venice.  We had executive lounge access as hilton diamond members.  The concierges were very knowledgable and helpful, and even sell daily passes to the water buses which are great.  They have a free taxi to St. Mark's square but we never used it as we required a bit more freedom to roam around the different parts of the city.  I would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
