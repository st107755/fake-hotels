I stayed here recently for our annual staff conference. Checked in quickly, room was large, bright and had all necessary amenities. Tea/coffee making facilities, safe, hairdryer, mini bar (for a very large fee). The only down side to this hotel is that they hire out the rooftop pool for 'private parties' so residents have to leave the pool/bar area at 5pm. For a hotel that IS NOT cheap to stay at, I found this very annoying. Housekeeping was standard. Buffet food was bland and tasteless, but catering for a very large amount of people is difficult. Location was ok, not on the main Island so you will have to get the Hilton water bus to St Marks Square (which is free). When I come back to Venice, I wouldn't stay here again. The hotel is beautiful, but there are many more in Veniceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
