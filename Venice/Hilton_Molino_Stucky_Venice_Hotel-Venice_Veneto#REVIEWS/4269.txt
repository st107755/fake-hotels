Wonderful hotel, nice size rooms, sparkling bathrooms, best we saw in Italy, this was our third hotel in our tour of Italy and we really enjoyed our stay here, although somewhat pricey, everything in Venice is. It was a short boat ride across the Grand Canal.We would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
