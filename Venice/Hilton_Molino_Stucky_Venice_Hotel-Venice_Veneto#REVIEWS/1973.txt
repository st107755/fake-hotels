We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. Your comments will of course be forwarded to the relevant management for their attention. I am truly sorry that we were not able to offer a late check-out but as you know it is upon availabity and we are indeed experiencing a very busy Summer season so far. May I take this opportunity to confirm that the safety of our guest is our most important priority and I would like to reassure you about the safety of our pool area. I am glad to inform you that we have no recent record of any guest falling and hitting their faces and I would obviously had been informed. This said, a lifeguard as well as first aid trained team members are always present upon pool opening hours. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our guests and, although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you again and regain your confidence in our brand here in Venice by demonstrating the high level of service we are renowned for.
