This hotel is simply fabulous. It is very well run and the rooms are spacious and keep in with some of the modern features. The skyline bar has beautiful views, a full 360 view from the roof pool. Relax in the pool with a cocktail and watch the world go by. The boat to San Marco is excellent at 7.50euros for your entire stay you get the peacefulness of being in giudecca and then the hustle and bustle of St Marks.  The beat of both worlds.

We are glad that you have enjoyed our Rooftop Pool and its unique view and that you liked to be away from the centre of Venice and from the more crowded areas. On the next occasion I would suggest a visit of the Giudecca island, where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
