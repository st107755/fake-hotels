Good roof top pool and bar area, only used pool in the morning as very busy in the afternoon, The breakfast was good with a wide choice buffet style, helpful and friendly staff. Shuttle boat service works very well between hotel and mainland Venice every 20 to 30 mins depending on time of day and stops just before 1am, plenty of time to enjoy the nightlife of Venice, great atmosphere in St Marks square later in the evening with the bands playing.The hotel is a nice retreat from the crowds of Venice and would go back again. Room was clean and a good size.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
