Spent the last days in Venice here after a cruise. Impressed with the size of the hotel, but was amazed at the small entrance.  Once inside, beautifully done hotel lobby.   Veronica, Front Desk was helpful and pleasant.  Room wasn't ready (which is typical at 11am on a Saturday).  Spoke with Christian, Concierge who gave us info and informed us of the shuttle to San Marco's Square, then we were off!  He also gave us info regarding how to get back to the airport for an early flight.  Upon returning to the hotel.   Our hotel keys were issued and luggage was waiting in our room.    Room was large.  Great bathroom.  And a really comfortable bed!  I read all the comments about the view from the roof, so we headed up there, but alas nothing was open due to a private party being setâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
