We redeemed Hilton Honors points here and really enjoyed the property.  Had wonderful views looking out over the water to the city.  Handsome rehabilitation of a unique building.  We liked being able to use the water shuttle and taxis to escape from the bustle of the city.  the executive lounge location is a bit odd -- just a raised portion of the lobby -- but we did enjoy the free drinks and snacks.  the only time we realized we were in a big hotel was at breakfast, which got a bit crowded.  but the buffet spread was generous and we took advantage of the nice outside seating.  room was extremely comfortable.   friendly staff.  we'd definitely consider staying here if we ever go back to venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 22, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
