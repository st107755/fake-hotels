We stayed at this hotel on Easter weekend.  We were a group of nine, so we booked rooms and suites. I highly recommend the family suite as it was spacious and extremely comfortable . The Hotel access is by water taxi, making it A 10 minute ride to cross to San Marcos square And 20 minutes to the train station.  The property is Grande with breathtaking views  Of Venice and its canals. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful at all times.  It's nice to get on your ferry and leave the crowds of Venice behind and be able to relax And enjoy this majestic hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
