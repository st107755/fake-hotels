This place was absolutely amazing. I was only there a night, but the service and people were so great and helpful. The bartenders downstairs, the guest services and the concierge were more than I could have asked for.   The rooms are amazing and getting to the hotel is not as complicated as it sounds. If you ask at the airport they will help you. My room had large windows that opened.   Their water taxi service was very helpful and made seeing the rest of the city very easy.   My only complaint was the sky bar. It was nice, but the bartenders there were not as personable as the ones down stairs. To their credit, it was pretty crowded and busy with a party so that might have been part of it.
