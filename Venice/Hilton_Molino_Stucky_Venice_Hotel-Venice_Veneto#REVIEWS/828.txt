Just had 5 days in Venice, stayed 2 nights at a hotel 2 min walk from St Marks and then the last 2 nights here.  It was nice experiencing both.  Always love staying at a Hilton group hotel and this was no exception, with the fantastic service, it’s like you’re coming home.   Loved the shuttle boat coming over you look at the hotel and it looks like a mental asylum somewhere in the states.  When you learn more, it was actually a flour mill and we were fascinated by all the history, there are photos everywhere showing you how it used to look etc.  Also they have the tallest roof top bar in Venice here!  Will definitely stay here again.  You can get a boat from the Airport to the hotel 15 Euros, one way, which was a really good price!
