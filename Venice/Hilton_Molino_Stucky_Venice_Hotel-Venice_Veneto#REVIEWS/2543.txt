I had a hard time deciding whether to stay at this hotel as it is a boat ride from Venice, but I am so glad I stayed at the Hilton. The staff was very friendly and made sure everything was perfect.  I had a cooling issue in my first room, and was immediately moved to a  new room.  The rooms and bathrooms are large and comfortable.  They have a free shuttle to Venice every 20 minutes.  Great view of Venice from the roof during happy hour.
