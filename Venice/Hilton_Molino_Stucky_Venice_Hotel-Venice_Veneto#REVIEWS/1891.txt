Must be one of the best hotels in Venice.  Positives: - Excellent hotel and great room facilities - Roof top bar and swimming pool with lovely view  - only 15 min to main center St Mark's Square via Hilton Shuttle which runs till late (around 11 pm or may be late)  Negatives:  - Far from Airport. If you use private taxi, it takes only 30 mins but that costs 130Euro ...while slower boats cost 15Euro per person but takes close to 2 hours - Swimming Pool water was quite coldRead moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
