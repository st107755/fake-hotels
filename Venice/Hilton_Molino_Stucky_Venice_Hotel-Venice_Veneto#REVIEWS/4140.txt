We lucked out with a great deal from Hotwire.  The hotel is very nice but despite its size and having full occupancy it lacked atmosphere. Regardless we were more than happy to check out the rooftop bar, use the executive lounge, and our rate included breakfast, which had a huge choice.  Free transport by boat to St. Mark's Square.  Comfortable room.  Highly recommend this place, particularly if you can get a deal.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
