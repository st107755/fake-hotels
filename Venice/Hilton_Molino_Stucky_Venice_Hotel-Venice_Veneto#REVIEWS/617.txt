There is no doubt this reconstruction was beautifully done. The quiet location is wonderful. However, we had requested one bed and got two singles. One with a ripped duvet cover. On reporting this to staff, we were promised it would be corrected. The duvet cover was fixed, the beds were never joined. At these prices that's very disappointing. Nice hotel, but not exemplary service.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2018Dear Madame, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
