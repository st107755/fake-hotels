Awesome hotel.  Short (free) ferry ride from hotel to San Marco Square docks.  Nice to be out of the madness in quiet location just across the water at night, but easy 10 min ride across via regularly scheduled ferry that ran up until late at night.   Hotel is clean, professional, staff were friendly and helpful.  Checkin and out were a breeze, executive lounge on 1st floor looking out over water from some windows.  Great experience.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 29, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
