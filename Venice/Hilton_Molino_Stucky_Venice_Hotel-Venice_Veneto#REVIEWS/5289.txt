W e were thee in December. Weather cool. Great place to be modern yet in a historical city. Offers water taxi service to st marks square free of charge. Free wifi. We were at the club level allowed wine and snacks. Hotel was not crowed. Had a great room plenty of space but it ws 390 euros a night.  Went into town both days had plenty to do. Went to the glass island of Muro waste of time do not bother. Water taxi to airport 106 euros 40 minute boat ride. I would recommend. Staying in an historical hotel in this old town would be problematic. The only draw back is not local restaurants to eat at.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
