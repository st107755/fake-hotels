Had a wonderful long weekend in May in this fantastic hotel with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   The staff were warm, welcoming and very eager to make our stay are comfortable as possible.  The location of the Hotel is absolutely perfect as it allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the centre of Venice.   We used the shuttle boat every day which was a bonus and not costly at all. The staff even arranged our taxi transfer to the airport on our return.   Overall impression of the hotel: 10/10 👌🏽 Can't wait to return!! 😘xxRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 1, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
