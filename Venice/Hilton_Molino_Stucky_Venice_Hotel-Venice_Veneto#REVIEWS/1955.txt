The only way to get to the hotel from the cruise terminal is by water taxi (or water bus if you don't have much luggage), with 5 cruise ships in port this was very busy and took a little time to get the taxi and not cheap but what a great way to arrive at the hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff, we had a excellent room with all the facilities of a 5 star hotel. Great views from the roof top pool it can get a little busy, My Hilton Gold Card got me into the executive lounge and very good complimentary breakfast. The hotel shuttle boat run every 20 minutes until 11.30 pm across the river to what must be one of the most beautiful city's in the world for only a few euros each way. Not the cheapest hotel in the world but the best never is, will definitely use again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Sir, We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
