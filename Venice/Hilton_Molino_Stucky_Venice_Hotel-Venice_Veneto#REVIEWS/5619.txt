I booked the Stucky Molino Hilton via a popular internet booking site.  What initially appeared to be a very good deal turned out far less than a good deal.  Why was this hotel a bad choice:  (1)  Upon check-in and a request for a room with two beds, the front desk clerk basically said that with the internet booking, no such choice was available to us.  However, for only "39 Euros per day extra", he would get us a room with two beds plus one with a view.  We did get a very small room with two beds and even a view.  Unfortunately, it also had a connecting door to the next room.  We were kept up very late for two of our three nights at the hotel by loud voices and TV from next door...even the wall between the rooms was slightly opened at the top.
