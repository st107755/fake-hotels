This is a very modern hotel in Venice, not a character property, but what a place to stay. Everything about this hotel is first class, from the rooms, to the restaurants, the lobby and the staff. It was a great hotel experience in Venice. The ambience in the breakfast restaurant, and the quality of the people-watching was so good I could have stayed there for hours. The food and wine is as you would expect, and the location on Guidecca Island is easily reached by ferry and water taxi. It's a great hotel in a great location in a great city.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear  Guest, We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and thanks for taking the time to leave your review.
