All around great experience, exactly what I would expect from Hilton. Check in was fast and efficient. All facilities were in top shape. Pool/bar has an amazing view not to be missed. The concierge helped arrange a trip to Murano island for us last minute witha group for a tour of one of the glass making factories. The night desk helped my wife with an emergency phone issue when she was having issues and even provided us with a travel charger adaptor when we realized ours wasn't working. All around great service from start to finish.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Sir, We would like to thank you for taking the time to submit a review regarding your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, it was a pleasure to read that you enjoyed our services and facilities.
