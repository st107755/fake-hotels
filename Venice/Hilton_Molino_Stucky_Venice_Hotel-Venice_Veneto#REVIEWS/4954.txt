Being a Hilton Honors member, we stay no where else!  During a 3 week trip to Europe we stayed at 3 Hilton Hotels before and after our cruise.  This hotel was the best of the trip and one of the best we have stayed at.  Accomodating from the first step inside, we were quickly checked in.  Our room was not ready but we were escorted to the Executive Lounge where we could relax until our room was ready.  They actually came to get us when we could get in our room and our luggage was already there waiting.  We had a beautiful room with wonderful views of the Grand Canal.  We could ask for no more.  I was very concerned about travelling around in a water taxi but the Hilton's free shuttle service was everything we could want.  No problems getting anywhere.
