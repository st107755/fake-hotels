This hotel is great. Its location is perfect. Just a short boat trip into Venice.  The best about this hotel is the Aromi restaurant. The food is amazing and the staff could not be friendlier . It made us eat most of our evening meals there . Reception staff has some training to do in terms of friendliness and how to give good service .  Great with swimming pool on the roof.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
