Second time back here as HH Diamond member. Came here a year ago and staff were really snobish. However, this time, I was amaze with the leavel of service! I redeemed two room for us 3girls and we were upgraded to a suite attached with 2 bedrooms with a huge living and dinning room and powder room! ON top of that we were able to access the executive lounge and enjoy snacks and drinks while have access to the restaurent for full breakfast! I never thought anything of their service a year ago but obviously things have changed.  Room were good and the hilton has a scheduled free boat into town less than 10-15mins away. It's conveninet to get into town w restarents and shops yet to stay here, quiet.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review and for your loyalty to the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
