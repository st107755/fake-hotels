Arrived at airport then walk 5 to 10 mins to the jetti to get the alilagoona vaparetto (cheap, about 100 euro return for 4 of us and easy) on the second last stop on the blue line to doorstep of Hilton - took about 40mins and excellent siteseeing on the way, kids loved it. Hilton junior suite for 4 was perfect with 2 teenagers, both double bedrooms separated by a large dining area and small kitchen - luxury bathroom - breakfast was buffet and everything fresh and well presented. Discrete staff throughout. Our favourite thing was free shuttle (minimal charge of about 4euro each) for the dedicated shuttle anytime back and forth to about 300 yards from Saint marks square..there are great place to eat on guidecca down the street from the hotel if you can't be bothered going too farâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 23, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor and for the information that will be helpful for other travelers.
