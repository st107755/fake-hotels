Had a weekend trip to Venice and stayed in an Executive Suite which enables you to use the Executive Lounge. There you can have free drinks and nibbles and between 5-7pm is happy hour with free wine and beer.  The hotel staff are really helpful and friendly. The location is great. It is nice to be away from the crowds near San Marco. The shuttle is frequent and we never had to queue.  The rooms are really quiet and comfortable .  Really enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
