So enjoyed our stay! it is just across from San Marco with great water taxi shuttle.  Our room was amazing with views over looking the beautiful and busy San Marco and this quaint and quiet island was perfect at the end of a busy day of touring.  The staff where fabulous we enjoyed drinks at the Skyline roof top bar (amazing views of the cruise ships leaving) as well as the Rialto lobby bar.  Had dinner one evening in Aromi food and service where amazing!  Would definitely recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
