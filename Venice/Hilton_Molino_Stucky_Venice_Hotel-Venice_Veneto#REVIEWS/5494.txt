We had a wonderful stay here. We were upgraded to a suite because we had our teenage son with us. The Suite was beautiful. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Executive lounge was very nice. The hotel shuttle to San Marco was very convenient. I would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
