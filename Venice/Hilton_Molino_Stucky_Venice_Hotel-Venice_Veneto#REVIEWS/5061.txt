I could not imagine a better place to stay in Venice. I travel for a living, and stay exclusively at Hiltons. This is the best one on the planet, bar none. My room had a view of the canal that was breathtaking. The food was great. The service was superb, everybody loves their job! Imagine if it was like that in the real world? I mean that as Venice and the hotel seemed to be almost too great to be real. I would gladly return here.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor and sharing your opinion on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
