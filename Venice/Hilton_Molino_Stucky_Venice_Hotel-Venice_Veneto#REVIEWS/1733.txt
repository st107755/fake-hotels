We just stayed at this property  last week for two nights.  The hotel itself is very nice, rooms are clean, we had a king size bed that was super comfortable and the hall way very quiet. Shuttle service is provided from the island to San Marco every 20 minutes and works out great, there is a 4.50 euro charge per room per day to use the service and is billed direct to your room.  We got a good rate by prepaying in advance, breakfast was not included in the rate and is available for 19 euro per person per day.  Might be good for most as there is NOTHING else on the island that the hotel is on. We took a private water taxi to the airport on the day we left, taxi service is 120 euro and holds 4 people, we were fortunate to find a shared ride by asking the concierge.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
