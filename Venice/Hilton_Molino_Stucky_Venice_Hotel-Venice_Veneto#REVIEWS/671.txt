Where to start? Okay it is quite difficult, so letâ€™s do it chronologically:  Check-In was smooth, friendly and quickly. As a Gold-member, I was upgraded to a nice room on executive floor.  The bed was cozy and the room nice and clean.  But then the breakfast, please get a cappuccino or Ristretto there from the wonderful waitresses. Besides wonderful coffee they serve everything you need for a perfect start.  Pool on the roof is nice and the view great.  But as most people you are there for sightseeing and the public transport is 2 walking minutes away, so you need no expansive taxi, just take the public boats.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 17, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
