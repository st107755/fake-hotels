On the island of Guidecca the hotel provides a great shuttle to SAN Marco every 30 minutes. The boat taxi from the airport is well worth the boat ride through Venice especially the first time. The rooms facing the canal are worth the cost. Breakfast is expensive but provides a great start for the day. One of our favorite restaurants is a five minute walk by the public boat taxi. The pool and bar n the seventh floor have great views of Venice especially at night. We have stayed in a great hotel n the Grand Canal which is also a great experience. In Venice be careful to know if you need to haul your luggage to hotels away from canal drop offs.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review.
