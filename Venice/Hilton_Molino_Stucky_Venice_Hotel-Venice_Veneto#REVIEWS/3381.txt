Its a beautiful property, with well done  rooms, free drinks and snacks (at the executive lounge), great bar at the terrace. The hotel is away from central venice but provides complimentary ferry service throughout the day. Kids will love the nutella snack bar. From the station you can take the local ferry ($ and 4.2) to a stop thats 10 min walk from the hotel. Not many places in the vicinity in case you want to go for a stroll.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
