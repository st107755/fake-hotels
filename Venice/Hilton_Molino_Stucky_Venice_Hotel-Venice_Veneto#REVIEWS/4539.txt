I usually don't associate Hilton with luxury, but this is one beautiful property. The Skyline Bar on the 8th floor affords one of the most scenic views in all of Venice. But our special moment during our three day stay was at the Rialto Bar on the ground floor just off the lobby. Bartender Enrico, a Giudecca native who worked in London for 3 years, introduced us to a local refreshing drink, Aperol Spritz and went out of his way to say hello each day as we walked through the lobby. Most Venetian visitors rarely encounter such hospitality and service.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
