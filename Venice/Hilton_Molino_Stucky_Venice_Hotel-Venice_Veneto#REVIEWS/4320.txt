This hotel is one of my favorites and as a Diamond member ive been to many ,as with anything to do with Venice it isnt cheap .But the views from the roof top pool have to be some of the best in the world .All the big cruise ships come right past the hotel if you have a Venice island view room you can almost touch them. The breakfast in the main area at the back of the hotel was one of the best ive had .The executive lounge is ok but a little bit lacking in service and they dont do spirits or cocktails in happy hour !but that is a minor little thing compared to what you get at this hotel. a special thank you to lady on the desk (sorry cant remember her name) who managed to get my clothing pressed on the same day i was leaving 18/07/13Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 22, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory and your kind comments regarding the service received have been shared with our employees.
