We paid extra to gain access to the executive lounge. There were no glasses, one had to open and pour the wine. We ordered sandwiches which took one hour to come. The Amori restaurant is very expensive and food service poor. Guest relations failed to deal with our complaints. We were even charged for 2 dinners which were included in our rate. We left the hotel 2 days early and went to the San Clemente Palace Resort which is truly 5 star, excellent service , helpful and pleasant staff. The food is excellent  and the resort is like a haven with beautiful gardens.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
