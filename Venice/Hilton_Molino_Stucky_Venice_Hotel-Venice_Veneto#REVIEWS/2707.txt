Rooftop pool was the main reason for staying here is August, amazing views as cruise ships went past & fantastic sunsets, refreshing after a hectic day in St Mark square , fabulous cocktail bar at night  & hotel shuttle service was great, run like clockwork and good to stay slight out of the hustle & bustle & travel into it. I would stay here again, we made the mistake of getting the public water taxi on arrival to hotel & took 2 hours15 euros each & return to the airport via grand canal with our very own private water taxi 150 euro as a specail treat to finish an amazing break.
