Please accept our apologies for the problem with mosquitoes in your room: unfortunately mosquitoes, especially in the summer season, certainly find in the Venetian lagoon the perfect habitat and are difficult to control, regardless of the regular disinfestations we carry out in all our guestrooms. We are extremely sorry for the discomfort that you have experienced this time and we will enforce additional measures in such cases as yours, which please rest assured remain isolated incidents. Otherwise I am pleased that you have appreciated the comfort in the room as well as the dining experience at our Aromi restaurant. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
