We stayed at the Molino Stucky for 2 nights in November and had a fabulous time.  It was clean and well presented with amicable but not over friendly staff.  We booked the hotel through Priceline which didn't include breakfast.  If you buy breakfast when you are there it is about 25 euros each!!! You are better off heading across the water and having a coffee and croissant at the little  coffee shop on the front for a couple of euros. The complimentary water shuttle from the hotel is very frequent and runs until around midnight.  On arrival at Marco Polo airport you can either take the bus to Venice (cheapest and quickest option) or a water bus (most scenic) which drops you off in St Marks Square then just take the complimentary water shuttle bus to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
