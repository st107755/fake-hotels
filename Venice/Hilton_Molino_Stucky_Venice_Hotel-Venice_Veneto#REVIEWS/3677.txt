This is the most awesome Hilton I've stayed at to date, and I've stayed at a few.  The building is huge, so it's pretty easy to get lost. The historic factory building has been converted into one of the more luxurious Hiltons out there. The best feature by far is the rooftop pool, from where you can see all of Venice while swimming or having a drink poolside. Also impressed by grand public areas, executive lounge overlooking the water, and the Nutella cafe in the courtyard.   It's not on the main island but a frequent free shuttle gets you to the main sights of the city and makes it really accessible.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 18, 2014Dear Madame,  We are delighted that you had a good time at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review.
