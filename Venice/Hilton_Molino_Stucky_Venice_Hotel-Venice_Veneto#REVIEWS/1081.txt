We stayed three nights at this Hilton, and it is beautiful and comfortable.  Rooms are clean, and furnished nicely.  Beds and bathroom are wonderful.  We didn't eat in any of the in-house restaurants, but we had breakfast every morning at the huge breakfast buffet and it was delicious.  All of the staff is very nice and attentive.  From the hotel, you look across the main channel to the heart of old Venice.  The hotel provides a free water taxi that runs every 20 minutes to take you across to it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
