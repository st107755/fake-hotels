Really nice location. Quiet and spacious room and easy to take boat to city centre. I like hotels to be the safe haven when away from home and that you sleep well in quiet, dark and fresh room. This Hilton deliver on that. Nice to escape from buzzling tourist areas for good sleep.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on TripAdvisor.
