We had a 2 night stay at this hotel. It is a beautiful hotel, fantastic views, lovely food and friendly, helpful staff. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a city break to Venice. The only downsides of staying here are that they charge extra for wifi and to use the spa facilities but the free water taxis back and forth to the main island where St. Marks square and the Doges Palace are, are a real bonus.  The room was well equipped, comfortable and the bed was fantastic, really comfortable! The reception staff spoke fantastic English and were very helpful.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 20, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
