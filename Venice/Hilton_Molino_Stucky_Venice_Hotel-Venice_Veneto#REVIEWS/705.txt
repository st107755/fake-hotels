Great hotel.  Wonderful rooms.  Service was very good.  The breakfast buffet was very good.   The variety of food they offered was one of the best I have seen.  The rooftop terrace at night for a drink for a sunset is spectacular.   The private water taxi is great.  However at peak times it fills up fast.  Make sure you are in line 15-20 minutes before pick-up time.  Would go back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 27, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
