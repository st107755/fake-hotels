From the minute you arrive service is excellent.  Very friendly bell boy and very friendly receptionist.  Carlo at concierge was fantastic. We upgraded our room to an executive King with lounge access.  Room was pretty small for an executive room but the view was exceptional.  Lounge was pretty good for breakfast and light snacks. Loved the location of the hotel.  They have a boat shuttle leaving around every 40 minutes to the main centre. We were there for a conference, but we will definately be back.   Excellent hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
