Spent 1 night here pre cruise on points and received a very nice corner suite from the upgrade fairy.  Had a glorious view from all our windows of the canal.  There was an entire living room and two bathrooms.  Didn't get to spend much time in the room but it was a very nice gesture.  Check in was at 2 pm and since we arrived early, we left our luggage with the bellhop.  When we came back to get our room keys the luggage was already in the room.  Requested late check out and was only granted 1 pm the latest.  We arrived via train and took the 4.1 vaporetto to the hotel.  When you walk out of the train station, go right and there is a vaporetto station for 4.1 direction Giudecca.  You can buy tickets from a newsstand in the train station or from a stand next to the vaporetto. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
