This hotel is amazing, what makes it so is the staff. From first to last. Nikos who checked us in was great, suggested us places and how to get around. Dinners at bacaromi were really nice, super food and staff great..  breakfast had loads of choices, also you can ask for omelets and waffles with strawberries and chocolate. Breakfast staff made our mornings great, can't remember they're names, but the Russian guy was super.  David was really nice at checkout. 10+ for the staff.  Shuttle that takes you to S. Marco is 6â‚¬ for the whole stay, running every 40 min.  Room was a standard room, we were 3 and everything was clean and spotless. A big thank you to everyone for making our stay enjoyable.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 14, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
