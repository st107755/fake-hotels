We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky 6th - 9th February. We had a slight problem with the first room so we were immediately moved to a suite which was delightful - very comfortable bed and large bathroom. The location is great on Guidecca and the hotel transfer boat was fast and extremely punctual. The breakfast was one of the best I've had in a hotel, extremely high quality hot and cold buffets. Most of all, I would like to compliment all the staff who simply couldn't have been more helpful and friendly - many thanks to all for a most enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank for taking the time to leave your review, we are really glad you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
