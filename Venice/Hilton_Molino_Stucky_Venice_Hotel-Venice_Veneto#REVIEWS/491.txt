Location is great; away from the canal smells during warm seasons. Hotel staff is extremely friendly.  The Executive Lounge is a disappointment (very poor and meager selection of food/beverages- Not a European class Exec Lounge, more like U.S. Version!). In general amenities in the room are limited. Some mold growing in the grout lines near the tub!  Needs better cleaning/maintenance.
