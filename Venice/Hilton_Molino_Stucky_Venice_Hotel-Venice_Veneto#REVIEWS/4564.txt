Had a fantastic vacation here, really like the hotel. Excellent service, excellent breakfast. The hotel is a converted pasta factory & the remaining features really give it character, the staff were really helpful & genuinely friendly especially with our two young children. My only complaint is the frequency of the water shuttle over to venice, the boys found it great fun but at times it only runs hourly which can be rather limiting. Overall though I'd happily recommend this hotel & would be keen to return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
