This was our last stop on a 2 week vacation. This hotel had all the amenities and services we're use to getting in the US (which was a welcome change). The staff was very eager to help and always available. The concierge and bell staff answered all our questions and steered us to restaurants and experiences that made for an incredible stay.  The only downside is that we had several big bags of luggage and took public transportation to get to the hotel (so it was alittle extra work lugging bags).Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments and positive review on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay.
