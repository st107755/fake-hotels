I had very high hopes for this hotel but was mildly disappointed. The rooms were quite average, the restaurants expensive and service was ok. The view from the Sky bar is beautiful, one of the best of Venice. Unfortunately for us the pool was not open as the refurbishments were not complete. We were there as part of a conference and the hotel catered very well for such a large group unless you are like me a vegetarian, or vegetable as the staff liked to call me. They missed out on one course, were so long bringing another everyone on the table had finished eating so I told them not to bother, then tried to have me eat ravioli, which was filled with vegetables but had a foie gras cream. The spa is 25 euros a day, for a jacuzzi, a sauna and a steam room which seems a bit steep.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
