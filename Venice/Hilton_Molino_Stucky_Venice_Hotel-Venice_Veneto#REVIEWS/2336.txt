Fantastic hotel on it's own little island facing onto the main Venice Island. The hotel provides a regular free shuttle boat into the main island/harry bar/St Marks Square. The hotel restaurant on the ground floor serves Venitian tapas. The rooms are stunning, the basic ones are on the small side though, and the terrace in the hotel bar overlooks the city. This is a beautiful and romantic hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 10, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments.
