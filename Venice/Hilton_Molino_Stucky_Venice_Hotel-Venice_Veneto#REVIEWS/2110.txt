Surrounding areas near the hotel were very interesting. During the day everything is open, but limited at night. Just a short shuttle waterbus ride fromvSt Marks square and central Venice. A great base for a short break, expensive compared to further inland at Treviso and other close areas where we moved to after 2 days. Well worth the visit.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive feedback I am glad to hear that you liked the Hotel and our services and that you enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
