Located about a 20 min ferry ride from saint Marcos. This is a pretty good option if you want something up market, quiet and away from busy downtown Venice.  It’s a large hotel, rooms are immaculate and well appointed. Good lounge, bar and restaurant options although you are a bit of a captive market here.  Not a lot to do in the immediate vicinity however there are some nice waterfront local eateries within a 10 to 20 min walk.  Good ferry service to downtown, seems to operate every 20 mins or so, it departs and arrives right at the front door. The highlight was perhaps the roof top pool and bar, magical views over Venice. All in all a nice quiet retreat from busy Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor, we are really happy to know that you have enjoyed your stay with us and that you loved the location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous cafés, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
