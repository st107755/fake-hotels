Overall, this hotel is beautiful.  The rooms are spacious and very clean (we were in room #507 with a great view) , the hotel grounds are wonderful as well,  but here's the thing...we stayed at 5 different places during our 2 week vacation in Italy and not only was this hotel the most expensive hotel for us, it was the only hotel that did not offer free wi-fi (hence 4 star vs 5 star rating for value).  The hotel is located off the main island but there is a free shuttle service that goes back & forth.  We've given it a 4 star vs 5 star rating because the shuttle stops running after 1am-ish so unless you want to pay for a taxi (which can be $$$), you can't really stay out late.  Breakfast is pretty pricey so we would hop on the shuttle and grab a quick bite at one of the cafes.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor.
