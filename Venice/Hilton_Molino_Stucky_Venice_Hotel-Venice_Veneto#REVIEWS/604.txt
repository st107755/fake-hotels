Absolutely Hotel Stucky suited our type of lifestyle.  This Hilton is on Stucky Island and is just a 10 minute boat trip away from St. Marks on the Grand Canal.  The boat is operated free of charge from the Hotel wharf.  The Hotel is gorgeous, very clean and our room was average size, upmarket and very comfortable.  The restaurant in the main lobby is very nice.  I was unwell one day and they made just a ham toasted sandwich for me.  Very obliging staff.  Occasionally I sat up on the roof in the bar area and would sip cocktails while looking over Venice.  The hotel is very well run and the staff are knowledgable.  Stucky island has a few restaurants to choose from in the evenings.  Every restaurant we tried, the food was delicious.  I would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 30, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
