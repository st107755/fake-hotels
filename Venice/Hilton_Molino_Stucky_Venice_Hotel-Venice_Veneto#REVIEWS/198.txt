We stayed at this hotel, twice within a 10 day period (pre-cruise and post-cruise). The first room was a family suite. It was old and run down and the air conditioner didn’t work. (They said it was working, I’m telling you it wasn’t.) The room was long and narrow and just weird. We came back 10 days later and had two rooms next to each other. They were(are) a decent size and BEAUTIFULLY updated. It’s like two different properties - make sure you ask for the updated one. The service has been great (except for the a/c issue with the first time), the staff is very helpful.
