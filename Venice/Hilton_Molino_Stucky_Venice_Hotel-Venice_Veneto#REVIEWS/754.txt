Complimentary and regular shuttle to the main island. Large and well maintained ex flour mill so pleasing architecture. Can be rather soulless inside. Was booking for us by Viking cruises but was far better than their usual standard so we were pleasantly surprised.  Good room, excellent comfortable large bed. Poor tea making equipment and after 5 calls to room service and conversations still couldnâ€™t get cold milk. No price lists of mini bar and very poor/ no in room information on location and facilities. Freezing cold shower on first day for no reason. Skyline bar uncomfortable seating and awful music that drives people out!! All that said viewing Venice from Guidecca island is magical. The island is charming and away from the tourist haunts but well worth exploring.
