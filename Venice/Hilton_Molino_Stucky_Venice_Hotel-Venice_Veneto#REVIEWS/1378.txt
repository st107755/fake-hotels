I am sad to tell you that we had a very disappointing experience at our stay at Hilton Molino Stucky. Service was appalling throughout our stay, staff some of the unfriendliest I've ever experienced and the rooms very smelly and already showed its use, despite only being opened a few years ago. Limited amenities available, was expecting much more for a 5 star hotel. The rooftop pool was closed despite it being 25C outside and people heading to the beach at Lido. I'm sure we might have had a better stay at an authentic little 2 star hotel in town. The only thing we liked was  the architecture of the buildingaway and the location on Guidecca, away from the tourist mayhem. All in all a huge disappointment and completele rip off. I should have probably written this review ages agoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 4, 2017Dear Madame, First of all I would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
