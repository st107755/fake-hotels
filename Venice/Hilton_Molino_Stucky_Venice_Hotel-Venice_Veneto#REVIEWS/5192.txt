Giudecca Island is such a quiet and relaxing respite from the bustle of Venice's canals and alleys. Then add the nice Hilton to the mix and you have a good option for your stay in Venice. I have stayed at this place before and have found that the hotel is very large and has a wide array of interesting rooms, many with tall ceilings and wood beams and some with a view of the canal, but others look toward the interior courtyards of the hotel.  The breakfast buffet is OK, but the eggs served at that buffet are probably reconstituted egg powder and were awful - more like tasteless watery egg soup than scrambled eggs. If I didn't get the breakfast included for free I probably wouldn't have eaten there.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive feedback I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hotel and the accommodation offered and that you enjoyed staying with us.
