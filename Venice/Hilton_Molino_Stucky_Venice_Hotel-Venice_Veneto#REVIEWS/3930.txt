we have just returned from a wonderful trip at the Hilton Moino Stucky, our room was fantastic as it over looked the Canal so romantic!, the service was great and staff were very couteous. We ate in both restaurants and had cocktails in the Sky bar, the views where amazing. We used the excutive lounge, snacks here where good and they serve wine and beer between 5 and 7. The hotel run a shuttle between Giudecca island and St Marks, this is very efficient and runs about every 20 mins. The hotel can organise a water taxi pick up service to the airport for about 16 Euros. We had a amazing stay at the Molino Stucky and will definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2014Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments.
