This is a very nicely decorated hotel. The rooms were lovely, I enjoyed the wide range of choice for breakfast. The hotel was well presented and would certainly stay here again. We had trouble with hot water and the hotel did all they could to fix the issue for us although we were put into a worse room when we moved so decided to move back and deal with the issue. Everyone was friendly. Definitely recommend. The water taxi is great also.
