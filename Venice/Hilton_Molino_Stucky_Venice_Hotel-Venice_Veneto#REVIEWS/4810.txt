Everything was great. Exec lounge, checkin, rooms (A+), staff, etc. My message to management is you know the water taxi will be overbooked at peak periods, don't leave the overflow standing there for an hour. We arrived at the St. Marks square pier 25 minutes early thank goodness, so getting on the shuttle boat wasn't a problem. However, many (and i mean very many) of those who arrived later did not get on. Mind you, the shuttle from this popular location ran hourly. Come on Hilton management, fix this problem!  Other than that, fabulous in every way.

I am pleased to read that you had a pleasant stay with us and enjoyed most of the hotel services and facilities. On the other hand I am sorry that you were not entirely satisfied with our shuttle boat service.  May I take this opportunity to confirm that our complimentary shuttle boat runs every 20 to 40 minutes from 8 am in the morning to 1 am in the night with the only exception of 1 hour break in the afternoon. In addition, Alilaguna public lines stop also in front of the Hotel, with direct connections to the Airport and the Cruise Harbour. Also, the ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. We acknowledge and appreciate your comments and constructive criticism as they will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our guests. We always place great value on the opinion of our guest and we hope to welcome you with us again in the near future. Best regards, Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
