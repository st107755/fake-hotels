Why charge extra for internet in the room when you pay so much for the room , for no charge internet you have to go in the connectivity room downstairs wich is not always convenient ....this should be included in the price of the room, restaurants inside the hotel way Overpriced dont go there same for a simple capucchino ....rooms are comfortable but we had to ask for a room change after the 1st day our room had a door wich communicate to the next room , we could hear the alarm clock, the neigbor taking a shower, snoring etc ...the other room was smaller but so much more quiet ,,, make sure your room has no wooden door that communicate to the next room ...good shuttle to San Marco and Zattere all drivers are nice except one that doesnt respect the schedule and doesnt smile at allRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear Sir,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
