The Molino Stucky is a lovely hotel, friendly efficient staff, large comfortable rooms and great, quiet location across from the hustle of central Venice accessed by the hotels own regular water taxi. This was our destination hotel from the London to Venice Orient Express and we were not disappointed. From checking in the staff were helpful, pleasant and very efficient. Our room was very comfortable, well equipped and quiet. the TV did not work properly, but we did no visit Venice to watch Sky News, so not bothered. The breakfast buffet was bountiful and the atmosphere relaxed. Would definitely use again on our next trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.It is a pleasure to receive such positive feedback!
