With HH points, it was a no brainer. But a very nice comfortable hotel with very good food close by. Only stayed one night, but was a very good experience. Front desk staff excellent, food at the Bacaromi Bar was good, HH breakfast was fantastic.  Only down side is that it is a bit isolated. Not much to walk to, but good walking nonetheless around the area. Have to take shuttle, or Vaporetto or water taxi to see any of the sights on the other islands.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
