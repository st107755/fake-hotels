Stayed here, based on reviews.  Was not disappointed.  The rooms were large, spacious and clean.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Away from the masses. Located  on Giudecca, a short ferry from the main island.  Rooftop bar view is amazing!!  Also has a great breakfast buffet.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 25, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive feedback on TripAdvisor.
