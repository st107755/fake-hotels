We were excited to return to this hotel as we had fond memories of the room, view, and service when we stayed there about 5 years ago. We've just had another perfect experience and appreciate Andrea's warm welcome at the front desk. Carlo, concierge extraordinaire, went out of his way to provide  assistance with train tickets to Milano at the last minute on a holiday weekend. Grazie mille! Note- the executive lounge provides nice appetizers, dessert, and wine in the evenings and the breakfast in the restaurant is the best we've seen anywhere in the world!Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 12, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments and review on TripAdvisor.
