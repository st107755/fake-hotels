We just returned from 2 nights in hilton stucky molino Venice... Not cheap, but definitely get what you pay for in terms of room quality and roof top pool with views across Venice... We had a room on 6th floor with view across Venice itself, staff were great and all in all a really enjoyable stay. Only slight downside was that neither breakfast nor wifi included in an expensive room rate we paid â‚¬460 per night... But that didn't detract from our stay at all!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2013Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
