First time to Venice and I think we could have found nicer accommodation.   For people that like big hotels this may be ok.  We felt like cattle at breakfast.  Missing attention to detail.  Lights in restaurant flicking on and off at breakfast.  Had to request bathrobe and face washers. Room key kept deciding to malfunction and 5 minute hike back to complain to reception who forgot to apologise wore thin after our second experience.  I would have preferred to stay in a smaller boutique hotel closer,  however view from Hotel is wonderful.  I do agree with previous view that this hotel does not soak up the atmosphere of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
