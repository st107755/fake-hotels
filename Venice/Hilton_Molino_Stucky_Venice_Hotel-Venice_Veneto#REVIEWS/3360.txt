We got a water taxi from the airport as there is no road access.this hotel is large and very stylish.The rooms are tastefully decorated.the hotel stands imposingly on giudecca island with little around it but they have their own water taxi which runs to a time table making 2 stops the second to st marks basillica which is the main tourist attraction.  the rooftop pool was closed end september but there is a roof bar with fantastic views. the breakfast buffet was nice with a good choice of hot and cold food.The concierge arranged a water taxi to our ship and check out was quick and easy.The bellhops took our cases to the water taxi and like when we arrived they put the cases on the water taxi.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor with regards to your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
