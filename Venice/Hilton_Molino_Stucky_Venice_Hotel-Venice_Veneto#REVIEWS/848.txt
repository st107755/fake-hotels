This was a great hotel to stay at in Venice. It feels like a luxury hotel at a mid-range price. The place is huge, and used to be an old mill. The people there are so nice and helpful. The only downside of this hotel is that it's located on Giudecca, which is across the Venetian lagoon from most of the city. However, the hotel has their own ferry which escorts customers across (less than 10 minutes). it costs about 7 euros per day per person, which is a bargain compared to the water taxis. Unfortunately we came in winter, and the Rooftop pool wasn't open, but I bet it would be SPECTACULAR in the spring or some. Would return next time in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 26, 2018Dear Sir, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
