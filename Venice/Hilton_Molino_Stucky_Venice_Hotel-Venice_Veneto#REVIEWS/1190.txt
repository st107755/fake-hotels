If you want to remove yourself from the craziness of San Marco/Dorsoduro, Giudecca is a great place to stay, and the Hilton offers a shuttle that goes back and forth into the fray approximately every 40 minutes.  This is really a beautiful Hilton in a historic refurbished pasta mill. Lots of Americans stay here,  which may or may not figure in your decision on accommodations. Definitely visit the rooftop bar, it possesses an amazing panoramic Venetian view up there. Note: walls are thin in the rooms, but that is something experienced in many historic building hotels in Europe.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
