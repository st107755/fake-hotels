Stayed here for 2 nights. Stunning location on the quayside. Rooftop bar definitely worth a visit, ideally try to see both sides as you get good views from both. Food was acceptable, but there are so many good restaurants across the water or along the quayside I would eat there. Staff, without exception very polite and helpful. (Not always the case in Hilton hotels I've stayed in in the UK)  Couple of tips.  If you plane lands late at night, email the concierge and they will reserve a water taxi for you. If it's daylight, and your first time in Venice, pay the extra for the water taxi route via the Grand CanalRead moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 27, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
