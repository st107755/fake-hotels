We have visited the Hilton Molino Stucky several times and they did not disappoint on this occasion. Staff were wonderful from arriving to departing. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade which was wonderful. Hilton breakfasts are great, plenty of choice for everyone. The hotel is away from all the madness of St Marks on the Giudecca which is what we love, going to the local restaurants & cafes. The courtesy boat is a bonus only a small charge per visit which is well worth it considering the cost of the vaporetta. We will definitely return.
