Our stay in Hilton was really very good. The staff, the room, the views  and Venice all were amassing.  We arrived at 10 a.m. after a cruise with two children and a person at the reception was very helpful and checked us straight in. The boat transfers were very useful and always on time. Both rooms were very well appointed and very clean. The pool side was such a pleasant surprise after long day in Venice. Overall I will very much recommend it .Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
