Venice was great. The Hilton Hotel sits across the channel and looks off on a 45 degree angle to San Marco Square. They have their own boat that ferries people back and forth to their own dock. From the public parking take the ferry to the 3rd stop. I believe it was Vespa #2. The Hilton breakfast was very complete; more expensive than most hotels, but so are the rooms. I would stay there again without hesitation.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 24, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website.
