Hhonors Diamond; upgraded to a suite. My family really enjoyed the rooftop pool. Beautiful views. We had access to Executive lounge with food and drinks throughout the day; it was nice to come back to prosecco and canapes and desserts after a long day of touring the sites. It's a gorgeous hotel. Service was impeccable from check-in to check out. We liked the location on Guidecca Island. Hilton has it own private water shuttle. So it was very convenient to and from the bustle of Venice. My stay at this Hilton made me fall in love with Venice all over again. Quiet stay with good night sleep for 3 nights before cruise. Internet was free. Can't speak to restaurant food as we didn't try or room service. They also have private water taxi service to and from hotel from airport.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
