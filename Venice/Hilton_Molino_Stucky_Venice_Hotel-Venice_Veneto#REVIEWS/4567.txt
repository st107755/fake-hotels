Me and my boyfriend came to venice for our 1 year anniversary so we wanted a nice hotel. We came in october so it was quite cold so when we got to the hotel the roof top pool wasnt open which was a massive disapointment because it looked lovely. The hotel itself is very grand feels like your in a castle it is huge. The hotel as its own free shuttle boat to venice centre which was great as it saved us alot of money and they came every 20 mins so didnt have to wait long. I didnt get to try the breakfast as wasnt included in my room, but we did goto the hotel bar resteraunt on the night and the food was lovely and the al la carte resteraunt next door was also amazing it had the best wine ive ever tested but cant remeber what it was im devostated!
