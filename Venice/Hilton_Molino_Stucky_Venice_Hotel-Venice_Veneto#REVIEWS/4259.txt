The only reason we stayed at this Hotel is because it was included in our cruise package for the night prior to embarkation. Whilst the Hotel has an interesting exterior and great views from the roof bar, the interior is quite soulless and reaffirmed my dislike of large, average hotel chains. I have been to Venice several times and have always stayed "in centro" which I find far more interesting and culturally vibrant. Whilst Giudecca affords fabulous views over Venice, the hotel just didn't do it for me. Concluding on a positive note, however, all the staff we came in contact with were fantastic and very helpful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
