Stunning location, looking across the sea to a glorious vista of towers and roofs. The old factory building has been sensitively redesigned and restored. The public areas are light and spacious. The bedroom was a good size and had been well kept. Wifi came and went. Very good breakfasts but we chose to eat out for lunch and dinner. A pleasant walk along the Giudecca takes you to very good restaurants and trattorias within a matter of minutes. Shuttle to the main sites was fast and efficient.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
