After staying in smaller, family run hotels in Rome & Florence, the Hilton Molino was a welcome relief.  Modern, yet retaining the charm that is all around it, we had a wonderful stay. Especially nice was the shuttle service from the hotel to two points on the main island.  It ran smoothly and on time.  My wife was especially impressed with the bathrooms, which are massive by European standards.  Although the air conditioning was turned off in early October, the room was comfortable to sleep in.  The concierge was very helpful in making restaurant reservations, and arranged for a very early water taxi ride to the airport.  Overall, a wonderful stay and we highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
