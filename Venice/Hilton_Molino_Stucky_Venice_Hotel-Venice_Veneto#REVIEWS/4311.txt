We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found the staff extremely friendly and the hotel clean and the fact that it's a converted flour factory makes it a little more unique.  We had a canal view room which was well worth it as the views from the window were awesome.  The free boat taxi to the main land was on time, but could get crowded so during our stay we only were unable to catch one trip back to the hotel around 1:20p.m., but got on the 2:20p.m. so not really that bad.  The hotel sky top pool is also a must see.  Venice it truly an amazing city with so many streets to walk, restaurants to eat, sites to see, it's impossible not to enjoy.  I recommend purchasing tickets with guided tours as you get so much more of the history.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
