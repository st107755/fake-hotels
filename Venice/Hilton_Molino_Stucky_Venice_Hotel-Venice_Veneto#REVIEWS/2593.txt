For a five star hotel, Hilton is quite nice,  democratic and less posh than other 5-star in Venice.  If you want heart and soul, stay in Bauer for example,  if you want the best rooftop swimming pool ( works only in summer period) and good prices, stay in Hilton. Don't forget that it's at separated island,  boat to center goes every hour ( after 10 pm on weekends sometimes each 40 min) .  Good breakfast,  good service,  spa is npt free!!!  Which is minus of course.  But gym is 24 hours.
