Had a WONDERFUL time in Venice!!  The hotel is stunning, and the staff is exceptional!  Only had 1 brief unpleasant interaction with one of the concierges; caught her making fun of us with her co-workers while we were still standing there!  But we came too far to let that stop us from having a great time!!  Complimentary water taxi ride to the tourist area was  wonderful!  The hotel has an amazing spread for the breakfast buffet!  Had a GREAT room with a GREAT view of the water!!  Can't wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare
