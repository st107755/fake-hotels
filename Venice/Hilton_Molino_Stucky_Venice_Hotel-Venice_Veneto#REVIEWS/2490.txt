We went there in the period of carnival.The hotel is a Hilton hotel,so you can imagine that is glamorous !It has no free wi fi in the rooms ,and the products in the freedge are very expensive .(the bottle of water costs 6 euros!) .But though ,the bedrooms are great ,it has a ferryboat that takes you to everywhere every few minutes for free and the breakfast is so rich! I recommend it! Venice ,ofcourse,is a dream!!!Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 2, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your positive review on TripAdvisor.
