Hilton Molino Stucky is a big hotel on an island close to Venice old town. It used to be an old Mill so the design is industrial which is made very well. I have visited other Hiltons around the world but have to say this was one of me better experiences. The rooms were big, clean and super nice with high ceilings and nice views. The service was excellent and the rooftop pool and lounge worked very well. Hotel also has it own shuttle taxi to the San Marco square so visiting beautiful Venice is quite easy. So if you like these kind of big hotels and are ready to pay the Hilton prices in Venice this can be your choice for sure.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 23, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor, it is a pleasure to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.
