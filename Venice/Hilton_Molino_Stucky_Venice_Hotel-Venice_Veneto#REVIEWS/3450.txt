Beautiful old Landmark Building. Spacious room, very personal and friendly service considering this is a over 300 room Hilton ! Nice breakfast room huge buffets,  The hotel is just a few minutes out of the narrow and busy paths of Venice, great for a retreat ! Has a great top roof pool with amazing view over the city and a lounge bar. I didn't manage to eat in one of the two restaurants (closing 10:30pm). You should not miss a visit to nearby FORTUNY, historical and exquisite fabric factory !Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
