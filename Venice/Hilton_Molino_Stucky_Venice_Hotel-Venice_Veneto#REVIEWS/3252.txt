Such a beautiful structure, which you will see from a huge distance. The hotel is not on the main island, which is not a problem at all. There is almost non-stop shuttle boat across, so it is as comfortable as possible. Nice rooms, maybe too small executive lounge, but fantastic staff. Some of them even gave us some extre food from breakfest, which was in a different restaurant. Amazing ! Nothing was a problem. Really worth the money ! Too bad, that the wellness centre is that small and expansive and there is only outdoor pool, which cannot be open during the winter.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 9, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your comments about your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
