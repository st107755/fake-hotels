Hotel is lovely amazing even from the outside and inside. Rooms are beautiful.  Staff are ok didn't eat there so only met a few. Roof top bar fantastic views, very expensive tho. Was nice to get the boat over to main Venice. They charge you on check out for this service and city tax seemed high compared to other cities don't know about other hotels in Venice and May not be set by the hotel. Found a nice restaurant along the front if u turn right out the main doors keep walking past the first few.  Overall fantastic hotel to look at but next time I would book in the centre of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 23, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
