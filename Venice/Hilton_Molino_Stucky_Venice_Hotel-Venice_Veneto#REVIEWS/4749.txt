As amazing as the concept is, a hotel on an island, not alone But this was even better to get to, right next to all the right places, St Marks Square, Zaterre etc the taxi ride (water taxi) is very regular.  The hotel mind blowing, huge, spacious and clean. We had a queen room and they kindly upgraded us, the room was huge!!! had a kitchenette, living area, a gianormous bathroom. the decor of the whole place has a unique character! The experience was beyond beliveable the breakfast- true hilton class! I am in awe of this place, having stayed in the hiltons in the US, Middle east and UK, this is by far the best ever! strongly recommended!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for the very positive review.

We are looking forward to welcoming you soon again here at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
