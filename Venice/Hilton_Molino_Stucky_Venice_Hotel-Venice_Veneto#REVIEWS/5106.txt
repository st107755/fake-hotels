We spent one day at the Hilton in Venezia and it was perfect! The hotel has its own free shuttle boat and it is very easy to get access to the "main" island of Venezia. It was also very simple to get to/from the airport as well - take the Alilaguna Linea Blu and the boat stops right in front of the hotel.   The hotel staff was nice and we really enjoyed the upgrade - even though we did not have to time to explore the really nice room they got for us (a pity) - but maybe next time... :)Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 3, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience.
