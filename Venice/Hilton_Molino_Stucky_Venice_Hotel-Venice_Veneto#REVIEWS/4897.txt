We stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise and I think it is the perfect place to stay.  You're actully across the water from Venice, but it only take a couple minutes by the  free private water taxi to cross. The views from the hotel are amazing and you get a quiet version of beauty.  The hotel has a nice cocktail time for Hilton members and a beautiful breakfast in the courtyard.  We had drinks upstairs at a lounge that overlooked the water and Venice, it was so nice.  The water taxi can take you right to the dock, I would book the taxi with others on your ship to save a bit. There are many restaurants and a local store to get snacks and great prices on wine, like $5 for Santa Margarita pinot grigio, a good idea before you board your ship.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
