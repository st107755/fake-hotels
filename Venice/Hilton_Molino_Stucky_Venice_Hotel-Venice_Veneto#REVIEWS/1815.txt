Stayed 3 nights in an Executive room.  The hotel and room were great.  We particularly liked the rooftop pool and bar, these being the main reasons we chose this hotel.  We also enjoyed bring able to retreat from the busy main areas of Venice in the evening. The hotel shuttle was very useful too.  Small areas for improvement - there is no information folder in the room. The Hotel info on the TV was inadequate.   The toiletries were not topped up on day 2, and the coffee tray not topped up on day 3.  There was no free water.  These are minor points, but this is a 5* hotel. I ended up calling reception 3 times to ask where breakfast was served and for replenishment of supplies.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your positive experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
