My husband and I have just returned from an amazing trip to Beautiful Venice - we stayed at the Hotel Stucky which is based across the water from the main hub of Venice - complimentary boat from the hotel to and from made access easy - in fact staying just a short distance away meant we had amazing views from their roof top terrace (Bellini at sunset is a must) hotel staff were polite - breakfast was excellent - room was a good size and clean - can't fault this 4* hotel - if you are from the U.K. be prepared for the Brexit effect on your euros -  the cost of eating / drinking in the hotel restaurants was eye watering - (  £20 for a gin and tonic ) there are  better value options off the main streets in Venice - however I would  def recommend this hotel and happily stay here…Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
