Stayed only one night returning from a cruise and flying out next day. Had visited Venice several days earlier before cruise departure and stayed near St. Mark's Square. The rooms were beautiful and food very good. Stayed in Room 712 which was directly underneath dining area. Heard a lot of chairs moving around but noise died down later in evening. But felt isolated & removed. Disliked having to take a water taxi or bus, so I enjoyed staying closer to St. Mark's Square area and could walk to many sites.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely, Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
