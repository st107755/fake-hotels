This Hotel is perfect in every way.... The location and views from the Hilton Stucky were superb.  The rooms clean and comfortable.The staff was friendly and concierge were so helpful.  The free water taxi always ran on time. The gift shop had the best prices of Murano  Glass I had found.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
