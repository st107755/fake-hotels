I stayed here for 2 nights recently. As with any Hilton , the room was spotless and the check in seamless. I stayed here as I was going on a cruise which departed directly opposite the hotel and the accommodation was included in the cost of the cruise package , otherwise I probably would have stayed at the Gritti Palace  . You are away from the heart of Venice and are reliant on the shuttle service , however if you can time them to suit your needs ( which is not hard ) , the hotel represents very good value. The rooms are very spacious and whilst the rooftop pool is great , given the size of the hotel , you would have to be very lucky to get a spot there. That did not bother us as we were there to see the sights rather than lay around a pool.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property and enjoyed its location. While it is true that we are not located right in the Venice centre, we are only a few minutes away from the city and very close to the main attractions.  With regards to our pool on the rooftop terrace, may I take this opportunity to confirm that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient building and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which have certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal.  I trust you had a pleasant cruise and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
