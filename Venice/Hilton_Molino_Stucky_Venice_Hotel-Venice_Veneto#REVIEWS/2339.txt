This hotel is fantastic. The hotel staff goes above and beyond to ensure all guests are happy. Mr. Franck Giacometti the rooms manager was the most helpful service person we have ever encountered. The boat service from the hotel to St. Marks is a pleasurable experience, and the schedule is very convenient. The rooms are clean. When returning to Venice, I will return to this hotel!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 8, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for posting your positiove comments on TripAdvisor.
