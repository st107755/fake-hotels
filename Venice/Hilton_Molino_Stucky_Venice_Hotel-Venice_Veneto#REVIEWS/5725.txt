The Motel Architecture is truly outstanding.  The views from the roofto swimming pool is georgeous, 360 panaramic.  The motel is located on a waterway thorofare and is accessed by courtesy boat every thirty minutes which we found convinient. The motel was very clean with premium interior materials.  We were not there on business but view the meeting spaces which are enormous and attractive. We also enjoyed the very elaborate buffet full breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
