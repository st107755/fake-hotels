This hotel came recommend from a friend who stayed a few years prior and I couldn't have been more please. Everything is very clean and new. Everything you expect from a Hilton property.   When I initially checked in my room view was not what I thought I had book. I was informed that I booked a lagoon view and not a "view" room. I went downstairs as it was my first time in Venice and being able to see it's beauty all the time was very important to me. The front desk person was very helpful and moved my room up closer to have a better view.   I appreciated being across from the main part of Venice being able to escape when needed. We utilized the public boat bus that has a stop a few steps away from the hotel. We never even used the hotel shuttle.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 12, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
