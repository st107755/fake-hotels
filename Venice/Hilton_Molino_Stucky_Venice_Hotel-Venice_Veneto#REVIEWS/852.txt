I stayed here in Nov 2017.  Was there again, a week ago during Carnivale.  I love the location.  A simple 10 minute boat ride to the busy, but beautiful, Piaza San Marco. Strolling the promenade near the hotel, day or night, is a look into a quiet residential district of Venice.  The views are superb.   The hotel is large and the remodel of the old pasta factory is a marvel.  Beautiful rooms, wonderfully appointed.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 19, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us and for choosing us again.
