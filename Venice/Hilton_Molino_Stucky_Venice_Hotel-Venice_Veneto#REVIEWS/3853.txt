The hotel is in stunning location with a fantastic view.  The roof bar is a destination in itself, the staff were always friendly and accommodating.  However, for a 5 star hotel it did miss the mark, the rooms were simple and small (stayed twice with the same experience).  The shower was worse than I would expect in a budget hotel and the bathroom supplies were enough for one person not two.  So it did feel like a business travellers hotel rather than a destination.  I don't stay in 5 star hotels that often but my past experiences have had the wow factor which was sadly missing.  It feels like due to the location they don't try that hard.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
