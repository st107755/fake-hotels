We stay in this hotel 3 nights. Room was perfect with nice view on all the Venice. Good shuttle boat service. Only what was not fair was the fact that we paid for the executive room so we had access to executive lounge for breakfast with very limited selection. So we had to pay additional 30â‚¬ per person and day for normal breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
