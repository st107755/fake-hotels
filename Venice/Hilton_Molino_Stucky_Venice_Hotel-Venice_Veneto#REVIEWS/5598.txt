Travelled with my family of 6 which included teenagers and young children.  This hotel is terrific in every way.  Within minutes of st. mark's square but with the best views of venice in my opinion.  The rooftop deck is breathtaking and the pool is just awesome and a big hit with the family.  A perfect way to relax everyday and take in the panorama of venice.  Great helpful staff.  We ate in Venice everyday so I can't comment on the restaurant except I understood it was quiet good.  .The buffet breakfast was excellent with very many choices in a comfortable setting.   Very good fitness club as well.  I was surprised by some of the negative reviews but frankly, eyes wide open, this is an expensive hotel in terms of food and drink and if you cant afford it then would recommendâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
