We stayed 5 nights here at the Hilton Molino Stucky the view from the pool is great, room we stayed in was 7th floor looking towards Santa Maria della Salute church also we enjoyed views in mornings of cruise ships passing by.  The room we stayed, was a twin, plenty of room, great high ceilings light and airy.  Downside I would say is the Kaldewei range small bath with no shower screen/curtain.  The room has no ironing board/iron but found a small room that had them near to ice machine this was a bit of a walk from our room on 3rd floor we may have a closer one but don't mind the walk. First few days we had room service for bucket of ice. Breakfast was great but can be busy due to business men/women and cruise pre/post passengers. English is widely spoken but couple of staffâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
