The hotel is nice from the outside but inside could use some work. Very friendly and helpful staff, but quality of exec lounge, breakfast foods and air conditioning lacking during such a humid time. The complimentary water shuttle to and from main part of Venice is frequent and helpful. The concierge was also helpful for directions and booking activities. Not sure if we would stay here again due to overall comfort.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing with us your comments about your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
