Disappointed..we have stayed at the Stucky previously but breakfast and service were no better than a Hilton airport hotel and certainly not 5 star... Cold eggs, cold coffee and no menu available for choosing freshly cooked food. However as always beautiful room, spotless with the wonderful roof top pool. Overall poor value this time around.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
