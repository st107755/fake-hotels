This is the second trip we have stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky and it remains one of our favorite hotels -- a historic Venetian building, beautifully repurposed into a luxury hotel, combining all the great features of a Hilton property (especially HHonors upgrades) with genuine local ambience.  There is a hotel shuttle, but we also found the nearby vaporetto stop (Sacca Fisola) to be very convenient, especially after we realized that the boats go in a circle and it can be quicker to go up the Grand Canal to get home!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for sharing your experience on TripAdvisor.
