Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice hotel. You arrive by boat and it is 20m to the hotel entrance. The strange thing is that there are column and beams everywhere - I had a column in my room. The rooms are very comfortable and the service is very good. We only ate breakfast and a snack dinner before departing for the airport so I wouldn't want to comment on the food.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 29, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky but on the other hand regret you did not appreciate the architecture and the restoration of this impressive old building.The project was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture which are usually very appreciated by our guests. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
