I have stayed in many Hilton hotels and this is one of the best!  It is across the canal from San Marco in Venice with free water shuttle service.  This hotel is relatively new and has all the amenities.  Service was outstanding, room was spotless, restaurants were great, and the rooftop bar and pool have the best view in Venice.  On check-in, I requested a room with a water view even if it required an upgrade.  It was graciously done at no extra cost.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
