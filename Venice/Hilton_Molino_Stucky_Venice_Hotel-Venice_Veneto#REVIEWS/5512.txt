My husband and I spent a weekend in Venice and stayed at this hotel. We got a great last minute rate from hotwire. this is a true four star hotel with unexpected luxury for a European hotel. The rooms were large, bathrooms were fantastic and all the amenities of an American hotel. The regular shuttle boat service to the main island was easy and convenient.  We had made a reservation for our final night in a less expensive hotel near the train station but decided to go back to the Hilton after seeing the dismal accommodations. The rooftop pool and bar are a great place to hang out and relax. if I ever get back to Venice I will be staying at this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
