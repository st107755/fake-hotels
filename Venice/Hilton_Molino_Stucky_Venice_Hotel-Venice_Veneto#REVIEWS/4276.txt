Ok spacious rooms. Fading carpets. Stunning rooftop views though pool is far too cold and should be heated to 29 Celsius. Mediocre food and service at skyline resto. Somewhat remote location requires vaporetto transfer to get anywhere. Excellent concierge service especially Elena.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
