We stayed at the Hilton with our 3 year old daughter in August. The Hotel is on the Opposite island to Venice central and there is a Hilton ferry service costing EUR 3 per person per stay, yes the whole of your stay which takes you to the centre; runs every 45mins to St Marks so very good. The Hotel itself is BIG, the pool has the best views over Venice but is cold until the sun is up so 1pm is the time in August to take a dip. Good restaurants and the Nutella bar is great for a cheeky treat. Not much to do on the island where the Hotel is so 90% of the time you will go to St Marks.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on Hilton Molino Stucky.
