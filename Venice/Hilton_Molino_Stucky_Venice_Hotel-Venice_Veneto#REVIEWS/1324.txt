We were in the Venice area for some Italian basketball games that were in Mestre, but we spent one night at this hotel in Venice and it was fantastic. The view from our room was unbelievable and the breakfast and other snacks available in the Executive Lounge were very good, too. The water taxi was easy to use as well. Plus the concierge arranged a trip for us to Murano that was terrific as well. Venice is very crowded and it was nice staying on the quieter section where the hotel is located. The room was spotless and spacious as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.
