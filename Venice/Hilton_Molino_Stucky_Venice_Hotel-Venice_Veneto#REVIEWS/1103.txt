The hotel itself is in a great location on Guidecca away from the crowds in the centre but easily accessible by the shuttle service from outside the hotel. Stayed in an executive room without the canal view which was very quiet and comfortable. Unfortunately the pool was unavailable for 2 full days due to a faulty pump which was a major disappointment. The executive lounge was quite crowded in the early evenings and there sometimes weren't enough seats for those wishing to use the facility.
