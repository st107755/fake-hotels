The hotel is located in a beautiful restored mill on an island with some transport facilities. We went their as a family during one of the hottest periods of the year. The family suite is very spacious and clean. Breakfast was plentiful and of good quality. Every member of staff has been very friendly to us and is underlying the high standard of the hotel. The roof pool is an absolute highlight and the roof bar to be recommended for the moments without the kids. Given the high prices in Venice it is worth to book rooms with the access to the Executive lounge. The shuttle works timely and is compensating very well for the fact that the hotel is not on the main Island. We definitely will come back to enjoy this hotel and Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
