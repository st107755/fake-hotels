Having used Hilton's worldwide I must say this easily makes my top 3.  Spectacular roof top views of Venice, wonderful Executive Club and spacious rooms. The staff is outstanding.  We took the airport taxi boat directly to and from their dock.  In addition, they operate their own boat (a restored yacht) to and from the pier near St. Mark's square.  After full days of walking Venice or taking the ferry to other islands like Burano and Murano getting back to the hotel and relaxing on the rooftop with its views was wonderfulRead moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
