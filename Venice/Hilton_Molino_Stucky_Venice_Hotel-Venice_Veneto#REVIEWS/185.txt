Beautiful hotel.   Excellent service.    Rooftop pool with unsurpassed views of the city.  Arrived via public transportation from cruise port for 8e+3 for luggage.   Has private shuttle/ferry to San Marco.  Returned to airport by private water taxi arranged by concierge.   Only complaint is I thought the food and drinks at the hotel were overpriced.
