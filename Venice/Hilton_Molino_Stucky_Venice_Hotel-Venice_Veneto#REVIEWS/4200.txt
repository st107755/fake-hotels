Hilton Stucky was so much fun.  It is a huge, beautiful building located on the island right across from Venice.  The hotel has a free shuttle boat service that is easy to catch and only a 5-10 minute ride back and forth between islands. The rooftop pool is gorgeous and a great place to watch the sunset. Hotel Stucky breakfast was excellent with good service and is free to Hilton platinum(?) members. The room my husband and I stayed in was unique and lovely. The ceilings are high with wooden plank beams, and a small bottle of Bellini with chocolates awaits guests. The bathroom is really nothing spectacular.  I wish the shower would have been better, but it sufficed. I recommend this hotel!  Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
