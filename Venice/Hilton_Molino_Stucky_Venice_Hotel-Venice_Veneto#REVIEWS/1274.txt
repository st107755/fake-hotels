Such an impressive hotel.  We booked a family king suite for our family of four.  The room was extremely spacious with a King bed in the main room and in the large lounge room there was a large comfortable sofa bed for our teenagers.  There is a pool on the rooftop and the view over Venice is stunning.  The restoration of this building is incredible and each space is breathtaking.  The breakfast is amazing and being able to order breakfast to your liking.  I ordered porridge each morning and it was lovely.  The cappuccinos are flowing and staff are extremely helpful.  We want to thank Gloria in the breakfast room for her happy personality and her enthusiasm for ensuring guests were happy was outstanding and extremely noticeable.  We looked forward to our breakfast each morning.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 20, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing our hotel for your family stay in Venice.
