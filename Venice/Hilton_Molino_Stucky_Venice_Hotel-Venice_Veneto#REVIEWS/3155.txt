This is no ordinary. Hilton, its a beautifully. Converted flour mill. Perfectly located you are away from the hussle and bussel of venice but the complimentary ferry allows you to take part as and when you would like.  A variety of gorgeous restaurants and bars. I recommend the rooftop bar and terrace restaurant.  Well equipped gym and stunning rooftop pool.  The hotel has gorgeous views. Each room is individual but well worth paying for a room with a water view.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky  We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.
