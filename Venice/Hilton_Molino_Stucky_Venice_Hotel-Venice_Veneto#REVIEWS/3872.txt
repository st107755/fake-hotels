This hotel is a little pricey, but it is worth it. Absolutely excellent stay, they provide complimentary transportation at all times from the hotel to Piazza San Marco. The concierge was friendly and helpful. Clean rooms, spacious, etc. The best part is Bacaromi restaurant. Giuseppe will personally see to it that you have a great time and a great meal.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
