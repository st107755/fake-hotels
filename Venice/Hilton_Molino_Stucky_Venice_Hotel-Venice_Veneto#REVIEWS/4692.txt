Stayed over New Year 2012/13 on Hhonors Points and was given a suite facing Venice "Downtown". You can't ask for more.  Reliable, regular and complimentary boat shuttle to Zatare and S. Marco off-sets the disadvantage being situated a little bit on the side of the action. 6th floor executive lounge was closed. The one in the lobby was somewhat small.  Free internet - vouchers were handed out daily. There are less complicated ways to deal with this, I think. Otherwise excellent service as to be expected by Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
