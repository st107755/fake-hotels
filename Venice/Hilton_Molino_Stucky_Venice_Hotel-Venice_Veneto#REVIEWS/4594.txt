We used Hilton points to stay one night at the Hilton Molino Stucky before leaving on a cruise. We were shocked when were were given the Tower Suite, overlooking all of Venice. We had a living and dining room with Murano chandeliers and two bathrooms. As we watched boats and ships leave the canal, we were in heaven for a night. We took the hotel shuttle over to San Marco for dinner, then walked to the Zattere dock for the return trip. The buffet breakfast was sumptious and well worth the cost. The staff were all accomodating.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
