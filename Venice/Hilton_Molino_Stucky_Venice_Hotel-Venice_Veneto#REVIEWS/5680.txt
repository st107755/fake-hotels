This hotel requires a shuttle ride to Guidecca Island, Make sure to keep a schedule with you at all times and plan your trips around the shuttle boat, there is no way to get to the hotel without hiring a private boat.  However, the shuttles do run on time and provide a comfortable ride during transport.  The hotel itself was beautiful and amazing and we enjoyed the restaurant as well.  I traveled with my 14yr. old daughter and she enjoyed the experience over all the hotels we visited during our trip to Italy.  The Skyline Rooftop bar provides a magical and breathtaking view of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
