Venice was one of the stops on our around-the-world honeymoon trip (US-Asia-Europe).  We booked 2 nights at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel based on all the positive reviews we read.  We noted that we are on our honeymoon in our comments, and we are also Hhonors Gold.  Before our arrival, we did receive a generic welcome email from Annimi Schifferegger, but that's where the customer service ended.  When we checked in, there was no mention about our honeymoon.  When I brought it up, the front desk clerk just said, "oh, that's nice."  We were "upgraded" to the executive floor with no view, but the lounge was relocated to the lobby level, so there was really no advantage to staying on that floor.  There was no welcome amenity or greeting or anything whatsoever inside the roomâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
