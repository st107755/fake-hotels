I stayed here for the second time in March 2014 and loved the experience almost as much as the first time. The hotel itself is excellent, with superb rooms, a lovely feeling of grandeur when walking around the place and an excellent breakfast; it is the location on an island just off Venice which sets it apart from any other hotel. It was great to stand waiting for the hotel's free ferry and watching the boats and larger ferries going to and fro on the glistening water. If I ever visited Venice again then I'd certainly stay there - but the cost is more than most but worth it! And I loved the huge beds.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
