My brother and I stayed here in March 08 and we found the property to be absolutely beautiful. The staff were professional and our room was very modern and looked out over the property through a huge floor to ceiling window. The window was almost the entire bedroom wall, pretty cool. The room was adequate in size with a nice bathroom and was very comfortable. The big flat screen was great for relaxing after lots of walking. The only thing we did not like was the time it took to get to the main part of Venice. Though they did have a private, complementary boat it still took way longer to get back and forth than if we had stayed somewhere else.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare
