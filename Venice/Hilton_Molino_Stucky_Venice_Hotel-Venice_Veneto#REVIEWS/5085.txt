Bottomline, it is a Hilton and you will get the service and quality you expect.  However, way too expensive for what you get.  And, if you are a business traveller, the business center was closed Sat and Sun while we were there.  The free boat shuttle across the canal is a nice, albeit mandatory, touch.  The rooms are interesting, in that they attempt to meld modern with classic.  This would be THE place to stay if it didn't feel like you were getting nickle and dimed for everything. 10 Euros for a bottle of water, seriously?!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
