Nice hotel, booked through our cruise line. Across the canal from Venice proper, but there is a free convenient shuttle to San Marco.  Hotel room large by European standards.  The only flaw was that the airconditioning did not work the first 2 days and evening-very warm and difficult to sleep. There are signs not to leave the windows open due to mosquitos and other insects.  Comfortable bed, great shower.  Very nice rooftop bar-however, they do not serve ANY food up there. Great views and drinks, but you need to go elsewhere to eat.  Very large and varied breakfast buffet, nioce choices and good food.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 15, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive feedback on TripAdvisor.
