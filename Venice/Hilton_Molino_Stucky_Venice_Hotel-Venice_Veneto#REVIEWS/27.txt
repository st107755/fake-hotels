I booked this hotel because of the building's architecture and the rooftop pool. Although the pool was advertised as open but with limited hours, it was closed.  We were offered free breakfasts when we complained but it wasn't made clear it was only for the buffet and I was charged for eating off the a la carte menu.  The room was nice but frankly, if you are paying serious money, there are better places to stay in Venice. The exterior is far more interesting than the interior.  While the renovation retained the original wooden pillars, there is a lot of soulless marble. The view from the Skyline Terrace is stunning but you don't have to stay in the hotel to access it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2020HelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review on Tripadvisor.
