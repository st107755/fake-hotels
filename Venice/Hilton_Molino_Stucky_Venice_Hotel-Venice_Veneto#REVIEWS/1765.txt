This is a magnificent Hilton property. Booked a suite for myself and friends. Even the sofa bed was comfortable. The views from the rooftop pool and bars were. breathtaking. The pool was ice cold though. Very expensive drinks. Even coffee was 8 euros! I would give 5 stars except for what happened at the front desk. My sister had accidentally torn a 50 euro bill. She asked for tape and then after taping it in front of the woman she asked if they would change it (we were leaving Italy that day).  The woman said yes but then said the manager said no because it was torn. We are silver HH members and own in HGVC. My sister and I were embarrassed at the front desk. Not to worry. It was accepted in payment for breakfast a short time later.
