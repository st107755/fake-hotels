Booked a family suite and upon arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful view suite.  They had thoughtfully already made up a roll away bed for our daughter in the new room.  The hotel is very nice and the staff is great.  I received prompt and helpful responses to several email questions leading up our visit.  (Boo to the Hilton website, which makes finding the email for a specific hotel a google exercise.)  The Giudecca is a wonderful alternative to the frenzy of much of Venice. Only aspects of the hotel for improvement on our visit would be better wine at the Executive Lounge cocktail hour and not getting turned away from the shuttle boat because it wasn’t large enough for everyone.

We are pleased to read that you had a pleasant stay with us and that you enjoyed the hotel services and facilities. We are sorry that you were not able to catch the Shuttle boat on one day; the capacity is of 39 seats and we usually suggest our guest to be on the dock at least five minutes before leaving hour. May I take this opportunity to inform  that the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. Thank you for staying at Hilton Molino Stucky and we all look forward to welcoming you back soon in Venice. Best regards  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
