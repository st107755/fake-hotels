The staff were helpful particularly when we asked to swap rooms at check in for one with a seperate shower. Room was OK, nothing special, good bed. This is a large hotel for the area and it was a hike to get from one side to the other. The ferry services was really useful to get over to the main action. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance and there was a great pizza bar close by (5-10 minute walk) for takeaway pizza in the room! The pool is great with spectacular views. The executive lounge was OK with views out to the sea, food didn't seem to be true Italian and seemed to try and please all and possibly disappointed most - would have been happy with bar type snacks and good antipasto for evening canap√©s.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
