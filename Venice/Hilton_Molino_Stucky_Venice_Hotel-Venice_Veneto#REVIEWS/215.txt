I am a Hilton diamond member so do expect a bit more.  The Molino Stucky is a beautiful building...a converted grist mill.  Lovely place with roof top pool (an bar but no food) overlooking beautiful vistas.  Go early...it closes before sunset ;-(.  I was upgraded to a gorgeous suite right on the water. I thought, lucky me! Unfortunately not appointed well and service was totally lacking!  Executive lounge was overcrowded.  Breakfast was terribly loud with marginal food quality and inconsistent service (one waitress was amazing...the others, not so much!).  Don't go late or they will be out of many items! Housekeeping was a problem...couldn't get extra towels (It was 90 degree out so took several showers a day).  Even when I did get extra towels, housekeeping would removed them! â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website, we are sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at our hotel.
