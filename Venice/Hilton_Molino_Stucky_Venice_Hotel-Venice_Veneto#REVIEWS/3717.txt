I think this hotel offers a great base for exploring Venice, particularly as it's on an island opposite the main sights. This means it is a nice oasis away from the madness!

It's never going to be a cheap gig, but the hotel is very good value for money.   Regular boat shuttles across to St Marks Square worked fine. And despite may scare stories, we found restaurants right on the canal, just a short walk away from the square, to be pretty fair.   Back to the island the hotel sits on, Giudecca, it's actually a lovely little place to explore on its own. There are some really nice restaurants and coffee shops along the front.
