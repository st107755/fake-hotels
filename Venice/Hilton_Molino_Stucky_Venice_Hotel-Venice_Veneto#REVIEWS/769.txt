Stayed here last year and had a divine experience. Thought to splurge here versus the Marriott and was disappointed from the entry. Only one person was taking in check-ins. I have a photo with the other blithely ignoring the line.  Upon check-in, we found ourselves in the smaller rooms (not deluxe). Booking.com advertises many room options are still available but the receptionist said they’re full. Malarky! I went down politely twice and felt brushed aside. I hope a manager reaches out. I’m still here and fuming. Room 554.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2018Dear Madame, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
