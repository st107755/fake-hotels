Very impressed with this franchised hotel in Guidecca. The external appearance is stunning, it's beautifully kept, the rooms are relatively small but well appointed.  The location for us was perfect, a 5 min shuttle runs regularly across to Zaterre and onward to St Marks.   The Skyline bar is an absolute must for wine / cocktail lovers, the ambience and views are truly awesome.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
