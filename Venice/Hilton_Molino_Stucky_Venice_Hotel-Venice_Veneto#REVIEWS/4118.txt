Had a executive king room with a view overlooking the canal.   The room was very clean and spacious. The staff were very helpful.  There is a shuttle boat which takes you over to the st marks for free and we found it good - its only a short ride.  The rooftop pool was a little busy but nice.  We had a bottle of prosecco one night on the rooftop bar overlooking the canal which was beautiful but a little pricey!!  With the executive king rooms you get access to their executive section which has the breakfast and also cakes and unlimited drinks through out the day for free - worth the upgrade TBH  Overall it was a lovely hotel and we will be going back again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
