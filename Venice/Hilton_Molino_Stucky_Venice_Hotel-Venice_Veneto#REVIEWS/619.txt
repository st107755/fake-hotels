We usually like to stay in modern luxury hotels, this is not the most modern hotel, however we really appreciated it as an authentic luxury hotel. The breakfast was lovely with many options. There is a large seating area so you do not need to wait long for food.  The only issue we had was the location, we had to take the water shuttle bus/water taxi to the city centre and back to the hotel. The shuttle boat was very nice, no complaints there. However, one evening we were stuck waiting in the rain for our shuttle to arrive. If there is any chance of rain, take an umbrella for your own comfort.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2018Dear Guest,  thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor which will be helpful for every traveler who will be staying with us.
