my Husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was so wonderful that we booked another stay, for one week .We stayed in room 310 and we are hoping we can have the same room again on our next stay.The hotel is Superb, the Staff are all very friendly and helpful in every way.  We came to celebrate the end of my Chemotherapy and we could not have picked a nicer place.  It is Perfect. Good bars and restaurants and the Breakfast is amazing.  So much choice. A very well managed Hotel. We look forward to seeing all the staff again soon.  we are both aged over70 yrs and were made so welcome and looked after beautifully.Thank you so much. The best Hilton Hotel Ever.
