The main reason for not giving 5 stars is that wifi wasnt free (and its 20 euro for 24 hrs which is incredibly expensive!) and for a hotel of this quality you expect it (especially when other Hilton hotels weve stayed at had free wifi). The hotel itself is a stunning building. Our room was great, breakfast offered good variety and the staff were helpful. The rooftop pool and bar offer amazing views and there are 3 restaurants to choose from for dinner. A free boat shuttle service operates to two points on the main Venice island - although we suggest queuing early to return to the hotel as number of passengers is limited and you may be forced to wait 30 - 60 mins for the next boat (depending on schedule) or paying for boat taxi.
