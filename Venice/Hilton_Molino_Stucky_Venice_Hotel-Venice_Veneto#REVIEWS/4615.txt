My wife and I stayed at the Molino Stucky for three nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel staff were lovely, particularly Annimi, for whom nothing was too much trouble. The room was great, breakfast buffet was varied and plentiful and the main public areas were lovely. Shuttle boat to St Marco was great, and staying somewhere other than the main island offered a different experience. The Sky Bar was a fabulous location, but could review its pricing policy to encourage greater usage. One minor grumble was the coffee at breakfast, which was a really low point in an otherwise great breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
