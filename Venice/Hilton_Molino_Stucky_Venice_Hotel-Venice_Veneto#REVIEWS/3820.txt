We arrived by water taxi and was set for success, immediately. The hotel was as grand as could be! The staff was gracious and kind. For 120 Euros they upgraded us with a room on the 6th floor which automatically gave us access to the Executive Lounge! This gave us free snacks, wine and Breakfast! The view from the bar on the top floor is amazing! Our room was clean yet modest with a bedet. This is a great hotel with water taxi that goes to local sites as well as to the Port where our cruise ship was waiting.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
