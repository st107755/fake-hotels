Just returned from a 3 day stay in this amazing hotel. Its huge ! Our room was a good size, big bathroom, tea/coffee facilities. No great view but didn't alter our overall experience. Staff were very helpful  - I needed two sets of documents printed from my emails back home and they assisted. Breakfast was great, huge selection including prosecco. Skyline bar was no more expensive than most places in Venice and has stunning views. We had a lovely few hours there and felt it was worth every penny. Free shuttle bus was a bonus and its nice to be away from the main area in Venice. Location was not a problem, it was an advantage.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for all your positive comments.
