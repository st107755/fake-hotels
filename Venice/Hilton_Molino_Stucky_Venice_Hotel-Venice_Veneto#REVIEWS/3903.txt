This hotel and the staff exceeded our expectations and made for a fantastic three days in Venice.  Enrico at the hotel restaurant went out of his way to make our experience memorable.  The rooftop bar gave great views of Venice.  The view of the canal from the room window gave us many photo opportunities.  I will definitely recommend this property to anyone traveling to the area.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
