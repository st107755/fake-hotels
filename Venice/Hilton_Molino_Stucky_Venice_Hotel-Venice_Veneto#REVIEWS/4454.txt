I stayed 3 nights at the Molino Stucky Venice.  It is located on the island of Giudecca, with a free water shuttle service to and from the main island.  The hotel is in an old renovated flour mill and is a connected series of buildings which can get confusing.  The roof top pool was the highlight affording lovely views over the city.    It was nice not being among all the tourists, however the water shuttle sometimes fills up and there can be a considerable wait.  Overall it was an enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
