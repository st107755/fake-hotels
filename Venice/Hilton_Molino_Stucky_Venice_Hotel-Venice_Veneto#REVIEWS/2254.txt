What a beautiful hotel across from the main island in Venice! It occupies an old and stately looking pasta factory building. It feels like an American hotel, the rooms are large and luxurious. If you are lucky enough, you will have a water view of Venice. They provide an affordable shuttle back and forth to La Piazza San Marco. You can avoid the zoo of tourists if you stay in this lovely, quiet hotel. The service was excellent. The concierge will give you great suggestions for the best restaurants. On our 12 day trip to Italy covering four cities, this hotel provided a luxurious and quiet refuge. Pricey yes, but worth it for a couple of days.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
