Stayed here over the weekend.  Overall I recommend it.  It is a very well run hotel, and very large too.  There were a ton of cruise ship passengers, guessing on either pre or post cruise stays.  The hotel provides a free shuttle into San Marco square which was nice.  I would stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
