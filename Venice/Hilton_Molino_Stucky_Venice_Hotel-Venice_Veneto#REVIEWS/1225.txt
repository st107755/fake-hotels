Loved being on Guidecca in this very grand hotel which faces Venice and is only a short distance by ferry provided by the hotel. It's pricey but worth it. It's a 'grand old dame', very well kept up and attended by staff. Lovely roof top pool with great view of Venice. Highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
