The hotel is really impressive. Outside and inside. The location is also not a problem, there are water shuttle´s often to san Marco and other places. There is no need to come with a water taxi. Needs improvement in the reception desk (you can see that the staff are stressed). That happened during check in, during check out... and they MUST be more polite. As a Hilton Honors member, I wished to have a better service. Rooftop bar is great. No options for snacs, only drinks! Service, chairs, could also be slightly better. (more high top chairs... better service...)  Temperature in the room would come down and my TV did not work even after the technitian come to check it. (hotel offered me a ridiculous €15 discount for this)  Breakfast is really amazing. Staff were top notch!Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 31, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
