We got two beautiful rooms overlooking the water and the city. Fine amenities in the room. The food for Hilton Honors, platinum, was nicely presented and good selections. We got to the hotel before the rooms were ready and relaxed in the members lounge. We passed on the hotel's water taxi service and just used the vaparetto which was only a short walk away and had a convenience schedule. It was a challenge to find the pool, but a beautiful view, if very crowded.  We arranged a private water taxi to the airport which was very fun as well as convenient. Used the public vaparetto from the train station which worked OK, though taking luggage was a bit of a challenge.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 23, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
