This hotel is a good value for money. It is not perfect but the staff is courteous and helpful. Showers are not really clean... Be careful, the visit proposed by the hotel to Murano site to visit the glass factory is not very interesting... You will have the pressure to buy and the people at the Murano plant are here to " make money" ... If you buy Ok otherwise, please leave... The hotel has no personality, the restaurant is offering poor choice... This hotel need a stronger positioning and a better involvement of the staff, including Housekeepers!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
