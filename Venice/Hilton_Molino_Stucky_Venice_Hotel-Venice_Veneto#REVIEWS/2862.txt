We stayed here for two nights.We were promptly greeted upon arrival by the bellman to help us with our luggage. This was very helpful because we arrived early and couldn't check in to our rooms yet. The other couple in our group had requested a non-smoking room but had been given a room that had a distinct cigarette smell. The staff quickly offered two other rooms and escorted our friends to the rooms to see which one they preferred.   The rooms were clean, the toiletries are high quality and the bed/linens were very comfortable. The grounds and the decor are modern and well-kept.  The rooftop pool was just OK. Amazing views, but the water in the pool was murky with visible, black specks floating throughout. The tile around the pool was VERY slippery with both dry and wet feet.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write your review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.  I am pleased that you found the service great all over the hotel, in particular our Bell Boys for which we pride ourselves and it is very kind of you that you would recommend us to other travellers. I do regret you did not find the pool area up to your expectations. However, may I take this opportunity to remind that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient building and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which have certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal. We place great value on your opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.  With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
