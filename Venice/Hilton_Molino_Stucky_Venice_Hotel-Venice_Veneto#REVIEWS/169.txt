This Hilton property is really great.   Service was amazing,  location is away the craziness of inside venice which made for quiet evenings and a nice break.   Water shuttle made it easy to get to main island.  Hilton status made this stay even better.  Water bus from airport dropped us at the door! Will be back again.
