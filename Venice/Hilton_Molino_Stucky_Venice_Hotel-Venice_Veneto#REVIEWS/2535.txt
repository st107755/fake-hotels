Arriving after 30 min by boat from the Marco Polo airport this impressive brick building (former Flower Mill) is very nicely renovated into a big convention hotel.  Although he has no Venetian Flair it has everything you expect from a Hilton. I would have preferred to stay at a cosy Hotel more centrally not having to take the (free) shuttle to San Marco each time. But I guess Americans like to feel like home finding sure Burger and Sandwiches on the Restaurant menu instead of interesting Italian cuisine. As I was here for a convention and think this hotel as a  great location fro a Convention hotel but not for a romantic weekend for couples in Venice.  The breakfast has everything you need and want. Service is polite and friendly.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 9, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your business stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
