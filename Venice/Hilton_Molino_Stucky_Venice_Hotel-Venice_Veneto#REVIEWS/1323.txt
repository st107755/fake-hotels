Lovely hotel away from the crowds but you can be in the hear of Venice in a few minutes courteous of the free water shuttle. Staff were really friendly, food was great and room was lovely. Rooftop pool and bar were amazing - fantastic views and a great place to relax. Staff couldn't have done more for us.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2017Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
