For a Hilton I was probably expecting more, as we have stay in a few over the last couple of years. Let me get this straight, the staff are impeccable, they go out of their way to assist and please the guests to the best they can. The place is a rabbit warren, eventually you will work out where your room is and it will be time to leave. Breakfast, the spread is grand ranks up in the top 10, however, you go to get your hot food and by the time you return to your table its cold.   I finally got myself sorted out with juice and coffee, went to get my food and came back to the table to find the whole table had been cleared, they had a staff change mid breakfast?   Organisational planning? Older buildings are normally pretty much sound proof, not this one.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
