The Hilton Molio Stucky Venice is a wonderful, charmimg hotel in Venice with a continous shuttle to San Marco.  This hotel gets you out of the major crowds of San Marco.  Traveling with my cousins we loved the quiet of the location and the ability of going to the other islands when we wanted.  The hotel is charming, our room had a view of the water and it was comfortable.  We had the Executive Lounge to go to and enjoy snacks and drinks.  It was comfortable and had a unique lay out.  We enjoyed our stay.  The restaurant prices were expensive and we ate mostly at local establishments.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
