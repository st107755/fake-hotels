We have stayed twice in the last couple of years and every time gets better. The staff are terrific, nothing is a problem. The rooms are well equipped as you would expect from a Hilton. As honours club members we enjoy visiting their hotels everywhere we go and the Molino Stucky is probably our favourite. Venice is a place everyone should visit at least once! With a frequent shuttle bus across to the main areas the hotel is perfectly positioned to avoid the worst of the tourist excesses!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
