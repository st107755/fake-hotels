When staying at the Hilton, go direct by water taxi if you have flown in as it could be a long wait to use public transport. Saves time and you settle straight in - its worth the 100 euro.   Reception is one area that the Hilton could improve. Checking in/out can be a problem as limited staff. This may have been due to being low season but this is one area they need to review  The hotel otherwise was fantastic and staff were attentive to any requests. The hotel shuttle service is good and using this in combination with the normal water buses  is no hassle seeing all of Venice. It was nice to withdraw to this hotel after a hectic day checking all the sites and knowing that its all across the canal. If you are lucky and get a front viewing room, you may get to see cruise shipsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2008HelpfulShare
