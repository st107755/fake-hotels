Our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice was amazing! The service is top-notch, the staff are so friendly, attentive, and accommodating! The hotel itself is gorgeous, and we were upgraded to a room overlooking the water. The hotel is very accessible and easy to go back and forth between San Marco and Guidecca. The free shuttle boat they offer is extremely convenient and reliable, runs every 20 minutes punctually and drops you off either at Zattere or San Marco. The breakfast buffet is amazing, the spread is huge and the food is fresh and delicious! We had particulary excellent service from Georigio at the front desk and Andreas in the Executive Lounge! Thank you! We would love to come back, and would highly recommend to anyone!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
