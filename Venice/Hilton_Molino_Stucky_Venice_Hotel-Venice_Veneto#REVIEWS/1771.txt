Stay here when in Venice.  The luxury s 5star and so is the staff.  It is away from the city center but just a quick boat trip to the private dock stop in the center of the city. the boat is free from Hilton and goes back and forth every 15 minutes.  At his is better that staying in the midst of all of the crowds and is a modern hotel.  Breaks aft was complimentary and very substantial .  the views of Venice from our hotel window were breathtaking.  Whether or not you are taking a cruise (port is 5 minute boat trip away), this is the best kept secret in Italy!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 7, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your very positive and kind review on TripAdvisor and sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky with other travellers.
