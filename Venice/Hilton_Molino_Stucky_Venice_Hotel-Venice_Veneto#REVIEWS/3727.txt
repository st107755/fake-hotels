Elegant and classy best describes this hotel. We were upgraded to a junior suite that had a huge bathroom and separate sitting room with a television.  We loved the location on giudecca. Ate dinner each evening in a locals restaurant.  The only negative was the executive lounge. The food was awful!!! Ice cold eggs every morning. The staff were always traveling between the kitchen and the lounge to refill the food. While the staff were pleasant, they could not keep up with replenishing the food. Happy hour was usually ok as long as you were standing at the buffet when they arrived with the small platter of snacks.  I really like this hotel, but they need to improved the service in this lounge.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
