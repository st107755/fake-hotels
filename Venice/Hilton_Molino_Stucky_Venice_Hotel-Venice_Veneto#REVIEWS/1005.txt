Really enjoyed this hotel. Great food and great staff. Easy hotel water shuttle to take you every 30min to the “mainland” of Venice island. We took the public taxi from the airport and it was approx 90min to get here, but worth the 90min because it was almost like a free tour of all the hot spots in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 18, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
