I didnt stay at this hotel my review is based on my experience visiting the rooftop bar and pool.  As a visitor you are able to have a bevvy at the rooftop bar. Prices are same as zeta bar in syd (expect to pay 18€ to pay 22€ for a cocktail). However you are paying for the sunset and the view of Venice. Great lounges and wide range of cocktails, staff speak perfect English.
