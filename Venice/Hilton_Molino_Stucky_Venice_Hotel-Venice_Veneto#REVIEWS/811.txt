Stunning looking hotel at the end of Venice, Guidecca island.. Bit spooky walking by hotel at night time.... Hotel itself was nice...  exec lounge was on ground floor separated from main lounge by glasss walls... Good drinks selection and food snacks ok.. Rooms good size but not as good as one would have expected for the price....Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 5, 2018Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor. We are pleased to read that you liked our hotel and it was kind of you to mention some positive impressions. I would like to take this occasion also to reassure you on the safety; Giudecca, as well as the rest of Venice, is usually safer than other venues and residents and tourists can enjoy evening walks without worries. This said, it is of course wise nowadays and everywhere in the world, to pay attention when walking in crowded places. On the next occasion I would suggest a visit of the Giudecca island, where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
