Great hotel.  Great location with water taxi service options both on hotel and in short walking distance makes the hotel a great option for Venice day trips. Hotel amenities are top notch.  Rooftop lounge provides great vie of Venice, St. Marks and the surrounding areas.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 25, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you  for your positive comments.
