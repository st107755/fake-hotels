Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at this hotel. Was greeted at the dock outside by a very wet porter, but the rain didn't dampen his spirit and he saw us right through check in and up to our room. The hotel was exceptionally clean in every area. The photos explaining the history of the building was a lovely touch. The Concierge couldn't be more helpful and printed off our boarding passes before we left at no charge and with a smile. Would definitely stay here again if I am lucky enough to return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 25, 2013Dear Guest,  thank you for the valuable review you shared with other travellers on the TripAdvisor site. it was good to read your compliments of our services provided and that you appreciated the history of our hotel, a building which dates back to the 19th century that was restored converting the original structure of the old flour mill Molino Stucky.
