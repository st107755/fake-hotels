this hotel is really fantastic. it is located on the other side of the center of town so you need to sail there but there is a shuttle boat. the hotel is just fantastic with great restaurants, a nice roof top pool and great rooms with nice views from the rooms.  the gym and spa is nice and they have a variety of treatments there. thomasRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2015Dear Thomas,   thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review about out hotel.
