We were looking for a hotel close enough to the main Island but not actually on it and an easy access to the cruise terminal.  Molino Stucky was it for us.  Large hotel with dining options and very quiet location. They have a shuttle to the main Island which worked for us and also on the Taxi/bus route. Took the  water bus across the canal to the cruise terminal without hassle.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 24, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
