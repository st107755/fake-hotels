So I must say that we stayed here using points.  We really liked the hotel, food was ok, breakfast good.  The free boat to the main island is easy but after the 3rd day it was a little old and it is expensive or difficult to get to/from the train station. If there is a better way we didn't find it.One person in our party had trouble with noisy neighbor, but that can happen anywhere. The property is cool, the only downside is that there isn't much else on the island. We had a room looking at the canal and Venice-ask for this. It was great watching the cruise ships go by. That said I would stay here again, it was comfortable and the rooms nice. It was worth taking the boat back and forth.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
