I really recommend you spend a little more and reserve a "room with a view". Here really worth having a window for the channel. The hotel is relatively new and was built taking advantage of an old mill - Molino Stucky. The location is good, being out of the mess and offering a shuttle boat to Piazza San Marco. However, as the hotel is crowded at high season, the service is usually not prepared for such overcrowding. The breakfast room can not accommodate all guests, so employees apologize and send you to some other small room.  The feeling in the lobby is that you are in a bus station. At any time of the day there are queues for check in and check out.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
