This is a very large hotel, unlike most in Europe.  There is a large lobby, restaurants, rooftop bar and pool.  Our room was great, a little old world look, but new.  Our kids stayed in a very nice two room family suite in a different building.   We took advantage of the water taxi in front of the hotel that comes every 20 minutes or so to get us to San Marco.  Very convenient.  The pool area was beautiful and had a little bar adjacent to it.    The Sky Bar was hopping busy some evenings and other evenings very quiet.  The most delicious olives were on every table, covered with a napkin so the pigeons wouldn't get them.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us!
