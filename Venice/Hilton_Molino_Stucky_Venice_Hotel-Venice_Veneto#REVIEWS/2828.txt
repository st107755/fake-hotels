Stayed here for 2 nights in June this year with the family, wonderful hotel the suite is great with 2 rooms kitchen and 2 bathrooms. The roof top pool is amazing , great view of Venice but the pool is cold, just what you need after a hot day in Venice The hotel has its own water taxi in and out of Venice which is free.  Only down side is the cost of breakfast, we found a great local bakery for breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 23, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
