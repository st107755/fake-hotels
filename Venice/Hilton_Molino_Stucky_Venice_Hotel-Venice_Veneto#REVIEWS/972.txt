This is a first class hotel, but what really makes this Hilton special are the people working in it.  They are exquisitely polite, friendly, and helpful.  The hotel itself is spacious, very clean and well appointed.  The rooms are quiet, and the beds very comfortable.  There are three restaurants and a rooftop bar with grand views of Venice, especially at night.  We ate dinner in the Rialto Bar and enjoyed attentive service and good food.  We had the  breakfast buffet in the Il Molino and it was a sumptuous combination of European, American and Venetian fare, something for everyone.  The hotel has a Spa that even includes a sauna.  The hotel has its own water taxi service which runs quite frequently back and forth from the hotel to either the San Marco or Zattare water taxiâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2017Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
