We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in June 2014. I booked it through booking.com. The hotel is very authentic as it has been transformed from an old mill. It's a gem in Vencie, because it's outside of the main island but only 5 minutes shuttle boat ride to St Marco Plaza. The only improvement points are, despite being HIlton and 5 star hotel, and despite me telling the staff that it was my husband's birthday no welcoming fruti plate, water anything in the room. Also not regular housekeeping, evening time service in rooms. The check out was a bit hectic at 12pm on Sunday. I expect at this day and age the hotel to implement check out from hotel room via TVs etc, but these are all minor improvements. We'd consider staying there again definitely if we go to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 10, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for your positive feedback.
