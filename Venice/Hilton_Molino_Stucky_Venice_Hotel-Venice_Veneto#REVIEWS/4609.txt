We stayed in this hotel for two nights, and they were just amazing. The hotel location is perfect, the suttle service to San Marco is part of enjoying venice, indeed we like the idea of going and coming back using a shuttle through the water rather than staying in a hotel in the center and keep walking all the time. However it is not far at all. The room is so clean, well decorated, bathroom has good size. The view of the room was charming. Breakfast is perfect, staff are helpful, the price is so fair while i think the hotel in general is one of the best. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who like to have a relax break in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
