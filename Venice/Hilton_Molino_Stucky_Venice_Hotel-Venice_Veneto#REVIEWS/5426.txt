I stayed here with a girlfriend on Hilton points about 3 weeks after they opened. The service was fantastic, the location to die for and the amenities top notch.

(I stayed here longer ago that this setup will let me indicate, but that didn't make it any less amazing)Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
