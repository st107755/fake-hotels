The Molino Stucky is a great hotel. I had high expectations of both Venice and the hotel and fortunately I wasn't disapointed with either.  The hotel is on a seperate island from the the main part of Venicewhich gives it a nice relaxed atmosphere. The hotel shuttle was really good & the water bus stop has a service that runs every 15 mins or so that is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel.   We had an exec room and so we had access to the exec lounge which gives you unlimited soft drinks, tea/coffeee, booze and snacks all day. If you are staying at this Hilton it's really worth checking out the cost differential for an exec room as a beer was 8 euros at the hotel, wine 10 euros a glass and the prices are about the same across the water.  The hotel is huge but still felt differentâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
