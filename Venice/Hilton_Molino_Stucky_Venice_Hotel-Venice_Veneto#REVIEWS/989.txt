The Molino is a great location with an easy shuttle ride to St Mark’s Square. It was nice to get away from all the busyness  of Venice every night. There are several good restaurants down from the hotel on the waterfront. We also picked up cheeses and meats at a nearby deli to eat in our room with a bottle of wine.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
