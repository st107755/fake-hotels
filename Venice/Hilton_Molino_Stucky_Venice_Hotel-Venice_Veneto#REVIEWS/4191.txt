We stayed for 3 nights in September and were impressed with the hotel. It’s on an island off from the hustle and bustle of central venice and is easily accessed via the free shuttle service which was punctual and reliable.   We liked being able to retreat to Guidecca after a day of getting lost in busy Venice, our room was clean and spacious and the hotel staff were polite and courteous.   You can also use the water bus to get there and Palanca station is a 10 minute walk along the promenade. If you’re taking cases this way be warned that there are 2 bridges to cross so you’ll have to be able to haul your cases up and over them.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
