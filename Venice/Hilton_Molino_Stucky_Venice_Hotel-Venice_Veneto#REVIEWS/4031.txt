We stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights prior to an Oceania Cruise. It was wonderful. Our room over looked the Canal and I loved that it had free water bus service back and forth. Our room was very comfortable . The food was great and they had a nice buffet breakfast every morning. This hotel is great if you just want to stroll around for the evening , find a great place to eat dinner along side the canal , and experience Venice. Would definitely stay there again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 28, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
