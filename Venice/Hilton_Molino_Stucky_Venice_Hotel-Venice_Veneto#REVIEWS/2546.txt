The hotel is stunning from outside as it is huge and stately. The rooms are ok with amenities. The decor is mixed and our room has a lovely chandelier with beautiful dark wood ceiling. Service is friendly and helpful. Executive lounge has ok food though scrambled eggs in am are really runny.  View is gorgeous. Beds are comfortable and the room is quiet. Plan your day in advance so you will be on time with the ferry to the rest of Venice. Nice addition to the day...a boat ride!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor.
