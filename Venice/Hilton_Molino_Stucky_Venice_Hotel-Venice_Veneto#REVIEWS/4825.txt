We stayed at the Hilton and was upgraded to a suite b/c it was our honeymoon. The room was BIG with the amenities of a 5 star hotel.  The breakfast was superb complete with champagne, fresh orange juice  and the worlds best chocolate muffins coupled with first class table service.  The location was great- away from the crowds but still accessible to St Marks Square with the free shuttle and the no 2 ferry.  The service was generally polished and professional however no one offered to carry our bags. There was also a charge of 9 euros for 24 hour wifi. Although the price is reasonable there is no reason why it shouldn't be complimentary like many other hotels these days.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting a review about your stay.
