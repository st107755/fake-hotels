Impressive hotel. We arrived tired but excited to finally be visiting Venice. Checking in was efficient and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We had a problem with the room safe which the staff fixed within minutes of being notified. The breakfast was excellent and the transportation was frequent and on time. I had a problem with getting my boarding passes on the last day and the conceirge helped me print them out. A very pleasant experience.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 1, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
