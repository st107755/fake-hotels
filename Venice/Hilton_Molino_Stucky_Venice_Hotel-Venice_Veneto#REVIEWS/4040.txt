Arrival: We did have to wait a good 30 minutes before we got checked in only to find that our room with a view was not available.   Room: We are gold members so we did expect a bit of a decent room however we were stuck in a corner room with no view - and I do mean no view, a brick building was outside our window.  The room was a decent size and had everything needed for a vacation.  One complaint is that in order to use the hair dryer you have to go outside the bathroom (over to the desk) b/c the hair dryer plug doesn't fit anywhere in the bathroom.   Staff:  the staff was very courteous. We used the concierge many times and they were always very helpful arranging even for us to see a pharmacist after hours.  Restaurant: breakfast was a very big buffet, my husband loved it. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and besides some very positive comments, I regret that we did not meet all of your expectations.
