Loved everything about this property!  The fact that it is a restored factory with some interesting history is just the start of the charm. The rooms have been beautifully restored. Loved that we could walk out the door, hop on a complimentary boat and be by St. Mark's Square in five minutes.  Venice can be so confusing map wise and so we could always find our way back to the boat dock!  We are diamond members and thought that the hotel went above and beyond to make us feel special.  We received a room upgrade, free breakfast, spa time and a private retreat with snacks and drinks.  What more could we want? I would recommend this property to all of our friends!  Loved it and the friendly staff.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
