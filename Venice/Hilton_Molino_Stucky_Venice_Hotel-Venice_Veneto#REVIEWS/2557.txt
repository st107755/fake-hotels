Always impeccable public areas, exemplary customer service (she remembered us from our last visit!), stunning views of the city, heavenly beds, quiet rooms and luxury amenities. The executive lounge offers great happy hour options (you may not even be hungry for dinner afterwards!) and the breakfast in their restaurant is a true feast (try the nutella muffins!). The hotel offers a water shuttle to/from the main points on the island, so even though you're slightly removed from the main attractions in Venice, you're still able to easily get there. You can also take the ACTV to/from the parking areas with ease. Don't forget to check out the rooftop pool and bar...what a scene! Can't wait to come back again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2015Dear Guest, thank you  for your positive comments.
