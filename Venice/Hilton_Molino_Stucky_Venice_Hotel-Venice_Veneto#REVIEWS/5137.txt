Massive hotel which is a bit like a maze to find your way round! Wonderful position and unlike some reviewers, the trip across to the main areas of Venice was not a problem for us. Luxury rooms, mine didn't have a canal or lagoon view but was mostly out and & about in any case. Hotel shuttle boat service very welcome, but some so-called sophisticated fellow residents were more like London commuters on a Monday morning elbowing their way onto the Tube. Would be better if they ran separate boats to/from Zattere and San Marco as especially on the way back, if it came from San Marco you usually couldn't get on it. The buffet breakfast is the best I've ever had - I worked in the travel industry for 14 years so that is saying something.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website.
