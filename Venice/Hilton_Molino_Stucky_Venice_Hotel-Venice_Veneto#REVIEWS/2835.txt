The hotel itself is nice enough and what is to be expected with a good lounge etc. Food is expensive (as is most of Venice) but ok. Good first impression.  One massive issue is that The Hilton Stucky is fairly isolated and located on the opposite side of the main canal from main Venice. This means relying on Hotel Shuttle or a 60 euro water taxi. On at least 3 occasions in 2 days (bearing in mind we probably only used it maybe 5-6 times), the shuttle was full which means waiting another hour for the next shuttle and the shuttle captains are exceptionally rude. To add to this, a shuttle fee is included in your room charge.

We are sorry if we did not entirely meet your expectations and will discuss your comments at our next Head of Department meeting for action and review. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I take this opportunity to confirm that besides our shuttle and private water taxie, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / line 2) station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
