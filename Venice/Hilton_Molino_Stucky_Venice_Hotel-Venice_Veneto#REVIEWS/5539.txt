First let me say, I am not sure what other reviewers wanted or need from hotels, especially in a place like Venice.  My husband and I were in Venice just this past weekend, November 2010, and loved every minute of it, a lot due to the Molino Stucky Hilton. We traveled as HHonors Diamond members like many reviewers, but that didn't have anything to do with the hotel, the way we were treated or where the hotel was located. We thoroughly enjoyed taking the FREE (for ALL guests) vaporetto over to Zattere or St. Mark's Square every day, sometimes twice a day, and then relaxing on the short ten minute ride home. It was no different than being anywhere else and having to take a shuttle or taxi. I don't know what people expect, especially from a city WITH NO CARS! It's amazing to meâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
