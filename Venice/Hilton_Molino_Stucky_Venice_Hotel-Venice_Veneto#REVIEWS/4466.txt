Most of you will say that all of Venice is a view but staying at this Hilton allowed us to view Venice with a wonderful view across from the Grand Canal.  We were greeted very warmly by the staff and they answered all of our questions with graciousness.  This Hilton has character as they turned an old mill into the hotel.  There are wood beams and interesting ceilings with windows that open.  You can see the cruise ships go by as they enter and leave Venice which is a site.  There is convenient shuttle service from the hotel to San Marco square and other stops.  But plan accordingly if you are meeting friends as these usually leave on the 1/2 hour.  When going back to Venice will stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
