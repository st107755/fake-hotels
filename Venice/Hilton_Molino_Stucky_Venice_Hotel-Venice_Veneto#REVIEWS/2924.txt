The Molino Stucky is ideally situated for visiting Venice and the views from the hotel bedroom were splendid. The room itself was extremely comfortable and spacious and it was well-furnished. The complimentary shuttle service was very convenient and we used it regularly. Breakfast was reasonable, but the executive lounge was not very welcoming given the odd configuration of the design and the total absence of a view. It felt somewhat claustrophobic and lacking in atmosphere. There was very little to recommend the lounge in fact since the food and drink on offer lacked variety and choice. Overall I would recommend the hotel, primarily for the comfort of our executive bedroom, the views and the location.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 29, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
