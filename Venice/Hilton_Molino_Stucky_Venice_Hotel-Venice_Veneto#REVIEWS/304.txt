As always with Hilton, our stay was wonderful. If you are traveling to Venice this is a fantastic place to stay. We took the public water taxi from the airport to the hotel (I recommend splurging on the private taxi if you can) Hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool and bar were great places to relax and recharge and was likely my favorite part. Our room was quiet and clean. Hotel breakfast was delicious. Always plentiful with many buffet options.  Thank you Hilon Molino Stucky for making our stay in Venice a great one. If we are lucky to return again, we will definitely stay here.  A great service of this hotel is the very frequent water taxi. It was just a quick 10-15 minute ride over to San Marco where we spent most of our time.
