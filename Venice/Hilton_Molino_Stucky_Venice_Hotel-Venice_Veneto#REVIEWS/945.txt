This property is a converted flour mill. I personally LOVED the conversion and was in awe by the huge exposed beams that  ran throughout our room.  I'm a Hilton Diamond Member and was upgraded to a corner suite.  My only regret of the stay was that it wasn't longer so we could have enjoyed more of the property.  We had a beautiful view of Venice and found the water taxi to and from to be very convenient.  We didn't swim in the pool but it was a seriously cool setting.  It was on the roof with an amazing view of Venice.  I look forward to staying at this property again in the future.  The bonuses for being a Hilton Honors Member are very generous at this Property.
