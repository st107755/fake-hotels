Your comments will be shared among our employees.  We are sorry if the location did not entirely meet your expectations. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  The Giudecca island is a quiet and  residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the crowded city centre and is specially appreciated from guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice.   We are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.  Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
