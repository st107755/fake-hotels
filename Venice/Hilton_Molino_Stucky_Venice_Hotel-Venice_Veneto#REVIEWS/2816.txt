Thoroughly enjoyed a pre-cruise night here. Had an executive room with a view so was able to make full use of the executive lounge for meals and drinks, as well as take in the fantastic views of Venice from the bedroom. Hot weather meant the pool area was busy but there was a lively vibe. Would certainly recommend this hotel for a pre or post cruise stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for choosing to stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky before your cruise.
