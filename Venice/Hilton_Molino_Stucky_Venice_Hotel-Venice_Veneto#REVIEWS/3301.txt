Hilton's Molino Stucky in Venice is a beautifully restored brick industrial building.  Our room was beautiful, comfortable and had a gorgeous view.  The staff was friendly, professional, and efficient.  I thought the restaurant prices were high, until I saw prices in central Venice and realized the Molino Stucky was moderately priced.  The hotel provides complimentary boat transfer to central Venice throughout the day and late into the evening.  I highly recommend the Molino Stucky.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 4, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your positive comment on TripAdvisor.
