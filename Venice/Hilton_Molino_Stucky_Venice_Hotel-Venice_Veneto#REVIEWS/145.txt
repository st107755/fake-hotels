The hotel is on a removed smaller Island than on the main island of Venice. The hotel offers free shuttle boat service to the city center, but it takes about 15 minutes each way.  At first those 15 minutes each way doesn't seem too bad, but it is more of a nuisance rather than staying on the main island.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet, but the food was VERY American and extremely repetitive. I expected most of the fare to lean more American, but when I am in the beauty of Venice and their amazing breads, muffins, pastries, etc., I would expect Hilton to offer a more creative and interesting breakfast selection.  I would not stay here again due to the inconvenience and the boring food selections.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2019Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website.
