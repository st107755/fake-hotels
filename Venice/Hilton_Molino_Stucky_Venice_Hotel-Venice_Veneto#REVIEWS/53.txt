This Hilton in our opinion is the best location and place to stay in Venice.  Staff was amazing, rooms are fantastic and the views of the city are incredible.  Restaurants and amenities are awesome. CAUTION:  If you are not familiar with Venice, the logistics getting to the hotel from parking to water taxi to carrying your suitcases a LONG way can be challenging and confusing.  But, it's worth it!  Call ahead to get help getting there.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 20203 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 31, 2020Dear Sir, We are glad that you have enjoyed your stay with us and we thank you for taking the time to leave your review on TripAdvisor.
