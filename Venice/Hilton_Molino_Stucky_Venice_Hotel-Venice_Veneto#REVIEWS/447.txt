Hilton has a regularly scheduled shuttle boat to the main islands which are included in the room fee. They offered free rides to Murano, as well as discount tix to the Dodge Palace, and other museums. Service was good, and their rooftop restaurant offered an excellent view. If you are there in the summer, they also offer a rooftop pool with a fantastic view. Rooms were comfortable, and breakfasts were good.Read moreDate of stay: April 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on the TripAdvisor page.
