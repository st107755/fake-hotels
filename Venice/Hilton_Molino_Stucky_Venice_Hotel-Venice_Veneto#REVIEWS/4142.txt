The best place to stay in Venice!!! Wonderful staff & great location!!  Everyone was very helpful, the shuttle provided everything we needed, view of the Grand Canal was fabulous.  I hope we can go back & stay for longer the next time.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
