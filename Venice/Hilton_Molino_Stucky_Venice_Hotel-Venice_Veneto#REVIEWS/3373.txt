The location and the architecture is simply great, and the staff  was exceptionally friendly and attentive.  A little annoying - the restaurant close to the Lobby- is overexpensive compared to what you get. For instance:The coperto- for 6 Euros each-  just consisted of a few pieces of hard bread . Breakfast - simply great, service team at breakfast - excellent. Rooms are ok, although the electricity ( lamps) remind you that you are in Italy. Free Internet in the room and /or Slippers would have made our stay more than perfect. Anyway- we will come back soon. Congratulation to the Management for running this place so perfectly.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 4, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review and for your nice compliments!
