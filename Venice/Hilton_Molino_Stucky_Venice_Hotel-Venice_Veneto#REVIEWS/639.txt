We have been to Venice many times and the hotel Molino Hilton is incredible. You must arrive by water taxi and the hotel has water taxiâ€™s to take you to 2 stops last being St. marks square. The rooftop bar is a must with 180 degree views of the city. The pool area is like no other a rooftop with 360 degree view of the entire city and cruise port. Restaurant is perfect and staff is very professional.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 2, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your kind comments on TripAdvisor and for your loyalty to Hilton Molino Stucky.
