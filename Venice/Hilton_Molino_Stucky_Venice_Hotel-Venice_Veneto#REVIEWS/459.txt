Loved the Hilton here in Venice. Keys things to note:- there's a great gym- ATM readily available at the hotel- despite it being away from the main part of the city at S Marco. There is a ferry right outside the hotel that runs regularly that will get you there (5-8euro) for the entire stay.- staff are amazing - view from the rooftop is amazing as wellIssues: - non with my stayIt definitely matches it's 5 star rating so overall I would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 12, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
