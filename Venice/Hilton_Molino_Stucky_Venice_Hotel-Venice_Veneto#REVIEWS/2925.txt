We stayed for one night ( 2 days) prior to boarding our cruise ship. I had high expectations before arriving based upon the reviews here, and was not disappointed. We had a lovely family room with separate bedroom and living room with small kitchenette. The room was slightly dark, but where isn't in Venice?? Check in was no problem. We checked in at 10am but room was not ready. However, they gave us free access to the executive lounge for drinks and snacks and our room was ready at 11.30 am. We headed straight out making use of the hotel shuttle boat service straight to St.Marks square. Departures were approx every 20 mins and was a great service. Would definitely stay here again next time in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
