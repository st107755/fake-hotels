Great service as one would expect from Hilton. The rooms were top notch. The breakfast and dining options great. It also had a dedicated ferry service for passengers to get across to the main island at multiple intervals. One of the things we found missing were family related options within the hotel and information on the tours/sights in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 1, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
