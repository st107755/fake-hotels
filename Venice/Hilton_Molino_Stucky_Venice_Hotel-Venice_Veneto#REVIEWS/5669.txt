Hubby and I had 2 nights in Venice. Rained the whole day that we were there...I mean monsooned so not too fun. This hotel was our saving grace as the hotel is beautiful and spacious. First off, the rooms are huge (we got upgraded to an executive room as we are Hilton Gold members) and are decorated beautifully. The furniture is all dark wood and the hotel looks very newly renovated. The breakfast spread (both hot and cold food) was SO good. The executive lounge is in the bar area downstairs (so was not separated like other Hiltons) and was kinda cool because we could get food and drinks in a fun atmosphere vs being in a confined "Executive Lounge" kind of room. There is a spa and fitness center there that is really nice...can't comment on the services as I did not get a spaâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
