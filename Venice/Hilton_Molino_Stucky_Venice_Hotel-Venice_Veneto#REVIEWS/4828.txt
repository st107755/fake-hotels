We stayed for 4nights and were extremely impressed. The rooms were large, and we were upgraded to a suite. The front desk was patient and helpful with getting the wifi and figuring out which vaporetto to take (and how to get a ticket). The only thing that could have been better was access to casual dining. The on-site dining, although delicious, was pricey....sometimes you just want a sandwich. The island and surroundings were limited, so you have to take the free shuttle to Zatarre. The free shuttle was a god-send...we saw so many tourists trying to figure out where to get tickets. The view from the hotel at night on the rooftop was spectacular. Would go back here in a heartbeat!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
