This hotel is beautiful, clean with comfortable beds and bedding and the staff is wonderful. They have a free boat (shuttle) every 30 minutes to St. Marks Square, we will be sure to stay here again. Great bar on the rooftop! Breakfast was very expensive and a bit disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare
