My boyfriend surprised me for New Year with a trip to Venice and we stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights.  We got off the aiport ferry and asked the tourist desk where the Hilton Complimentary taxi was - followed directions right to it.  Check in was great.  We had booked an Executive Room but we were upgraded FOC to a Venice view room (the hotel is on Gieudecca) which was lovely.  Room was spacious although like a sauna.  We reported the air con problem and it was fixed within the hour.  Because we booked the exec room we had access to the exec lounge which was great - aperatifs and different food during the day all free of charge.  We found transportation fine between the hotel and main Venice island - You can either go to St Mark's Square or Zaterre (15 and 5 mins respectively).â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
