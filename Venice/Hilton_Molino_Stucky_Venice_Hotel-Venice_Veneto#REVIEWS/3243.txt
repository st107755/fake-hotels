Stayed here for one memorable night in Venice. What a beautiful hotel. We reserved a regular room but found out when we checked in that we had been upgraded to a suite! The suite was bigger than my apartment! It had a dinning room, a living room, 1 and 1/2 baths and a kitchenette.   I was worried that the hotel being on Giudecca would be inconvenient but with the vaporetto stop nearby and the hotel's shuttle it was not a problem to get anywhere.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 20, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
