My wife and I purposely selected a hotel that was on Giudecca for our last stay.  The goal was to be away from the tourist traffic until we wanted to be in the thick of it.  The hotel service and amenities were excellent.  The staff was courteous and responsive.  The offerings in the executive lounge were adequate.  Some of the other Hiltons I have stayed at have better regional offerings in the evenings.    My one and only complaint is thin walls.  When my neighbours turned on their TV I could hear whatever show they had tuned in to.  Fortunately I did not spend a lot of time in the room, but it was annoying.  I would absolutely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 8, 2018Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
