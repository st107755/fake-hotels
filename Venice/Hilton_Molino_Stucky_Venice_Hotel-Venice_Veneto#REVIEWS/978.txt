Second time at this hotel. Superb location. Fantastic executive facilities. Loved the Nutella crepes for my family. Water taxi couldn’t be better. The wonder of Venice without the crowds. Watch out for mosquitoes when out and about in Venice in July- we were badly bitten in the evenings without spray on.   Have a great time at this hotel - one of my favourites. Please try the sea bass- it’s amazing.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for your loyalty to our hotel.
