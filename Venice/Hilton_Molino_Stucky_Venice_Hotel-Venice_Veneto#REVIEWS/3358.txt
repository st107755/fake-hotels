Three days at this converted flour mill. Five minute launch ride to Vevice proper. Restaurants were excellent with fun staff and good service. Gold member breakfast rather limited. Wick worked well in room and lobby. Front desk staff also great. Only downside is having to get launch over and back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor with regards to your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
