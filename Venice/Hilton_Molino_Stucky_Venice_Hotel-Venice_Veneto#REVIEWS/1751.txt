The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice hotel is a spectacular hotel from which to tour Venice.  The hotel itself is lovely and comfortable.  The rooftop pool has the most spectacular views of any pool I have ever seen. We stayed in an executive club level room with a wonderful view of the canal. We had access to the executive club all day, including a full breakfast, all-day snacks and non-alcoholic drinks, and wine, beer, and hot hors d'ouevres from 5 to 7. We loved being able to return to the hotel and be away from the crowds in Venice while still having a great view of Venice.  The hotel's boat shuttle was very convenient to go to and from St. Mark's square.  Finally, the staff was attentive and pleasant.  If I have occasion to return to Venice I will definitely return to the Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
