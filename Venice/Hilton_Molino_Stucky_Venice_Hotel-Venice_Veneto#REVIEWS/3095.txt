I was looking for a hotel in Venice when my family decided to visit Venice during Easter holiday. I booked this hotel because of good reviews it received. The hotel did not disappoint us. Good location for visiting Venice. Although not in the the busy area of San Marco, but the hotel has regualr shuttle boat and was convenient. A good hotel for family with children. Spacious room, Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was great and worth the 15 euro we paid at check in. In general, we had pleasant stay and good price compared to what we would have paid if we had stayed in San Marco areaRead moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 13, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
