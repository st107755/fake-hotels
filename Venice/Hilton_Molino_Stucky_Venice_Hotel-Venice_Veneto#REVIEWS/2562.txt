Property is in a renovated historical huge building. Still keeping the old Architecture. Despite the fact it is a very large hotel, service was one of the best we received. Our suite was facing the ocean and we could see boats passing by. Practically every staff member was extremely courteous. From Bell Boy, Concierge, reception staff, all restaurant staff to breakfast area were just wonderful. Even though it is inconvenient location. It cost us 120 Euro to go back to the airport by private boat taxi but customer service made up the difference. We will highly recommend and love to come back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive comments on this website.
