We had a lovely room but view was not great. The hotel was smart and modern but some things disappointed e.g., indoor pool very small, breakfast expensive and not of the high standard we are used to at Hilton, rooftop pool was really cold. The biggest disappointment  was what to have been a special evening dinner in their 'posh' restaurant. we were the only customers at 7.00pm, only one other table was occupied after 9.00pm, food was over-priced and we had to send backone of the main courses of 'mixed fish' which was actually a few bits of sickly batter concealing mostly batons of carrot and coutgette. It was removed from our bill which still came to over Â£100 with only two very small glasses of house red wine!Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
