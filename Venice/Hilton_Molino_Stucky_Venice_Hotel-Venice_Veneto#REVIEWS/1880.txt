This hotel was an amazing choice while staying in Venice. It's situated on an old flour mill site and is huge! So much cool history and the island is beautiful. Lots to do at the place and certainly love the Nutella crepe bar in one of the courtyards. We loved the rooftop pool and bar. Views were outstanding. It was also really nice to not stay right in Venice! Much better to look at it from across the channel for sure. A good escape. They have free boat shuttles to Venice and back that run all day so transportation was not an issue. Also. When we flew in we opted to take a private water boat from the airport directly to the hotel. The experience was bucket list for sure. We did the same thing when we left Venice but this time to the train station.  Highly recommend this placeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
