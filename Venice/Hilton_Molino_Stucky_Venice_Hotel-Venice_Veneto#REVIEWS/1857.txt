We were in Venice for 3 night mid August and stayed at this hotel. It was perfect! Well worth every penny for us! Arriving at night and after a long ferry journey we spotted our hotel and it was magical all lit up. Staff were fantastic, so helpful and very nice. The shuttle ferry into Venice was very easy to use and even though they do tell you to avoid busy times they were never that busy when we used them. They were regular and only took 20 mins max to get to St Marks. Breakfast was lovely and had everything anyone could possibly want available.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
