We stayed here to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Everything about the stay was great. It feels like a little bit of a retreat from the main areas of Venice, and if you're OK with that, it's lovely. The room was good sized, comfortable and looked out over Venice. The bed was enormous and the floor was absolutely silent so making for good sleep.  One of the main reasons we chose the Hilton was to get a decent breakfast. This was included in our deal and didn't disappoint. There was a wide selection of food with a local twist.  The service was generally very good and we received some good recommendations from the front desk staff.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
