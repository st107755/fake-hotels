As previously stated in other reviews, this is indeed a little of the beaten path but the location is still convenient with the shuttle service provided by the hotel.  We arrived well before noon due to flying from the states but were told that our room was ready and that we could check in immediately which was unexpected but very much appreciated.  The view from the room was incredible with a panorama of Venice across the waterway.  The happy hour for Hilton Gold members was very nice and usually not very crowded.  This was our second stay here and we would return again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your second stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
