We stayed there a few months ago.  The location was convenient in that it was across the water from St. Marco square, and there was frequent hotel provided water transportation.  The hotel was clean, with a couple of nice restaurants.  Rooms were a little small, but probably better than most in the area.  Very nice roof top pool with great views.  The hotel lobby lounge was a nice place to get breakfast, or a cup of coffee.  The hotel provided water transportation has certain working hours, so you should check their schedule, and plan accordinglyRead moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2013Dear Guest,  thank you  for your positive comments.
