I thought the up charge for a water view was a bit steep ($100 per night) but we're glad we did because it was so much fun watching all the water activity like cruise ships coming and going, water taxis, and private vessels as well.  The breakfast was quite extensive including fresh pressed juices and servers offering many beverage choices including espressos and lattes.  The rooms were quite elegant with high ceilings and warm woods and the staff were very friendly.  (They advertise the free water shuttles to Piazza San Marco, however, we were charged 7 euros PP PN, but worth it in the long run for certain.
