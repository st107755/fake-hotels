Second stay at this hotel and a second great experience. Yes, its a Hilton and yes I stayed on honourspoints, but its still a lovely experience. Rooms are well appointed and exceptionally comfortable. Since my last stay, the executives have obviously been naughty and are now limited to alcohol during 'happy (2) hours'. But drinks, snacks and breakfast are great in the executive lounge all day. We ate at the 'Bacaromi' restaurant which was lovely and competatively priced. The concierge was always helpful and informative. There are plenty of lovely restaurants to walk out to on the island. I know people have commented on the inconvenience of location but we found that the fact the hotel boat drops outside the hotel and you dont have to wander around to get to your hotel a plus. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 9, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
