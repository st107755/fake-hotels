After staying in fairly quaint , basic but lovely accommodation through Italy while travelling , the Hilton was just what we needed to break that up and was simply stunning. Views were breathtaking from both the pool on the roof and the rooms. Waking up to sunrises were phenomenal.  Hotel in general was first class as you would expect for what you pay.  Restaurants at hotel had a lovely menu.   Only real negatives would be the gym - considering size of the hotel it was very small and basic , and the Club Access area (for complimentary snacks and drinks) also fairly simple and not many choices compared to other Hiltons we have been to , and hotels in general.  Constructive feedback only on those couple of things , would definitely recommend to others and would love to return .Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
