One item on my new partners bucket list was a visit to Venice, followed by a journey on The Orient Express! We booked with Jules Verne and chose the Molino Stucky in Venice.  An amazing hotel with great history which is shown all around the hotel. You must go up to The Skylight Bar for a cocktail! Not cheap but wow what views of Venice well worth the cost of the drinks. Breakfast is great, a massive choice.  Gutted we were not there to use the roof top pool, looked great. No executive floor despite being Hilton Honours members but still a fab hotel with lots of character.  Very good shuttle service but was quite busy and quite a few guests from the hotel did not manage to get on the boat sometimes. I would defiantly stay at The Molino Stucky again!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 18, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments.
