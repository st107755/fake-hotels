Really good hotel, service is perfect, breakfast is amazing and has everything for everyone.  The hotel is a bit far out of the way but provides a very convenient free shuttle to San Marco. They'll even call water taxis for you if the shuttle gets too crowded. Having said that, you get standard American service, nothing cute or particularly romantic as you would expect from a 5-star hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to write your review.
