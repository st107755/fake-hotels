Been several times in Venice. Slept in several old, musty, "elegance" and expensive hotels but from now we know that this is the right place to sleep in Venice. It worth for the everyday's trip on the canal to the other side. It's like a hotel:-) comparing to our previius trials. Modern, clean, comfy and very nice. We had an afternoon on the roof pool bar and a pleasant night on the canal side in the terrace restaurant. Both were a great experience and a never forget type of thing. Thanks so much Hilton!!! We love you and promise to come back and recommend to everybody!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 13, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review about our hotel.
