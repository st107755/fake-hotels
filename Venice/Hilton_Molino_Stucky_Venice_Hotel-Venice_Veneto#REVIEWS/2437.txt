Super disappointing to say the least. I know this is a historical hotel and has claimed that many celebrities have visited, but it kinda sucked. The towers were so confusing and the room was like a 4 star room. The pool closed so early and some of the workers were kind of rude. It's hard to access and the direct boat to the hotel (since it's on it's own island thing) is so hidden! We couldn't find it! So disappointing and unorgainsed.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 5, 2016Dear Madame, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
