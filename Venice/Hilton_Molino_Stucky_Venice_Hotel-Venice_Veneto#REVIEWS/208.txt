Honestly, Venice was my least favorite city in Italy but Hilton Molino Stucky changed it this time. If you want to see the real beauty of Venice, this is the best choice. The Venice view from Guidecca and the hotel was beautiful and the front desk staffs that I encountered, especially Francesca, were very nice and helpful. The food quality at the breakfast restaurant and the Executive Lounge was absolutely great. I would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 9, 2019Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
