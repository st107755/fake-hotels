Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. Basics (bed, food, room and quietness) were all good. Staff we very service oriented and multilingual. Great location to get away from the madness of Venice. Taking evening shuttle after an afternoon by the pool is a great way to end the day.  All round a good stay.
