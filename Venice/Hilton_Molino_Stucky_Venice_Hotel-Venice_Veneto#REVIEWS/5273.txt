I stayed here for a week during my honeymoon. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the veiw of Venice is amazing. I can only imagine how beautiful the rooftop pool must be when it is open. Everything about the hotel delivered and the free shuttle across from Guidecca, where the hotel actually sits, to San Marco square was very convenient. We did buy a water bus pass for easier travel to outlying locations. Most of the restaurants and tourist sites are on the main island but there are a few wonderful places to both eat and visit on Guidecca. Make your trip to Venice more than a day trip and stay at the Molino Stuckey!Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 27, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
