We very much enjoyed our stay at the Molino Stucky hotel.  Much more than a standard corporate Hilton, this hotel has some style and the renovation to the old Mill was superb.  We enjoyed being away from the mad crowds on the main islands, and the boat transfers made getting around Venice so easy.  The service too, was far beyond the jaded corporate feel of most Hiltons.  Everyone we met at the hotel was delightful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
