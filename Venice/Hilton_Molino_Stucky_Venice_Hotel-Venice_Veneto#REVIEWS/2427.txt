Access is only possible by the hotel's own shuttle ferry, which is free for residents and runs every 40 minutes but is limited to 39 passengers, or by water taxi, which we did not sample and don't know the charge. At busy times be prepared for a long wait! Accomodation and service are as one expects from a Hilton. Our one complaint was that hot food available at buffet meals had to be put onto ice-cold plates and was not more than luke-warm by the time one sat down to eat it. We wanted to see the new year in from the Sky Bar but it was so crowded and noisy that we finished up admiring the Venetian fireworks from water level.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 7, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice for this New Year start.

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that beside private transportation, there are also very efficient public services: Alilaguna lines stop right in front of the Hotel, with direct connections also  to the Airport and the Cruise Harbour.
