My family and I have stayed at this hotel twice now for about a week each time. This hotel is phenomenal. It is in a great location, just across the channel so there aren't many tourists crowding outside. This hotel continues to amaze me. The hotel employees try their best to meet the needs of the customers. If you're questioning your stay here, PLEASE DO NOT. It is so worth it and you will not regret that choice. I hope you love your stay as much as my family did!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 23, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor and for your loyalty to our brand.
