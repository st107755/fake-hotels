I love the Hilton in Venice.  Elite members will get the best treatment in the chain and it's a remarkably nice place in the area near the residential side.  They have private boat to take you to St. Mark's Square and it's a wonderful daily service.  Elite members will enjoy the executive lounge, which includes a nightly wine hour with appetizers.  I love that they care enough about the kids (and me) to provide soda and ICE (people, who go to Europe will understand how great ice is).  You will also enjoy a breakfast, which can vary greatly in the Hilton chain.  I like the way they treat the road warriors.  Staff is courteous and will try to accommodate your needs--not just provide lip service.  Hilton and HHonors does a great job of making things right and keeping elite membersâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 23, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments about Hilton Molino Stucky and for your loyalty to the Hilton brand.
