The hotel itself was fine although the room service cleaning was poor - lots of dust in the room. What was very disappointing though was the hotel renting out their function room for a 2am disco on Sunday night. This was 3metres from our room and made sleep impossible. The managers obviously didn't really care about me as a guest despite my repeated request for the disco to stop. Another disappointing point is the price of everything - it feels like they are holding you to ransom as you are on an island. A burger of the standard menu is 25EUR and the breakfast 30EUR! Could do better....Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations. Please accept our apologies  if you found the room not up to our standards, we have addressed the issue to the Housekeeper Manager for action and review.  I am sorry that you have found prices to be expensive as we always strive to meet our guestâ€™s expectations and to comply with their requests. We acknowledge your comments though I can also assure you that prices of food and beverage in our bars and restaurants are in line with other 5-stars hotels in Venice. Please accept also our apologies for the music  which was played in our Ballroom to celebrate the end of an important event. I have been informed that the music was lowered but there is no excuse for the fact that  you were not contacted by the Manager on Duty that night. We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance. Sincerely. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
