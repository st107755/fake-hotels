Nice room and breakfast restaurant. Short stay for 2 nights but very memorable one, room service was very good. Location is a bit far from center of tourist attraction. Hotel shuttle is available but long queue and not easy to save seats on return trip back to hotel. The hotel building itself is amazing, huge hotel building and our room was very nice and big. Due to holiday season, onlly very few restaurants nearby hotel were open so dinner mostly at the hotel (hotel food is great, it's just for culinary adventure reason we wished to try local regular restaurant). Will definitely want to go back for next trip!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 5, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
