Pay the extra for a Private Taxi from the airport E100, it's a spectacular entrance to Venice and the Hotel sat on an island opposite Venice. No porter to receive you..? Paid extra for Executive Lounge, nibbles were poor and alcoholic drinks only from 6-8.30, not value for money. Sky Bar was dear but you are in a 5 star establishment. Told the hotel it was my wife's birthday, no cake or complimentary bottle as we received in Rome and Berlin. Maybe we were spoiled by Rome I'm not sure, but Hilton will no longer be my preferred hotel. As for Venice, go off the beaten track look at tripadvisor and go native with the localsRead moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.  I am sorry if you did not completely enjoyed your stay with us and that our Executive Lounge was not up to your expectations. I would like to take this opportunity to inform that guest having access to the Executive Lounge can help themselves to complimentary snacks and drinks throughout the day as well as hot beverages, soft drinks and wines. Per Hilton standards, from 6 PM to 8.30 PM, we are pleased to offer our guests a selection of finger food and appetizers. In regard to the special occasion that brought you to Venice, we always take special care for guests staying with us for a special celebration.

Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
