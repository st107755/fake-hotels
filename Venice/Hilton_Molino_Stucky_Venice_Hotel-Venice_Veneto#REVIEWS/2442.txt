Arriving in this quiet part of Venice was such a relief! From Tronchetto to this place is an easy boat ride and walk. The executive suite room with a view is lovely with old beam ceiling which added such a charm and the view from this room is just stunning! The bathroom and other room amenities are of good standard.  The rooftop pool is very beautiful and a good place to party although it was very crowded when we were there. It is also worth recommending to dine in Aromi restaurant which offered Mediterranean dishes with a twist such as the Bacalao fish balls served in a Martini glass. The dinning area is elegantly decorated and service is very good.  I'll definitely come back the next time I visit Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2016Dear guest,   thank you so much for your positive review.
