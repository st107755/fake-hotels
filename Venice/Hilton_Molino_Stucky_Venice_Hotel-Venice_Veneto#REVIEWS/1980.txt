My wife and I stayed here for two nights and enjoyed every minute in this hotel. I am an HHonors Gold member so were upgraded to an executive room. The room was very large and had a nice view of the laguna separating Giudecca from the main part of Venice. The view from the roof deck and pool is breathtaking, but both are a bit small for the number of people. The breakfast was very good and the service was excellent.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
