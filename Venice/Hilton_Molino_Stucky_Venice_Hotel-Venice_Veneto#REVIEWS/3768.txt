I stayed at this Hotel in February of 2014. It is not on the Grand Canal. However, the location is still great. There are Ferries from the hotel free of charge to where all of the action is. Be sure to get the timetable from the front desk and you are set to go. The location is quite nice as it is still water front but not too far from all of the happenings in Venice.
