We stayed here back in June for our first year wedding anniversary & it was amazing!! Very helpful & friendly staff who couldn't do more for us to feel settled & welcome. The rooms are tastefully decorated & very comfortable,aswell as the bathroom. It's an old flour mill so it's absolutely huge & very well decorated. The food in the restaurant is of high standard & the roof top pool is definitely one of the highlights. Overall would highly recommend this hotel,especially if it is for a romantic getaway. :)Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 25, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for sharing your positive comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
