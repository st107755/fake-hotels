We (2 adults, 1 toddler) stayed in this hotel for 5 days over Easter.  The hotel itself is a short, easy boat ride away from Venice proper, and we loved the fact that it was away from the hustle and bustle of Venice.  Overall, the hotel was very nice, but upon check-in, we were informed that we were 'upgraded', when, in fact, we had booked the 'upgraded' room that included access to the executive lounge.  The staff were not very friendly.  We were also quite disappointed that the lounge was closed, and that a small corner of the lobby was cordoned off to be the 'lounge'.  This was a very small area that was often very crowded with no seating.  We checked out the actual lounge, and there was nothing going on (i.e. it wasn't closed for renovations, at least when we were there). â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2010HelpfulShare
