This hotel is in a great, quiet location across the water from the main city. The rooms are beautiful as is the hotel. It was renovated from an old flour mill and was very well done. They have regular water shuttles between the hotel and St Mark's Square making it very convenient. They even have a Nutella station! Nice spa and fitness facility as well. Rooftop pool is crowded but awesome. View is unbelievable.Great hotel!!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
