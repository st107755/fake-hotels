We booked 10 nights at this hotel as it has a roof top pool and is close to the centre of Venice. When we arrived at the airport the hotel arranged for us to have a boat transfer which was a private boat with a hostess. This included a trip down the Grand Canal, the hostess explained to us the history of Venice, this was excellent and included a bottle of champagne.  When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready so we had meal in the roof top resturant, food was good and as you would expect in Venice expensive. Reception staff and concierge were very good and spoke good English. Occasionally there were queues but this was a very busy hotel.  We booked a king executive room with views of Venice. The room was fantastic and had a lounge area, separate bedroom and bathroom.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
