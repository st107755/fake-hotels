We spent a week there in Dec, 2013 and the service was great. Rooms big and spacious and a nice gym and spa area. Breakfast is great, huge selection and really good staff. The only negative was the room service meals were a bit expensive for what you get.. and the swimming pool was closed for maintenance during our stay. Free water bus service to St Marks square made getting around very easy.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
