The Hilton is an excellent hotel to stay at when visiting Venice.The shuttle service to and from the main island only takes a few minits but really adds to the whole experience.Try to get a canal view as this is spectacular especially at night.The service is first class as you would expect from a Hilton Hotel.The executive lounge is well worth the extra.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
