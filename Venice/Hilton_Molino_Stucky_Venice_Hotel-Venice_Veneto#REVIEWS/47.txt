Located opposite of "Venice", it is a wonderful water shuttle ride away from San Marco, a great starting point for further discovery. The hotel is located in an old pasta / bread factory.

The gym is well equipped.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 6, 2020Dera Guest, thank you very much for leaving your review on TripAdvisor, we are delighted to see that you have appreciated your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky and that you have appreciated many aspects of your stay at our property.
