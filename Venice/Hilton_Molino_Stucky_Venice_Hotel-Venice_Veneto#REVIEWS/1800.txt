Such a beautiful hotel from the moment you walk in. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. They offer a free boat service to St Mark Square which runs all day. The staff were very friendly and the location is perfect. Highly recommended and would definitely staff again, whether it's for business or a weekend away.
