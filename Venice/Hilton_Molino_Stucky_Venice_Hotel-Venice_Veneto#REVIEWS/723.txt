Our party of 3 stayed in the Hilton Molino Stucky for 1 night.  We had connecting rooms, which were well appointed, clean and very comfortable.  The hotel is full of charm and is beautifully situated - walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  They offer a shuttle to the Piazza San Marco area throughout the day.  Check-in was a bit slow - other then that, a wonderful stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 15, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
