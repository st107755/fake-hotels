We got to Venice a day early for a cruise leaving from that port and had a great room with a beautiful view of the canal and St Mark's Square in the distance.  The food was a little expensive but the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen.  Staff was friendly and helpful with assisting us to find transportation.  Our room was terrific too and had windows that opened for fresh air.Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
