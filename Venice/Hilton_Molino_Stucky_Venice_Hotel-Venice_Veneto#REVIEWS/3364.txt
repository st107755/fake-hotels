We stayed in the Hilton for three days in Venice in late September 2013 and could;t have been happier with the stay.  The hotel is simply magnificent, the room we upgraded to looking out over the canal to Venice proper was very nice and the service could not have been better.  My only quibbles were with the 40 person occupancy rule for the shuttle boats and how the loading process could be made less indifferent on the Venice end and the scrambled eggs in the executive breakfast were pretty awful.  But aside from those things, which I would not downgrade the stay for, we were very happy and will stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
