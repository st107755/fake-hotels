We spent 3 days in Venice at the end of a 12n cruise. The hotel has its own boat and a timely schedule.  We were there at high season which always makes Venice a challenge but the hotel location is perfect for such.  It is modern with the amenities but still has the old world charm.  Very spacious room with view of the main waterway.  The staff, though the hotel was full, was friendly and ready to help. First class.  Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2013Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
