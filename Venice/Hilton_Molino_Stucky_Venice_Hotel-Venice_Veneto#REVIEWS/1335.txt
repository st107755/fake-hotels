This was our second time staying at the Hilton Molino Stucky.  We were greeted as a Diamond member and were given an upgrade to an Executive Suite (Room 460).  We had reserved the SkyDine but due to inclement weather it was cancelled.  The hotel informed us the day before and offered a dining reservation in the Aromi restaurant.  It was greatly appreciated and we enjoyed it.  The shuttle to San Marco is well appreciated and the location we felt is perfect.  The only draw back is the executive lounge, for such a great hotel you would expect something more, but it is greatly appreciated.  They offer Diamond members breakfast either in the exec lounge or the restaurant, appreciated !  We recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to have a great stay in Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 29, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel, we are glad that you decided to stay with us again!
