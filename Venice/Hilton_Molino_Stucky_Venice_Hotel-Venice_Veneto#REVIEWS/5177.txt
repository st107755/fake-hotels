We stayed 2 nights post cruise and were extremely pleased.  The service was impeccable.  We had a lovely room on 7 overlooking the canal, but the A/C was not working.  The problem was immediately evaluated and we were transferred to a beautiful suite.  They went above and beyond.  The food was very, very good but quite expensive as it was in all of Venice.  Their service to St. Mark's was wonderful.  Their concierge was prompt & efficient.  The bell boys were so accommodating as was the entire staff.  Enjoy the roof for evening cocktails (however, we had rain the whole time we were there).  The view is fabulous.  The breakfast buffet is served in multiple rooms.  In all, I would stay there again and highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 10, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments.
