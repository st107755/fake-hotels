This is a beautiful facility--built within the original shell of an historic spaghetti factory. Very large but relatively easy to find one's way around. Very professional, helpful staff. Don't miss the views from the rooftop restaurant/bar and swimming pool. Hotel provides an hourly shuttle boat to get to the St. Mark's Square area as well as another, quieter neighbor across the Giudecca Canal.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
