Everything was perfect, we’ve been upgraded to the renovated room and it was absolutly beautiful. The staff was awesome, knowing it was during the acqua alta. They were prompt to keep you updated of the level of water and the public transportation!  Breakfast is great!  The jaccuzzi Wasn’t working but itwas nice to enjoy the rest of the Spa!  Restaurant is a bit expensive but really good! Nothing to say about the perfect location ... because we know that location is KEY when you travel! Can’t wait to come back to that hotel and enjoy Venice even more!
