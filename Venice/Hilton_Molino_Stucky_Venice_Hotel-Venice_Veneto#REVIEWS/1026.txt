From the arrival via taxi (water) to the reception by the fabulous desk personnel, to the beautiful suite with a view of the canal and the discovery of a bidet in the bathroom' everything was fantastic. The front desk staff, especially the concierge was extremely helpful and gracious. The breakfast buffet was expansive and the staff there were very helpful. The best; however, was how beautiful the hotel was decorated with so much Moreno glass and antiques. A definite touch of class in Venice. The shuttle to St Mark's was a real plus. Lots of small but inexpensive places to eat just up the canal from the hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
