We had three couples booked months in advance and ended up with tiny rooms facing brick walls!  The hotel was  a pain and hassle to get to and from the mainland.  Too many people waiting for the water taxis or for the  boat provided by the hotel.  The interior was like any large impersonal hotel and we did not feel like we were in Venice at all.  The upstairs sky lounge had a disgusting lunch buffet ( old lettuce leaves, fruits obviously sitting around too long, etc..).  And, the hotel smelled like sewage in certain areas.  This was my third trip this year to Venice and I will never ever ever stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
