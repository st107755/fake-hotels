Great friendly service, small but richly elegant immaculate very quite room, Wow! factor large marble bathroom. Astounding root top deck- bar and penthouse pool views of Venice at night.  Short private and or public taxi boat ride over to the major squares. Lovely outside terrace on the waterfront restaurant. This is an interesting redone 19th-century ancient 10 story brick factory turned into a very restful beautiful unique hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2018Dear Guest,  It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel and we are very glad that you have enjoyed your stay in Venice.Receiving such nice feedback really motivates us and pushes us to do our best every day to make sure that all our Guests are as happy with our care as you are.
