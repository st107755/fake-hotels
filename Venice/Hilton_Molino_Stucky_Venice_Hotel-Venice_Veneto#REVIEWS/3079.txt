We visited the Hotel Molino Stucky in October 2014 - I must say this is one of the best hotels that I've been in.  From arrival to departure we were looked after superbly.  The Hotel itself is immaculate and the view from the rooftop is one of the best views I've ever seen of Venice. We paid a little extra for a room with a view and this is definitely worth it.  The breakfast is amazing and the staff all so friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  There is a complimentary transfer boat to St Marks Square at regular intervals.  I would certainly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 22, 2015Dear Ms. Daria,   thank you so much for taking the time to leave a positive review about our hotel.
