I love this hotel! Hilton did a great job renovating this old factory into a classy, comfortable hotel. It’s not always easy to find hotels that accommodate a party of three but they were able to prepare our room for my husband, daughter & I. From the moment we entered the hotel, the staff were very friendly & helpful. Even though the hotel is located on Giudecca, we enjoyed being away from the crowds. Our room faced a very quiet courtyard and we slept with our window open which was very pleasant. Go up to the rooftop bar & enjoy the beautiful view of Venice. Vaporettos are easily accessible as well as Hilton’s water taxi.
