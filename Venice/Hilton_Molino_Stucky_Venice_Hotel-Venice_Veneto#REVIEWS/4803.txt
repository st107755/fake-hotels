From my initial interaction with the hotel's website to final checkout, our stay was a wonderful experience!  The website is the best I've seen, especially giving very specific instructions and links to make connections to get there. We actually stayed 2 nights, one before and one after a cruise.  The location is perfect for this, as the hotel is 10 minutes ride from the pier.  Every employee that we encountered was top notch, especially at the front desk and at the Executive Lounge.   We enjoyed wandering around the Giudecca Island and had a quiet lunch at the water's edge.   One note - we usually use points, and can't remember ever having to pay tax.  Here there was a 5 euro charge per person city tax per night.  We didn't mind paying because everything else was great!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.

In regard to the Venice City Tax, this is a city council tax, which was enforced since August 2011 as follows: “As of August 24th 2011 a city tax is due on top of the room rates. The city tax amount is 5 Euro (in high season) or 2.50 Euro (in low season) per person per night, applicable for a maximum of 5 nights. Tax reductions and exemptions as follows: children under 10 years old are exempted, children between 10 to 16 years are entitled to a 50% reduction on the amount.
