The Hilton Molino Stucky is a short vaparetto ride across the way from San Marco, and a great place to stay. We had a small 2-room suite that included the use of the well-stocked lounge (you want that), and had room for us and our three teenagers. The lounge had great foods and drinks throughout the day. Our smallish suite required using the convertible couch and a cot, but the staff put the room back in order forst thing in the AM. Beautiful hotel and setting, and great staff.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2011Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments.
