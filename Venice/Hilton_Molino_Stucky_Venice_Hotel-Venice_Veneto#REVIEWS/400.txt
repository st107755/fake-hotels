Arrived home yesterday from a weekend away with my Wife. Staff are very helpful after a mix up with our reservation they offered us free use of the executive lounge which was appreciated. The hotel is very clean and had a great view of Venice. Shop around for airport transfer we booked a private taxi then private speed boat. We were greeted on arrival and taken to the Hilton, duration 30mins in total and only cost â‚¬35 absolute bargain compared to others we had seen.Read moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 1, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
