A refurbished mill, the renovators took care to preserve the original brick walls, steel beams, and wooden ceilings that give this hotel its particular charm. The rooms are large, clean, with very comfortable beds and free WIFI. The small gym is open 24/7. The breakfast buffet is a literal feast and the food in the lobby bar offers good local and international fare. The staff are warm and incredibly helpful. Only drawbacks were the lack of coffee/tea in the room (there are mini bars) and the location - this hotel is not located on the Grand Canal (but on the outskirts) and on a long and picturesque boardwalk. Therefore, if you're on a business trip with little time to spare, a boat taxi ride will be required if you wish to visit the main sites.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 17, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor. I am glad to hear that you liked the Hilton Molino Stucky and that you appreciated the architecture and restoration of this impressive building. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city while relaxing in a typical residential area away from the crowds. We place great value on your opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager  Read more
