The Molino Stucky is an immense milling edifice transformed into a hotel and a conference center. The interiors are of a standard deign you can find in any hotel; I would have expected something more special in this kind of place. The location is good, facing the city center from Giudecca. The hotel was easy to reach with public vaporetto and hotel shuttles are available for San Marco. During the low season, the choice of nearby restaurants was not that great.  The common facilities in the hotel were clean and spacious. You had to walk several minutes to get from the room to the breakfast restaurant. I would chose something cozier for a couple or family holiday. Conference lunch was great. The room was comfortable, even unnecessarily big, more suitable for 6 persons than 1.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your detailed review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
