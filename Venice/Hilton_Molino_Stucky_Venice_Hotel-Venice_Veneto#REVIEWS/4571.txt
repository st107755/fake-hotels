The hotel is good quality and our room was nicely finished.Tea and coffee making facilities provided along with a free in room safe.Only gripe we had was the shuttle boat as it was so busy.On more than one occasion passengers were left on the jetty in the pouring rain as it was already full on leaving st marks square.Breakfast was also hideously expensive at 30 euros per head.Concierge was excellent -friendly and knowledgable.
