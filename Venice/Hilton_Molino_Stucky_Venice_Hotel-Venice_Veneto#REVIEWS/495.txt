Hotel is located on separate island that will cost you dearly to take Water Taxi there unless you want to be packed on a tourist boat stopping everywhere along the way taking hours. Yes Venice is costly we knew that but the airport Taxi from the hotel was told to us $80 then billed over $150. I disputed the charge because i was send a separate bill from room charges with no explanation. When answer came back from hotel management all they would say is it was legit case closed. I had the case reopened for answer to charges and sent bill saying it was my Taxi cost to airport when i checked out. $150 i could have flown from Venice to London roundtrip so being Diamond member ill never stay there again after the numerous nasty emails from management until i told them to stop emailingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 20183 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 29, 2018Dear Sir, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your experience with other travelers. We are sorry that you feel this way and we are saddened to read about your disappointment. As per correspondence with our Guest Relations Team, I confirm that the amount on the receipt signed by you upon booking of transfer with our Concierge team is indeed the standard cost for a private water taxi service from the hotel to the airport during day time, up to 4 people. The currency used in Italy is Euros and for this reason, as any other hotel worldwide, all prices are given in the local currency. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
