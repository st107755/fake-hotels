I visited this hotel for 3 days (2 nights) for a short trip to Venice. The hotel itself is beautiful, it is a converted Mill so has some old architecture mixed with modern. However, the hotel is not too modern so you do not miss out on the venetian charm.   The hotel is located on Giudecca island, which if you look on the map you will see that its an island just south of the main part of venice which is san marco. Although you do have to get a boat every day to the main island, this did not and would not put me off staying at this hotel. You can literally see the island opposite and is actually quite nice to get away from the hussle of venice which is packed full of tourists. The hotel has its own shuttle bus running every 20-30 mins ( they give u a timetable which is usefull.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
