Excellent stay.  Clean, modern, large and comfortable room with superb view of the canal (book a room with a view).  Breakfast was fantastic, more than you can hope for.  Location is slightly out of the way, but makes up for it by being a quiet haven away from the tourist zoo of Piazza SM.  Shuttle service across the canal and to Piazza SM is excellent.  Great restaurants across from the Hilton (the Riviera is a must!).  A bit expensive but hey, this is Venezia!  A tip:  take a water taxi from the airport, lots of fun, like a private tour of Venice, you feel like a movie star, plus you get there quickly without futzing with your luggage and transfers.  (P.S.: don't waste your money on the Cipriani...)Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
