Nice hotel on the water front .Excellent pool on the roof top with a great views .Breakfast was  awesome  and the service very warm.The hotel provides a schuttle boat service at regular intervals . Rooms are neat and nice large bath rooms we had a cannal facing room with not much of a view.Room service takes a while to get delivered.Private boat transfers to and from the airport arranged (at a charge ) by the hotel was a nice experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
