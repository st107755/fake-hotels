This had the worst food in all of Italy.  To make it even better they are rude and not helpful.  If you need to get to the airport make sure to schedule at least 5 hours before your flight to leave the hotel.

We were sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at the hotel. We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. For the benefit of other Tripadvisorâ€™s users, we would like only to clarify that as regards  transfers to/from the airport, there are various options. The fastest one via private water taxi lasts half an hour while with the Alilaguna public blue line the journey takes 1 hour and 40 minutes aprox. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we will have the opportunity of welcoming you back in the future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
