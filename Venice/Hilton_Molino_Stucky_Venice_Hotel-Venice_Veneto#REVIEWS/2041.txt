Pleasant hotel in need of maintenance. Very difficult to access if you have mobility issues or big bags. Good breakfast. Food is good but pricey and bland. Rooms were neat and well equipped. The concierge was helpful and the neighborhood is very nice- welcome relief from hustle and bustle of tourist areas.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
