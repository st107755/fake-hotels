A beautiful reconverted flour mill on the waters edge.Well connected with a shuttle service.Ambience, breakfast and quality of service is excellent. Free wifi and quiet in house wifi stations, the little curio shop and authentic Venetian cuisine at dinner. Pancake stations and the complementary executive lounge was a hit with the kids. The interiors are done up so tastefully and the Murano glass around the hotel is absolutely beautiful. Not cheap but well worth the expense.  All in all a fabulous stay and would definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare
