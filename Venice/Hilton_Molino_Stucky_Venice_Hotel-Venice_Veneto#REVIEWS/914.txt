This hotel offers a special atmosphere. And one wonders about the architectual masterpiece to convert an old storage building (a mill?) into a very nice hotel. Anyway, check-in and check-out were fast and easy. Rooms are nice, clean and well decorated, although not overdone. Heating in corner rooms could be a bit stronger. The executive lounge is nice, basically within or next to the main lobby area. Listening to nice Christmas music on tape we could have stayed forever in thre lounge. We come again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review.
