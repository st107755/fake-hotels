Just returned from my first trip to Italy, two nights of which were at this wonderful hotel. The rooms were great. Ask for a canal front room, the higher floor the better and if possible an executive room.. The hotel surprised us on our 40th anniversary with a heart of rose petals on the bed. The staff was very welcoming and sought to anticipate our needs. I did not have to worry about my Italian because the desk staff was fluent in English. As to convenience, you are just a short complimentary shuttle away from the main sights. We did not feel the need for any additional water transport pass. However we did splurge on a water taxi on leaving to give more time to get to the train station. In short my bride and I enjoyed this Hilton very much.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
