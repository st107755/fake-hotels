You really appreciate the location of this hotel after you spend your first day in Venice. The neighborhood of Giudecca is a hidden gem you appreciate more after seeing the crowds in Venice first hand. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend the hotel breakfast. It was very convenient to start our day there and then head out to San Marco. The hotel water shuttle is very convenient just be careful not to miss the last one back (1:20 AM) or you will be short $70 for water taxi to hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting  your nice comments on TripAdvisor with regards to your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
