We stayed during the aqua alta which was fun for the first time in Venice.  The hotel is located in Giudecca which is a short vaparretto ride to San Marco.  The hotel is quite large.  Room spacious.  The only reason for not five stars is that the room needs new carpeting and a couch.  Both were old and frayed.  The WiFi worked well and the staff were outstanding!  Exec lounge very nice as well.   We used the private water taxi to and from the airport - it was pricey but worth every euro!!  Highly recommend. We would definitely stay here again next time we come to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 14, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
