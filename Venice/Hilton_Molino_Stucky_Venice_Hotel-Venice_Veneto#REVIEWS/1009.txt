I had always heard that Venice hotels offers very small size rooms and its known to be a expensive city for hotels. With an additional top-up, we opted for Hilton and to our expectation, it offered a very good size room. The breakfast had great variety as always in Hilton. I loved the fresh juice prepared at a live counter by chef- a mix of carrot,apple and pineapple. Its not a difficult access from Venice station by ferry and Euro 7.5/pp in public transport. Hilton also offers ferry from its hotel to St. Marks Square every 40 minutes to and fro and it runs upto ard 11 pm. Overall, an excellent choice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 18, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your positive experience on TripAdvisor.
