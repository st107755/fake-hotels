What a great hotel, I have nothing bad to say about the place.  I was fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which was delightful, the exec lounge had everything you could wish for.  The hotel  was perfect for a wedding anniversary celebration.  The staff were polite, helpful and courteous, and nothing was too much trouble for them.  The hotels location is on the island of Giudecca which is a five minute crossing on the courtesy shuttle.  Best way from the airport is the water taxi service, but not cheap at EUR 120 each way, but it only takes half an hour rather than 90 mins on the vaperetto service.  Highly recommended, and the team there are a superb reflection on the management team at the Molino.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
