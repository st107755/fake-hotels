I was not very found of the boat ride from the airport to the hotel. A very small boat and windy - but you cant blame the hotel for that:) I was there off season. Maybe not a problem in the summer? A classic 5 star hotel. Friendly staff, very nice rooms. Only the main restaurant was open we I was there. The food was....ok. Not more. But the breakfast was fantastic. Cava, salmon, different cheeses, fresh fruitsalad, fresh orange juice...mmmm. And a nice bar at the roof.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 22, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
