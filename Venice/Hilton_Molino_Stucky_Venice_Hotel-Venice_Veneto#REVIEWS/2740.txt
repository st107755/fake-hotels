We had one night at Hilton with our two very noisy children. The staff couldn't do more to help dealing us with the oldest one, who wouldn't seat for dinner. They presented her with colour marker pens and leaf, then a waiter managed to look after the toddler while we were having dinner.  The room was probably to small to accommodate all of us with an extra bed and a cot, but we managed to have a pleasant and resting sleep. The boat transfer service from and to the main town centre is free.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 25, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for posting a review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on our property.
