The Molino Stucky is top class. Really difficult to fault. It is in a really lovely location and a great example of how to use imagination in the refurbishment/ redevelopment of an old building and make the most if its location. The rooftop pool and bar have stunning views over Venice and across the lagoon to the Lido. The shuttle boat is excellent. We always book an Executive room if we can - it adds to our enjoyment of our stay in a big way! Having said that all the rooms we have had over 3/4 years have been good. We really enjoyed our stay in 2011 and we are going back for a short stay at the hotel on 19th July.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your very nice comments on this website.
