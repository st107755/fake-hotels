I stayed at the hilton for a weekend and had a great time, Its in a good location away from st marks square. We got private boat taxi from airport for 100euros (30mins).  We booked through priceline and got a good deal and I aske dto upgrade at the hotel to a view luckly I asked to see the rooms first and it was not worth upgrading as the hotel was full and the partial view room was small with a side view of the canal, we stuck to oour extra large courtyard view room which was massive. The hotel has a great terrace and roof top swimming pool.  All staff were helpful and there is a free boat shuttle every 30 mins to st marks square (5mins by boat). I will stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
