This hotel was excellent.  We had a wonderful view of the canal, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom excellent.  The restaurant Aromi was outstanding.  The best food we had on our entire trip in Europe.  Giovanni Burrafato was an outstanding host and his staff (especially Roberto) were awesome.  I highly recommend the hotel and the restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
