Lovely hotel which used to be a mill. All staff very helpful , all areas and amenities kept very clean. We had an Executive room which was a good size and we loved the high ceilings and view which made room seem spacious. Bathroom could not fault and was very clean.  Pool area and Sky Bar very pleasant places to sit an relax, great views from Sky Bar. Only downside a bit pricey. Small charge for water transfer to Venice but well worth it for the amount of times we used it. Join the Hilton Honours scheme as it gets you free wifi in your room. Would definitely revisit this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 5, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
