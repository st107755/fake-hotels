Hilton Molino Stucky was a great experience for us.  Hilton upgraded us (husband is a diamond member) and we had a suite which was nice to spread out in after a week of tiny Italian hotels.  Convenient water shuttles to get over to the mainland.  Very good executive lounge and the roof top bar was amazing!Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 24, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
