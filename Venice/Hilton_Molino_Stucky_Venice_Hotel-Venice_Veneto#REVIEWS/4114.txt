I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of November. Arrived by water taxi and was warmly welcomed at the quay side. Easy, friendly book in and then up to my de-luxe room on the 7th floor. Spacious clean and airy with good size bathroom with marble floors. My room didn't look directly onto the canal but peering through the windows I could get a great view over Venice and watch the cruise liners majestically sail up the canal being escorted by tug boats. Breakfast was great. Good choice of fresh fruit and cereal. Cold meats and cheeses or scrambled egg, bacon etc if you fancied something warm. Attentive service although there is a difference between expresso and a cappuccino,maybe I didn't make it that clear!! Note: must brush up on my Italian.
