Just stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky for 3 nights (two rooms) in early June with my family of 4.  Everything was just perfect!  I have logged 2+ Million miles traveling the globe and this was a top hotel stay experience for sure. Contacted the hotel prior to arrival and were quickly connected with the very capable Concierge Piero.  Piero was very attentive and worked out specifics including arrival transportation with the perfect English Speaking guide and an introduction to Venice down the Grand Canal. The hotel is new and simply gorgeous.  The staff was very friendly and efficient.  Rooms were spacious (very unusual for Europe, let alone Venice!) and beautifully decorated.  Private hotel boat services are the best with punctual departures and convenient locations. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
