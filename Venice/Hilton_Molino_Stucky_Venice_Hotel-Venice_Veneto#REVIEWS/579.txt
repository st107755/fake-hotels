Very nice property, well kept and helpful staff.  We were not sure we wanted to be on another island and need to take the shuttle each day, but it was very easy and nice to be away from the noise and cluster of St. Mark's square.  I can highly recommend it if you are in the area.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
