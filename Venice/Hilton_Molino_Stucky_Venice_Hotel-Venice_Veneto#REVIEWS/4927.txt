Stayed here for a two night break to celebrate wedding anniversary. Although it may appear to be on the wrong side of the canal, the frequent free shuttle boat solves this easily. It may even be preferable to the bustle across the water, and there are some charming local restaurants along the waterfront. We were upgraded to a suite with views of the channel. Wonderful. The hotel is quite large and rambling, but you can find your way. Pleasant little rooftop pool with spectacular views of the city. Executive lounge access very desirable- a little fenced off part of the lobby bar offering complimentary drinks and breakfast- saved us a fortune! The staff were very helpful and courteous- they solved every problem and upgraded us every time! Maybe it was because I am an HHonorsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
