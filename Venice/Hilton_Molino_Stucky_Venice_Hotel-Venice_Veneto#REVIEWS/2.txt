We stayed at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice during the COVID pandemic and can honestly say that they made this stay the most comfortable, safe, and enjoyable experience we had on our travels.  From check in through until check out, the staff were polite and helpful with all of our needs.  Luca in particular was extremely helpful and gave us many tips on Venice and the things we could do and things we could see. He also gave us a lot of information about the building’s history - which we loved to find out about.  Our room and bathroom was absolutely gorgeous and super clean - there wasn’t one thing out of place. And although due to Covid precautions the breakfast buffet is not as it was used to be, it went above our expectations as the staff were polite and happy to help us when we kept asking for the things we would usually be able to go and get ourselves.  Overall, we would rate our stay at the Hilton Venice 10/10 for the overall experience. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so comfortable.…Read moreDate of stay: October 2020Trip type: Traveled as a couple1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
