We have just visited the hotel in Venice for 3 nights. In respect of the rooms, food and cleanliness the hotel cannot be faulted, however we found it very impersonal. The staff on reception very not overly friendly and the staff working for the   Shuttle service were very abrupt and rude. It is worth noting the ferry is very handy  although due to the size of the hotel, at the weekend it can prove difficult to get on as it has a maximum capacity of 39 people. It is worth going up the sky bar for a cocktail although expensive the view is impressive Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2015Dear Mark,   thank you for your kind review.   I was pleased to read that you enjoyed your stay with regards to room and cleanliness; I was sorry to see that you found our staff impersonal, we really try our best to help our guests as much as we can and we normally get good reviews for our friendliness; we are sorry if in this occasion you were not completely satisfied.

We thank you and look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
