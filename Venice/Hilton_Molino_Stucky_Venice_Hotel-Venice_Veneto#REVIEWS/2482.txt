We stayed at this property in Venice. While it is a little inconvenient as it is on Guidecca island, the hotel is wonderful Brand new with large rooms, great views, friendly staff, helpful concierge. Price was ~50% of similar properties on the main island. So a 20 minute boat ride to save a couple of 100 Euros a day is worth it!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Direttore generale at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 7, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
