We came in 2 days early for a Mediterranean cruise and stayed at the Hilton Milano Stuckey. What a great place to stay! Everyone was very helpful and friendly and the King Suite we had was excellent.  The hotel has multiple restaurants that are very good and a lounge area for diamond members. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ever in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Direttore generale at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 6, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
