Great Hotel with a great location and view. Located in Giudecca so you are not in the middle of the Venice traffic. A Water Taxi takes you over to Venice and the other area islands, after visiting these areas, you can come back to the hotel to relax and not worry about the crowds. When we return to Venice we will stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
