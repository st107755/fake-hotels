The hotel has suite like rooms and wonderful service.  The restaurants are expensive but highest quality.  The Aromi Restaurant was wonderful - black cod was excellent.  Staff there were cooperative with each other and attentive to guests.  You do have to take a Hilton ferry to get across the Giudecca Canal to get to San Marco and the rest of the main part of Venice which cuts down on sightseeing time.  However, we were here to join a Greek Isles cruise and it is only one stop and 8 euro away from the cruise terminal on Alilaguna so if you are going on a cruise from Venice this is a great choice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
