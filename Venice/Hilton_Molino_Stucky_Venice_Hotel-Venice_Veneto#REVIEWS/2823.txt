Room is very clean with great views; Staff is very friendly.  Food in hotel is quite good, great selection for breakfast and dinner. This hotel has its own shuttle boat to commute back and forth to San Marco. We like the location of this hotel, far from the loud tourist areas, but convenient enough to enjoy everything. For dinner, make sure you make reservations. I also enjoyed the massage services there.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
