We are a family of four and loved this hotel.  The water taxi ride from the airport took approximately 30 mins.  Check in was swift, friendly and efficient.  We had 2 adjacent rooms on the first floor with a lovely water view. Although the hotel is located right on the busy canal, the rooms are very quiet and well appointed.  Beds very comfortable and rooms spotless. The rooftop pool/bar has amazing views over Venice and has a lovely vibe with nice music playing in the background.  The hotel offers a regular shuttle boat across the river and also to St Mark's Square.  The hotel is also close to restaurants and cafe's.  It's lovely to return to the hotel after a busy day of sightseeing as it's away from the hordes of tourists.  We loved it and would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
