The Molino Stucky is a nice compromise. The hotel is luxurious with a rooftop pool with breathtaking views of Venice. Because it requires a ferry to get to the main islands of Venice, the price is less than comparable properties that are walking distance to Veniceâ€™s main attractions.  Nice, casual restaurants that are walking distance on Giudecca. Highly recommended!
