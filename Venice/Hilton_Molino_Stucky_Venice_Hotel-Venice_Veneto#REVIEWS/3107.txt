This is one of the most beautiful Hilton Hotels I have ever stayed in! Our room had a beautiful Murano Glass Chandelier. The bathroom was fit for a queen with beautiful marble. Beautiful comfortable bed and I could have spent a week here but alas only had three nights. The breakfast buffet was huge and everyone from the front desk to all the staff were pleasant and helpful. This hotel is on the Giudecca Canal and of course being in Venice you have to get around by boat so it was great that the Hilton has there own water taxi. They also have a rooftop swimming pool and bar. I would love to come back and spend a week in this fabulous hotel and beautiful Venice!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 10, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
