We chose Molino Stucky because of its location on the Giudecca which has the merit of being a bit more peaceful than the centre of Venice but still easy enough to get to. We were expecting a fairly interesting looking hotel and we got more than that. The service was very good too. When we got there we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the build generally and our room . If you like stylish bars the rooftop bar is for you-it is great. We would go back there if we were staying in Venice in high season again as it is great to avoid the crowds. The Stucky has a water bus which runs regularly to the centre and if you enjoy the fact of being in a city on water this is an added bonus. Hilton often have good deals too and for Venice we did not think the hotel was too expensive.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
