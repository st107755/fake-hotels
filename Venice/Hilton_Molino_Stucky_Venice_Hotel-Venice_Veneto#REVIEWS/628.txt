We took a beautiful birthday weekend to lovely Venice and were not disappointed. Recommend to get bus from Marco Polo airport as the scenic boat taxi to hotel took over an hour :( the boat to St Marks was regular and quick though stopped at midnight in case you were planning on staying out late. The Hotel itself was very well kept, great location and we paid thatbit extra for the view down the cana from the bedroom, which also was a lovely sight at night from the beautiful rooftop cocktail bar. We skipped most sightseeing as went for a kid-free break and enjoyed getting lost down all the little streets and canals finding little hiddden gems for a glass of vino or coffee. Highly recommend Venice to all ages, though recommend you are a good walker :)Read moreDate of stay: November 20172 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 9, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on TripAdvisor.
