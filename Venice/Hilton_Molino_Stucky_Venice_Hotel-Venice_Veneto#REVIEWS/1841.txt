Thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay prior to a cruise. The hotel is on an island 20 mins water taxi away from St Marks Square. The hotel shuttle ran every 20 minutes and it was a great way to get in and out of Venice.   Venice was really busy so being in a lovely hotel on a quiet island was great for us.   The hotel pool was on the roof but had a temperature of a plunge pool which came as a bit of a shock but was OK after a few minutes.   Rooms nice and spacious with loads of storage space.   Staff were all lovely and the breakfast was fantastic.   Would certainly go back.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for sharing your positive experience on TripAdvisor.
