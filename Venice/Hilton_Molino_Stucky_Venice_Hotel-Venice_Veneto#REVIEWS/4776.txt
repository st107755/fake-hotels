The Hilton Molino Stucky is a little removed from the main tourist areas of Venice.  Some view that as a drawback - I view it as a huge positive.  It's incredibly easy to sneak over to St Marks and get amongst the crowds.  It's just as easy to get back to the sanity of the hotel when you are done.  The free shuttle boat runs every 20 minutes during the day.  It's less frequent at night and we did have to wait after dinner once - but that just gave us an opportunity to have a coffee in another little place on the water.  The roof top bar offers an amazing view of the Cruise ships that are berthed on the other side of the channel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
