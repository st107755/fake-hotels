My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location was very convenient for exploring the main sites in Venice, only a short boat ride away (approximately 15 minutes).The staff was friendly and helpful, from the moment of check in till check out and at all times in between. The room, which offered a great view of Venice's lagoon, was large and well-appointed with a bathtub as well as shower, comparable to those in the U.S. but less usual in Europe. The buffet was outstanding, lots of fresh and delicious choices. Both the hotel restaurant and bar where we had dinner several times were top notch. Our trip to Venice was memorable, and lodging here helped to make it so.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on the hotelâ€™s facilities.
