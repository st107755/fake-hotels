I stayed with my family on May 2013. Finally have a chance to write my review. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous. We stayed on the 2nd floor overlooking the canal. The shuttle boat to San Marco is great and is was working until almost midnight. Great location away from the busy touristy crowds. Full of charm and elegance. The courtyard cafe has the best Nutella crepes!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
