What a great hotel! We loved every minute of our stay there. The level of customer service from all the staff members was nothing but excellent. Annimi went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was the best it could be. Thanks again!  If you have time, explore the neighborhoods around the hotel and hang out with the locals for a glass of wine and cicchetti. Read moreHelpfulShare
