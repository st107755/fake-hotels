I really do not like to post negative reviews. But, in this case it is truly warranted. My wife and I have waited for years to visit Venice. In that time I accumulated the hundreds of thousands of points necessary to stay at this hotel. When we checked in we were given a room with virtually no view and paper thin walls.

We are sorry that you did not thoroughly enjoyed your stay at our property and that your expectations were not met. As valued HHonors Member, you know that upgrades cannot be confirmed before arrival and are always offered upon hotel availability. Due to Biennale and Expo international 2015 events, we are indeed experiencing a very busy Spring season this year and the hotel is fully booked very often as it was for sure during your stay. Therefore our Front Office team was unfortunately unable to offer you an upgrade to a different room category and we are sorry this spoiled your stay with us. I do hope that should your plans bring you back this way, you will give us another chance to serve you.   Best regards  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
