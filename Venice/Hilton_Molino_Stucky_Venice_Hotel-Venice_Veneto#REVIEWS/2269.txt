My husband and I booked here after debating for months whether to stay on the main canal or not and getting mixed opinions from people we knew had been to Venice. From arrival we were all glad we picked Hilton Molino! Beautiful hotel with every facility needed,  helpful staff and a super easy boat shuttle to the main square.  On arrival our room was ready early which was a bonus and we then discovered we had been upgraded to an executive room with view for our honeymoon...what a great suprise! The rooms have amazing views,  comfortable beds and are well sized for a comfortable few day stay. Breakfast is fantastic and such an amazing variety of food. Make sure you arrive well before they finish serving though.  The boat shuttle to the square is fantastic and right from the door.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 11, 2016Dear Madame, We appreciate the time you took to post a comment on TripAdvisor.
