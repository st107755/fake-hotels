As a multi-year diamond member, I expected more. Told I had an upgraded room, I asked if it had a view of the canal and was told no. Reception checked and said I could have one with a view with twin beds that could be put together, so I accepted. The room had a partial view of canal over looking restaurant seating and industrial area on other side of canal. Food at restaraunts was average and somewhat over priced. Over all the hotel is adequate, but over priced.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2017Dear guests,  We thank you for your loyalty.
