This was our first stop of our two week vacation.  The hotel is gorgeous.  The staff incredibly helpful and kind.  Rooms large and nice.  Bed super comfortable.  Bathroom very nice.  You must visit the 8th floor bar with incredible views.  This was one of our favorite parts of our Venice tour as it was authentic.  We wandered the alleys, ran into the local elementary school and ate at a cafeteria where no one spoke English.  Would go there again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your ncie comments on this website with regards to your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
