We loved the hotel.  The restaurants were overpriced, but we didn't stay there for that reason.  The rooms were great with gorgeous views of the waterfront.  The included breakfast was a fantastic buffet which covered your every need.  Yes, the pool is not gigantic -- how could it be when its on the roof of a historical building. The view up there is wonderful.  The only negative we experienced was the water shuttle to the main island did not have very friendly or helpful drivers at times. The front desk was always helpful and happy to answer all our questions (regardless of how many we asked). The concierge did a wonderful job of having our private water taxi ready to take us to our cruise ship and to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
