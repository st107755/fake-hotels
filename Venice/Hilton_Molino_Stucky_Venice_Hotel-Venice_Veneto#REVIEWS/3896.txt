We stayed at the Stucky Molino April 4 & 5, 2014.  The hotel is well located and provides a water taxi, which is great. We found our room to be nice and clean, well appointed.  We were excited to see the rooftop pool only to find it closed for renovation during our stay. We did visit the Skybar... the views were amazing and the atmosphere is great. The only negative comment I have about this hotel is the amount we were charged for breakfast upon checking out. 30 Euros per person for the breakfast served was way too much.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
