As a part of a global chain in a historic city, this hotel is a safe bet. It will be good to know that you cannot get to the hotel by car since it is located on an island. You either have to take a water taxi directly from the airport or come to the center of town by car or bus and get on a ferry. The hotel has a frequent water shuttle to take you to the city centre, but if you want to stay away from the crowds, it is possible to hang around the hotel with good dining and lunch choices. Old factory turned into a hotel, the rooms are ok sized and service is good. Concierge is very helpful and has access to all the sight seeing trips and excursions.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 20, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
