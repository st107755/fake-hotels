Just stayed at this beautiful hotel for three days. The staff is pleasant and helpful, the food is good. Complimentary water taxi to St Mark's square in both directions. Upgrade your room to a canal view, as the view is beautiful. the cruise ships float by and the boats in the canal are like a freeway, Totally amazing.  The rooftop pool has incredible views of the city. When booking check hotel web site as breakfast is included. Take a private walking tour of the city that is not part of the tourist attractions, as you can see how the people live.The hotel has different wings so it is easy to get lost, DÃ©cor is beautiful and I definitely would go back againRead moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 20, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
