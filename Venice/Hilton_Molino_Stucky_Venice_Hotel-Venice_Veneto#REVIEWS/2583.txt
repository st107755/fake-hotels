We began our Italian honeymoon with four nights here.  We loved the room, the staff was exemplary (we were especially delighted by Enrico's genuine excitement for us when we told him we were honeymooning), the location was very convenient, and the shuttle made getting around easy.  We loved breakfast and happy hour in the executive lounge, and enjoyed both the bar and room service, but were underwhelmed by the breakfast buffet and the restaurant.  We'll definitely stay here again next time we visit Venice and will recommend that our friends do the same.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 19, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
