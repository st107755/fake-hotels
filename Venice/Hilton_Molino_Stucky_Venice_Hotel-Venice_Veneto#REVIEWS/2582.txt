The description of this hotel does not do it justice. After arriving at the airport we took a water taxi to the hotel. It is across the canal from the city, As with most European hotels the lobby is small, but once I entered the rest of the hotel it was beautiful. The rooms are large and well appointed.The breakfast was superb. The roof top bar was amazing with views of the city. I was worried about the shuttle that goes over to the city. However, it ran on time, had two stops and was rarely full. Venice is difficult to find your way around. I can't imagine trying to find a hotel there. I would love to stay the again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 19, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
