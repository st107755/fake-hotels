Great hotel - excellent location away from the crowds, great service and good amenities. Only downside the drinks are over priced. Overall excellent experience.  Recommend: private water taxi to hotel, 12hr public water bus ticket to see the whole of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
