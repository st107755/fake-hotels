Just "ok". Nothing great rooms smell and just above average not a Hilton worthy. 20 euro for drinks in the bar is more than you would pay at Mayfair in London. Whatever you do, do not bother about the lounge. Small and crowded, full of children that treat the place like a playground and the offering is very very basic bordering on poor. Drinks are limited to white/ red wine and beer. Not worth 3 stars overall. Staff are struggling to cope and do their best to accommodate but little they can do. This is the worst experience ever, you get the feeling you are a school cantine and not a respectable hotel. The could not seat 3 people and we had to wait and they won't even upgrade to normal breakfast. Will tear my hh honors card after this experience.
