Venice is a very lovely place to visit.Ideal for a short break as you can see most of what there is to see in 2/3 lady's.Its good to buy a travel card for a few days which you can use on the bus and water boats.Travel in and around Venice mainland can be done by taxi or bus but after piazza Le plaza it's all water taxi and water boat. I'd also advice to get mosquito repellant before you go or when you arrive as there are a lot of mosquitos. I spent most of my time itching my legs so ladies cover up at night even feet. Absolutely amazing food,sea food is lovely and so are the pizzas.Absolutely love the ice cream. If advice staying somewhere like Lido if you are looking for budget as lower budget place like Mestre are a bit rough.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 6, 2016Dear Madame, We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
