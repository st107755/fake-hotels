We arrived at this Hilton property via a Vaporetta (water bus), walked into the front lobby and fell in love with the place. It is directly on the large canal with a free shuttle into the "tourist" center of Venice with 2 convenient drop-offs. The property itself had a fabulous staff that bent over backwards to help, beautiful and clean rooms, and a gorgeous roof top pool and pool bar. What a way to relax at the end of a long and hot day of sightseeing. The food was fantastic and the location was superb. I would go back and spend a much longer time in Venice just to enjoy this hotel a little longer!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience.
