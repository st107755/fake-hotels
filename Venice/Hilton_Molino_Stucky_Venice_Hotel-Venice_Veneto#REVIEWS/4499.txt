we stayed here after our med cruise. We found the hotel fine,but it could be a hilton hotel anywhere. We didn't feel like we were in Venice. Service was fine, room was fine,had a great meal at one of the resteraunts. Using the free shuttle was ok but next time in venice we would rather stay on the island.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.   We regret that the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guest can still enjoy the vicinity in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a residential area.  We are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.  Best regards,  Alessandro M. Cabella General ManagerRead more
