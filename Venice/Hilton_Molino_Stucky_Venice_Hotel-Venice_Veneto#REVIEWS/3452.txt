May I confirm that the mentioned rooms are Executive rooms with Venice view and I regret you experienced an inconvenience during you stay. Unfortunately being Venice in a lagoon and also due to low tide, the odors can sometime be beyond control. I have discussed your comments at our Management Meeting and we are glad to inform you that we have a project to improve this in order to avoid the reoccurrence of experiences you have highlighted although we cannot change the fact that high and low tides are part of our city.  We place great value on your opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.  Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
