This hotel in Venice 4 stars is basic for the price you pay.  The breakfast is area is very big and because of that not comfortable. The food is ok but definitely not great.  The swimming pool was cool on the top floor. The cocktails are basic. The room is basis for a deluxe suite. Very small and a old bathroom. You have to take a private watertaxi of 60 euro one way. That makes it expensive but cool to do.  Expected more of it!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 26, 2016Dear Sir/Madame, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel. You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by Guests at Hilton. I would like to take this opportunity to inform that besides our shuttle boat and private water taxi, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto/line 2) station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. Your comments are being reviewed and we are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.
