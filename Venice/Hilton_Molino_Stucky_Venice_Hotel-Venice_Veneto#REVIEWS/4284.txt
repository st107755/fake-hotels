Stayed here for three nights having prepaid 800 euros for b and b before a really awful three nights at the Excelsior having paid 1965 euros for b and b. Hotel building impressive with easy access by boat from station and St Marks. Struck lucky with a room at the front where the canal gently lapped the terrace below our window. Room decoration antique and tasteful, beautiful views of Venice. Dinner on terrace expensive but adequate with excellent service to compensate for the average food and good wine. Breakfast very good, staff pleasant and helpful. Rooftop pool and bar very impressive. Guests seemed mostly happy and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, would definitely go back. Compared to the Excelsior this is eight star.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
