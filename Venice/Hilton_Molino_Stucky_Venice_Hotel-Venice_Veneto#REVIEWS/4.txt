We have just returned from a visit to Venice staying at this beautiful hotel. Everything about this hotel was stunning the location is ideal with the water taxi stop just outside . The hotel has an amazing roof top bar and pool . All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and thanks to Hilton’s stay safe program we felt very safe. We were celebrating our anniversary and loved that the staff went to the trouble to congratulate us and we received a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and Venetian biscuits in our room. It was so thoughtful. Thank you Stucky Molino I can’t wait for a return visit . Read moreDate of stay: September 2020Trip type: Traveled as a couple1 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
