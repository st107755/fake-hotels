Hilton Molino Stucky is ideally designed for the kind of weather experienced in Venice. Its solid and gigantic proportions rising by the waterfront belies the warm and personalised interiors of the hotel. The rooms are designed for Royalty with state of the art accessories.  The food spread is wide and totally sumptuous. The staff were most helpful, warm and courteous , especially the old Italian concierge who guided our umpteen trips across the waters on vaporettos to different touristy spots in Venice.   The Molino Stucky is highly recommended for a truly Venetian experience.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
