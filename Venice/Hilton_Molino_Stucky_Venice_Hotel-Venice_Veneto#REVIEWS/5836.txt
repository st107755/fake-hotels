Very beautiful ancient building completely restored bathing in local luxury. Comfortable rooms with all necessary facilities. Astonishing breakfast with an overwhelming choice in fresh fruit, cereals, eggs .... Beautiful view over the city on the top of the hotel - ideal for watching the sun set! Free and frequent shuttle to the centre of the city. Thanks a lot people!Read moreDate of stay: April 2007HelpfulShare
