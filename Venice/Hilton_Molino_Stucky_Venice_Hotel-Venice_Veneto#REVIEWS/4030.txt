I stayed here recently on a business trip. Love this hotel. So unique.  I was upgraded to an Executive Suite which was great. Fabulous views of the city and the room was massive!  Executive Lounge was good. Unlike the last reviewer I found it great and the free drinks were good. I love the Hilton because of their superb Loyalty Scheme.  I aim to return here again for pleasure.  Well done Hilton!!Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 30, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel.
