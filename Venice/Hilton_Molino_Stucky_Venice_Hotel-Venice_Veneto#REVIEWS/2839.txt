Stayed there for two nights. The location is not the best as itÂ´s located on Giudecca island, but there is a hotel shuttle boat and the public boat stop isn't far either. The rooms are modern and clean. WIFI top. The restaurants are excellent. Breakfast too.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 21, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
