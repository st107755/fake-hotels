Stayed for birthday celebration for six nights. Wonderful hotel. Breakfasts, outside fine dining on the terrace or the roof top cocktail bar all make a very special stay. Use the Hilton free water taxi system around the islands. The rooms are very smart and comfortable. This is a place I would return to and would recommend for a stay in venice. Its quiet and on an island rather than in the central part of the city but transport is laid on by the hotel so its easy to get back and forth.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2013Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website, it is a pleasure to receive such positive feedback and I am pleased to read that you decided to stay with us for your special occasion.
