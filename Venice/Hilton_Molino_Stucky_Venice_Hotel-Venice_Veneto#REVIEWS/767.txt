Hotel was great - rooms were super comfortable and a decent size, with a view of the Guidecca Canal. The building is amazing, and well worth a wander around. View from the rooftop bar is gorgeous, although food and drink prices are proportionately steep!  Shuttle service to Piazza San Marco was efficient, comfortable and good value (7.50 per person for the entire stay), and being that being slightly removed from the main tourist area was actually quite nice and relaxing. Breakfast was delicious.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 14, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for taking the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
