Even though this hotel is not in the middle of old Venice- it is still a great location. The entire complex has been recently restored and is beautiful and modern!  A water view room allows you to open your windows and partake in great views of Venice- while not in the crazy tourist zone.  The hotel operates a free water taxi- that delivers you into the main parts of Venice in minutes. Our room was great- staff great- and we loved using the rooftop bar at night that overlooks Venice- as well as the rooftop pool(also overlooks Venice) The food is a little pricey- but it was all good- and you are paying for great surroundings.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 3, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
