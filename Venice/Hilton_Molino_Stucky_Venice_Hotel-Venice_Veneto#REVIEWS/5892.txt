This Hotel is new and fresh compared to the old hotels in venice.No creeky floors and windox box air conditioners. If you like the big american way...this is it. Everything is expensive so bring your money.The taxi from the hilton to the airport is 100 euro....or you can  lug your bags on two boats,spend double the time and pay alot less on a public boat. Enjoy Venice....it was fun!Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
