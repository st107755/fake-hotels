This is a lovely hotel.  Beautiful and luxurious in every respect.  We caught the vaporetto over here specially to see the views from the skyline bar, which we do in most countries we visit.  Sadly the views were not special, not worth the long journey to get there  However we did discover a shuttle boat put on for free by Hilton that runs from San Marco square and back, which is a great service,  There is a lot to recommend about this place, but don't come just for the views.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 23, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for posting your feedback on TripAdvisor. I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hotel including our shuttle boat service but I am on the other hand surprised about the fact that you did not enjoy the views from our famous Skyline bar which are one of our highlights and appreciated worldwide. Maybe the day you come to visit us the weather was not at its best and this may have ruined a little bit your experience. We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
