This is a beautiful hotel, but removed from Venice proper. You need to use the boats to get into the city. Nice views from the roof. The rooms were pretty nice, at least you could open the windows to get some fresh air. Breakfast was good. Do not pay the hotel rate to transfer to the cruise dock - hotel price for transfer for 4 was E 70, Price on the boat was E 12 pp (E 58 for 4). The pool deck is dangerous when wet, as are the marble floors in the hotel leading out to the pool. Very expensive for what you get.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations. While it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
