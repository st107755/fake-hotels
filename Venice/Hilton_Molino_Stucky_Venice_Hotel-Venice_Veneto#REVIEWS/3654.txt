Beautiful Hotel...love what Hilton did with a turn of the last century old factory.  Signage is a little confusing within the hotel and takes some getting used to.  Also, the food in the hotel is very good, but pricey...wish the service matched the price.....very slow.  A must go spot is on the roof bar...amazing views.  Room was perfect and always clean  The boat shuttles take some time to get used to as well.  Hilton has a dedicated shuttle.  The unfortunate thing is if it fills up the stop before yours (where you're waiting to get on), it goes right on by without stopping.  Recommend to get out there early and wait as they only take a certain amount of passengers.  Other then that, great hotel...just have patience, be flexible and remember you're on vacation  :-)Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
