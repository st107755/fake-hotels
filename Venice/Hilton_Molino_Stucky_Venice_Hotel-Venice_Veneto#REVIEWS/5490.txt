My fianc√© & I stayed here for 8 nights, hotel staff were very helpful,shuttle was fun & relaxing though they sometimes didn't keep to time on their timetable. Food, drinks & Internet access were very expensive I would suggest going to the local supermarket to buy drinks,water,etc Liked the fact the hotel was away from 'main' Venice.  Hotel breakfast well worth itRead moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
