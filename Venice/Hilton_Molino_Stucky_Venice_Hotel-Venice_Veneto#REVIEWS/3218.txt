Well what can i say, what a lovely hotel in the perfect location with boat taxi transfers to go over the river thats included. We stayed here for 2 nights, check in was quick and the women at check in was very polite and welcoming once checked in the concierge took our bags and showed us to our rooms. The rooms are a good size and the view is amazing very relaxing after half hour of being in the room we recieved a phonecall from reception to make sure we was happy with our room which was nice. Paid for breakfast and so glad we did so much choice from healthy to bread, cheeses and hams and also a full English!  The bar downstairs is very nice although would be nicer to have more viariety of cocktails on the menu and for the rooftop bar absolutely superb lots of choices of drinks.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 12, 2015Dear Ms. Vickie,   thank you for taking the time to write such a nice review on Tripadvisor!
