Average 3-4star hotel. Not 5 star. Staff was absolutely NOT friendly. Room had a strange smell like smoking smell but We ignored it. Curtains couldnt stop the sun coming through the room. It was okay for us. But if you need complete darkness for your sleep, think carefully. Noisy in the morning and late night (people shouting chatting smoking right next to the hotel). It has a nice view on the top of the roof though.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
