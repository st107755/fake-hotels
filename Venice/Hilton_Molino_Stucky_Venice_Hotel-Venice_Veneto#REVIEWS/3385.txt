Great place!  Be sure to check out the Rooftop Lounge. The view is breathtaking during the day as well as the evening.  Wonderful service and staff.  Many great restaurants nearby. Hotel is modern, spacious and very charming. We had multiple issues. Safe never worked - battery was low and would not close and lock.  Informed front desk and during our 3 day stay it was never fixed.  Upon departure we left for breakfast, came back and our door would not open due to low battery again!  Maintenance staff responded fairly quickly due to time crunch for flight.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
