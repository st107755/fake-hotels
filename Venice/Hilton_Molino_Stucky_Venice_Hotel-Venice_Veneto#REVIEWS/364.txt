The Molino is an excellent, well run hotel. The views of Venice from the rooftop bar were wonderful. Moving back and forth between the Molina and San Marco by water was fast and easy. The Hotel restaurants are worth a look. Our dinner at Bacaromi restaurant was one of the better one meals we had in Venice, and the wine list was very good at reasonable prices.
