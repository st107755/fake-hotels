We had a wonderful stay after our cruise at HMS.   The location, away from the crowds, the rooftop bar view are amazing. The room was very comfortable and service very good.   We appreciated the free water shuttle to St Marks!   The local restaurants are busy but worth the wait.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 10, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
