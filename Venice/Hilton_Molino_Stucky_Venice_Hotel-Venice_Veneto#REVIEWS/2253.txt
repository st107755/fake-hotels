This hotel is clean, the rooms are nice, and the food was what I would expect at an American Hilton Hotel, even decor wise. I was a little disappointed at how little it felt like Venice but instead a standard American Hilton. The food was acceptable but again not super impressive. Everything around the hotel shuts down after 6 in the Winter and there is nothing within walking vicinity to really do. The spa facility was OK but not super impressive either. I would stay here again only if it was a great deal but it wouldn't be my first choice. Venice is definitely a must do though so if you haven't been.....make sure you go!!! :)Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 20, 2016Dear Madame, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at our property. The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. We are sorry if our location was not entirely to your expectations; the hotel is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the city centre and it is especially appreciated by Guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good and excellent restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
