On arriving at the hotel for our 4th trip to the hotel in Venice we were absolutely shocked and amazed to be told due to there being no rooms left we were being upgraded to the presidential suite for free!!! The presidential suite which is situated at the top of the hotel in the bell tower boasts a private gym, sauna, jacuzzi, 2 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms plus a free bar! It was truly a once in a lifetime experience. The bell tower had a spiral staircase which opened up at the top where you can walk up and get the best ever view of Venice!
