We stayed 4 nights at the Molino Stucky mid-July over the Il Redentore festival. Whilst the staff were very helpful and polite, this large clean hotel, with good amenities and a lovely rooftop pool, is in our opinion at best a 3 star. What really lets down this hotel so much are the paper thin walls between the rooms. We stayed in a large executive room with lovely views overlooking The Giudecca Canal, but we the could hear everything our neighbours said both sides of the room. This we feel is wholly unacceptable for such a hotel, especially when paying over Â£400 a night and for that reason alone, we would not return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
