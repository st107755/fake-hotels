Try the Aromi restaurant. Visit the pool for the view (especially if not staying in any view room). Close windows because of mosquitoes. (not only at Hilton). Be patient with water transports / hotel water shuttles and expect delays. Hotel water shuttles get easily full at Zattere and San Marco. Expect to wait for the next one (20 min) or be prepared and arrive to the stop in advance.  Thank you very much ROSA THEA MICELI and all the staff.
