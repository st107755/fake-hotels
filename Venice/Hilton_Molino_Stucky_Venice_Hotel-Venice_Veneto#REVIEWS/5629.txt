T'was the most sumptuous of our Italy trip.  The views are unbelievable and the brunch is worth the stay...outstanding!  The room was elegant and unique.  It was great having our own water shuttle and fun staying across from Johnny Depp's yaght.  Don't expect an authentic experience, as the hotel, being a Hilton, is full of Americans.  That being said, it was reassuring to have the quality of a Hilton while in Europe.  After reading mixed reviews, I would highly recommend it.  It is elegant, yet set in a very unique setting. Frederica was amazing, as a concierge.  She was most helpful, booked whatever we needed and had a refreshing sense of humour.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
