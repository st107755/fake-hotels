My wife and I and two friends stayed here in June 2015. It is a converted factory/mill and so has bags of character , the renovation has been done in a sympathetic but modern way which does have the wow factor. we stayed in a club room with the appropriate benefits of breakfast afternoon teas and pre dinner canap√©s and drinks. the hotel is actually on a small island ( Giudecca ) just off Venice but the hotel provide a shuttle boat to Venice proper and it only takes 5 minutes. The room was of average size , but clean and certainly acceptable with nice products in the bathroom. All in all a great stay and a lovely hotel , would I go back......yes. The hotel pool although not terribly large has a fantastic  . oh p.s. they have a really nice bar on the top floor.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Staff.
