This hilton was a great hotel with great service and great grounds and property. I highly recommend the executive lounge upgrade it comes with periodic meals, complementary beverages and bar, and free internet plus a better room. Although i could tell you all about the pros of the hotel you have to take a shuttle boat to get to venice which comes every hour, or every 20 min on sunday. Overall a good experience and i recommend it if you are a person who does not like going in to the city and just relaxing, however if you like touring and being out like me than you will not like it as much.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 5, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor.
