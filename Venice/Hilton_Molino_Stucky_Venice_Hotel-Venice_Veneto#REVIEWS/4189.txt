The Venice Hilton is not to be missed by visitors not in a rush to go sightseeing and taking  their time to relax at a really phantastic place. The view is great and the friendly atmosphere and unparalleled service make up for the time it takes to get here. Hilton provides free!! shuttle from Le Zattere and San Marco. Quite a treat. Price is worth the place.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
