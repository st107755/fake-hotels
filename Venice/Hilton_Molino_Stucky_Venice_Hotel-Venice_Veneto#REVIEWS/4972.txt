Our family (2 teen girls) really enjoyed this hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, with quiet, efficient air conditioning. The whole hotel has been converted from an old flour mill using lovely wood, etc. The location worked for us: the hotel provides a regular free shuttle boat to take guests to Zaterre (5 minutes away) and San Marcos. Private water taxi (for 4 people) to the airport was 105 euros. There is a very nice small pool and sun deck on a roof terrace - with great views - but this gets full quickly. My wife was initially against this hotel as it lacked Venetian charm - but changed her mind when we could return here from the rush of Venice. Look on the hotel web-site for the best rates.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2012Dear Guest, We would like to thank you for taking the time to submit a review regarding your stay and it was a pleasure to read that you enjoyed our services and facilities.
