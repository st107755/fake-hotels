One of the biggest and most lavish hotels in Venice, we definitely enjoyed our short stay there. The rooms are pretty big and are furnished with top of the line stuff. The hotel has several restaurants and bars (expensive - but so is everything in Venice). A visit to the Skyline bar is a must at night for some fabulous views! The rates are fairly high - even for Venice standards - but we got lucky as we used our points to make our reservations :)  The biggest drawback of this hotel is that it is located on the Giudecca Island. While it is nice and quiet, we found it a little inconvenient to get to (specially at night.) From the train station, there are 2 vaporetti that go to the hotel (stop is named Palanca). But you need to check the timings first (plus each trip is EU 6.50).â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
