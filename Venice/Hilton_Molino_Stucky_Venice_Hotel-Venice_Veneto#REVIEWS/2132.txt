If you are planning a trip to Venice you have to stay here! It is a fantastic hotel. We had a room on the 4th floor with a view of the water which was just outside the hotel. I loved the room. It was large and beautifully decorated. The room was kept clean and every consideration to accommodate us was gladly arranged. There is a water shuttle that runs every half hour back and forth to St. Marks square and they were very reliable. I highly recommend this hotel. If I ever get to return I will stay here.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 3, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for highly recommending our property to other travellers.
