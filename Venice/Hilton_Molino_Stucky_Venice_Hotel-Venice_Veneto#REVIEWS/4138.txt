From the outside the place looks like a warehouse because it used to be one.  On the inside it is a maze to find your room but no worries, you will be happy when you arrive.  We had a spectacular view of the waterways.  The room was clean and there is a private taxi from the hotel to the other islands.  We ate down the street at the Osteria next to the water taxi stand.  I heard horror stories of other hotels in Venice, but this one did not smell moldy and like mildew and the staff was awesome and friendly.  Take the tour of the Murano glass factories ( free) . you get to ride in a speed boat James Bond style through Venice!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
