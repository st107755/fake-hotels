Very nice hotel. Confusing on best stop from the train station for the public water taxi - make sure you double check the stop-off point! Pleasant walk back but it was a half-mile.  Excellent staff, could have been clearer on hotel water taxi fee at check-in although a very reasonable rate. Room was next to a family with a crying infant so I had to put in earplugs for a bit - thin walls. Great views - overall an expensive but very nice experience. As usual, book well ahead to get a better rate.
