Great room, great views and very easy access to San Marco via the free shuttle. Lunch and the views from the rooftop restaurant are spectacular, but a little pricy. Surprised that as a guest of the hotel we were charged a cover charge as well as a fee for the pane, even though we ordered meals. We visited during a festival (unbeknownst to us) and were not advised to make reservations for dinner at a restaurant in the hotel. Every restaurant around was totally booked as well as all of the restaurants in the hotel, so we ended up eating dinner in the bar. That being said, we had front row seats via the windows in our room for the spectacular fireworks show! The breakfast in the morning was outstanding.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
