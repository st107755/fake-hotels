We (Family of 2 adults + 2 teens) have just returned from a 4 nights stay @ Hilton Molino Stucky. Great location, Great Views, Great service, Large modern rooms, Great roof top lounge and views, Swimming Pool, Great Breakfast. What else are you looking for? The only point that you need to take care of is the free shuttle timing that go and leave from San Marco square. The challenge is the shuttles leaving from San Marco by night, you need to be there a bit earlier to ensure that you a have a place. Hilton Molino Stucky is away from the crowds???? Who cares!, when you spend all your day in the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
