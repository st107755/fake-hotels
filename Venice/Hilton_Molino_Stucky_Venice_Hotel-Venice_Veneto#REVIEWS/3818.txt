The Hilton Molina Stuckey is a beautiful hotel right near the cruise port.  In fact it is the first stop on the AliLaguna which made it most convenient from the port and to the airport.  The hotels complimentary boat to and from St. Marks' place was also great.  The staff was terrific and helpful and the bathroom outstanding.  Though not in St. Mark's Square, it was very convenient for transportation and quiet in the evening.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
