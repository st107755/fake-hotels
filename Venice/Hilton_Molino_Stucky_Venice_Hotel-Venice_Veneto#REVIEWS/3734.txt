The hotel is located on an island across from Venice.  They have a boat shuttle that drops you off in Venice.  It is very convenient.  The hotel is quiet and the rooms are very comfortable. If you are lucky to get a water side room the views of Venice are spectacular.  There are also two restaurants attached to the hotel. Both quality.  There is a rooftop bar with great views of Venice also.  All in all if you do not require staying in Venice this is the place.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
