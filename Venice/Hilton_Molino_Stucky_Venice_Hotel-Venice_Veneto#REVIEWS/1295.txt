We stayed at the Hilton molino sticky Venice for two nights during or honeymoon.  We were relieved to see that they offered a shuttle from the hotel to San Marcos square throughout the day and night.   Although on Giudecca, It is convenient and saved us from having to drag a suitcase in search of our hotel through crowds of tourists!   Hotel is beautiful and we really enjoyed the hotel pool and rooftop bar offering great views of the city.   Staff was friendly and helpful!  We are always loyal Hilton fans and this hotel did not disappoint.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 12, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
