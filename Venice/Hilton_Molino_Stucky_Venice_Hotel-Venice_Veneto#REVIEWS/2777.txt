This hotel is beautiful! Hilton did a fantastic job of preserving the history and spirit of the old building while incorporating it into a great hotel! The staff is extremely friendly and almost all speak English very well. The rooms are very nice, and there are lots of dining opportunities within the property. There is not much as far as things to do on the Guidecca island where it is located which is actually a great plus!! You can enjoy the hustle and bustle of San Marcos square and everything on that side during the day and then retire to a nice quiet evening back at the property. One of the highlights is the rooftop pool and bar which offers as great a view of Venice as you'll get. I was here for business, but I will definitely return with my family one day!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 13, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review about our hotel.
