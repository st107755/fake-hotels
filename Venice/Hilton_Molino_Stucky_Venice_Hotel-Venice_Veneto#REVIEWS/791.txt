Really enjoyed the opportunity to use the hotel shuttle to get back and forth to St Marks and the action downtown but walk the quiet streets of Giudecca, enjoying some smaller cafes and restaurants. I was upgraded as a Hilton gold member to a larger room on the 4th floor with beautiful views of the city and the canal traffic. Amenities were great, including the executive lounge. Loved the cocktail hours with some homemade spritzâ€™s. Even though it was chilly during Easter week, we braved the cold and went up to the rooftop bar two evenings. Had drinks, blankets and a beautiful view of the city all lit up. Breakfast buffet was wide ranging and had something for everyone. Would definitely stay again, if I had the opportunity.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 16, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
