I am pleased to read that you had a pleasant stay with us and enjoyed the hotel services and appreciated the architecture and the restoration of this impressive old building which dates back to the 19th century.  I am sorry you were not completely satisfied with our complimentary shuttle service. The capacity is of 39 seats and, as you also suggested, we usualyy inform our guest to be on the dock at least five minutes before leaving hour. May I take this opportunity to inform you that the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. I look forward to welcoming you back to the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
