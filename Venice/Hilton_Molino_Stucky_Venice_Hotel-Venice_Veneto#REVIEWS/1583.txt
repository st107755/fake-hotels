Just a quick visit and was very impressed. Rooms are a good size with a great view. We ate lunch which was really nice, went out for the day in Venice which we were taken over by the exclusive Hilton boat which was nice. After the day in Venice we returned for some  rooftop cocktails which were a little bit expensive but you get what you pay for.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 12, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
