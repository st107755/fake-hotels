Our second stay at Hilton Molino Stucky and again loved it. Located on Giudecca Island you need a boat to get on the main island with St. Marques Square. But actually this is a big asset as itâ€˜s quite, less crowded and lots of small, nice restaurants around.  The staff all around the place is amazing, from check-in to restaurants and pool.  Our executive room with canal view was perfect and the rooftop pool is the best treat after some hours of walking.  Breakfast is served due to Corona and the hotel is doing everything to keep guest safe. We believe this is the best place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 20201 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded 5 weeks agoDear Mr Michael,  Thank you for taking the time to leave such a nice review on TripAdvisor!
