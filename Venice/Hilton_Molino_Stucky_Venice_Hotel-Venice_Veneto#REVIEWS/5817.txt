We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice in August 2008 for 3 nights.  The location is good, Giudecca Island is a short boat ride from Venice, and the hotel has a two an hour shuttle boat service.  There are also several boats that stop at Giudecca that are a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  The hotel is huge. The room was standard; we didn’t have breakfast there as it is quite an expensive hotel.  The staffs were very unfriendly.  We didn’t stay at the hotel much but it s good base for Venice.  However the hotel did have a rooftop swimming pool with beautiful view of Venice.    Venice however, is the most beautiful place I have ever been too and it was worth staying at the Hilton just for that.Read moreDate of stay: August 2008HelpfulShare
