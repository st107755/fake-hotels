We arrived for a night at the Hilton Stucky after backpacking down through Europe. After the heat and the bustle of Venice, arriving at the hotel we found a haven of peace and tranquility. The staff were faultlessly polite and helpful, and our room was huge. The rooftop pool is beautiful and has outstanding views over Venice. The communal areas are spotless and stylish. We had a snack at the Nutella bar which the kids loved, and breakfast in the morning was superb. I can't speak highly enough about the hotel, absolute 5 star quality, we were gutted to leave.
