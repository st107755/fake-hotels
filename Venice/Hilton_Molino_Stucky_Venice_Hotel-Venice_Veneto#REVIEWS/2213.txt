Unlike others here, we had a pretty poor experience at this hotel. It may have just been the time of year we travelled to Venice, but the smell of septic was horrible in the bathroom. The Family Room was OK but average. The bed for the kids was really terrible; teens will not sleep well. Also, we were "trapped" on this island and forced to eat and drink average and over-priced hotel food. I would have given anything for a reasonably priced sandwich or snack.

We are sorry if the location on Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and travellers can still enjoy the vicinity in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a residential area. This island also hosts a number of good and excellent restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
