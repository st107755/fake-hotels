From the minute of arrival to departure we enjoyed our stay.  The room was perfect and ready very early.  The service was superb.  The restaurants were exceptional,  the Skyline bar a fun place to end the day and most of all, the pool with its exceptional view was well appreciated.  And as a bonus staying on Guidecca was ideal, close enough to the main city via the free Hilton shuttle boat but far enough away to enjoy the quiet and calmness.  Venice as it should be.
