We loved this hotel.   It is very nice and well appointed with a fabulous staff.  Every interaction we had with the front desk or concierge was first rate.  They were friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and spoke English very well!  The breakfast was incredibly good.  Our room was large and the bath was large.  Beds were very comfortable and the venetian glass chandelier is the perfect touch to the beautifully decorated room.  The pool has an incredible view and is very comfortable.  Our only complaints were the wait during the evening break for the shuttle ( however we planned accordingly after the first evening) and the fact that we could only stay 2 nights!  I would go back in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2011Dear Guest,  thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
