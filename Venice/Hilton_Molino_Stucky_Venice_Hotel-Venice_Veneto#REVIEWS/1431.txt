This is an excellent hotel, very comfortable. We had inclusive breakfast and had lunch twice at the Rialto Bar. The service and quality of food was excellent. Access to St Marc's by hotel shuttle service which was very reliable and only took about 20mins (worth the extra 6EUR charge per room per stay).
