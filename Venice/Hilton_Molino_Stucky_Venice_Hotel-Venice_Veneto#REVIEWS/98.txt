Hi, so just to make it simple and clear : We paid a 4 nights stay at the Hilton in Venice, and how to say ? First : mold and humidity that nearly sent me to the hospital (will send you a medical certificate on that purpose straight away if you want) We wrote to the hotel to tell them we were coming for our HONEYMOON! Guess what ? We got a twin bed !! How awesome!! What’s next then: complaining to the front desk about all the above : the only response we got from them : “we’re sorry but we’re fully booked” i.e. “not my problem”. Cherry on the cake : we didn’t even have ANY compensation discount or ANYTHING !! How to say this politely ? I am determined to get a full refund ! And I won’t give up on this !! Why that ? YOU RUINED MY HONEYMOON!!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 12, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
