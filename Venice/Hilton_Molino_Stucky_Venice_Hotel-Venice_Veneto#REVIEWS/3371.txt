The hotel itself was good.  However, on our first night eating in it's restaurant was awful.  We waited an hour before an apology came that our order had been overlooked. Then one order was incorrect !  We also had to keep asking for tea and milk for our room. The positioning of the hotel on Molino stucky was a big mistake. We spent so much of our time going back and forth over the canal. There was a free shuttle but it was often too full to get on and constantly checking the time for boats returning was a pain.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 4, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
