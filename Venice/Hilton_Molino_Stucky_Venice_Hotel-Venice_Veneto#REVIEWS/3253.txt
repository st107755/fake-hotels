A large and relatively new Hotel across the lagoon from Venice, the Hilton brand does not meet experiences on the ground.  An ex-freight warehouse, the large cavernous public rooms including bars and restaurants are characterless.  Views from the front of the Hotel look out onto the busy lagoon with shipping continuously using the waterway all night and day.  The wifi is lousy.  Poor hotspots around the hotel.

The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture and our guests usually appreciate its particular and historical atmosphere. I would like also to take this opportunity to inform you that besides our complimentary shuttle and private water taxies, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto line 4.1 - 4.2 and 2) station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we will  have the opportunity of welcoming you back in the future.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
