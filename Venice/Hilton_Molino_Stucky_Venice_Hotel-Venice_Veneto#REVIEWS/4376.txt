It was good to read that you liked the location on the Giudecca island as well as our facilities and the service levels.  We are sorry you did not like the structure of the Hilton Molino Stucky which is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy. Though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture.  The project was approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to this monumental complex, protected by local authorities.  We are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.  Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
