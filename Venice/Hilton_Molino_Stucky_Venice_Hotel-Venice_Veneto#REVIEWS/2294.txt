Our son booked this hotel for us for our wedding anniversary. It is a beautiful hotel, very clean, the staff are amazing,  nothing was too much trouble for them, the food was lovely. It is such a magical place. Short  10 min boat ride across to St Marc's Square, the boat is provided, and is every 10 mins. We would recommend to anyone.
