We booked a king deluxe room with a view of the water and it was gorgeous. The room was clean, large and comfortable. The hotel has a lot on site including a rooftop pool. What really made our stay amazing was how friendly and helpful the staff are. They went above and beyond to help us and even allowed us to have a late check out.  They run a water taxi to and from San Marco and it only takes a few minutes to get there. Having never been to Venice before I was unsure if this location would be close enough to all that we wanted to see and do and the answer is yes it is!  We loved staying here and we will come back and stay here again. We highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
