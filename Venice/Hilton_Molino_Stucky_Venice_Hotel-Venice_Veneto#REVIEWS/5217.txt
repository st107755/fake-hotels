Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and have to say it was a lovely stay.  Venice is beautiful.  This was our first time to Venice and so glad I chose this hotel it was perfect. The location was good. We got a water taxi from the airport to the hotel which was 115 euros which took about 25 mins.   The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable.  We both loved the breakfast which was included in our stay, it was fab and plenty of choice.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The shuttle boat was a great service, always on time.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully return to this hotel in the future.  10 out of 10 !!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Molino Stucky Hilton on tripadvisor.
