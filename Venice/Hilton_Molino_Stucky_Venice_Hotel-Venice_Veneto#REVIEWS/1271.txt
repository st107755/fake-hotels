We were told to book this hotel by friends who had visited it last year, they loved it and we did too. It's a great location away from the claustrophobia of Venice but easily connected with it's own regular ferry. The hotel has been built in the ruins of a flour mill using the footprint of the original building to create a modern but old hotel. Best of both worlds with modern facilities combined with classic 19th century designs. Great room, fantastic views, brilliant service. We would not use any other hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 20, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
