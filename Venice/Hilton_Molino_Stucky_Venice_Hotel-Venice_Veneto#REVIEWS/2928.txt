It will have been two years, almost to the day, but we are on our way back to Hilton Molino Stucky again. This has got to rate as one of our favourite places to stay for the following reasons. It is a fabulous hotel, but you can see that for yourselves in the photographs on the hotel website. It is warm, friendly and very attentive to all our needs. It is reasonably priced when you compare the tariff of other hotels in Venice. But best of all. It is on a quiet island, away from the crush and crowds of the tourist trail. Local people have local shops and hidden away there are some local restaurants. We do the shoulder to shoulder tourist thing during the day but evening brings tranquillity.  The answer to "When did you travel" is incorrect.
