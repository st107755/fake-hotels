The hotel is located a 5 min boat ride from the main island & 10 min from the main square, but don't let this put you off. It's nice returning to the calm location of the Hilton after a busy day on the main islands. There is also no chance of getting lost on the way to the main square, when the boat drops you off directly in front of it.  The hotel itself is very nice & clean. The rooms were large for such a historic European city. Breakfast was quite expensive but there was plenty of choice. The layout of the hotel can be a bit confusing & easy to get lost but that's Venice.  The roof top pool is a great place to watch the sunset; the reflections of the deep orange sky of the pool make quite a good picture.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
