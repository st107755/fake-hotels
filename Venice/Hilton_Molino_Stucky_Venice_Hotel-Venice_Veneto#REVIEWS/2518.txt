We stayed at the Molino Stuckey at the end of our cruise.  I am a Hilton Diamond customer so I had extra perks which made this stay so great.  The Hotel is an old flour mill and beautifully done in an Italian way.  We were in room 506 which is in the front of the hotel with the most unbelievable view.  This was a twin bed executive with lots of room.  This was American sized room decorated beautifully.  My husband was getting a cold and snoring horribly but we could push the beds to either side of the room - most often they are anchored and can't be moved.  We ate breakfast in the dining room and they had a huge assortment of food you could choose from to suit all needs.  We also had access to the executive lounge which was by reception and nicely done and was great at the endâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Madame, thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
