Stylish but corporate-feeling: especially when a big conference is in. Removed from hustle and bustle of Venice by being on one of the quieter islands but don't rely on the hotel shuttle boat to get around - not very frequent and often full (even when not high season) and you get left behind. Luckily vaporetto stop short walk from hotel. Wifi only free in public rooms. Rooftop bar has stunning views but people in hotel rooms under it complained of the noise at night and had to change rooms. We had to change rooms as originally allocated one without the canal view we had paid for. Pleasant enough stay but prefer hotels in walking distance of St Mark's and Rialto.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 13, 2015Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post a review on Tripadvisor..
