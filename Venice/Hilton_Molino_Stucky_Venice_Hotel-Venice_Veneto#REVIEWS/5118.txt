This is not your typical Hilton, the hotel is stunning both inside and out. The service is friendly and very good. There is an amazing rooftop pool and bar that offer excellent views and a free frequent shuttle to St Marks square.   The food and drinks are very overpriced as is the internet, but most hotels the world over are the same!!!!   Great location and we would definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
