A beautiful Hotel with great staff and super helpful. However, I am torn to wether staying on the main island of Venice would have been better.  For luggage purposes no (trying to carry luggage through Venice streets and crowds would be miserable) but for time of transport back and forth and making sure you caught the shuttle yes.   Also, no need for the private taxi unless you want to waste Euros- the public shuttle from parking garages picks you up and drops you off a few blocks from hotel (but not good if you lots of bags or can not carry them bc you have to cross two small bridges) but it will save you 50 Euros!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 11, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your kind review on Tripadvisor.
