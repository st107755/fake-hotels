I spent 2 nights at the Molino stucky on business early November. In brief very clean, spacious and classy. There were regular boats from the hotel to Venice central and the hotel staff were very helpful. A very pleasant stay and I will return soon.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 5, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments.
