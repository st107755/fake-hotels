This hotel is a great hotel in a great location.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Would highly recommend this hotel.  They have water taxi service to different areas of Venice that is very convenient (complimentary).  They also have ticketed water taxi service that can get you to the airport or the cruise dock which makes it very convenient.  The rooftop bar is very cool and gives a great view of Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky!
