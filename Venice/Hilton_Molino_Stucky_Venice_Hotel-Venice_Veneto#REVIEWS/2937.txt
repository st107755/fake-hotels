Great location,views, and staff. Rooms were spacious and comfotable. Stayed two days and had a wonderful experience. Restaurant and bar a bit on the high side but there are many choices within a short walking distance from the hotel  . Shuttle service was convenient and during longer wait times we walked to the local shuttle service as they run more frequently and Is only a short walk from the hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
