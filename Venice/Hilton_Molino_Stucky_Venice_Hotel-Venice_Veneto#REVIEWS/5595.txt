My partner and I stayed at the Molino Stucky for 5 night. The pool area was lovely and the views of Venice are spectacular. The Skyview was far too expensive and such a shame that a nice glass of wine (small) to watch the sun go down cost 10 euro!! Staff in the hotel were not very helpful and ignored my complaint about my room key not working for 2 days!! There is no where in the hotel to buy water or a can of coke etc.. it has to be bought at one of the bars for huge mark up! Generally service in the hotel and the whole of Venice was awful and actually found many waiters/waitresses downright rude. Prices were high even in the back streets and with the lack of customer service made the prices even harder to swallow!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
