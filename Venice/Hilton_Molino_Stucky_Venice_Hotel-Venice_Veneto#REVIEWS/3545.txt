My mother and I stayed here for a week and were very impressed with the hotel. We've stayed at lots of hilton hotels before and found this to be one of the best. Very nice rooms, clean, lovely staff who were always polite and happy to help, great location (with a frequent, punctual hotel shuttle bus and a stop on the public water buses so no need to pull bags to the hotel which is a major benefit and quite unusual in Venice) and really, really good food and drinks throughout the day if you can get into the executive lounge (hilton gold and platinum members only I think). We would definitely go again.
