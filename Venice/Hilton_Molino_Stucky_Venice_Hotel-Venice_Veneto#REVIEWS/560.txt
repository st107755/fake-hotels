I travel for work and have been to a number of Hilton properties around the world... and I think this might be my favorite because of the views and very wide selection at breakfast buffet. They have a corner dedicated to bread and sweets and most if not all are very good. The views from the hotel is just beautiful, especially if you have a room with the waterview.  Excellent customer service.  I have stayed here three times and will come back again if we visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 18, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for your loyalty to Hilton and Molino Stucky.
