I'm delighted that we stayed here, on Guidecca, and away from the crush of tourists instead of near the city center.  We enjoyed quiet and secluded strolls through local and picturesque neighborhoods.  Convenient hotel shuttles pull up to the hotel entry approximately every 15 minutes to take guests to other locations all over the lagoon.  The hotel, first built as a flour mill and also operated as a pasta factory, is renovated into an amazingly beautiful, enormous, and comfortable property.  Our room was cozy and comforting.  Don't miss the rooftop lounge with an Aperol spritz and delicious appetizers.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 23, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
