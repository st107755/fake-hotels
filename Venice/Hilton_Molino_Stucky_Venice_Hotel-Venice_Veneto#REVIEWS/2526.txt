We were very happy with our hotel choice.  The room we had was large with a nice view of the canal.  bed was comfortable and the room had all the amenities I would expect.  Service was friendly.  The sky bar also was a big bonus. Fantastic views and very good cocktails. Not the cheapest, but worth it in my opinion.  Guidecca is a nice place to stay. I enjoyed being able to escape to a more quiet location. Lots of restaurants, shop, bakers nearby. The free boat shuttle (is not actually free) was about 5 minutes to St Marks and ran at regular intervals. We had no issues at all with this. We tried to avoid peak times of travel.  Would return.
