The Hilton Molini Stucky is located on Stucky island acrodd the main island. its away from the crowd and has great views of the city. The rooms are nice & brigh well equiped. The staff is friendly and try and make your stay as comfortable as possible. They have a water shuttle rumming to St. Marco Square every 40mins and charge 4.50 per person for the entire stay. It is really convinient to get around the city. Also the hotel has a free taxi to the Murrano Glass factory to see glass being blown. Overall it was one of the best places to stay in Vinice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
