We had to move three times to get the suite experience we wanted and our tower corner suite offered truly spectacular views. But like the other rooms the furnishings and fabrics worn and the spaces cut up. Lighting bad. Not enough convenient electrical outlets. A re-do badly needed. Even as a diamond member there was little recognition to start, service was spotty, breakfast was pretty crummy. Awful executive lounge. We did like the shuttles and were sent to a lovely restaurant by the concierge desk.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a response after your recent visit at Hilton Molino Stucky.
