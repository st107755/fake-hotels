Booked this hotel strictly on past experiences with hotels in Europe.  The thought was to go with a recognized name and hope we wouldn't be disappointed.  We were concerned about the location but booked it anyway.  The hotel is just off the main tourist area of venice but this proved to work out great for us.  They have a shuttle boat that runs until late so getting back and forth was no issue (the shuttle takes a few minutes to get across).  Being able to escape the crowds late at night and retreat to our own island proved to be a bonus we didn't anticipate.  The hotel is quiet and the rooms were ver comfortable.  We never did eat at the hotel but we did enjoy a drink at the rooftop bar where the view was amazing.  The pool is on the roof and is something we plan on going backâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
