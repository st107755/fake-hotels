A perfect setting in the hustle and bustle of Venice. Taking the courtesy shuttle boat across the canal to Giudecca island is well worth it to take advantage of the peace and tranquility the Molino Stucky has to offer. The rooms are lovely with fantastic views over the canal. Take a trip up to the rooftop bar for even more great views. As with most hotels in Venice this does not come cheap but the service is excellent and the breakfast is amazing. It is worth upgrading to an executive room if you can as you have access to free drinks and snacks in the executive bar.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
