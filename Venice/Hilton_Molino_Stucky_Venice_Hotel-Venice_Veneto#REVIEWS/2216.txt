Really nice hotel and staff friendly and helpful we had use of the executive lounge and that was really useful rooms are lRge with great views   Breakfast was available in the executive lounge or dining room with a lot of choice. The roof top bar was quite expensive and not as amazing as I thought it might be and the drinks were really not worth the price but to be expected the cocktails were around £28 and a very small glass of wine £10Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
