I stayed at this hotel for two nights in Venice. The hotel was in a great location and was easily accessible with the various water taxi boats. There was a free shuttle service to two locations provided by the hotel, which was east to use. The hotel was very nice, and we enjoyed drinks on the roof top bar, but were unable to access the pool due to a "private booking" from another guest. The room was comfortable, but I was surprised at how small it was. The bathroom was a good size and had a full size bathtub.  The staff were always very pleasant and helpful with figuring out which water taxi to take and giving estimates of how long it would take to get to the destination. I would recommend staying here and will stay here again if I return to Venice in the future.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
