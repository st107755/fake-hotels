Everything you would expect from the Hilton Brand.  Great rooms, very clean, beautiful decorating and you get nickled and dimed for everything.  It was also across the water from "downtown" Venice, which means you can take the vaporetto bus (7.50E/pp) or the Hilton Shuttle (free) which runs once an hour.  If I were to do it again I would spend the extra money and stay "downtown" much more convienent and walkable from the Train Station.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
