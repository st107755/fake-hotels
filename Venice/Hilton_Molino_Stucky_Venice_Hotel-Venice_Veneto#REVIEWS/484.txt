Although this hotel is conveniently located (great access to water taxis throughout Venice).  The hotel is nothing spectacular.  Additionally they failed to provide adequate customer service (they wouldn’t break a $50 euro unless you purchased something) despite staying at the hotel.  In fairness it might have been Regent Cruise’s fault. They were so busy taking care of arriving and departing cruise guests....they didn’t take care of those of us that stayed there.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor, we are sorry that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky was not up to your expectations.
