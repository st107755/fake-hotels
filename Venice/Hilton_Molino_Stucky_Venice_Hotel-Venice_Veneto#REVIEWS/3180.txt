Lovely hotel in a historic building which has been refurbished to a high standard. The shuttle boat is really handy and we preferred staying just outside of the hustle and bustle of the main squares. The spa could be a bit better (and I would expect it to be included in the price) but rooms are lovely and the rooftop bar was also good. Internet wifi is payable which was a bit cheeky. All in all an excellent stay though.
