The room is fine and what you would find at any Hilton but the service staff were not friendly and at times unhelpful. Simple requests like getting ice were ignored. Our trip coincided with a big convention so most of their attention was to the group and not the individuals. The hotel is in Giudecca and although they provide shuttle service, keep in mind that it is out of the way. And as for their food, at first the breakfast buffet looks very impressive but the actual taste of the food was mediocre at best. Would not choose this place again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
