I was initially concerned about some of the reviews I read here, but so very glad I went with my instinct to stay in a chain hotel.  Hiltons are nice & the avg cost per night is reasonable.  This one in particular was very well appointed, provided shuttle service to San Marco, & the Concierge was helpful.  I would definitely stay here again, just not when the cruise crowd is in residence.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
