We enjoyed nearly everything about this hotel - it is a terrific re-purposing of a vintage building and the views of Venice are spectacular.  The website uses photos of a wonderful rooftop pool that was not available to us during our stay, which was a disappointment.  Our room was very comfortable with a great view.  We will likely stay here again, but only after making certain that the pool is operational.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 12, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you have appreciated the hotelâ€™s facilities and services as well as the restoration of this interesting and historical building. I am sorry on the other hand to hear that you have been disappointed by the fact that our pool was not open yet as the opening period is also mentioned on our website at http://molinostuckyhilton.it/gusta/piscina-panoramica.html. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that it is open on a seasonal basis (mid May to September) while the Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day of the year (from 5pm until after midnight) and our guests can enjoy a unique and spectacular view over the city of Venice and its lagoon. We thank you for being our guest and we look forward to welcoming you again in the warmer season. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
