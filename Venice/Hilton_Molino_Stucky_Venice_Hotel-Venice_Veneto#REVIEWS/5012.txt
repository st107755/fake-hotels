Great hotel.  Nice slippers, robes, bathroom and overall size.  You must get the breakfast when you book your room.  It's a nice buffet and it gets your day started fast, no need to look for a place to eat.  Wi-fi was down when we got there but it worked on the second day and it's free.  There is a complimentary shuttle wich is a perfect way to get to the sites.  It's also a great place to stay if you are going on a cruise.  It's only 8 euros to the cruise port with Alinigua (http://alilaguna.it/en).Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
