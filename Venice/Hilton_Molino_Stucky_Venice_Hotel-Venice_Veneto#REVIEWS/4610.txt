We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a cruise. The staff was helpful, and upgraded us into a fantastic room. The lounge with the complimentary items was a nice touch. The water taxi picks up right at the hotel making it easy to get around. We really enjoyed this property and have recommended it to others.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
