Lovely friendly and welcoming staff, impressive room with everything working. Good atmosphere and a great breakfast selection. Only had dinner once as we were too tired to go out on the first night, it was OK but expensive for what it was. Very happy with the free boat taxi which is easy to get with regular journeys to St Mark's Square so it's easy to walk to all the main attractions. We left our luggage at the hotel on the last day before getting an evening flight and we managed to mislay one ticket, even then, the hotel staff were polite and helpful. Luckily we found the ticket in the end. We had a quiet room on the corner so we had two fantastic views, would love to come back one day!Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 25, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
