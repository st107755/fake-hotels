Everything about this property is amazing.  This hotel has everything and customer service is top notch.  The property is beautifully furnished.  Nice open business center with computers set up for multiple languages. The roof top swimming pool and bar have gorgeous views.  They have their own transportation to San Marco, only $4.50/person for your entire stay. They have the most wonderful buffet breakfast with so many offerings.  We had junior suite, large living room, dining room, wet bar, large bedroom and bathroom with soaking tub and separate shower.  The pillow top bed was so comfortable, the linens high quality, complete with down comforter and  feather pillows.  I wish I could have stayed longer!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 7, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
