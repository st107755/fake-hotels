My husband and I stayed at this Hotel for a short trip to Venice. Really enjoyed the free bus ride to San Marco, hourly service.  A good hearty breakfast, clean rooms with Mosquito repellent plug in. We loved it!  Saint Mark's Basilica was really beautiful, especially in the evening, there is a HUGE square with the most exquisite architecture with cafes and restaurants with mini orchestras, it was magical. so relaxing! We loved it!  Gondola rides were really pricey, but enjoyed walking around instead. Just a word of warning, Mosquito repellents needed, when sitting at a cafe in front of the water edge, but don't let that put you off!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
