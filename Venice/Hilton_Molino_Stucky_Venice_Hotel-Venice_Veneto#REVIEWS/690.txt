Just got back from an amazing week in Venice staying at the Hilton Molino Stucky. The views and location are superb.    Had the best truffle risotto ever at the restaurant and were welcomed by the guest services with Ballinis, Swan towels and a lovely note from the Hilton team.  The team at the rooftop deck pool were also very good and looked after us.  A few words or comments for improvement: 1) the food and drink prices in the hotel are not just high, they are extortion. 25 Euro for a cheeseburger and 27 euro for a club sandwich cannot be justified in any LSM group!! You are driving people out of the hotel with such prices. 27 euros for breakfast is also robbery. If you are a person who gorges on masses of food for breakfast then that is the only way to get value for that…Read moreDate of stay: June 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
