We stayed here for two nights at the end of our cruise. At first we were disappointed not to be on the main island but once we settled in we saw why our tour operator had chosen the Hilton. The building is amazing - an imaginative conversion of a number of huge buildings that used to be a pasta mill, run by Signor Stucky!  The food is great and the staff go the extra mile.  Two things stand out. One is the rooftop bar and pool with its incredible views. The other is the freedom to walk along what is still a village street with a bakery, butchers and a few cafes. Catch it quick before it gets gentrified!  Oh, and the hotel shuttle boat works very well and is free.
