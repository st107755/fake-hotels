My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in an executive club room. We had a private water taxi from the airport, which drops you off literally at the front of the hotel. Check-in was efficient and as we had arrived early evening our room was ready. Our room (#129) was spacious and clean, with a king bed located on the first floor. We had booked a court yard view, and although if you got close to the window, you could see a courtyard, in essence we had a view of a wall of another part of the building (not a problem for us). Room was clean and promptly serviced every day. The location of the room was also very quiet. The executive lounge was open all day for self serve soft drinks and snacks and alcohol between 5-7pm (choice of wine or beer only), which was freely available.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for your detailed review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
