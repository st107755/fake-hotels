I did not want to write a review about his hotel, but I do it anyway. Why ? Because I liked the enthousiasm of the staff. There we faults, surely. But everyone tried so hard to make up, I could not help to be touched. One thing is great: the rooms are large, the beds very good and the showers excellent. What else do you need ? The pool comes in handy at 90 F in the afternoon. And the rates are fairly low. But do not order a beer in the bar !   Special mention to Papa, the concierge. He is a great guy.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
