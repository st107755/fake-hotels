Not in the center but with the hotel own shuttle boat the perfect location. The hotel was pretty full because of the carneval in Venice - nevertheless we had never the impression it was loud or crowded - even at the breakfast buffet.  One of the biggest advantages is clearly the free boat shuttle to the Piazza San Marco. One has to be in time at the landing stage - only the first 40 or so are allowed on the boat and especially at night it means waiting for an hour or taking a water taxi ...   Services provided by the concierge was perfect. They all were very helpful in giving advice to their guests.   Overall a very nice hotel and properly maintained.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive feedback with regards to your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky during Carnival.
