Stayed here over new year, was expecting a high 4 star/ 5 star experience based on the few hotel reviews I had read but I wouldn't put it in that category. It's still lovely and  venice is amazing, the hotel is clean but the location is awful in winter and the 'executive' room was more standard. The complimentary food and drinks for the exec rooms were whipped away bang on time or had run out.  My partner had read the 'bad reviews' so knew about the problems with the boats but luckily hadn't told me. Your day needed to be planned around them or else you had to pay to get to the main venice bit and figure out the right boats.

We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  our Guests can enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  With regards to our shuttle boat, may I take this opportunity to confirm that besides our complimentary service, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
