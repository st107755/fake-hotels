Loved the Molino Stucky! We had amazing service, and the attention to detail was superb. Everyone was gracious and helpful. We felt very welcomed and would absolutely recommend it and stay here again. Btw, the free shuttle across the Giudecca Canal was perfect; we never took any other transportation.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 22, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
