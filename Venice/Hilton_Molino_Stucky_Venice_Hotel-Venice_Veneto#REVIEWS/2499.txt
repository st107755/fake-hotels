A grand hotel situated in a grand historic building. Shuttle boats provided for hotel guests, they levy a charge for the shuttle boats regardless if you ride or not.  Breakfast was a very good spread.  The room meanwhile was one of the nicest I ever been in, with wooden ceilings and a chandelier inside.  Location was hard to walk to at first eventhough the building can be seen from another island. However once you know the way, both left and right of the hotel have easy access to waterboat points to catch the boats.  Get the view overlooking the water and just gaze at the water traffic.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 24, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
