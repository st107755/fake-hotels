Stay was very enjoyable, hotel was top quality with amazing service. Staff were very friendly and happy to help with anything, can't praise them enough. Hotel is beautiful and very clean. Only had one problem, the A/C in our room was broke so it was warm at night, but it was bareable. Very happy with my stay, will return to this hotel when back in Venice. P.s take advantage of the hotel shuttle boat service, it is such a good perk.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 18, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
