Our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was a great experience and perfect start of our Italian vacation. Not to be missed. the rooftop pool and bar with views of ALL of Venice and a beautiful scene at night with the lights of Venice below. We want to thank staffer Daniel for his assistance in a small problem we had during our stay. The boat shuttle was always there for us to access the different points in Venice and the staff of the hotel was terrific and helpful. This hotel is super clean and I wish we had more time to stay....maybe nexttime.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 15, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for your kind review.
