Great building on Giudecca. The rooms were a decent size and the bed large with goose down pillows. The free shuttle to Zattere/St Marks is really useful. The staff are friendly and the bar had great views of Venice. There are some nice restaurants nearby and the area feels generally a lot less touristy than the rest of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
