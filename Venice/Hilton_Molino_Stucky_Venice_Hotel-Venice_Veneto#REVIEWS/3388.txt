This was my second visit to Venice and had heard from friends that Venice had become increasingly crowded and touristy.  If this a concern of yours, the Hilton Stucky Molino may be a good choice!  We stayed as the last stop on a deluxe tour, and noticed that the spectacular view from the pool deck was the cover for the company's European brochure. The photos we shot there were equally as good!  Since it is located on Guidecca, across from Venice, you can see the channel and the charming buildings illuminated by twilight.  The Hilton has a free, prompt and fun shuttle service boat which drops you off near St. Mark's Square.  Whenever we crossed the channel, we breathed a sigh of relief. You can also pay to take the ACTV public transportation boats to Guidecca from San Zaccarroâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting an exhaustive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your positive comments on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
