Stayed for 3 nights last week - first room we were given #536 - supposedly an executive/deluxe room with king size bed - at the rear of the hotel with a view overlooking a flat roof with some kind of storage tanks, this was quite a pokey room, and not at all what we were expecting - we asked to change to a 'room with a view' - Venice, canals, iconic buildings, 5* hotel and prices - quickly shown a room on 2nd floor - #203, as only one available this was much bigger having a view onto the water taxi pontoon and across the Giudecca canal to the city, said we would take this at an extra 30 euros per night!  Room and hotel exceptionally clean, staff as you would expect in 5* hotel, not too busy so public rooms, bar etc. lacked some atmosphere, especially the Skyline bar on the roof.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 11, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
