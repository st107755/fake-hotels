as diamond at Hilton and Platinum at Marriot i've stayed at a number of great hotels.  The European versions of these chains tend to be nicer than their US relations but among the extremely nice hotels we've stayed at in Europe, the Molino Stucky Hilton stands out.   Very attentive staff - all interested in making your stay in Venice enjoyable.  Concierge folks are great; Spa quite nice; easy transportation on the Hilton boat to Zattere or St Marks where you can start your walk or pick up the waterbus.  Rooftop Pool is a great place to relax after walking over 50 or 60 bridges on a short walk in the city.  Not the first time we've been here but it lived up to our memories..  It is pricey.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
