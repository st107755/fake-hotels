The staff at the reception was very friendly, the room was just fine (and ready 3 hours before the official check-in time!). It had a great view (be sure to ask for the frontal view). The carpet in the room could have been cleaner. Otherwise, for Venice, where you will NOT be spending much time in your room, the hotel was just perfect. The hotel boats are punctual. Make sure you are not late, otherwise you will be wasting time waiting for the next boat. My only major complaint is the quality of the breakfast, which was really poor (completely tasteless). The same applied to the food in the Executive Lounge (to which we had access because of our status, but it looks like there is nothing there to be envious about).Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 24, 2016Dear  Guest, Thank you for your feedback which certainly helps us to monitor and improve our services.
