Located near the port of Venice the Molino Stucky is convenient for tourists arriving Venice by ship.  While it is located a bit away from city center the hotel provides excellent complimentary transportation to and from St. Mark's Square on a frequent schedule.  The rooms are well appointed and the beds are very comfortable.  Being away from the touristy sections it is a quiet location.  The hotel amenities are excellent and offer the tourist or businessman most anything they would want.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
