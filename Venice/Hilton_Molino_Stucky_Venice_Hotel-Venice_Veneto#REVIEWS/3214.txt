The Hotel is very Good, The rooms are very Big and the beds are big too, the breakfast is very good, a lot of options, and the spa is good but you have to pay 30 euros for entrance. the shutter service is very good and it works in every 30 minutes, from giudecca to san marco. Venice have a BIG BIG problem, all the hotels are very old, and smell not very good, and Hilton is not very old, that is the best thing about the hotel. the only problem about the hotel, is that at night you become a hostage of the hotel at night, because there is nothing to eat in Giudecca, so the food there is very terrible,  and very expensive, like 50 euros for a poorly made spaghetti pomodoro.  Apart from the food, the hotel is very good, clean, and the shutter really works.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 17, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to write a review about our hotel on Tripadvisor.   We are pleased you enjoyed your stay and liked our rooms and breakfast.   May I please point out that the access to our SPA is actually 20 euros , not 30 as you mention in your review.   Giudecca is linked to the rest of Venice by the ACTV public service, which runs 24 hours a day with a boat every 10 minutes during the day, 20 at night, therefore our guests may enjoy food in Venice at any time and come back whenever they please.    We are sorry if you did not like our food and will pass your comment to the Executive Chef, so that we will improve our service.   We thank you and look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
