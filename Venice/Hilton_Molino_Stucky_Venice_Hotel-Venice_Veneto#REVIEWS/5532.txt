I was at this hotel with my boyfriend and because he is a diamond member we received an upgrade which meant a wonderful room with a gorgeous view. The best place in this hotel is the pool located on the roof of the building which lets you have an overview of the Venice. It's such a great panorama especially at night, when you have the feeling that you are in a fairytale.  The executive lounge has also a very inspired location, on the ground floor, with a great sight.Read moreDate of stay: December 2009HelpfulShare
