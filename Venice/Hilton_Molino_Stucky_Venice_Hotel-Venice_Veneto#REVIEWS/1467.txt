Stayed for one night while in Venice.     I highly recommend setting up an Honors account (if you're not a member) because the pre-arrival information was invaluable. Their water taxi is convenient, inexpensive and easy to use.  We went to the spa for 2 hours and it was unbelievably relaxing.  Also visited their rooftop bar with a beautiful view of the city.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Highly recommend.
