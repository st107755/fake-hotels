We had stayed here for New Year a few years ago and it was just like coming home. We were upgraded to a room with a view overlooking Venice and it was an added bonus. One of the major highlights was the huge chandelier which gives you and idea of the height of the ceiling. Breakfast is always a wonderful experience here with a magnificent choice. For me the pancakes were wonderful.. The executive lounge is a bit smaller than some Hiltons but the situation is ideal. The shuttle across to the mainland is extremely convenient and well worth the â‚¬6 added to the bill.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
