Stayed here for a night on my way through Europe with a few families.  The hotel is a truly beautiful full service hotel.    Quick Pros   1.  The sky deck and pool are out of this world.  Amazing sunset view of Venice and the kids swam while we all had a drink or two...don't miss it! 2.  Large modern rooms with typical American Amenities.  We had a suite and it was giant..large master bedroom, huge bath with a great shower and a living room with a small kitchen and pull out sofa.

We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.  From our Skyline Terrace and Pool the view over the city and  the lagoon has indeed no equal in Venice and we are glad that you could enjoy it. On the other hand we are sorry if the location on Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; however the Giudecca island is closer to the city centre and St. Mark’s Square than other areas in town. Besides our shuttle and private water taxi services, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / line 2) station is only a few minute walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again with your family. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
