Two friends and I shared a room for three nights at the Hilton. One friend was on crutches, and we were thrilled to find that the hotel could accommodate us with a wheelchair with only a day's notice. The staff was helpful, courteous and professional. The views from the roof are unbeatable. The only consideration to keep in mind is that because the hotel is on Giudecca, it does require an extra boat ride to reach almost all of the sights. The hotel provides a shuttle but there can be a long wait time. Sometimes the shuttle has to leave some people behind if it is too full. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
