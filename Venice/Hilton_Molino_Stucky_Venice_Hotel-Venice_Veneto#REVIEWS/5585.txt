Stayed in an executive room with lounge access. The lounge is actually a separate part of the Rialto bar downstairs but still ok for drinks and snacks. We found the location of the hotel excellent and the shuttle boat well functioning. The hotel is beautiful and the view over Venice astonishing! Agree about the breakfast. The breakfast room is not nice and the service is not good. The food is ok, though.  Still, at least the exec rooms are great, the views over Venice are stunning and the pool is very nice to have in the summerRead moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
