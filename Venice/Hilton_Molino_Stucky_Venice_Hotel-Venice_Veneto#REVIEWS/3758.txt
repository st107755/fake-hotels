Very convenient location. Free frequent shuttles to and from St Marks Square. Very quiet. We stayed in an executive level room and it was great. Lounge is rather small but there is a good variety of snacks and breakfast selections. Would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 16, 2014Dear Madame,
