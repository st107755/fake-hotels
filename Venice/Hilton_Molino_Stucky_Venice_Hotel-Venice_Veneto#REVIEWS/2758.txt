This is the second time we've been to Venice and probably the best time. Our whole stay was fabulous. Great breakfasts in the mornings and also great Nutella bar with amazing treats! We found it very good to be on Giudecca and not on the main island of Venice. There was only one moment that upset our holiday and that was when we got charged at the end of the holiday for using the hotel shuttle (7 Euros) even though it had been advertised as being free. However, looking at literature after getting home we realised that you had to pay if you got off the boat at St Mark's, which we did not. All in all, a fantastic holiday.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review.
