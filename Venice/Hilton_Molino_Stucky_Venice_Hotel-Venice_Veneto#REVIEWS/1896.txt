The hotel itself is mordern and well equipped with everthing you would expect at a 5 star hotel. However, its location is a little far from the central tourist sites.  I loved the swimming pool, with a very beautiful view. But since it is an outside pool, early morning, late afternoon would be the best time to swim.  All in all I would recommend this hotel to peolpe who have more time , maybe more than 3 days,  because you will need the time to travel from the hotel to your destination.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on the hotel’s facilities.
