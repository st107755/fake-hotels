The rooms were nice, but that's about it.  The hotel layout is TERRIBLE. Only 1 elevator worked (we would sneak in to the service elevator)., the nice rooftop bar was closed at weird times, at breakfast they ran out of syrup and they didn't replace it through our stay.  Bypass this hotel and get one IN Venice.  Hotel Monaco is a much nicer hotel and location.Read moreDate of stay: April 2008HelpfulShare
