This hotel is gorgeous, which blends well since Venice itself is beautiful beyond belief. There are so many things this hotel has to offer, beware, it’s very easy to get lost when searching for a restaurant, your room, the front desk, or the spa. Just consider it part of the experience. The service is fantastic and so hospitable. Can’t wait to visit again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 31, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
