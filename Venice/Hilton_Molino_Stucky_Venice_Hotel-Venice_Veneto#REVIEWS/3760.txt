Another trip to italy with my daughter this time to Venice.  We treated ourselves to this hotel for 4 nights.  The hotel and the rooms were excellent in this large converted mill.  The staff were so friendly and helpful.  We payed a little extra to use the executive suite which was open all day for breakfast, daytime snacks and drinks and 5-7pm free snacks, wine, beer, soft drinks and coffee.  The rooftop pool was a bonus after a warm day sightseeing.  Would definately visit again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 16, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on Tripadvisor.
