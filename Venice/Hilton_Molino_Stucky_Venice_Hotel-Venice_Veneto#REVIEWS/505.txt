I visited this hotel with my mother sadly for only one night as we stayed in the main area for the other two.  Well what can I say, amazing service, every member of staff was pleasant and helpful.  Lovely boat ride in Hiltons own shuttle, what a joy having had an awful experience of a private transfer from the airport a few days previous.  The skybox is fantastic though you need to be on the high stools otherwise its a tad pointless.  Breakfast was fine though if I"m honest slightly overpriced had we not already paid as part of the room booking.  Rooms were comfortable and clean.  Would definitely recommend this rather than staying in main area, its lovely and quiet so refreshing to escape the vast crowds.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 22, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
