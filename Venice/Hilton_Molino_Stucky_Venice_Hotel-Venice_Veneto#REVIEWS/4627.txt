We stayed for one night at Moleno Stucky...is on a separate island and so it takes longer to get to everything (although its probably only a 15-20 min boat ride to St.Marco square.  The hotel is clean but had a weird smell of cheap cologne.  Everything is very expensive...any drink at the lobby bar is over 10 euro. We asked for a room with a view but they put us in a room with a lovely view of a fire escape.  When we wanted a cup of milk at 1230 am we had to order room service and it cost 12 euro! Then room service came into our room at 9am while we were still sleeping and woke us up. We told them to leave...but the lobby phoned us at 930 asking us to come down and pay our bill...even though check out was before 12. The breakfast was good...worth the 10-12 euros we paid for it. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear  Guest, Thank you for your feedback which certainly helps us to monitor and improve our services.
