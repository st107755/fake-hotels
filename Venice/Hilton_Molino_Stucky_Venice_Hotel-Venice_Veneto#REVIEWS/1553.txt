It had been a lovely experience staying in this hotel. All the staffs were so friendly and very helpful. We felt really welcome. We also like its location as very nice and quite. The shuttle definitely is a plus point. We could reach the city within no time which is so conveniently and go back to a quite and relaxing place for rest. I would definitely go back to stay when we are next visiting Venice.
