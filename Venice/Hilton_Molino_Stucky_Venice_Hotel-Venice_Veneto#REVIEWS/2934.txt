Had the 2nd floor room looking onto waterway.  Absolutely stunning. Upgraded the room for 40 euros more.  Breakfast was top class as was the advantage of executive club lounge.  Staff were really helpful.  Free shuttle bus service to st marks allowed you to see the sights but have peace and quiet away from the throngs.  Also couple of really good restaurants very nearby as well as the Hilton restaurants in the stucky.   Would highly recommend as a Base from which to see Venice.
