The Molino Hilton certainly treated us well. The hotel is away from the "mexican border town" ambiance of San Marco Island and doesn't allow europeans to smoke at the outdoor restaurant. The standard room was fine and the hotel is quiet.      It has been 26 year since I last was in Venice and what I thought was pure romance is now just a tourist trap. Don't even bother to go to San Marco if the 7 cruise ships with their 11,000 people are in town. And the smoking! I choked multiple times just walkng down the street. What is more disgusting is sitting at an outdoor cafe and having 4 people sit next to you and all lite up.      The Hilton has none of that annoyance. If you have to go to Venice it is a good place to stay, but I certainly would not reccommend anywhere in the mainâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
