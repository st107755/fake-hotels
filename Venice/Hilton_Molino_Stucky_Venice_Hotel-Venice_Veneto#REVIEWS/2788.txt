We are very sorry to read that your stay was not up to your expectations and would like to apologize if you had an inconvenience, especially with the noise.   We will investigate about what happened exactly with the dog in the other room, the noise from the boat and the price of the taxi. We believe there was a misunderstanding with our Concierge, as they always give very precise quotation and information, so we just find strange that you were quoted the wrong amount. We will check anyway with the watertaxi company to see what happened and avoid future misunderstandings.   We hope you will decide to give us another opportunity to show you that we can improve.  Please accept our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience and we look forward to welcoming you back.   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
