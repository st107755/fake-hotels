After spending a fortune on a lovely upgraded room for my 30th Birthday my boyfriend and I checked out. We asked if we could shower as our water taxi was not arriving until 17:20... to our dismay we were told we had to pay 20 euros for a shower! 20 euros! We'd just finished up paying for our stay and they wanted more just so we could freshen up before our flight home. I was outraged, asked to speak to the manager... 'There is a shower by the pool' I was told... in front of all the other guests?! 'Yes, he explained' ... 'would you let your wife, girlfriend, partner...child! ..shower outside in front of everyone?!' I couldn't believe it. I was told there was nothing that could be done. An absolute disgrace of a hotel, who treats their guests like that?! Will never come back hereâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2017Dear Madame, thank you for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are sorry about your disappointment upon check-out. If possible we are happy to offer a transit room for needs such as yours but due to high season and high occupancy we were not able to do so this time as all room were sold. This is why you were given  the opportunity to use our SPA facility for the amount of 10 euros per person. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
