Beautiful hotel on the island of Giudecca. It takes quite some time to get here from the airport, but it is worth it. The hotel is located in a former pasta factory, beautiful building. We enjoyed the rooftop swimming pool, with excellent view on the Canal. Breakfast was nice, and we could enjoy several bars and restaurants. The hotel has its own ferry service to the San Marco square which is very convenient. But the island of Giudecca is a nice discovery in itself, with many nice restaurants along the watersideRead moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
