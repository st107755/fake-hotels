First time we stayed out of central Venice and did not regret as there was more space without the crowds.  Although it is located on the island of Giudecca, it was 20 minutes by boat (excluding wait time) from St. Marks Square. The hotel provided a shuttle boat service for a relatively nominal amount billed on checkout.  The room was large and clean but the walls were thin and we could hear neighbours.   The buffet breakfast was excellent.  Staff was friendly and informative.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
