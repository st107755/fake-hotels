Our stay in the Hilton Molino Stucky was nothing short of perfect. The hotel is an old flour mill turn into a luxury hotel, the view from our room was totally amazing (see picture below) It is located in the Giudecca island. A quite and beautiful area to walk , shop or eat, there are many little restaurants and art galleries far from all the heavy tourist area. The hotel has a wonderful roof top bar a spa a couple of restaurants and a boat that goes to plaza San Marco every 15 minutes. I totally recommend this hotel Is Beautiful and very convenientRead moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 13, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
