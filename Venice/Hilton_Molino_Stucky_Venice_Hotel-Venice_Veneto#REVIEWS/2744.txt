Service great-shuttle boat to Venice is punctual and efficient. We were allowed to check out 3hrs late with no charge or fuss, which allowed us to spend our last few hours by the pool. Pool area lovely with amazing view of Venice as was the 8th floor rooftop bar.  Breakfast excellent choice of everything.  Staff really friendly and helpful.
