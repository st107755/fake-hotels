Positives: Huge hotel, new interior with clean and modern rooms. Negatives:  A bit of a boat ride to downtown.  Hotel boat is not easy to find and nearby vendors could not help.  This is a beautiful hotel with great staff.   The only downside is that it's not in the middle of the main land area.  In the future, I would probably pay a little more to be in the center of it all.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
