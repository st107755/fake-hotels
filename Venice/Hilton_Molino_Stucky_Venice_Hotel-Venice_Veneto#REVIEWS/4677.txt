We stayed at the Molino Stucky for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it.  The hotel is on a small island a short water taxi ride from the main island in Venice. We enjoyed coming back to "our small island" after a day walking of around in Venice. The water taxi made the trip easy and short. From the airport, we took the bus and then the normal Venice water buses.    The rooms are extremly spacious, with a large, comfy double bed and a nice and clean bathroom featuring a shower and a bathtub.  Staff was helpful and nice.   The breakfast buffet is incredible: A large selection of everything, ranging from sweet pastry to omlettes and ! gluten free bread is served for breakfast and there is an small corner dedicated to gluten free food with the most amazing gluten free chocolateâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review.
