My family and I stayed at this Hilton for 3 nights and this has been one of the best experiences we have ever had.  We travel a lot and I rarely post a review , however this was an exception, and  truly a magnificent experience.  The rooms facing Venice have beautiful viewed, and the staff is professional, courteous and friendly.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 10, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your excellent review on Trip Advisor and sharing your opinion on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
