Just returned from a stay here.  Great and helpful staff, great rooms.  Be sure to check out the spa and the relaxation room.  Free ferry from outside the hotel across the water is very handy and the bus from the hotel also drops you right outside.  Looking forward to another trip to Venice and will be staying here again.  Must checkout the rooftop pool, when the sun is out.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 9, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting such positive review about your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
