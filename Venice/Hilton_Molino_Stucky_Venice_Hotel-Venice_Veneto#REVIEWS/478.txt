This Hotel is located on an island away from the main part of Venice. Very nice hotel with shuttle taxi boat to San Marcos square. Also available is the water bus service that will take you anywhere in Venice. Be aware that though the hotel is off the main island, while we were there several cruise lines used this hotel for a Venice destination stop.I would highly recommend this location if traveling to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for choosing to stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky.
