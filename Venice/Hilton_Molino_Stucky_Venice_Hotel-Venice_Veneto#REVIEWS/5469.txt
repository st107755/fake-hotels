We stayed at this property for one night following a cruise.  We had been looking forward to it for almost a year, after seeing photos of the hotel on its website.  We are Hilton Hhonors members and used points to pay for the stay.  We arrived at 10:00 a..m and were pleasantly surprised that a room was available for us to check into immediately.  That is where the "pleasant" ended.  The king-bedded room was very small and dark.  There was one tiny window that looked out directly onto another building of the hotel (the hotel has 4 buildings.)  Since we did not plan to spend much time in the room, it was not a big deal.  The fitness center was small, dimly lit, and only had 2 machines that were usable.  There was a beautiful pool with an incredible view on the top (8th) floor. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
