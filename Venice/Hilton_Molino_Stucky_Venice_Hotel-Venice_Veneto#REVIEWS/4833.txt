Very impressive building externally but inside it seems over large and impersonal. The main room for breakfast is huge and canteen like although the quality of the breakfast is very good.  Our room was ok but not up to five star standard. There were stains on the carpet and curtains and a mould stain on the ceiling. The roof top pool area has terrific views and plenty of sunbeds but the water in the pool is very cold even on a hot day few people were swimming. Giudecca is not a very interesting island so all sightseeing involves a boat ride. Hotel shuttle boat is useful and reliable.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we did not meet all your expectations. Please accept our apologies for the issues in the room: there are no excuses for the cleaning standards not being up to the expected levels and I have personally addressed the problems to our Executive Housekeeper for action and procedure review. I am also sorry you found the temperature of the water in the pool to be cold as the pool is indeed heated to a level which is considered an average safe level of standard sanitary rules. We do hope to have the opportunity of welcoming you back in the future. Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
