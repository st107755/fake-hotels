The hotel is on an island on the southside of Venice, and at 8 stories high is one of the tallest buildings around Venice.  The rooftop swimming pool and lounge are great for taking in the sunset while looking over all of Venice.  The staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean.  There is a shuttle that takes guests to the mainland every 30 minutes, so getting around is convenient.Read moreDate of stay: May 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
