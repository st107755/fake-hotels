The private taxi provided by the hotel made it quite easy to St Marks Square and they ran fairly frequently.   Pool area was seriously crowded and is reasonably small for the size of the hotel.   The breakfast was great - huge selection and very nice staff. The reception staff too were welcoming and great with children, which always leaves you with a great first impression.   We had a family suite, which was great - large room plus lounge, with 1 1/2 bathrooms. We really liked the layout of this room, it had enough space for 4 people to relax.   Standard rooms are adequate - not large, but ok.   Some furnishings are a bit tired and in need of updating. Overall however we loved the hotel and would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 14, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to review us on Tripadvisor.
