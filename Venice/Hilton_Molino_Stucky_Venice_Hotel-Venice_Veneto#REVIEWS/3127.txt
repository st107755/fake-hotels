We know, Venice is busy. Even on a weekend in March the city is crowded with visitors from all over the world. For me this is fine, to get away form the crowd I love to stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky on the Guidecca island, 10 minutes with the free shuttle boat to San Marco. The hotel has a very dedicated staff, they are friendly and fast. The place is special, as it is a former industrial building from the turn of the century, now converted into a luxury hotel. I still do not like to shower in the bathtub concept, other than that even the standard room is big enough for a week to stay. The Skyline bar is a must, make sure you are served by Michele, he is cool and knows the drinks.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 30, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your kind review on this website.
