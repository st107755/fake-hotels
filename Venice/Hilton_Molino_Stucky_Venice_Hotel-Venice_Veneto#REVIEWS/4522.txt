We stayed here before a Regent cruise and enjoyed the quiet of Giudecca Island and the Molino Stucky Hotel, away from the Piazza San Marco, which was teeming with tourists even in mid April. The hotel's vaporetto gets you back and forth to the island twice an hour and there always seems to be one available. Get a good night's rest and be ready to enjoy Venice-so much to see and do. We so enjoyed the breakfast buffet there and the food in the 2 evening restaurants was fresh and delicious. The hotel itself is like a mini museum.   Don't be afraid to stay here versus on the main island. You get a wonderful view from the hotel and the bar on the top floor is a breath of fresh air.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
