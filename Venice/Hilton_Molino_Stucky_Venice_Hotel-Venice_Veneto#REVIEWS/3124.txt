The quality of the rooms and food were really good but the 'free' shuttle bus didn't go often enough and only went to San Marco every other time. If you missed one, you were going to wait a while and it's on an island that the locals don't consider to be venice. I didn't appreciate all the extra charges. €30 for two days of Internet. €8 just for the tray that my room service food came on! €50 for my 25 min massage which only lasted 20 min and I got so lost. The only people who know anything about the area are at the desks me are usually too busy to help. I had to queue to check in and out. Really wish I had made a better choice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 31, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. The Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the crowded city centre and is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice.  I do regret that you did not find our complimentary shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs. May I take this opportunity to confirm that the ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12'. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
