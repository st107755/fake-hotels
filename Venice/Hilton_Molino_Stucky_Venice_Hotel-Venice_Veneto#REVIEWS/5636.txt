The hotel is very convenient and nice location. Alexandro (Front Desk) was very helpful when we checked in. He upgraded us to a room with a view, overlooking the canal, free of charge. Our room was very clean, nice furnishings, nice chandelier. Bathroom is very spacious. I love this hotel. All the staff were very courteous.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
