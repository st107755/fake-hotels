Last minute decision to take a nervous flyer on another flight to keep the momentum flowing.  We booked our 4 day trip through British Airways, we needed to tick several boxes for 4 people. We thought we couldn't fail with the Hilton.  Beautiful building   ✓ Fantastic check in staff  ✓ Super room, canal view  ✓ Fantastic breakfast buffet  ✓ Shuttle boat to St Mark's Square  ✓ Free wifi  oh dear, we seem to have failed here!  Hilton did Tweet me to say if i booked direct they give you free wifi. I chose to book through a world leading airline so, I was made to feel like a second class citizen. Fantastic coffee shop nearby with free wifi, so all was not lost.  Overall fantastic, I just think in this day and age wifi is as necessary, as a hot shower and a bedside lamp.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotel’s facilities.
