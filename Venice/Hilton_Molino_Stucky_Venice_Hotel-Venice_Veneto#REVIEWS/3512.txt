First class from the moment we checked in.  Received an upgraded two room suite with  a beautiful view across the canal to Venice.  The renovated factory setting for the hotel creates a wonderful ambience for Venice.  The room was full of modern amenities and a very large bath.  The hotel shuttle worked flawlessly, just pay attention to the weekday schedule (different than the weekend).  The rooftop bar was not our taste, but for some I imagine it would be chic.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
