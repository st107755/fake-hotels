This is a beautiful hotel built in a refurbished mill. Our room was in the main building. It was beautifully decorated with a gorgeous Murano chandelier. It was a spacious room with a view of the ship channel. Every person we dealt with was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was phenomenal. Lots of fabulous choices in the buffet. If you wanted eggs or inlet yes that was available. The dining area for breakfast was well staffed and the food was replenished immediately in he buffet. We stayed before a cruise and after the cruise. I would love to go back. I recommend this hotel.
