First, of all, let me explain our view of Venice on the whole.  We found it beautiful, well worth the trip, but I was a little surprised at a couple of things.  First, after getting dropped off at the Venice Port, your sort of looking around and wondering, ok, where do we go now???? There are no signs telling you what to do or where to go.  So, my advice to anyone going to Venice, is to get explicit directions on how to get to your hotel, which water bus to take, exactly, because your hotel may be on Line 2, for example, but there is a 2.1 and a 2.2, and a 'night' route, designated with the blue 1/4 moon symbol.  Again, make SURE you know exactly how to get there.  Second, Do not count on there being English signs around to help you, because English signage is lacking throughoutâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for taking the time to write your very exhaustive review, I am sure many will find your tips useful (especially about transportation, our shuttle service and how to get around Venice).
