A wonderful hotel. Family loved it. Was nice to heat away from the heart of Venice where all the crowds are, yet only a 5 min or 10 min shuttle away.  Amenities were awesome. Only complaint we had was that the pool closes at 8 pm, often that was when we were getting back to the hotel.

We are very pleased to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us and we thank you for mentioning our facilities like the shuttle boat to San Marco. It is also important for us to know that you have enjoyed to be on the Giudecca island to escape the more crowded areas of the city centre. We thank you for your comment with regards to the pool opening hours and will discuss it during our next head of department meeting. We look forward to welcoming you soon again.
