We stayed at this beautiful location with spectacular views of Venice. The whole experience was wonderful - from e-mail assistance prior to coming to the hotel to first class customer service throughout our 2 night stay.  All the staff could not have done any more for us.  The private shuttle water taxi from the hotel to the square was very easy.  A thoroughly enjoyable experience all round.
