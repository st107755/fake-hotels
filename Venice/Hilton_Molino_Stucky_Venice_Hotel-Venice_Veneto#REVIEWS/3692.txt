What can we say but a huge thank you to all of the staff at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel Venice. Having stayed here on previous trips we were reassured that our wedding stay would be in good hands but the guys surpassed our expectations! As per usual the facilities and rooms lived up to their 5 star rating but what blew us away was the 'can-do' attitude of Eleonora Barboni (and Irene) who organised what can only be described as a fabulous wedding evening party for us all at the Skyline bar (Venice terrace) where our guests (40 people) danced, ate & drank the night away - Guys.. you nailed it.... Thank you!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
