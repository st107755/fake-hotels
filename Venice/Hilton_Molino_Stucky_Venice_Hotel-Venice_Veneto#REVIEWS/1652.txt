What an amazing hotel! Great location and views over the canal. You can see large cruise ships passing by. The hotel has a private shuttle straight to San Marco square and in the evening also to the other side of the canal, which is a great area to have dinner, Zattere. Last but not least the staff, all throughout the hotel; at breakfast, in both the restaurant, but also the concierge, they're great and made our stay even better than it already was.
