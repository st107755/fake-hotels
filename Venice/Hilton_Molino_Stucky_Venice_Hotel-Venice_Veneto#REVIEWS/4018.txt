Beautiful hotel and an advantage to stay a little distance from the main city. Complimentary shuttle was excellent, as was customer service and the breakfast. Room on 1st floor very nice and super king bed very comfortable. Hilton high standards come at a cost. VERY expensive to eat and drink there and definitely worth getting breafast as part of your deal. We did, however, have a wonderful time.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
