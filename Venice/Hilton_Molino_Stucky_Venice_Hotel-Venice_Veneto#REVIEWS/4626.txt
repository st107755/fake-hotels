An amazing conversion of the mill. Rooms well sized and a view over the canal was perfect for our anniversary. Bar and restaurant staff very professional. Federica Marchiori the concierge amazing knowledge of the town and cannot do enough to make your holiday special. Even if you don't stay at the hotel the cocktails in the skyline bar are worth the 15 min trip from San Marco. The only thing that let it down a very small bit was the breakfast staff just not enough to serve the 3 rooms that were in use over the weekend.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments and very exhaustive review on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay.
