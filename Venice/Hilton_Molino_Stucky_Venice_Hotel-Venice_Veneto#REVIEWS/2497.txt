Hilton has rehabbed a factory on Guidecca island and made some great views in well appointed rooms.  It is tricky to get to the Stuckey from the airport and Hilton does not assist with a boat/shuttle.  In our case we hired a private boat but when we got to the dock, no one from the hotel came out to assist with our climbing onto the dock or to assist with luggage.  Room seemed stuffy at times and there was a caution re mosquitos if you opened the windows.  we were disappointed the "heated pool" was not open in November. The shuttle to St. Marks was prompt,   frequent and comfortable.
