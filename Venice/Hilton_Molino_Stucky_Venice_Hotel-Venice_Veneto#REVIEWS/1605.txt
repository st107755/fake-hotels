Attention from personnel was very nice. I also managed to get my Hilton perks (something impossible in Waldorf Astoria). On the other side, I had to change room because of the bad odor (satyed in 5th floor). In the other room that they gave me it was the same or even worse, so it must be a structural issue in the hotel connected to the water drain. This issue alone created an overall poor perception of the hotel to my wife and I. Also, it woulg have been good to know in advance that there is a hotel shuttle. I wrote the day before to the hotel and received an explanation on how to reach it by private or public means, but didn't tell me that they had a shuttle and it would have saved me a precious time in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we did not meet all your expectations. It was very kind of you to mention our professional Team Members who do their best to extend our hospitality every day. With regards to the smell that you experienced unfortunately being Venice in a lagoon and also due to low tide which in this period of the year is very common, the odors can sometime be beyond control. I have discussed your comments at our Management Meeting this morning and we are glad to inform you that we have a project to improve this in order to avoid the reoccurrence of experiences you have highlighted although we cannot change the fact that high and low tides are part of our city. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you and your wife back in the not too distant future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
