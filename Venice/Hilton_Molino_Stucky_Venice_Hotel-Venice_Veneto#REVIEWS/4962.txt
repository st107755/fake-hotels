The hotel is beautiful.  The location was challenging (must use the hotel's water shuttle or a water taxi to get to main attractions).  Beware of the food prices.  The restaurant food is very good, especially the Aromi Restaurant but the prices are off the charts!  There is a very nice sky bar, restaurant and pool at the top of the hotel.  The staff were great at the Concierge desk but a bit rude at the Check-in Desk.  I would recommend this hotel for those who prefer a quiet location but not for those who have limited time to explore Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 5, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations, however the Giudecca island is closer to the city centre and St. Mark’s Square than other areas in town. Besides our complimentary shuttle and private water taxi, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / line 2) station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. We acknowledge your comments on prices, though I can also assure you that prices of food and beverage in our bars and restaurants are in line with other 5-stars hotels in Venice. We look forward to welcoming you again at the Molino Stucky Hilton Venice. Best regards, Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
