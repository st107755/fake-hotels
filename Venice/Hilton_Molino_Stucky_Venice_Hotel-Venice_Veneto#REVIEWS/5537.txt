Part of our group stayed at this hotel which is on Guidecca Island across from the main part of Venice.  At first I was disappointed that we weren't in the heart of things but in reality it was no problem at all.  The free shuttle boat from the hotel runs frequently and it was much less of the hustle bustle.  Rooms were very nice, nice pool area and lovely area to walk along the water with shops and restaurants nearby.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
