Venice family stay.  We totally enjoyed our stay at the Hilton. We had plenty of room for 3 adults. Just be aware if you are driving, you will need to take a water taxi to get to this hotel. If you are arriving in the early morning hours, make sure you pre arrange transportation. A car problem had us arriving at 0100 and we did not get into our room until 0300. Still once there all was great.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive feedback on TripAdvisor. The Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, only a 12 minutes boat ride from the crowded city centre and it is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. We confirm that Venice is made of many islands and transportation is possible only via water means. There are many car parkings available and the biggest one is very convenient to reach our hotel with the ACTV public water bus line 2.We are pleased that you have enjoyed your stay with us and we all look forward to welcoming you soon again at our property. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
