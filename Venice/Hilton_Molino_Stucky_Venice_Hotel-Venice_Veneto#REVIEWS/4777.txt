What a delight. The Hotel Molino Stucky is a jewel of a hotel away from the maddening crowd of St. Mark's yet within a lovely shuttle ride from Giudecca.  The shuttle is a free service of the hotel. The roof top pool is exquisite and the views indescribable !!  Read the history of the "factory" and its transformation into a hotel and you'll enjoy your stay even more.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments.
