We stayed there two nights and were quite unsatisfied with our stay, only good thing was the view.  Hotel is big, and very american. Breakfast has poor selection of products. Staff doesn't care about you at all, they just work there.  Also, note that hotel is on a separate island. We had to take water taxi for 60â‚¬ to get there first night, as we arrived quite late.   Definately don't want to stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
