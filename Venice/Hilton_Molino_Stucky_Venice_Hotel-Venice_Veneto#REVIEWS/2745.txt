We had an amazing 3 days at Hilton. The building is honestly beautiful and away from the hustle and bustle of the main town centre. The hotel provides a great shuttle service which connects you to the rest of the Venice and runs all day long to suit your convenience. Our room was beautiful and spacious ,house keeping did a great job of keeping it immaculate. The hotel has a number of different restaurants and a lush spread of breakfast every morning. We dined at almost every restaurant starting with there Rialto bar and then dined at Bacaromi which provided beautiful Venetian cuisine. There sky lounge provides stunning views and a great cocktail list with lush sushi. The rooftop pool was great too. All staff very helpful and attentive thanks for an amazing 3 days.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 25, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
