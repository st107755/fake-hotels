While my stay with the Hilton Molino Stucky may not be the typical since I am a Hilton Diamond member and get extra perks - my experience was amazing! Traveling through Italy with my Sister on an adventure of a lifetime - we stayed a couple nights here on points.  Travel from the train station is not convenient, but it was definitely an adventure and can be done inexpensively if you travel by water bus and transfer to the free Hilton boat. Even with luggage in tow, we had no difficulty.  We were upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the main canal. The room was absolutely beautiful. Could not have asked for a better room.  We took advantage of a last minute special at the spa and treated ourselves to a massage our first evening. Very nice experience after a day of travel.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 19, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
