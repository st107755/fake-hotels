We loved this hotel.  The hotel is located on the island and is a short boat ride away from San Marco Square.   We loved the experience.  I recommend you make arrangements to get a water taxi before you arrive in Venice.  You can take the public water taxi if you are ok with handling your baggage.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 22, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to write a review about our hotel.
