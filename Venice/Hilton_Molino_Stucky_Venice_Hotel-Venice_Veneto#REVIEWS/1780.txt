Although I typically like the smaller more central hotels, this was a great introduction to Venice.  With its own shuttle you can get to the ancient city quickly and yet come back to quiet and luxury.  The Concierge was extremely helpful, explaining where to buy tickets for St. Mark's and the Doges Palace so we could avoid the lines.  He also showed us how to have a nice tour of the Grand Canal using public transport vs. paying for a tour.  The room was large and comfortable, the breakfast amazing and the pool / bar as spectacular as advertised.  A wonderful introduction to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
