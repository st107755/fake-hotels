Before traveling to the mainland, we stayed just two nights at the Hilton Stucky Molina.  The concierge, Yazireh, was very kind to coordinate a private taxi from the airport (got in late and didn't want the hassle of a time-consuming public taxi).  The front desk staff, particularly Andrea, was very helpful. Christian, at the concierge desk, was very patient with all our questions.  The rooms were so quiet with no disturbance from outside boats. The breakfast was delicious with homemade orange juice made in a big awesome machine!  The Hilton's water taxi is 6 euros per person per stay, and it was a quick ride over to San Marco Square.  We hated to have to leave but had to go to the mainland to work. We can't wait to get back to this hotel in the future!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 13, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
