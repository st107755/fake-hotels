INteresting somewhat off the beaten path hotel, yet easily convenient to the rest of the city. Iâ€™ve stayed in many off the top hotels in Venice befor but liked the charm and low key atmosphere of this one. A quick, easy and somewhat romantic boat ride to everything. But the best thing abut my stay was the massage I had in the spa. As I had requested a male massage therapist, the hotel had made arrangements for Jacopo to meet with me.  I have had numerous massages all over the world, and he is absolutely among the best. Do yourself a favor....you will not be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 31, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
