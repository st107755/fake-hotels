This hotel is a jewel located in Giudecca just across from the main island. The rooftop pool has spectacular views and the rooms have all the modern amenities that you need for a pleasant stay. They have a shuttle boat that for a one time fee takes you to the main island, which it is very convenient because you are away from the crowds for relaxing and when you need to explore the town you just hop on the boat  Overall, a great property that I highly recommend especially if you are used to the comfort of a reputable chain like HiltonRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
