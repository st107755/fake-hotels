I had the pleasure of staying a Hilton Molino Stucky Venice hotel from 31st March to 1st April - although short stay, the hotel service was amazing, the roof-top bar is one of the best views one can get of Venice and the frequent shuttle-service to S.Marcos helps you to reach the down-town venice with ease. Great restaurants around the hotel and amazing view of Venice from the entrance.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 12, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
