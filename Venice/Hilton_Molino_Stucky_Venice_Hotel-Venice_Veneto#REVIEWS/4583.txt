We had requested an upgrade as Hilton members and got a "nursery" room, connected to a corner suite. Small room but comfortable. Very good breakfast service with attentive staff.

Free umbrellas for walks around the island where you can find a few small restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
