Venice was our first stop on our trip through Italy, and we chose to stay here on HHonors points. I can't remember how much we used per night, but it was a great choice! It took us a bit to get there from the airport via public bus and waterbus, but it only cost us about â‚¬35 total which seemed like a deal.   -Spacious and clean room and bathroom. -Nice executive lounge. It only has a small assortment of snacks, but they were tasty. They also had a happy hour from 5-7 daily. Breakfast was okay.  -Very friendly staff. -Beautiful view of Venice from the pool on the rooftop.  -Shuttle over to the main island that ran regularly and was always prompt.  -Concierge recommended a great restaurant on our first evening there.   Would recommend, especially for those with Hilton points!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest, We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
