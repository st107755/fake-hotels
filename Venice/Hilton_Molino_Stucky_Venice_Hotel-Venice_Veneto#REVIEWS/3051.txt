This could be a super hotel but during our recent stay we felt could do more to improve. We chose an executive room to take advantage of the Hilton lounge facilities. In this hotel they are limited and poor. On our first morning the breakfast was whisked away at 10 sharp, after taking to a manager we found out breakfast should be served until 10.30! Drinks are only served between 5 to 7pm again all were whisked away on the dot. The whole pool area was closed, despite it being sunny, no free wifi in the room you have to pay for the Hilton water taxi. We will go back to Venice, but not here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 12, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.
