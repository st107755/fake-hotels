My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hilton and have to say, it's one of the best holidays we've had.  The hotel was superb, the view from our room (601)outstanding and the staff very helpful and friendly.  We loved the location as the shuttle service is an excellent option, but you can also get away from the crowds.  We enjoyed the breakfast and also our dinner at the Aromi restaurant..  The Rooftop Pool is an excellent added extra.  I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all friends and family and, if lucky enough to return to Venice, would certainly return to the Molino Stucky.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
