We were at the Hilton Molino Stucky for a night before beginning our Cruise the next day. It was the perfect hotel to be in. The staff was fantastic ...and we were fortunate to be given rooms facing the lagoon. The views were unbelievable especially when a big cruise ship passed by.... it was surreal, like a Hollywood set! Being jetlagged ( it was an 18 hour trip coming over) I found myself wide awake at 4 am but just looking at the buildings and lights across the water was  calming. I was quite happy to sit and stare. Breakfast too was fantastic with a wide variety of food. The free shuttle operated by the hotel made getting about so easy. ..St Mark`s in 15 minutes!  I was truly sorry to be leaving the hotel and will definitely be back one day and this time for a longer stay!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
