We spent 3 days and two nights at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel. At check in, they said there was an upgraded room available on the sixth floor with windows on two sides. Separate living room and bedroom. The weather was great and the views were even better. the hotel is a converted flour mill and is first class, located on an island called Giudecca. To get across the water you need to take a hotel provided water taxi on a 5 minute ride. They run all the time and cost something like 3 euro for your stay. We really thought this added to the ambiance of the hotel and the whole Venice experience. If you get a chance, go see Venice on your trip to Italy and try out this hotel. I doubt you will be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us on TripAdvisor.
