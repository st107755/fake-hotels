I was on a site inspection at the hotel and found the hotel to be an amazing experience in all levels.  The quality and size of the rooms are nicely appointed with great amenities.  The internet signal is strong enough in all areas of the hotel.  Surprisingly, the rooms are extremely quiet, I didn't hear the usual noise of the hallway that you encounter in old hotels that have been renovated.  The hotel offers a boat shuttle from its own pierce to Venice island.  You can get from the airport to the hotel via taxi (130.00 euros up to 3 people) land it takes 30 minutes or alternatively you can take public transportation which would be much less but it would take almost 2 hours to get to the hotelRead moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for your positive comments on TripAdvisor, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
