4 nights in Venice. Location is convenient via shuttle, which is free. Not much did options on site, and walls are thin (crying baby and angry couple next door not the hotel's fault, but thin walls are). Nonetheless, service was good, ambience is nice, hotel lobby and bar were nice, and the staff were helpful with arrangements and suggestions. Would stay again. We couldn't try the pool because of the weather in that time of the year (rainy) (autumn).Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Guest, thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
