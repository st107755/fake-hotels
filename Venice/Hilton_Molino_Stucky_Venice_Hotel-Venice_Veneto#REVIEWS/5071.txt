The Hilton is in a beautiful building. Walking around is a pleasure make you feel relax. To get there we took a taxi from Santa Lucia train station. They arranged that for us since my husband needed a special taxi for his mobility scooter.  The check in was fast. Rooms are big, no A/C at the time we were there ( end of March 2012)but the room had big windows so no problem. House Keeping department should be more careful to check the towels, I got one with holes. Il Molino Breakfast was good. It would be nice if they have a station where eggs are cooked to order, I was missing that. I enjoyed my cappuccino every morning. Lobby bar has a good selection of drinks and food. Check out the views from the Skyline bar. Bacaromi bar is an excellent place where you can savor dishesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive comments on this website and I wanted to personally respond and thank you.
