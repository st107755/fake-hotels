I found this hotel difficult to rate.  The building and view from the Pool are fabulous.  However the service was patchy excellent at breakfast but poor at the sky bar and bar on the ground floor.  Executive lounge was helpful as prices even by Venice standards were high.  Room was good.  My overall impression was that Hilton had built an over large hotel that they found difficult to maintain as a 5 star hotel due to lack of trained staff and difficulty in keeping the hotel clean and tidy.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 4, 2016Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
