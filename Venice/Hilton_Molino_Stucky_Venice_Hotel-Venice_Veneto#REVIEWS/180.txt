I like to make it simple:  Strengths:  -Pretty, quiet, pool and rooftop, helpful and attentive service, modern facilities. clean and comfortable room.  The hotel has character and some vibe.   Advice:  The shuttle to the main part of Venice is efficient.  In general, it is a process to move around Venice.  The shuttle takes time, but it was reliable.  I appreciated getting out of the main part of Venice and returning to the hotel.  I am not shy about crowds, but Venice can be a bit much.  There are many small restaurants located on Giudecca island.  You can access local food without traveling on the shuttle schedule and battling the crowds of Venice at the end of a long day.  Had I understood the location better, I would have tried a few of these more local establishments.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2019Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review.
