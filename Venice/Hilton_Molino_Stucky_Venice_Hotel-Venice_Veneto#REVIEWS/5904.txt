This hotel was wonderful. We had complimentary water taxi to San Marco and Murano which was great. The service at the hotel was less than the other hotels we stayed at in Italy (even though they were not five starts). That may be just because the hotel is so large. The view from the hotel pool area is amazing.Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
