Excellent property and services. Location is on Island across St. Marks Square with free shuttle boats from morning until midnight across. At check in Tito took great care of us. Fabulous room with all five star amenities and ample size for european standards.  We were quicly advised by Tito about getting around town, rooftop pool with a spectacular view. complimentary transfer to Murano island to visit a Murano glass factory, airport transfers, etc.  Great service all around.  Included breakfast was plenty and very good. The Nutella creperie was a great stop, before hitting the Venice "roads". Will definitely stay again at this property. Excellent hotel for flawless vacation in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
