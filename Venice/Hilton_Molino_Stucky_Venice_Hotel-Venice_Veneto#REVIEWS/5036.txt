Just returned from 4 nights here.  Hotel is located across the canal from Venice center.  Free water taxi was provided by hotel to shuttle you across and back that runs every 20 - 30 minutes.    Food was good, but $$$.  Three options for restaurants.  Large patio in the shade for outside dining.  Pool was the best thing about this hotel, rooftop with spectacular views.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
