We had a lovely night here. One night prior to a cruise, very good choice for cruisers, close to cruise port and lovely amenities. The pool is very special and gives you a nice place to rest should your room not be ready. Easy to get to the main tourist spots of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
