We stayed here on our honeymoon and had a very nice experience.  Our room was large and well appointed and had a great view of Venice across the Guidecca canal.  We really enjoyed the executive lounge access and the roof top bar was outstanding!  The free water shuttle to Zattare and San Marco were a nice touch.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
