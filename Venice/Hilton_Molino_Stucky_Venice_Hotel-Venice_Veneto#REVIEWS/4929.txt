I stayed at the Hilton Molino in July and can honestly say it was a lovely experience from start to finish. We got the water bus from the airport which took about and hour and 30 minutes but dropped us right outside the hotel and was the cheapest option, the check in staff were pleasant and the hotel on first mpressions looked amazing.   The room was lovely with a big queen size bed and modern bathroom, the view was great too overlooking the canal. Food and drink in the hotel is rediculously expensive, cocktails in the sky line bar were 16 Euros and a bottle of beer was 8 euros!! The pool on the roof is also lovely but not a lot of sun beds and it was always full when we got there, it was very hot though so guessing this is why it was so busy. Lovely views from up there too!  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 5, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
