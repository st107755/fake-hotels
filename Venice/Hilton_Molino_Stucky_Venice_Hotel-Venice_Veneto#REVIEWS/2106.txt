We visited Venice in April and stayed at the Hilton on Hilton Honors points.  It was a lovely hotel and they were very helpful with recommendations.   If you have anxiety about getting around - don't.  It's not that complicated once you arrive.  We did arrange for a private transfer (Car then boat) to the Hotel from the airport.  After traveling 10+ hours, we wanted things to be as simple as possible.  It is expensive, but we felt that it was worth the money.    The free shuttle provided is great for getting to the main island and is easy to navigate.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 13, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your positive comments.
