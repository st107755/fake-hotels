We chose the hotel because of the location and its transfer to San Marco. The price seemed reasonable and my former experience with Hilton hotels was good. BUT: the room was not cleaned appropriately, we had bed bugs and the service mentality was not as expected.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 29, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to post a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor. Our aim is to provide each and every guest with a wonderful and memorable experience, and I am sorry that this was not evident in your case. As regards bed bugs, as you can imagine, we take this very seriously and we rigorously follow Hiltons procedures and protocols as rooms are inspected on a regular basis. Immediately after you reported the issue last Saturday, our Housekeeping Supervisor  went upstairs to check your room and she did not find any evidence of bedbugs. Earlier today the team and I have again visited the room with no positive results. This said the room has been taken out of the operation until we receive the visit from the pest control company tomorrow morning after which I will be more than happy to share their report with you if you can share your e-mail address with me on VCEHI_GM@hilton.com. As you know Venice is surrounded by water and mosquitoes are present year around and it would be that in your rooms there were mosquitoes. I do hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. With best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
