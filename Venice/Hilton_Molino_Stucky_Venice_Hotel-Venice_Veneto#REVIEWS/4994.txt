The Hilton Stuckey Molino is a beautiful hotel.  It is spacious, but the shower was a little small.  My room featured the shower separate from the tub.  I was on the first floor and there wasn't much of a view, but the hotel was comfortable.  The staff was nice; I needed a box and tape to pack wine I had purchased.  There were two computers for use by guests; they really need more.  The breakfast buffet each morning was wonderful with plenty of options.  I spent some time in the lounge area and on the beautiful bar on the rooftop.  I had a great experience; the hotel offers a complimentary water taxi to St Mark's Square.  My stay was lovely.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
