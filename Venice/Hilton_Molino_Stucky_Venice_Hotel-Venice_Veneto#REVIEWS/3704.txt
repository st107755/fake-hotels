Beautifully restored building, incredible view from pool deck and rooms facing Venice. A major laid down in terms of all services. Virtually non-existing porters; our bag was not delivered even after chasing up via reception and finally had to go and collect ourselves. Executive lounge too small, crowded and poorly maintained. Ferry service unreliable, too crowed. On two occasions we waited for more than one hour for ferry beyond scheduled time. My recommendation; stay in mainland.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
