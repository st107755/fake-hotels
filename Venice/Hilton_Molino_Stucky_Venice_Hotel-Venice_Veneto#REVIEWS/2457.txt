1. Put your name on your luggage and keep it monitored when you arrive in the hotel, because mine arrived in the room 2 hours after.  2. Check the timetable of the 'vaporetto' at the closest stop (200 mt from the hotel), because the hotel's courtesy boat is not that frequent 3. If it's not a business travel fully covered by your company, think twice before either drinking, having a snack at the hotel's bar, or taking items from the room fridge 4. The terrace is fantastic in the warm season, much less in winter 5. Consider that the internal temperature is cold in the reception, a bit warmer in the corridors, hot in the meeting rooms 6. For info, ask the concierge, she's very gentle and competent 7. Venice is beautiful. But give a look to the Giudecca as well.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 17, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for your review and for the useful tips to future guests.
