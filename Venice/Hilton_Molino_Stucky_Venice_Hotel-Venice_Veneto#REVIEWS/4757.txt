It was a pleasure to read you enjoyed the hotel and the the quietness of the Giudecca island. We are sorry for the long delay you have experienced upon departure and we will take steps with the Departments Heads in charge so that in the future procedures are carried out in a smoother and faster way. Because of our location very convenient and close to both Venice Passenger Cruise Terminals, our hotel is indeed a favourite with “cruise makers”. However we welcome only a limited number of them and we are proud to be a favourite with all kinds of tourists and holiday makers in Venice. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.  Best regards, Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
