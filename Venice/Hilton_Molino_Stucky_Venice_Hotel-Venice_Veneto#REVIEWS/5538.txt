This was our first family vacation overseas. We were worried our teenage sons would complain about everything. Well the front desk staff made a mistake the day we checked in but corrected it right away. The concierge recommended the most amazing places to eat; suggested his personal favorites and we enjoyed them all. It was great to be away from the hustle and bustle (we slept in from jet lag). We relaxed on the roof when the kids went to bed. My husband and I dream of returning to this same hotel without the kids and perhaps staying longer!Read moreDate of stay: December 2009HelpfulShare
