We loved the building itself, the pool on top, the service of the staff on the top floor, but.......at the spa the staff was mostly busy excusing for things, such as sauna in repair, and we did not find an easy place to have and easy dinner although the hotel is proud to have 5 restaurants: we ended up being served in the most expensive part where we waited 40 minutes for the first course. Also, the breakfast room is crowded and restless, mostly due to being understaffed. The boat service to the center is a great advantage.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2018Dear Madame, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
