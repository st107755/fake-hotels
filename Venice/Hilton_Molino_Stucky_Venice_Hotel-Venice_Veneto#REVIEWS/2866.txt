The water-front hotel isn't 'down-town' but has it's own ferry to St. Marks; once back at the hotel we could unwind, relax and sleep well in the quiet neighborhood.  To get to the hotel you can either take the public ferry or hire a taxi - the taxi is of course quicker, but costs more.  The public ferry is fine, making several stops along the way - just keep your timing in mind if you need to get to the airport.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 20, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
