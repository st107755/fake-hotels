This must be one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. I really would go back to Venice just to stay there. We were in Venice for 2 nights and a day and a half. This hotel is short of nothing, be it great restaurants, a spa, a spectacular view from the 8th floor overlooking the whole of Venice. The hotel is on the Island of Giudecca, but there are water shuttles available to the main Island.  Only down side our room had no view, we looked into the courtyard. But the room was lovely, comfortable and a great bathroom. The breakfasts were also well catered for. So that was a hotel that I will highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
