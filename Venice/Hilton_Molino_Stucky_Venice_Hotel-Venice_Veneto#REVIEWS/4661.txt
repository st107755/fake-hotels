We stayed for 3 nights on the tail end of our 12-day Princess Cruise.  The hotel was beautiful and staff was gracious and accommodating to American travelers.  The complimentary water taxi to travel across the canal was most convenient and accessible.  We had an executive suite that included a wonderful breakfast and complimentary, private lounge with snacks, hors d'oeuvre, wine, beer, soft drinks, tea, coffee, throughout the day and evening.  I highly recommend this hotel to American travelers visiting the enchanted City of Venice!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 22, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
