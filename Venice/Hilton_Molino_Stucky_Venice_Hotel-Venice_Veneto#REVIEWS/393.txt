We had a fantastic weekend in this hotel, the second time we have stayed here and we will certainly be booking again.  There was a small issue with our room which was very quickly rectified by the manager who was very helpful and quick to sort the issue out.  The food is lovely and I love the sky bar, the views and drinks were lovely. Didn’t get to visit the spa as unfortunately the jacuzzi wasn’t  working at the time we were there but was being fixed.   Thanks for a great stay!!
