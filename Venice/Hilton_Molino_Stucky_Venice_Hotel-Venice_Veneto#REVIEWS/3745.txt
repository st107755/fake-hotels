The best aspect of this hotel is it's 8th floor pool that overlooks Venice.  Make sure you get there early as the area has limited seating capacity.  But, the property has many shortfalls considering its price.  Our first room had an A/C that did not work correctly that caused severe condensation and wet carpeting.  Additionally, Americans should be warned that the hotel does not have 120v electricity.  Also, they charge for WiFi and the breakfast buffet is bad.  The dinner restaurant is only adequate and overpriced.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we did not meet all your expectations.
