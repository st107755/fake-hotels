First the positives - has all the appearances of a top hotel, lovely rooms with large bathroom, well stocked breakfast and breakfast staff friendly.  The cons?  No wifi in room, which is a no-no in any hotel with 5 star notions.  Drinks prohibitively expensive on bar.  Safe not working in room.  No water taxi available at 10am despite website claiming bookings not necessary at this early hour.  Worst of all was that 6-8 of us were left for 1.5 hours attdhe shuttle stop near St Marks around midnight, with 2 shuttles failing to appear.  More than one call to hotel and we were promised transport which never arrived.  After finally returning, requested telephone call and explanation from client services and deafening silence on that one.  Not good enough and would not stay hereâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
