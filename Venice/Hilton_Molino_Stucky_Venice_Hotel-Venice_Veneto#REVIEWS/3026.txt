You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations, however the Giudecca island is closer to the city centre and St. Mark’s Square than other areas in town. Besides our shuttle and the private water taxies, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / line 2) station is only a few minutes walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12'. Your comments are being reviewed and we are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.   Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
