We were in a lovely suite overlooking the canal and couldn't have been more pleased with the service and level of amenities. The hotel water taxi service runs about every 25 minutes and only from front of hotel to San Marco, but once you figure it out, it is very convenient and the least expensive way to travel from one island to the main attractions. Venice is fabulous and it was nice to stay with Hilton brand but in a typical building renovated to make a lovely hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
