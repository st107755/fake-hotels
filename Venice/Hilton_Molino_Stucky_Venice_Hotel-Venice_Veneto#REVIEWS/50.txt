We visited Venice in January 2020, which was a last minute decision to get away for a few days.   If you haven't done it before, a speedboat taxi from the airport to the hotel is a stunning way to start your stay in Venice.  All the staff we encountered at the hotel were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, and thankfully their English was a lot better than our Italian.   The Hotel is stunning, we opted for a Junior Suite, which was very nice, spacious and faultless.  The hotel's water taxi to San Marco is efficient, great value and allows for easy access to the hustle and bustle of San Marco from the sanctuary of Giudecca.  The Breakfast was good - seemingly catering for most tastes and cultures, the Skylight bar affords amazing views.   Loved it.Read moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 3, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
