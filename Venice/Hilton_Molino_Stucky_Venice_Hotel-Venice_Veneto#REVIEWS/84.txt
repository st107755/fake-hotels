The Hilton Stucky Molino, on the island of Guidecca, offers a quiter and less hectic  alternative to the city proper.  I stayed in a fairly recently renovated, contemporary room that was amply spacious with a large bath.  Comfortable bed and pillows.  View o fhte city jsut across the canal and a short walk (6-7 minutes) to the Vaporaetto, with a very short ride to S. Marco.  Also there is an Alilaguna station at the hotel for easy transfer to/from Maro Polo Airport.  Very convenient yet quiet.  Lovely staff all around.  Extremely good value for money; quite a bit better than I would expect.  This was my 11th visit to Venice and possibly the most enjoyable.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 4, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
