A great Hotel making a very worthwhile 4 day break. After reading some reports we were a little concerned that the hotel was on the Island of giudecca, this however made the stay more interesting and it is not a problem to move about. I had a room with a great view on the Exec Floor, Staff also very good and friendly.Read moreDate of stay: August 2008HelpfulShare
