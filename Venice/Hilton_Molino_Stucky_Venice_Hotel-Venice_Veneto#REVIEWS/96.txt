Nice hotel on one of the main channels with excellent roof top bar. Nice design of a luxury hotel that reused one of the old shipping warehouses.  If the SPA would be improved I would give it a real 5 Star experience.  Since I think it falls short with that I am giving it a 4.5 Star. Nice rooms and bathroom and very friendly staff that speaks English well.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 12, 2019Dera Guest, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor. The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy, a true milestone in the XIX century architecture. We thank you also for the less positive comments which will be very helpful to improve our service. Thank you for staying with us and we all look forward to welcoming you soon back in Venice. Kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
