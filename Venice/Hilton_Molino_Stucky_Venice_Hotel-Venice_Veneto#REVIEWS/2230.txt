We chose the Stucky Hilton on the Giudeca because we were traveling with a family and wanted somewhere a way from the tourist craziness of San Marco.

Seems odd that food isn't a commitment.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 28, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
