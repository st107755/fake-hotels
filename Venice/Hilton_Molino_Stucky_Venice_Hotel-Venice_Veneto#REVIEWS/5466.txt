Stayed with tour group 2 nights . What else can i say but it exceeded our expectations in all areas.Was the highlight of our trip as far as Hotels were concerned. Have never stayed with Hilton Hotels before ...look what I've been missing out on.  PS They have a free water shuttle to St Marks Square which visually is close by but naturally you can't walk ...nor swim !!Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
