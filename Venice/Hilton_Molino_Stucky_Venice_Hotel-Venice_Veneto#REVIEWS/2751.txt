This hotel was great. Just going for a short break to Venice should mean it's purely a walking holiday. However this hotel allowed our break to feel like a real holiday. The roof top pool, the view and cocktails made it. The restaurant food was delicious and service was excellent.   There were a few things that could have made it better;  1. Being able to take my Ice cream from the Nutella stand, upstairs to the roof top pool  2. When the ceiling in our bathroom was leaking brown liquid from the room above on the last day of our stay, some sort of offer of discount would have been welcomed. We paid a premium for the hotel and expected the same back.  3. A more extensive list of cocktails in the day by the pool.
