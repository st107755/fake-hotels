This hotel was WONDERFUL!  We stayed here for our 2 days in Venice.  Got a nice room on one of the higher floors facing the canal.  Opened the window up and slept to the sound of the water.  The room was really spacious, and the hotel itself was HUGE.  The lobby was beautiful, the Executive Centre (breakfast and snacks) was always well stashed with goodies.  Service was amazing.  This is typical of Hilton.  Great job guys!  Keep up the good work.  I'm definitely gonna be staying here again!
