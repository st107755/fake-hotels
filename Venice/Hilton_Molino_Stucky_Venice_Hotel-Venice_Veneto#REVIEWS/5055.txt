I stayed at the Hilton on the island of Giudecca. The hotel is historic but not as friendly as you would think. The front desk agents were a little irritated to check my family of 8 into two hotel rooms. The room itself was great but not too impressed. The location of the hotel bothered me the most due to the fact that it was not on the main island of Venice.
