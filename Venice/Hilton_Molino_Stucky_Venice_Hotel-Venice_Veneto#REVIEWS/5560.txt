SHORT REVIEW: Rooms are good. Pay extra for a view. Service is excellent. Crowd is lame: conventions and cruise ships. Do eat at Aromi restaurant which is fantastic. Do not buy w/breakfast included or pay for the buffet. It's completely disgusting. You're not within walking distance of anything. Free shuttle boats are convenient but end at 8:30pm. Overall a nice hotel, away from the bustle of Venice which has it's pros and cons.  GETTING THERE: You must take a BOAT to the hotel from a parking garage. You cannot drive. Take a "shared" private taxi if you're 2 people. Take a private water taxi if you have 4 or more people. Don't take the public boat. The dock is too far from the hotel to walk with luggage.   THE ROOM: The room was nice but a little on the small side for the price.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
