We had a nice stay at the Hilton in Venice.  Rooms are clean, beds comfortable.  Beautiful views of Venice from the sky lounge and pool!!  A must see!  The Hilton ferry can be a little annoying as their schedule is approximate.  They will leave early or late, not terribly consistent.  This led to some long waits.  We later learned that there is an app to track the boat schedule.  This would have been helpful to tell us at time of check in.  Our stay was otherwise pleasant and I would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
