Hilton is a fairly good hotel but it is somewhat pricey for what it includes,  you also must pay 130EU each way to from the airport , hotel should provide shuttle like other hotels do for a much better price, dinner at the hotel will be no less then 130EU per night, a burger runs for 28EU at the hotel restaurant, NOT GOOD.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
