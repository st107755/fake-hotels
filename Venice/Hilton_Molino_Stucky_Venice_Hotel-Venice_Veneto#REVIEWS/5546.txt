We read here mostly good with a not so good breakfast buffet.  Well the buffet was huge and it had everything imaginable.  We were a group of 20 and no one had any complaints about the breakfast or anything else about the hotel.  The resturants were high priced so we asked the desk for other suggestions and there was resturants in walking distance that were excellent and reasonably priced.  The bakery down the street had the best olive bread we ever had and sold it warm by the slice.in the morning.  The hotel water taxi was good and always on time.  The bartenders at the roof top bar were very friendly and there was quit a view from there.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
