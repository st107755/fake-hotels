Please be informed that amongst our choice of 10 rooms and suites categories, the Hilton Molino Stucky has various and different levels of rooms, from standard to deluxe and executive rooms and suites with and without view.

We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we will  have the opportunity of welcoming you back in the future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
