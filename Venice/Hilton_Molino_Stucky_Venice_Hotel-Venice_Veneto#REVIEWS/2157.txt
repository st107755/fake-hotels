Hilton arranged Hotel transfer from airport which was excellent door to door service. As a HH member had instant upgrade on room to a suite. Excellent location with Hilton private taxi boat to the main island every 20 minutes both ways. Food was excellent, and all services. Only one minor complaint was the swimming pool closed early.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 25, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your positive comment about Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
