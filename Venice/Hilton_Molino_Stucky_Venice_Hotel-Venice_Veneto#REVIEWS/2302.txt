I like this amazing historic building. Service is very friendly especially in the breakfast room. The executive lounge is located at the ground floor. Much better than the former location in the upper floor. Some rooms are small. We had a bigger room with tantasticview to the canal. Unfortunately noisy in the early morning because of the ship traffic. This is a wondetful hotel if you like to be away from the crowded places. Anyway to ho to the center by hotel boat is only a 15 minutes journey.
