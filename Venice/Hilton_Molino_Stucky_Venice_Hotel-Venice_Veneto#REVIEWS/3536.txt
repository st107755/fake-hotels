We have just returned from the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We loved the hotel and we loved the pool area which has beautiful views from the roof terrace. The staff here were excellent and always accommodating.  We booked an Executive King Suite for my husband and I and the 2 children. It was very comfortable, with lovely bedding and pillows and our bathroom was luxurious. We had the use of the Executive lounge and the staff were also excellent accommodating everyone. I thought the breakfasts were ample as I had previously read from other visitors that it was basic, however I thought there was plenty to choose from to satisfy everyone.
