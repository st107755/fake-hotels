What a great hotel in Venice! The hotel itself is beautiful, the view is incredible, the pool and terrace bar are fantastic, offer the BEST view. Service was very good, Rooms are clean, beds are so comfortable and breakfast buffet is VERY good. The hotel has shuttle service to two different piers at a very convenient times and until late night. I definitely recommend this place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
