This hotel property was wonderful, we took the public water transportation from the airport for 15 euros each and it stopped at the hotel.  The hotel has complimentary transportation to St. Mark's square.  The hotel is around the corner from where the cruise ships leave, but it is on Giudecca Island so you still need transportation to get there.  It has a roof top pool that has an amazing view of Venice and St. Mark's Square.  The rooms are very large in European standards, modern and very comfortable.  There are all kinds of restaurants, small supermarket and shops.  It is very easy walking.  We would go back there in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
