I liked this stay very much indeed,  Not only was our room super with a great view across to Venice, the hotel staff were just perfect - from chambermaid ( rm 301) to executive lounge, to the lady in the dos and especially Jessi on concierge . Special mention for her because she basically organised our data and evenings making us very happy and making me look a complete hero in the eyes of our family!!  The hotel is delightfully away from the hustle of central Venice and endless tourists but conveniently connected by the hotels own water shuttle - no charge.  Well done!
