While this hotel may be perceived on the expensive side, the amenities and benefits  make it worth while for Hilton Honors members (and many others too) - free breakfast and lunch, free boat shuttle to Murano (and to St. Marco plaza), $6 per stay (unlimited days) per person fee for shuttle back and force to main island areas, roof top pool - all of this makes it both affordable and enjoyable stay.
