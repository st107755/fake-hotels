We stayed at this hotel during summer time. It was our first time in Venice. Everyone told us we should stay at the Hilton because it wasnt IN VENICE, but they WERE ALL WRONG!  When we return we won't hesitate to come back to this hotel, and not even think of going anywhere else.   The hotel is great, staff friendly, very clean, easy access (from the airport and with the shuttle to Venice) the best was the amazing swimming poll! We spent every afternoon with a cocktail up there, great views and its just perfect!   I highly recommend this location!Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
