a lovely restored hotel in a perfect location to be able to visit Venice. The water shuttle service was invaluable and excellent value . The rooms were decorated to a very high standard with very comfy beds and kept meticulously clean. All in all my two sons and myself had a fabulous time and I especially loved the rooftop pool with magnificent views of the City. The staff were so polite and attentive. It was a shame that we couldn't have stayed longer.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 21, 2017Dear Madame,  We would like first to thank you for taking the time to post your review related to your recent stay at our hotel.
