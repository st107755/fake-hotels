We took a water taxi from the airport to the hotel and were dropped off at the private dock on a side canal.  I had pre-paid for the room and, as Diamond Member, received an upgrade to a nice sized room on the front of the hotel overlooking Giudecca Canal and the city of Venice.  The free  water taxi service offered by the hotel makes it simple to get around to explore the city.  We also had access to the executive lounge.  Free breakfast and evening snacks and wine were great!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 22, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
