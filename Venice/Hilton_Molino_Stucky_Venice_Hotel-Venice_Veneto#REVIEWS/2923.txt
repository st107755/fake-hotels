Just spent 3 nights at the Molino and they were great. Good service and nice people. The rooftop bar and pool provide a great spot to view the city of Venice!  The shuttle to and from the city was very punctual. Also, book a Chichetti tour early, it's a fantastic way to see and taste Venice as a Venetian.
