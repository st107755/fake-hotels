We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour by Viking Ocean Cruises.  It was lovely, the rooms were comfortable and we enjoyed the relative quiet of the location.  It was easy to get a water taxi to see the sights, but the hotel has enough to offer that you could stay there if you preferred.  We would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 27, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
