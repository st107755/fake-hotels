We chose this location partly on brand loyalty, partly on location and a lot on amenities. Staff was friendly from arrival to departure and went out of their way to recognize birthdays and accommodate requests. Lounge is adequate,  good for snacks, only downside is mosquitos by the windows. Rooftop pool is amazing. Nice quiet location after a busy day. Great breakfast. Rooms were spacious and clean. We did not use the included shuttle as we had three say transit passes and it is a short walk to the Palanca stop with multiple routes. Just let them know and they will remove the charge. This hotel was a ton of fun for adults and kids and would definitely stay here again.
