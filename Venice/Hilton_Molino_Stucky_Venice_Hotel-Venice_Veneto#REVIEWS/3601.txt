Stayed for 2 nights prior to a cruise.  Beautiful hotel.  We were prepared for, and liked, the location.  It was a welcome respite after the hubbub of St. Mark's.  On the other hand, it was a bit of a pain to go back out in the evening.  No troubles with the shuttle; the one time I saw it too full the hotel staff summoned another boat.  We enjoyed the executive lounge and the rooftop pool.  The pool area is quite small and only 25 lounge chairs, so be prepared.  We had dinner at the canal side restaurant and it was lovely.  Room was small by American standards but well appointed.  Bathroom was spa like.  Would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
