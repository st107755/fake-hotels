We stayed here for 3 nights. We loved the stay. Once we come to this hotel from St. Marks square, it is clam and relaxing. We can take a nice walk around the hotel. We loved the free shuttle to St. Marks square and it's very convenient. The restaurants in the hotel are pricey but we can always to go the St. Marks or we can walk for 5-10 mins and there are good restaurants with decent price.
