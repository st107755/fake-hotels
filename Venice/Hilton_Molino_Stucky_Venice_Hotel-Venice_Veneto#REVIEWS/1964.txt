I may be biased since I am an hh member, but the hotel is relatively new, or the rooms look quite well and although the staff can be a bit abrasive, like the blond lady in the executive lounge who acts as if she serves the sludge of society, although I haven't seen anyone be mean to her this year or last year, the intricate hallways, wood pillars and beams and overall feeling make this hotel feel very homey.  The breakfast, although they don't have champagne or prosecco, can't remember which exactly, as a few years back, still is the best we've had in Italy.   As mentioned, the swimming pool is quite stunning and you can see a great deal of Venice from there. Oh, also, their laundry service is impecable, we were quite impressed.   Would definitely recommend!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 2, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
