We stayed here after a cruise for two nights.  We had a corner suite overlooking the water.  The view was breath taking especially in the sunrise.  We never noticed any noise from the boats.  We had read the reviews and understood that we would be using a boat to the hotel and just made sure accommodated the times.  It was not a big deal.  The only odd feature of the hotel was the executive lounge arrangement.  It was a corner in the hotel lobby. Overall it was perfect ending to a wonderful family vacation.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
