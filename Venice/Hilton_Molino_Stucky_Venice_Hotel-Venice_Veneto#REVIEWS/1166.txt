We booked this hotel at short notice so pretty much knew what to expect from the Hilton group. The hotel itself is very large but in a beautiful old building. The staff were very good, the room was very good (with views over Venice) and overall we were very happy. One big surprise was the excellent restaurant with tables by the Giudecca Canal, perfect for dinner, with beautiful views of Venice and the sunset. The roof top pool and bar are great but there is no shade or umbrellas by the pool in the daytime. Although the hotel is on an island, there is a regular shuttle across to the main part of Venice and water taxis can be booked to and from the airport. Perfect for a couple of days in Venice but if you want a romantic hotel, this isn't it.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Team Members, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us! From our Skyline terrace and pool the view over the city and  the lagoon has no equal in Venice and we are glad that you could enjoy it. May I take this opportunity to inform also other travelers that we do have sun umbrellas but being on a high floor if there is heavy wind we close them for safety/security reasons. We are also pleased that you had the chance to dine at one of our restaurants located right in front of the Giudecca Canal, I will share your words of appraisal with our Executive Chef and his brigade. Thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni   General Manager Read more
