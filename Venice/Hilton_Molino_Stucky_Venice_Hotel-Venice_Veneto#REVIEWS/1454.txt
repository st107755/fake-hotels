We are delighted that our services met with your expectations and that you enjoyed your stay with us as well as the facilities and services offered in the hotel and on the Giudecca island. With regards to the architecture and restoration of this impressive old building, which dates back to the 19th century, may I take this opportunity to inform that the project was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture which are usually very appreciated by our Guests. The Ministry of Cultural Heritage took care of the conversion making sure to preserve the majority of the original elements of the ancient mill. We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.   Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
