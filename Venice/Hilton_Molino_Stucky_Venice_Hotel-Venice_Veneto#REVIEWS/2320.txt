From the moment I arrived via water taxi, the red carpet was rolled out at this luxurious resort!   LOVED everything about this amazing hotel.  Very professional, friendly staff who went above & beyond to make my stay perfect in every way.  There was some miscommunication with the concierge who was supposed to set up transfer for me at the airport.  I ended up taking a water taxi which costs 120 euros.  Also, the airport lost my luggage.  However, the hotel made sure my luggage was delivered to my room as soon as it finally arrived.  Room was so well appointed and luxurious.  Great tea & coffee provided for free in room along with a nightly turn down service.  Excellent fitness center which is open 24/7.  It was fun getting lost in the maze-like structure of this resort. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2016Dear Guest, many thanks for your very kind review on TripAdvisor.
