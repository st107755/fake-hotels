We had an Executive King Suite with a fantastic view of the water.   We were able to roll in a rollaway for my daughter and still had plenty of room. I liked being away from the main part of Venice and getting away from the crowds.  The 15 min shuttle was convenient.  The food at the restaurant and room service were just Ok though, and not worth the price.  Walk down the street there are cute good restaurants.  The pool is beautiful and the lounges comfortable, but the water icy cold in June! The wifi worked great in the room and the public areas.  And the executive Lounge was great.  We would stop in there just to make a cafe au lait or get a quick snack.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 29, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
