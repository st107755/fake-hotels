So romantic!! The hotel is in Giudecca, which is much calmer than the main island. Both the location and the hotel are beautiful. We only stayed one night, but we'll never forget it! We had a very nice deluxe room in the tower with an unbelievable view over the whole city and the Canalgrande. We woke up late and had breakfast at the nutella kiosk, which was fantastic! Stroll through Giudecca too if you get a chance, it's really charming!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you for taking the time to write a review about us on Tripadvisor.
