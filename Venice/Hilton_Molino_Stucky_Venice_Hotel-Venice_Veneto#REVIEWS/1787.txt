This hotel is nothing short of spectacular. Great staff, beautiful decor and easy access to the main island only 10 mins away via a dedicated boat, The island of Giudecca is also worth exploring - gives you the chance to see  Venice without the crowds.  The staff here were exceptional. Elisa and Giada from guest relations made our stay incredibly good. Every detail was covered and birthday celebrations for my wife and daughter were made very special indeed. I cannot thank them enough. A great hotel in a special city.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 26, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
