This hotel is very beautiful. The outside is quite a sight and the rich history adds more glamour. Staff is very nice, the hotel itself has some of the most beautiful accommodations I have ever seen. The rooftop pool is a must... best views of the city and so refreshing! Staff there is so nice and the area is clean but there is not enough seating! Shouldn't be a problem though, you'll want to spend your time in the pool. Although we didn't take advantage of all the dining options available on site, they all looked great. The rooms themselves are the perfect mixture of modern yet classic. Very comfy beds! Clean too. We didn't get a nice view in our room (just another building) but it didn't really affect our stay.
