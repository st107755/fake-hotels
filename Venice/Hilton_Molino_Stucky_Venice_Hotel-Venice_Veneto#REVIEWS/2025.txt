We stayed at the hotel with our children for 3 nights. We had city view rooms at the front of the hotel and the views were stunning. It is great hotel to stay with family , the pool was fantastic, again with stunning views, and much needed after a hot days sightseeing. In great location, away from the busy centre of Venice, but San Marco was easily reached by the hotel water taxi in around 10 mins. The water taxi service cost 18 euros for 6 of us for the 3 night stay. Would definitely recommend this hotel,beautiful building and the Sky Bar is stunning at night with views over Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 25, 2016Dear Madame, thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
