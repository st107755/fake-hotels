We spent a weekend in Venice, but decided not to stay on the main island. Instead, we chose the Hilton, although it is on the island of Guidecca. But trust me, this is really not a problem as the hotel offers free shuttle boats to San Marco square and to Zattere. By the way, I recommend to take the Zattere stop, as it allows you a beautiful stroll to reach the center. In the Hotel, we had a room with the view over the "Canal de la Guidecca" on to Venice. Very nice. The rooms are big, and although, the building is ancient, everything is perfectly maintained. We didn't have dinner, but the breakfast is not to be missed. You can start your day here with a great variety of foods, and, if you like to spoil yourself, with a glass of Prosecco. The roof bar is also a must. Check it out!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments.
