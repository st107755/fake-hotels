I stayed for three nights at this wonderful hotel to attend a conference. Rooms were spacious and quiet with quality details; mine looked at dowtown Venice. The hotel provided a free shuttle to Zattere and to San Marco, so it was easy to get to the centre of Venice. Very friendly staff and good breakfast. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 10, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for your excellent feedback with regards to your stay during the conference you attended at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
