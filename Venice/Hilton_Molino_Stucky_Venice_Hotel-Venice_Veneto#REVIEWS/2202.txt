Great hotel situated across the canal from Venice necessitating use of the Hilton water shuttle which is fun but they charge for.  Come on Hilton. Don't open a hotel inaccessible by public transport then charge guests for the  privilege.  Pool not open despite it supposedly from 1st May.   Glad we got upgraded free of charge as the two niggles for £1600 a night would have really p****d me off if j had paid full price for the suite we were upgraded to.  Even so a good hotel choice for Venice Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Direttore generale at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 6, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are delighted to read that you had a nice stay with us and appreciate your comments and criticism with regards to our shuttle boat service which has a cost of € 4,50 per person per stay. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Giudecca island is indeed accessible to public transport and besides our shuttle boat and private water taxies, the ACTV vaporetto station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
