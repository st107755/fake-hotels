The Mulino Stucky is a beautiful hotel with wonderful amenities.  The rooftop pool with its amazing views was a pleasant retreat after a day of touring.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  The only down side to this hotel would be that you must take a water taxi and/or shuttle anytime you want to go somewhere.  The hotel does have a free shuttle that takes you to two different areas but when trying to go back to the hotel it was really hard to find the shuttle and they run on a very limited basis.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
