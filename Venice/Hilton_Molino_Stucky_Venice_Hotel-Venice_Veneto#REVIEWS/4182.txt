My wife and I stayed at the executive room on the 6th floor. The view from the room was amazing anytime of the day out looking the river and main islands. The hotel was not on the main island. So, it was very quiet which we liked. The hotel provided free shuttle boat service. However, it could get crowded sometimes and had to wait for the next boat to come by. Not so good when it rained and you had no place to hide at the Zattere stop. May not be good for people with lots of baggages or have problem walking. As you have have to take the waterbus from the train station to Zattere stop, walk ~2 minutes to the Hilton shuttle boat stop, then take the shuttle to the hotel. But it's all manageable or you can take the water taxi. The breakfast buffet was great with many selections.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
