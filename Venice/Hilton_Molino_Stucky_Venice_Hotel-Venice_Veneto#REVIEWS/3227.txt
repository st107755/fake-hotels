Check in was easy and smooth, be careful as we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a better room for $40 Eur/p/N extra, having looked at the  more expensive room it was the same as the room we chose not to upgrade too? the staff are very friendly and helpful, especially Carlo the concierge, the breakfast is very good,  we only ate in the bar once which was less than impressive, not sure about the restaurant. The Hilton have their own shuttle boat to take you to San Marco or Zattere, this works well as the boats seem to run every 30/40 mins, so it is easy to move around Venice. Being out of the hustle and bustle of Venice is rather relaxing, you can still enjoy the boats and canal activity which is what Venice is all about, would stay here again especially in the off season.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 2, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for posting you positive review with regards to your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.

As regards the upgrade which was offered to you upon arrival, may I confirm that our colleagues from Front Desk usually inform our guests about available upgrades and although you did not see a difference with the initial room you booked, I trust that the category was a different one. Our hotel in fact,  has various and different levels of rooms, from standard to deluxe and executive rooms and suites with and without view.  We place great value on Guestsâ€™ opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in the near future.  Sincerely,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
