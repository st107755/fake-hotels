A nice hotel in a very bad location. Across the channel from Venice itself. They advertise a free water taxi to Venice, but they don't tell you that they don't promise you can get on the taxi. I spent 2+ hours waiting for a taxi that wasn't full to get back to the hotel. Pair this with very high drink in the bar ( 15-20 euros for a thimble sized scotch). and the fact that the waiter dropped a tray of drinks at the roof top bar and didn't bother to clean it up for an hour. we had to wade thru the broken glass to leave. Not what I expected as a Hilton Honors member. Steer clear of this property.it  really tainted our Venice visit.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 20, 2015Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minute walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 inutes. Please accept our apologies for the lack of service and attention you have experienced at our Skyline Bar. I have addressed the issue to our Food & Beverage Manager and rest assured this is indeed an isolated incident. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
