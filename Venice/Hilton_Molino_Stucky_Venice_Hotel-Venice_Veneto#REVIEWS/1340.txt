This beautifully re-purposed property totally wowed us. The private water taxi runs from just off the celebrated St. Mark's Square to the hotel in a matter of a few minutes. The staff is cordial, knowledgeable, and definitely exerts itself to make your stay the best. We had an internet issue the first night, called the desk for advice, and within minutes an IT savy staffer arrived to provide hands-on help.Definitely the finest of the Hilton brands  and locations we've visited. Rooms are HUGE and well appointed. Noise is no consideration at all. Even with all the dinning options available by water taxi, you'll want to do a sunset or nite-caps from the roof-top terrace.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 25, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
