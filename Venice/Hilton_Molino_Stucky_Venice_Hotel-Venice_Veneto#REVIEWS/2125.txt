We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel as part of a pre-cruise package, so we did not select the hotel on our own.  We have mixed feelings about the location of the hotel.  It is a good location if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist attractions (about a 15-20 minute boat ride away).  The hotel does provide free shuttle service.  However, it is inconvenient if you want to go out for a quick bite to eat.    We arrived on a rainy day in May, and ate lunch in the Rialto Bar and Lounge while waiting for our room.  After seeing hotel guests coming in drenched from the rain, we decided it would be best to stay in the hotel.  Food prices were outrageous - 88 euros for a hamburger, soup, Caesar salad, 1 bottle of still water and 2 glasses of wine.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 6, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky.
