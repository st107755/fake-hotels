In 2016 there should be no excuse of not having free Wi-Fi in all rooms in a hotell and especially a 5-star hotel like Hilton. The cost of adding 7 day wi-fi to my room is more expensive than if I just use 3G/4G all week and pay the bill to my phone company back in Sweden. And 3G/4G does almost not work in the rooms.
