We spent 8 nights in the Molino Stucky and enjoyed a nice upgrade thanks to Diamond status! Very nice hotel, it definitely has a "new" feel even though it's in a old building. The shuttle takes some logistics, but it's very handy and saved us on the day that the vaparettos went on strike!!! Breakfast in the executive lounge was a bit scant, but free!Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
