Well located hotel. Very motivated service & staff. Rooms are clean and in good condition but many of them are dark & small. The breakfast is distributed over several rooms - what is ok but makes things a little hectic since everybody has to walk to the central breakfast buffet. Breakfast buffet quality is ok to good. However, they constantly serve the worst scrambled egg I have ever had (just some juicy stuff not even looking like scrambled egg). The hotel has an exec lounge nicely located on the ground floor with water view and good food & drink quality but it is usually pretty crowded.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 28, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback on TripAdvisor and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
