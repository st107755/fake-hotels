This is an amazing hotel!  While it is not technically in the city center, the hotel offers frequent complimentary shuttles to Piazza San Marco.  The lobby is beautiful, as are the grounds.  The hotel rooms, while a bit dated, are elegantly appointed.  The rooms were large by European standards, and very clean.  The bathrooms are also very nice.  I would definitely recommend this hotel while staying in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 14, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to review us on Tripadvisor.
