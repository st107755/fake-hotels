I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Venice. It is away from the hussle and bussle of St Mark's square, so if you want somewhere a bit more calm and peaceful, then this is perfect. However, when you do want to go into the main square, it's only a 15 minute water taxi journey. There are hourly water taxis to and from the square. The location of the hotel on Giudecca is simply stunning. Breakfast was good, and staff were very friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed my time there ☺️Read moreDate of stay: August 2020HelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2020Dear Guest,  Greetings from Venice!
