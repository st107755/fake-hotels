We stayed at two hotels during our stay in Venice, and this one by far had a better room - especially the bathroom.  It was roomy and comfortable, although the bathroom did have some mold.  One of the hotel's best quality is the free shuttle to and from St. Mark's square.  The staff was horrible and not helpful at all.  We tried to get assistance on how to get to the cruise port and we got 3 different answers from 3 different people.  The power went out in our room, but we were leaving so we didn't really care.  Overall, I would stay there again but wouldn't expect great service.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
