Once inside you do not feel at all like you're in Venice.This does not mean that it is up to Hilton standard  as the hotel atmosphere left me confused.The in room internet is difficult to find and extremely expensive.I had stayed in 2 other similar priced hotels during the same trip and was much happier.The view from the 8th floor pool is outstanding.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
