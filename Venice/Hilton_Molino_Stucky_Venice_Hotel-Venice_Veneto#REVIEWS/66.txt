Not a great experience as you expect in such a luxury and prestigious location. Many little important details can be improved. Executive lounge is small and with poor variety of food, also considering the option to have breakfast there.  Rooms are good with large space and overall nice view.  Restaurant for breakfast is not perfectly organized to attend full occupancy. We found a dirty spoon in the room however cleaning service is ok. Private Hotel Transportation to S.Marco is very good.Read moreDate of stay: January 2020HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 7, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you for your review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
