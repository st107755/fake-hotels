My wife and I went to Venice for Christmas and stayed in this hotel, which is very impressive, clean and with the shuttle boat service has good access to the main island. I don't like leaving anything negative but we were seriously shocked by the in-hotel prices for drinks... short with mixer 17euro, food.... toasted sandwich 12 euro (just two examples) so be prepared -- we had a drier Christmas than planned - even the main island was cheaper.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 9, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing with us your comments about your recent Christmas stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
