We were supposed to be in the Bauer Hotel after our cruise prior to boarding Orient Express but along with several others were placed in the Hilton. The rooms were not ready as we arrived rather early but were finally placed in a small room on the first floor with no view. The next door had TV on very loud so did not sleep much. The next day we were reallocatted an even smaller room but with a view of Venice.  The breakfast was poor but the evening meal was excellent. The view from the rooftop bar was also spectacular. We would have enjoyed this stay if we had a better roomRead moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
