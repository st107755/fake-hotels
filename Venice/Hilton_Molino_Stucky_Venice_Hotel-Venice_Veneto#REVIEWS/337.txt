There's not a bad thing that I would say about this hotel. The location on Giudecca is stunning. The staff are amazing. The room was spacious, well appointed & always spotless. The facilities were excellent, I had a fabulous massage in the spa & the skyline bar & rooftop pool offer stunning views of the beautiful city of Venice. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel & will definitely stay again in future.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
