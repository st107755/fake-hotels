Not as inconvenient as I had feared because the hotel a shuttle boat running every 15 mins, and we're lazy so we would water taxi to/from airport and cruise port anyways.  Breakfast is great (i.e., smoked salmon, prosciutto and arugula, lots of fruit, fresh bread, great choice of cheeses, someone standing there squeezing juice), staff are super keen, concierge staff are more than helpful with reservations and arranging your itinerary. THE VIEW FROM THE ROOFTOP POOL IS A DREAM. I don't really care much for rooftop pools in urban areas, but yessss see the entire historical venice under a setting sun with a glass of champagne in your swimsuit yessssss.   At around $500CAD/night during high season, it's still great value compared to other hotels in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
