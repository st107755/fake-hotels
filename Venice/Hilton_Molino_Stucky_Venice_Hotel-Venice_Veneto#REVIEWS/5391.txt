The hotel building is impressive and has been built from an industrial site just opposite of main Venice and San Marco (the 10mn vaporetto drive is not too much of a burden).  No worry, it is a Hilton by all standards and her staff is competent and trained.  Problem was that breakfast looked very much like taken in a canteen. None of the restaurant rooms were sufficiently sound proof and whatever the time chosen for buffet breakfast was, it was all too noisy!!!  Also the gym is far too small and inconsistent for the size of the hotel (about 500-1000 rooms or something)Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
