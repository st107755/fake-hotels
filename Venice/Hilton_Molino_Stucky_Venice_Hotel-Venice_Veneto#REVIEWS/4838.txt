First visit to Venice, was not prepared for how crowdy it would be.  Hotel staff very helpfull in every possible way.  Roof top views are magnificent.  All public areas are spotless. As it is on an island across from the main thoroughfare you take a water taxi but the hotel provide this free of charge. The room we had was very large and spacious.  Would recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
