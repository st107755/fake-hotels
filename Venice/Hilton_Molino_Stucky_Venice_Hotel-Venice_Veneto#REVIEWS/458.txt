This redesigned hotel from an old flour mill is impressive. The rooms are nicely appointed and the complimentary breakfast is wonderful from American standards and European offerings. The free water shuttle to St. Mark's Square is the best. The service runs from early morning to late evening allowing for guests to plan full days in the beautiful city of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 12, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website.
