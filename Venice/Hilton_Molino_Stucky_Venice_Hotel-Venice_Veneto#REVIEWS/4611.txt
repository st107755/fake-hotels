Enjoyed a long weekend here with a room overlooking the river.  Nice bar areas and rooftop pool. Staff were very friendly and the manageress very helpful with advice on best places to eat. A lovely fruit basket and bottle of champagne were sent to our room after speaking with her! A lovely surprise. Breakfast was very good. The hotel is situated across the river from the main areas to visit. A private water taxi will cost €50 one way, but the hotel has its own water shuttle service which leaves every 15 mins or so. Be careful of the restaurants in the busy Rialto bridge area - they are poor quality and £££'s. same with some in st marks square. Best to ask advice of the locals as to places to eat.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
