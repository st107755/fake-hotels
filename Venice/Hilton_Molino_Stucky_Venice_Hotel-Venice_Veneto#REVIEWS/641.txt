The premises of the Hotel are excellent. We were given lovely rooms with city views as requested. The desk staff were friendly & polite but they did not explain the benefits or restrictions of the Executive Level. Because of this we missed the evening drinks which only went for 1 hour. The wait staff were arrogant & unfriendly bordering on rude. I had left an item on the desk in my room & as soon as I realised I rang the Hotel & was told to put it in an email. I did so & was told that there was no item found. I asked them to check again as there was no way that this item could have been accidentally placed in the rubbish. Again was told that it was not found.  This was the worst Hilton we have ever stayed in & would never do so again.
