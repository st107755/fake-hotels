Outstanding gem in a renovated flour mill.  Great views, service and amenities - and part of the Hilton experience.  Away from the madding crowds but convenient to St. Mark's square & everything by free shuttle or Vaporetto.  Not cheap - but it's Venice!  Avoid the overcharging venues that deliver less at higher cost and stay here.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 12, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to write your positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky  I am pleased that you found the service great and that you appreciated our shuttle boat service.
