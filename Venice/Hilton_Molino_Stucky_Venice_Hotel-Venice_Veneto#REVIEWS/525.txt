Overall, a very nice stay.  Checkin was a bit slow, but they did cover a lot of information (boat schedules, prices, etc).  Our room was nice - a little 'dated'- but still had life left to it.  We had good views over the canal to the main areas.  Friendly staff in all aspects - from doorman/front desk/housekeeping.
