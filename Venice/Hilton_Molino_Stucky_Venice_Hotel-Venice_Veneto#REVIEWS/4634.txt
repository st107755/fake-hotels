We had a long weekend at this hotel over Valnetines weekend and we couldn't fault it.  Perfect location for San Marco which is easy to get to via the free boat service at the hotel.  The staff couldn't do enough for us and the hotel is presented beautifully in keeping with the location.  Highly recommend drinks at the Skyline bar with views over the city.  We wanted a relaxing weekend with good food and drink and this hotel plus picturesque Venice was perfect.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
