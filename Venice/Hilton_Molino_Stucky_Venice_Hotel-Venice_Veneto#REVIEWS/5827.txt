My wife and I enjoyed one night at this hotel in Venice.  We had a great room overlooking the lagoon and Venice.  The service was great...the breakfast was great and the view from the roof was even better.  We passed on the special Sushi night....a little too pricey but walked down to a restaurant just 200m from the hotel and had a great meal.  The private hotel water taxi is convenient and reliable and the vaparetto service is very convenient but requires a 5 minute walk which can be long with a lot of luggage.  Thankfully this wasn't an issue for us. The hotel used to be an old flour factory and has been beautifully restored.  It really is great. If I go back to Venice I would stay here again.  It is quiet and very close to all of the attractions.Read moreDate of stay: February 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
