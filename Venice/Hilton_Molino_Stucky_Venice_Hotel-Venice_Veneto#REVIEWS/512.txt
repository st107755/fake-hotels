From arrival to the time we left the service was superb. Had an appointment executive rpom which gives you access to the lounge for drinks and snacks. The hotel waterboat to St Marks square was a fantastic perk. Location of the hotel is ideal. Rooftop bar and pool offer excellent views and itâ€™s lovely watching the sunset over Venice. The hotel itself is very clean and airy, the guest services are fantastic at recommending restaurants in Venice. They were happy to keep our bags until 9pm for our flight at 1155pm. The only thing that could be improved was staff at the breakfast service to be more hospitable as they appeared somewhat cold and unwelcoming.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
