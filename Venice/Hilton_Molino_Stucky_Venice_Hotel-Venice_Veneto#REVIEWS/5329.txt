Just returned after spending 4 nights at Hilton Molino Stucky. It not on the main island but on Guidecca island. The hotel has its own regular water shuttle and is well connected by Alilaguna water bus from the airport. There is also a vaporetti stop about 5 mins away. The room was comfortable, not as big as what one would expect in USA when spending that sort of money. I did not eat at the hotel. There is a great restaurant, Osteria ae Botti, at the vaporetti stop. As most of the time would be spent sight seeing, one can always eat before getting on the boat to back at the hotel. Overall, a good but not great place/value to stay in Venice. If you snag a really good  deal, then go for it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 22, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
