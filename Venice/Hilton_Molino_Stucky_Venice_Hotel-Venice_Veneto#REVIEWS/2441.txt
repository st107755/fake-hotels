I stayed here for 2 nights over New Year for my 30th birthday and had a great time in Venice overall.  The hotel is undoubtedly good quality and classic in style, but it was a little anonymous and not in my opinion luxurious.  We were in a standard room which had a view of a brick wall!

It is nice that the hotel is a little haven away from the main island, but this does mean relying on the shuttle boat, which is a great service provided almost complimentary by Hilton, but at peak times it is very busy and very possible you could be turned away (it happened to us a couple of times and often it's too long to wait for the next).

We were pleased to read that you overall enjoyed your stay here and are sorry if you were not entirely satisfied with the breakfast service. We will inform our Food & Beverage department in order to improve our service.   Regarding the prices of the New Year's dinner and drinks in the bar, we are sorry if you felt they were high but please keep in mind that, even if on a quiet location on Giudecca island, we are still a 5-starts hotel and our prices are on the same level with those of any other 5-stars property in Venice.   I kindly suggest that next time you book an Executive Room with lagoon view, in order to have a nice view. Our Standard and Deluxe Room do not have outside view, as explained on our website.   We thank you and look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato  Guest Relations ManagerRead more
