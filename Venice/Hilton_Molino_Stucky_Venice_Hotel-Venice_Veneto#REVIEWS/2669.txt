We are staying here now.  Walked into our room at 10:00 PM and mosquitos flying around the room and on the ceiling.  We did not have the window open while we stayed here, but once we opened the curtain to look outside, even more flew out of the curtains.  No way would we stay here again at the price we paid for the room.   Other than dodging mosquitos the experience has been ok.  We had to wait on the water shuttle for 1.5 hours to get back to the hotel.  You have to plan your trip across the water around the water shuttle unless you get a water taxi for 60 Euros.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.

Thank you for your feedback and we hope to have the chance to welcoming you with us again in the future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
