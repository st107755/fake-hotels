We were sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay with us as we always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations.   We regret that you did not enjoy our Executive Lounge and that you have experienced a lack of service from the staff; we have pointed out the issue to the Department Head in charge for review. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that guest having access to the Executive Lounge can help themselves to complimentary snacks and drinks throughout the day as well as hot beverages, soft drinks, beer and wines. Per Hilton standards, from 5 PM to 7 PM, we are pleased to offer our guests also a selection of finger food and appetizers. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
