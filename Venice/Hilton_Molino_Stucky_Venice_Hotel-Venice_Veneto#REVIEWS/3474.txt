I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  The room was nice, no view and no upgrade for gold member, however the bed was comfortable and room was adequete.  The lounge for Honors members was average although we did not find that it was monitored and there was minimal choices as well as no stocking of different drinks(no diet soda) breakfast was ok and well monitored.  The complimentary shuttle worked out well and found no problem getting on or off. Kudo's goes to front desk staff they were great and helpful.  Would definitely stay again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 18, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
