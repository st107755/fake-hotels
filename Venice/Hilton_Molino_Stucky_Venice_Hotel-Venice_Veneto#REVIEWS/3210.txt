A lovely stay at this stunning hotel, made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. Lovely room & view. Catered well for our 12 month old baby with highchair and cot.  A beautiful breakfast with endless choice and friendly staff. The only negative was overpriced in the bar & restaurant and the Rialto bar had a very very limited selection of food, felt this was a shame as its so nice to stay in after a long day out but with such little choice after a night or two it becomes a must to go out.

We are pleased you enjoyed you r stay and our staff looked after you and your baby.   Yes, the public waterbus is a good option and will take you to the airport in 1 hour 40 minutes, at the cost of Euro 18 per person.   We are sorry if you thought our food was overpriced, we must keep the rates on par with those of other structures of the same category in Venice, in our case the 5 stars hotels. We will pass you comment about the limited selection to our Food & Beverage Manager to improve our service.   We look forward to welcoming you back  Best regards  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
