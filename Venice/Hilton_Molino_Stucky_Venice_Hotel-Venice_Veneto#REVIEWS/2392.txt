The hotel has high ceilings, a grand atmosphere, and excellent attentive staff. There is a small executive lounge, and a pool on the roof with views of Venice.  While not on the Grand Canal, there is a shuttle and it is not far from St Mark's square.  I would recommend this hotel and will gladly visit with my family.   It is one of the best Hilton's I have visited - quality of accomadation, staff, and locationRead moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 8, 2016Dea Guest, Thank you for writing such a positive review about our hotel on Tripadvisor.
