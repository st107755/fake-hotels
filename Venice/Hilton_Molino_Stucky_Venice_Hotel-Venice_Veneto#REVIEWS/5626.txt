My husband and I have just returned from a lovely two-night stay in Venice and were absolutely delighted with the level of service we received at the Hilton Molino Stucky. We stayed in a tower suite, which was incredibly spacious and had the most amazing views and were treated so well for the duration of our stay. We enjoyed breakfast at the restaurant as well as drinks and nibbles in the executive lounge and cocktails at the Skyline Bar. The hotel is situated a short shuttle ride away from San Marco, no more than ten minutes away and it's actually nice to stay slightly further away from the hustle and bustle of tourists. Clean, luxurious and relaxing - would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: June 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
