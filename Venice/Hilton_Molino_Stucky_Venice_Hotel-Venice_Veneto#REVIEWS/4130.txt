An amazing hotel and service, we were horrified to see some kind of spider on the first night, our room was immediately changed and apologies were made. We were kindly offered a complimentary lunch to make up for this, and I think this was an exception case.   The location was good with a shuttle boat complimentary service to the main centre of Venice. We experienced the Murano glass factory which was very expensively priced but was amazing to watch.   The rooftop swimming pool was closed when we visited unfortunately which was disappointing. Even still it was a lovely hotel and lovely service, the breakfast was yummy and the staff helped us make tasty sandwiches for lunch.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
