Hilton was perfect. Nice location, room was right on the water facing Venice, and the Hilton boat went back and forth so often, we never even waited for it. Would definitely stay here again. Very busy place, but lovely just the same. Pool on the rooftop was the best view in town of the waterway and the cruise ships passing by. Our room had a beautiful chandelier with exposed beams on the ceiling.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
