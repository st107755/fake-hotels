If you ever get a chance to visit Venice you must stay at this hotel.  Everything about this hotel is top rated.  Situated away from the hustle and bustle of San Marco square, but only a water taxi away from the city proper.  The pool is located on the roof and the views are so breathtaking.  Rooms are spacious, modern, state of the art.  The building was once an old warehouse that was completely renovated for tourism.  The accomadations could not have been better.  This is the way to see Venice!!!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
