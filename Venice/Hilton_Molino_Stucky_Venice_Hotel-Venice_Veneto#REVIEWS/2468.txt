We stayed at the Hilton for one night in Venice. The hotel isn't on the main island but there was a great shuttle boat that took you to two different stops one being S. Marco. From there you can take public transportation to any of the islands - Lido, Murano, etc. We had a great time exploring and the hotel was great at helping us to plan our 1.5 days in Venice. Definitely recommend!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 13, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you so much for your positive review.
