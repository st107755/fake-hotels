This summer Venice was teaming with tourists. The Hilton was a great refuge. Getting into St Marco was easy with the Hilton's own vaporetto which ran at least once an hour, sometimes every twenty minutes. It has two stops only and you can walk around Venice easily. The hotel has a rooftop pool of which I didnt avail myself as I was too busy in town. There is also a rooftop bar with a terrific view and two restaurants on the ground floor.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 10, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
