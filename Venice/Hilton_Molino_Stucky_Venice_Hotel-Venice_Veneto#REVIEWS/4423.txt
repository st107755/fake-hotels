Venice is so beautiful but so very touristy. Everywhere you walked you'll be met with tourists. I chose the hotel for the extra  benefits to elite HHonors members and to rest away from tons of tourists. To some, the location may be a negative, but the free water shuttle service is frequent and efficient enough for me. Thoroughly enjoyed the lounge and the breakfast spread in the restaurant, which included many items.
