This is a very large, busy and excellent Hotel on Guidecca opposite the main part of Venice, The hotel offers a courtesy waterbus service which I would recommend a water taxi to St Marks Square is over 100euros. The Hotel is very modern and spacious with a very welcoming bar area. The rooms are spacious and if you I recommend getting one that overlooks the canal(very interesting watching the cruise lines pass towering over you. Break fast was buffet but you can get a cooked breakfast if you desire, Breakfast can be a very busy time. I would also recommend trying the Restaurant excellent local cuisine with very good service. All in all I would this hotel as a good base to travel around the rest of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
