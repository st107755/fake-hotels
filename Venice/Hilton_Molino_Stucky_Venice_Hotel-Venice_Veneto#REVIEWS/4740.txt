We stayed here for 4 nights following a cruise. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff were very, very helpful. We received an upgrade to a suite when we checked in, which made the stay even better. The breakfast offers a wide array of foods - cereals, fruits, meats, cheeses, pastries, juices, even prosecco - every day. The hotel is located on Giudecca across a canal from Venice Island, but there is a complementary shuttle so we could go back and forth as often as we needed, and return to the quiet of Giudecca. The staff arranged our transportation to the airport. We ate there one night, and had a marvelous meal. I can't say enough good things about it.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your positive comments on Tripadvisor.
