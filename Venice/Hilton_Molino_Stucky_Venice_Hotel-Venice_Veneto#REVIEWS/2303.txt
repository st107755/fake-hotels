We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and Guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides and private water taxies, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12' minutes.

Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
