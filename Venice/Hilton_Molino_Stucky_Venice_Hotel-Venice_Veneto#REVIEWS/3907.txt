If you like being in the middle of it all, it might be tough for you, but the Molino Stucky is a beautiful hotel situated on an island with excellent access to anywhere and just far enough away from all the tourists. There is a free shuttle that works punctually and the service is great. We met many people and everyone seemed to be enjoying their stay. It's child friendly. The pool is also nice but it's closed till May as it's still pretty cool here!!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
