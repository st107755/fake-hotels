We stayed here for five days over Easter.  We had an executive room which was nice and big with plenty of cupboard and wardrobe space.  We have Hilton diamond status so we received free use of the executive lounge which we could use till 11 pm.  Breakfasts were included and we received wifi free because we had an executive room.    The ferry shuttle is free and runs till 1.30am.  The staff at the hotel are lovely and go out of there way to help with anything that you require.    We definately will stay here again when retuning to Venice.  Don't let the fact it's not on the main island stop you.  Its only a ten minute free ferry ride away.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for writing about us.
