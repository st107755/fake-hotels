This is a great place to be...we started and ended a cruise in Venice at this hotel, and it was a fantastic experience, with a view over the water into St Marks and all the passing water traffic. Get a room on the front and it's worth every penny to sit at your opened windows having a breakfast, or looking into the city late at night and watching the skylines. The island is a haven away from the hustle and bustle of Venice but the private launch only takes a few minutes to land you over. In addition its on the vaporetto stop so you can get anywhere including the cruise terminal. One of the best hotels in Venice and that includes the Cipriani!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 1, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
