I visited Molino Stucky with my husband for 4 nights over new year. We arrived by train and got the vaporetto (water bus) number 1 to the Vallaresso stop  for St Marks Square. We searched for the Hilton taxi stop eventually finding it at the opposite end of the promenade which took 15 minutes in the dark!! We eventually found the shuttle at the S Zaccharia vaporetto stop(which is the stop afterValaresso!)  Get the No 1 Vaporetto straight to S Zaccharia- there Hilton how hard was that! There was a notice  which seemed to suggest that the shuttle was alongside the stop but when we went down that path we were sent to the vaporetto waiting room where we sat for half an hour. When the shuttle eventually arrive everyone surged down our original path and pushed on in front of us!!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
