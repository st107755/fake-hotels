This was our splurge hotel for our European holiday but despite the well over $500 a night price tag, the hotel still delivered with a great location, water taxi transfers to San Marco (6 euro per person per day) and a wonderful buffet breakfast.  Immaculately clean and comfortable room with a cot supplied for our 21 month old.  Unfortunately the pool was not open (because of a storm one evening and a private function the second) and given the 39 degree temperatures, it would have been nice to have had a swim.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Sir, thank you very much for your positive feedback on TripAdvisor. I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hotel and our services and that you enjoyed your stay at our property. Please accept my apologies with regards to the fact that you could not enjoy our rooftop pool, we have experienced this Summer some heavy storms which have indeed affected some of our outlets. I would like to take this opportunity to inform also other travelers that we charge 6 euros per person per stay to use our shuttle boat to St. Marks square. We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you and your family with us again. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
