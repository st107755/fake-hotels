WE stayed at this Hilton for five days in August.  Check in was very quick and they allow early check-in after long international flights.  This was the second time we had stayed at this facility, the last time being two years ago.  We had a view of the Grand Canal and we were able to be mesmerized by the boats and ships venturing into the area.  This Hilton in Giudecca is a welcome quiet retreat from the crowded and active San Marco area, but yet, just a short boat ride away from it all.  We love staying here because of the excellent quality breakfast, attention to detail in the rooms and the helpfulness of the staff. You will get all the Hilton amenities here.  Great restaurants nearby...  This Hilton is truly a very nice find while staying in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
