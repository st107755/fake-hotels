We stayed here for two nights over new years eve and had a great time. The hotel rooms are fantastic with great beds and wonderful bathrooms. We also really enjoyed the service of free hotel boat to take you across the water.  We had room service one night and this was great, if a little expensive. The location is a bit out of the way from the main parts of venice, but this added to our experience of being able to see more and get away from the crowds when we wanted.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 27, 2012Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time over New Year at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review.
