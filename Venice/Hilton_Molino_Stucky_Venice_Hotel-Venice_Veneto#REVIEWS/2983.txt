Look...it's a Hilton so it is professional without fault and everything is perfect but bring heaps of money.  And beware there are pick pockets everywhere in Venice and all women need to get luggage locks for their hand bags.  My wife was robbed within five seconds of getting off the ferry.

Be sure to get insurance.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 4, 2015Dear Sir, thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
