Definitely away from the main part of Venice and only accessible by boat. This made the hotel very peaceful yet you are able to view all the activity on the canal. Room was comfortable but noticed the passageway was musty. Had a beautiful dinner at the hotel restaurant Bacaromi. Excellent cocktails at the Skyline Rooftop Bar.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.
