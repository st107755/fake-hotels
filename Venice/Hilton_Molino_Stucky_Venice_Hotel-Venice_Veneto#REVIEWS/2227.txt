I ended my trip to Italy in Venice, after spending 2 weeks between Rome and Florence. In both cities I booked 5 star luxury boutique hotels ( thinking I'll get local vibe and experience ) only to be disappointed that the "boutique" aspect meant no gym, no spa, mediocre service. The Hilton was a refreshing change. Good chain, professional staff who understands the needs of travelers, almost everyone spoke English, also they have a boat shuttle service to s Marco square which is nice. I got sea sick from the boat rides and bar staff were very helpful and gave me salty nuts and snacks, apples, free of charge.  Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 28, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
