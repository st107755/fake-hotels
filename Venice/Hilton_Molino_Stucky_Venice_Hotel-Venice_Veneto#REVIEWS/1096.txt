Gorgeous hotel, extremely grand, beautiful surroundings. All members of staff were extremely helpful with excellent customer service. Fantastic breakfast each morning with a brilliant choice. The room was a good size with absolutely everything you could have needed and lovely toiletries. The view of Venice from our room was stunning, it was lovely to open the curtains each morning. The boat service to Piazza St Marco and back was a fab service and if it couldn't get any better sunbathing on the roof top pool was Devine! I would definitely visit again!
