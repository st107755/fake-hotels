Hotel lovely, as you would expect, but the roof top pool makes it stand out.  Stunning views and a dip in the pool on the roof is the perfect end to a day of sightseeing in the Venice heat.  Shuttle bus to the "mainland" is relatively frequent and a public bus is also available, although we never needed to use it so you don't feel too cut off, in fact it felt quite nice to be on the little island.  Not cheap of course, but for a treat where money is not an object there can't be a better hotel choice in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
