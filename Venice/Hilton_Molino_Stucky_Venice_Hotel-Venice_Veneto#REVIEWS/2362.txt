We went by the hilton brand at venice in the carnival season.  Pros- Wonderful breakfast and the staff there Nice view from skyline rooftop Nice lobby Boat service to mainland Bathroom was good  Cons- Checkin process was absolute pain. Standing in a long line and then had to change lines as the front desk was busy. After complaining to supervisor another staff came Room is outdated with old carpet and old furniture.  Definitely not more than b & b hotels. Have stayed in several other hilton hotels.  No free wifi in room for non hilton members  Supervisor informed us that some renovation is being planned.   It was a hit or miss experience for us during the stay.  Needs lot of upgrade to be a 5 * hotel Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 22, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
