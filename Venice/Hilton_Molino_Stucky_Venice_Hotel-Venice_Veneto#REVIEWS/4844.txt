We have stayed in many Hiltons and this one is probably the best one of all. The staff are friendly and welcoming, rooms are spacious and well appointed, the rooftop views are stunning and despite the full occupancy we were unaware of this being the case. The Executive lounge exceeds most others and is a must! The shuttle is efficient and frequent and the hotel location affords both peace and quiet on the island which it is situated on and also is 20 minutes away from St Marks Square. We came here to celebrate a 60th birthday and the room upgrade was much appreciated.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
