We absolutely loved our stay at this Hilton.  The view of Venice from the rooftop pool is breathtaking! The rooms are clean, well appointed and the beds extremely comfortable.  We found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  Since you have to rely on a water taxi to get you across the canal, I recommend you choose the least busy times that are clearly marked on the schedule available at the front desk.  We traveled at a very busy time of year and getting on the water taxi was never an issue.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear Guest, thank you very much for your excellent feedback.
