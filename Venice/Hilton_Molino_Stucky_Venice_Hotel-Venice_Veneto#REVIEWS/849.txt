From arriving to the hotel off a beautiful boat it was great. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Room was great clean spacious but very warm even with the heating turned down.  Only one small thing there was building work been done outside our room on 3 of the mornings we where there which started at 8 which wasn’t great        Not a lot to do on the island the hotel was on but great that the hotel provided a taxi boat to and from main island £7.50 each which was worth it. Loads to see and plenty of walking to be done (take comfortable shoes) some places where a bit pricey but not really more than anywhere else.  Roof top bar was great perfect view, pool was not open as still winter but would of been nice to be told this when booking!
