Lovely hotel, small rooms with comfy beds. Breakfast was great, expensive to drink at the bar. Nothing really around this hotel to walk too. Water taxi stop right outside the front door. Pool on the roof has amazing views.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 7, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you enjoyed our famous Hilton breakfast. The Giudecca island, is a nice and quiet residential area, away from the crowded city centre, which is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice and a fantastic view over the city from our spectacular Rooftop Bar. On your next visit to our city may I suggest that you visit our island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
