My review was 5 stars, and remains so.  However, the water bus referred to in management's response to me did not run that frequently at that time, and we did take it one night - it leaves you a very scary walk down darkened desolate streets with occasionsl gatherings of what appeared to be potentially threatening young men, and to the rear entrance of the hotel.  THE WATER BUS IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT recommended after sundown.  Pay the price - get a private water taxi and ignore management's suggestion.  Two grandparents, our son, his wife and our 4 year old grand daughter.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us but are on the other hand disappointed for the bad feeling that you have experienced.
