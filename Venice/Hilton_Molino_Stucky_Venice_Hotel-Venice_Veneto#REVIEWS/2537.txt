I stayed two nights at this hotel and the rooms and facilities were pleasant enough. The hotel is large with miles of corridors to navigate.  I found  its location too remote and it took far too long (by boat) to get anywhere interesting.  Because the hotel is large it is able to accommodate cruise ship passengers in their hundreds.  This meant that on the first morning the queue for breakfast was ridiculously long and the food choice poor.  The second morning, after the cruse passengers had left, was altogether more satisfactory .The same applied to eating in the bar.  The first night I could not get a table so was directed to one of their other restaurants which offered neither the food i wanted, or the prices I was prepared to pay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 9, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your stay in Venice.
