As a valued HHonors member, may I confirm that your accommodation was indeed upgraded to an Executive Room with lagoon view.  Complimentary upgrades to rooms with Venice view were unfortunately not available, though I am pleased that our Front Office could offer you a solution to your satisfaction. Our Skylunch Restaurant is open for lunch from 12 noon to 3 P.M. whereas the Sky Bar opens at 5 P.M. until late night.  I am sorry if you could not enjoy a drink before the opening time of the bar and for any misunderstanding with the bar team members in this respect. Thank you very much for being our guest and we hope to welcome you soon again. Best regards, Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
