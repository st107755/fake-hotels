Stayed here for 3 nights following a cruise. We were upgraded to a family suite which was located at the rear of the hotel and had virtually no natural light - we had to have the lights on a midday and it was a bright sunny day. It was a nice room but the lack of light really was depressing. However the thing that really surprised us was the really poor standard of housekeeping - the corridors leading to the room were badly hoovered, the carpets and upholstery were stained and the surfaces were thick with dust. The suite had stained carpets and upholstery and debris on the carpet when we arrived was still there after the cleaners had left on the following day. Not what one expects from a Hilton.  My key also failed to work on 2 occasions necessitating a trip down to reception.â€¦Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
