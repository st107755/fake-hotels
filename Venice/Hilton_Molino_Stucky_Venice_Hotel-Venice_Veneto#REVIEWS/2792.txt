I have been to Venice three times and every time I have stayed at this hotel and every time I go back I will stay at this hotel! Amazing, wonderful, refreshing pool on the roof with amazing views or Venice and the port where you can see the boats being pulled in! I stayed here before going on a cruise and it was so Convenient.   Hotel is not in Venice but across the canal but they provide a water shuttle that runs all day and night to take you to Venice for €5 per person per stay (this is the first time they have added that charge but oh well). Rooms are decent and clean. Breakfast is delicious. Enough can not be said about this beautiful hotel!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for your kind review and for choosing our hotel for the third time!!
