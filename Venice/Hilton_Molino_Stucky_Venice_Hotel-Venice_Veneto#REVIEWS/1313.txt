We loved the location being somewhat out of the madness and he regular shuttle makes it easy to access San Marco.  Our executive room had no view, which was disappointing as we were staying for 4 nights. The room is large, the bed very comfortable, water would have been expected for the price and the cleaning was patchy.  Concierge was excellent: knowledgeable and helpful and staff in general well informed.
