This hotel is by far one of the best properties I have visited in Europe.  First of all, location is quiet while well connected to downtown.  Rooms are big and have that venetian style that is just wonderful.  Swimming pool at the rooftop from where you can see the whole city.  Breakfast buffet is great with multiple choices (arabic, chinese,etc).  Exec lounge offers you amazing views.  I literally cannot wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 15, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at our property.
