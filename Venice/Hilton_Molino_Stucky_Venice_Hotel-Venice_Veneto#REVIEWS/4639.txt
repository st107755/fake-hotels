The hotel is ok and the staff are friendly. However there was a smell of sewage in the corridors when we complained this was masked by air freshener. Also it is quite inconvenient that you are reliant on the hotel boat to get to the main tourist attractions.  Giudecca the island the hotel is on is basically derelict out of season nothing was open and it seemed deserted. If I went to Venice again I would stay in a more central hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2013Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  still enjoy the vicinity in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a residential area which can be specially appreciated from guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good and excellent restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
