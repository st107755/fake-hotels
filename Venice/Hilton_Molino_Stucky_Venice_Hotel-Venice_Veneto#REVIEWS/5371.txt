Best of Venice.  Million euro views from the rooftop pool and skybar night & day. Free shuttle boat to/from San Marco.  Room 222 was large queen suite, not much view but nice and clean.  This is a 5 star hotel that is quiet and well suited for executive travelers.  if you are HHonors member, the executive lobby lounge is the spot for breakfast, lunch & appetizers and adult beverages all on the house.   Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
