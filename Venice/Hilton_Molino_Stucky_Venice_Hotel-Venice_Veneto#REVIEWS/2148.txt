Stayed here for a couple of days after a cruise in the Medi.It was down hill all the way, they lost our luggage for hours , not just us but nearly everyone transfering from the cruise to the hotel did not get their luggage on arrival. It all left the ship on time but the porters just did not get it right. Booked a double but got a 2 singles , had it changed and ended up beside the lift well and with a smaller bathroom to boot. Breakfast was a shambles, each person/couple was led in to a table , caused a traffic jam, shortage of staff, coffee was hard to get and milk even harder, to get a small jug of milk for the table one ended up with a tea pot of milk. The pepper and salt was hidden in a drawer run by the wait staff , and I mean wait!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 27, 2016Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
