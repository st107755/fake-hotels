This is a wonderful place from which to see Venice because you can retreat to a quiet location anytime you want and because the free water shuttle service makes it so easy to go over and back both during the day and for dinner. Our thanks to. Alessandro Pisciotta and Yovany Santa Torres for noticing on her passport that it was my wife's birthday and arranging for an excellent room and complimentary drinks, and for helping me get boarding passes. Considering that we were staying on points, we were treated extraordinarily well. It certainly does Hilton credit that it recognizes the value of brand loyalty. The price of the rooms for additional nights was higher than other hotels we checked, but if you have the money, this is for sure the place to spend it.
