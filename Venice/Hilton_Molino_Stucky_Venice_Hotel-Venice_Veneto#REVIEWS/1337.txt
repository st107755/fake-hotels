My husband and I spent three nights here during our honeymoon in Italy. I couldn't recommend this place higher. The room was wonderful, the bed was extremely comfortable. We splurged for the room with a view and it was just gorgeous. The hotel has it's own water taxi that takes you right to San Marco and you can also purchase water taxi tickets for public transportation at the front desk. Made it so much easier then having to deal with the lines at the public transport stops. The rooftop bar and pool were so nice, you can't beat the view. If we return to Venice, we will stay here again. Staff was helpful and food was delicious.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 26, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your excellent and detailed review of the Hilton Molino Stucky which will help also other travelers.
