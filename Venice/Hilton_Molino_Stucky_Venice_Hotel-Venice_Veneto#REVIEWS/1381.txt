This is a wonderful hotel in Giudecca Island. The hotel has it's own water taxi that runs to Venice Island about every 15 minutes. Giudecca is a quieter island, that is walk-able, and has good restaurants. There are many places to sit and view the canal's, boats and sunset from the dock area near the hotel.   The room was well stocked, very large and comfortable. There were many outside areas to stroll in, as well as a pleasant atrium to relax.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
