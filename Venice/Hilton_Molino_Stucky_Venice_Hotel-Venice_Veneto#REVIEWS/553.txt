The hotel is very nice, clean and friendly staff.  On arrival, we were upgraded to a suite, which was nice.  The only drawback is that the hotel is not on the main island and you'll have to take a hotel shuttle over.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2018Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky. We are happy to read that you have appreciated our hotel and our customer service but we are disappointed that the location on Giudecca island did not entirely meet your expectations. It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a relaxing atmosphere in a typical residential area with great views over the city. On the next occasion I would suggest a visit of this important island, where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
