We spent two days in Venice and three days at the Hilton.  This hotel was great, but only as expected from every other Hilton in the world.  The location is good meaning that it has a great view of Venice..but is far away. By far, I mean that you can easily get a boat (free and easy from the hotel) that will take you to where the action is, but the hotel is not itself located near the city.  What it comes down to is if you want a true "Venice" experience then you should stay some where else.  If you want a nice, modern, western, place to be comfortable then Stucky is for you.  The hotel itself is great.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical Venetian residential area. Sincerely. Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
