I got this hotel through Priceline. I was offered a Five Star for a reasonable price and I accepted. The hotel was nice enough, but not five-star nice. The rooms had a musty smell & flat pillows. In addition, they did not offer free internet service - wireless or otherwise. The shuttle stops on Venice to get to the hotel are not identified and we had to call the hotel to find out where we catch the hotel shuttle. Once that was figured out we got used to taking the shuttle back & forth to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
