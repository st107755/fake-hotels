Great spot. Rooftop view, best around, magnificent looking Hotel, on Giudecca Island. Has its own ferry, on the hour, great resource. Skyline Bar and pool, day or evening, excellent, throw in the views and what can be better!  Breakfast world class, and we enjoyed its  Bacaromi Restaurant.  Gym well equipped, and when you step outside the front door, an amazing view of the main canal, and a 2 kilometer walkway, with great cafes, dining locations, inexpensive to expensive.  Stayed 4 nights, 2nd visit in 3 years, hard to match anywhere.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2017Dear Sir, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
