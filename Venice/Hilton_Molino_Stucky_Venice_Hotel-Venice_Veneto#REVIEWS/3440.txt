We stayed at this hotel 3 nights as part of a tour group. Well WOW!!! I absolutely loved this hotel. Beautiful building and lobby area, great bars and gorgeous location. A short shuttle ferry ride (Hilton Shuttle) to the main islands. The rooms were just amazing. Comfortable beds, lovely bathroom, classic style and I just felt right at home. Breakfast was amazing - an array of hot and cold foods and coffee to order. There is a bar on the top floor of the hotel (and a pool) with amazing views - make sure you check that out! Negatives - no free wifi in the room (my constant complaint about Hilton Hotels we have stayed in to date) and no bath robes (just a thing I have!!).  Apart from that, perfect!!! Check into the history of the site - pretty interesting and there are picturesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
