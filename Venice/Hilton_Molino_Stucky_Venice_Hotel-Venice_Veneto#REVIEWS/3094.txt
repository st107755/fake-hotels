This is quite a remarkable hotel. It has been here as a hotel for seven years and still seems to be a work in progress. It is a completely retrofitted historic building. It has plenty of amenities and a pleasant, quiet atmosphere. Emphasis on quiet. This place is across the water and a special boat ride is required for access. Some may like this, some may not.   There was a lot of construction going on while we were there and access to the room involved a convoluted and lengthy corridor.  The buffet breakfast was as good as any to be found anywhere.   Flying home? A private water taxi to the airport is 120 Euros in cash.  Overall, a nice place.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 14, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
