My daughter and I stayed at Hilton Molino Stucky for one night in May and were very happy with every aspect of the hotel.  The porters were very helpful with carrying our bags over the bridge on our way to the vaporetto and the executive lounge was well stocked and the staff there very friendly.  We were upgraded to a suite with views of the backside of the hotel but even without the Venice view the hotel room was quite comfortable and spacious. It's location is ideal if you want quiet yet it is a quick vaporetto or shuttle ride to Venice.  Overall very pleased with this property.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments.
