Amazing hotel and location. Was greeted exceptionally well by the hotel receptionist Andrea who was extremely helpful and friendly. Upon arrival we were upgraded to executive floor, lovely room with a great view overlooking the sea. Enjoyed breakfast each morning with the staff also really friendly. Enjoyed the little bonus of having access to executive lounge also. The water taxi service run by the hotel was extremely efficient and always on time. Overall, we had an amazing stay in the beautiful city, would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 27, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky!
