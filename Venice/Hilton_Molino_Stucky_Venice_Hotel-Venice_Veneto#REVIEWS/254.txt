This hotel is stunning. Arriving to it on private water taxi was amazing from the airport. The service is first class. Reception was very good in booking us in quickly and efficiently. The room over looks lagoon. It's simply superb views from our room. The room is very clean and tidy. Restraunt food is of excellent standard. Our favorite place is the skyline pool and bar. Stunning views from the pool area. This truly is 5 star hotel. Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
