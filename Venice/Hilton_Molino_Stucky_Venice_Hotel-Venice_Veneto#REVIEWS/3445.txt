We had been booked into the Cipriani, however this has been cancelled by the hotel due to Mr Clooney's wedding party. Beautiful building, good food. Service varies from specific experiences. Great location, has complimentary waterbus onto main island and return.  We had a lovely stay, although check out was an horrendous experience. Every transaction took an age and no where near enough staff on the desks. The room was spacious and comfortable, with a wonderful view of the lagoon. Although the chandelier was covered in cobwebs and the ceiling was in poor repair.  Still give 4 stars.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting a review about the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
