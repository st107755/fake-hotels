This hotel offers great rooftop views (pool, bar, & room).  Our room overlooked the Grand Canal, which was fabulous. Several cafes serving mainly locals are a short walk of 300 meters away. Breakfast was as good as any that I've had anywhere with so many choices it is hard to imagine a person looking for a certain flavor that couldn't find something they liked. Room was large & comfortable, but I'm giving it 2 stars because we could hear the entire conversation of the people in the adjoining room, and we could also hear the people on the other side with no adjoining room. Soundproofing needs to be added between the walls and/or in the ceiling area.  Our neighbors conversing at normal voice levels caused restless periods that I just don't expect from a Hilton level hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 14, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
