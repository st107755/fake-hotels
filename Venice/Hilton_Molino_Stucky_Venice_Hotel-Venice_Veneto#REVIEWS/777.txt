We had a fantastic trip to the Hilton to celebrate a milestone birthday with our 3 year old. Great location away from the hussle and bussle of the main island and the shuttle service makes the Venice experience all that more special. Food at the hotel for breakfast is awesome. Note, there are additional menu items to order, in addition, to the buffet. The swimming pool and sky bar makes for a unique experience. Definitely worth a return.
