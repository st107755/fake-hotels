I was quite surprised how much I liked this hotel. Iâ€™m a Hilton Honors Diamond and have stayed at the Cavalieri in Rome six times. For me, I now rate this hotel ahead of its Rome sister. Partially because the Cavalieri  is not as good as it used to be and because of the way the Molino Stucky took care of us. We were upgraded to a suite and each day received free water and a bottle of Bellini. The lounge is a roped off section of the lounge and has better fare than the Cavalieri. Their shuttle boats run often and late. The service was excellent as were the breakfasts. With all the crowds in Venice I found it nice to retreat to this very nice hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
