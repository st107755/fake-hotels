I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times both in the summer - initially when it first opened as it gave good rates, and then subsequently when going on a cruise.   The plus points of the hotel are it is air conditioned.  The rooms are modern and well equipped, but with a nod to the age of the building and a traditional Venice - lots of cool marble everywhere.  Particularly in the summer, it is peaceful being on the Giudecca, away from St Marks, and the free shuttle service to the Dorsodura from where it is easy to walk around the rest of Venice, is worth its weight in gold.   One of the stars is the roof top swimming pool.  It is absolutely stunning and has fantastic almost aerial views of the lagoon.  Space is limited so guests arriving after lunch will have a tough timeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
