My husband and I stayed at the Molino Stucky during our Italy tour.  The hotel was beautiful, the rooms very comfortable and the location was perfect.  I was impressed with the friendly and helpful staff as well.  The view from the Skyline bar was spectacular, but the drinks are a little pricey ( $17 Eu for a Cosmo).  Still, a small price to pay for such a nice atmosphere.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us.
