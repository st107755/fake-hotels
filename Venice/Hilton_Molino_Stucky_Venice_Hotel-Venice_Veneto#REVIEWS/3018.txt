Absolutely wonderful experience from the waterside location to the friendly and very helpful staff!  Room was comfortable with a garden and water view.  Free shuttle boat was great getting to and from San Marco.  Rooftop bar had incredible views over the city - 180 degrees fropm each side!  Restaurant food was fine but on the pricy side.  Outside and to the right of the hotel over two or three bridges are some neat little "local" restaurants as this side of the canal is mostly residential.  We ate at Ai Cacciatori and Trattoria "De Mori" and had wonderful meals -in fact our meal at De Mori with coctail and wine was less expensive than the "American" breakfast for two at the hotel!!  I would stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 28, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
