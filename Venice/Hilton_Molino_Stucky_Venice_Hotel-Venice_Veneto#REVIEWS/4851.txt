This was a perfect spot for a post cruise stay in Venice.  We booked this on our own and not through the cruise line.  It is a big Hilton but is so gorgeous. Our room, over looking the canal was unbelievably  elegant and comfortable. It is quiet.  The staff treated us like royalty.  We enjoyed a lovely lunch overlooking Venice, at the Sky Bar.  So romantic!  The roof top pool is one the prettiest I've ever seen. I loved having a retreat from the crowds.  The hotel has a convenient  water bus to take you to the action at St. Mark's Square.  After a long day of sight seeing the hotel's gracious unhurried hospitality was a gift.  We also enjoyed the restaurants on Giudecca Island. The knowledgable and enthusiastic concierge sent us to some fabulous local restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
