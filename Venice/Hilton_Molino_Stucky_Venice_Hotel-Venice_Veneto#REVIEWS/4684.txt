I have stayed at this hotel for two night & I wish I stayed longer. First of all the hotel has its own complimentary shuttle boat to st. marks square and to zattere so no worries about the transportation. Either the hotel is very new or recently renovated. The hotel is perfect in all aspects. Though there was no special treat for diamond Hilton Honor members, I was total satisfy. It might seem to you that this hotel is overpriced but believe me it worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay.
