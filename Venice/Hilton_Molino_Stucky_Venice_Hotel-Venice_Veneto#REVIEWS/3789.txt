One of the best things I can say about this hotel is the free water taxi service they provide. It's a wonderful thing they offer to use to and from the hotel to other areas in Venice. The top of the hotel where the pool is, is AMAZING! The pool is nothing special, in fact it's kind of small. But the view is wonderful. The breakfast in the morning is good as well. We had executive rooms, so we got it for free. They also put out good snacks and what not as well. We booked our rooms as executive rooms, but somehow my parents ended up with our reservation. So the hotel ended up giving us executive privileges as well. I was disappointed when I found out that since the reservation was booked as "executive room" that both rooms looked identical when one was suppose to be "executive".â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
