As part of a Viking ocean cruise pre departure package,  we stayed in this large, pleasant hotel and except for the service of the front desk staff would recommend.   The location away from the justle bustle of the main island, room, buffet breakfasts and ammenities are all above average.   The big disappointment was the late night front desk staff as well as the morning manager.  Both days we encountered less than helpful level of support.  On the other hand the concierge services were good.   The hotel is probably at it's finest when not at a "completely full" status.
