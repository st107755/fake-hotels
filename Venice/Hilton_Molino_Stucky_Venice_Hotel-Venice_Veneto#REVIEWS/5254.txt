I was really pleasantly surprised by the Molino Stucky. Friendly, efficient staff. I liked the location at the end of Guidecca. You're away from the crowds and the hotel boat (5 mins to Zattere, 10 mins to San Marco) is frequent and leaves right from the door (as does the Alilaguna boat to the airport). There are a couple of good restaurants nearby. The hotel also seems to offer some really good rates. Downside: breakfast was so-so -- poor coffee, which is a disappointment in Italy, but otherwise a large buffet. If I knew a really romantic, intimate little place in Venice that was clean, comfortable, quiet and great value I might just recommend that instead -- but I've only stayed at the Stucky and I thought it was fine.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay.
