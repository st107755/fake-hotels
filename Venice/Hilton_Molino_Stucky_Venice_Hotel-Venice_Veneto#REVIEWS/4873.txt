The hotel is in a great location away from the hustle & bustle of Venice, but just a few mins away from St Marco square by boat. Its well worth paying for executive club rooms as this includes breakfast (hot & cold), snacks thoughout the day & evening including drinks. Food is expensive at the hotel but there are many restaurants nearby. Also nearby which is useful are bakery and supermarket. The pool at the hotel was a great way to cool off in the summer heat, although did get very busy. The rooms where very nice, well worth paying for a view too.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
