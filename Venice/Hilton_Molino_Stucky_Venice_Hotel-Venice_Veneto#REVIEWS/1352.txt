We stayed here in May 2017 to celebrate a milestone birthday. Lovely hotel in an old historic flour mill. We had a delux room with lagoon view of Venice that was just fabulous. Hotel staff were friendly and very helpful , with a special mention to the excellent concierge service.  The hotel ran regular shuttles to to St Marks which were part of the whole experience arriving right next to the square on modern comfortable boats.  Would love to return.
