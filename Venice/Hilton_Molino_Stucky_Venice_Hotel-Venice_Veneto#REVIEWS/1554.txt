Located on the Giudecca island with a beautiful view of the city. The hotel offers free boat shuttles every 20 min to the San Marco square. If you don't want to take the boat at night, there are plenty of restaurants on the island, only a few minutes walk from the hotel. I have mixed feelings about this hotel. A plus for the friendly staff and excellent breakfast. A minus for the room. I had a pretty strong unpleasant sewage smell in my room, coming from the shower. As the hotel was fully booked I could not change rooms. On two occasions during the five days I stayed there, the water in the shower was only luke warm and never got really hot even though I let it run for almost 10 min.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 30, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for having taken the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
