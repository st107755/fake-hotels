This was my 5th stay at this great hotel.  I love it, and everyone I have spent time at this great hotel loves it too.  They treat Hhonors Diamonds well, the lounge was better in my opinion when it was on the top floor, but it still is nice.  The Hotel is great, and has amazing paintings, and glass art throughout the hotel, including the Murano Chandeliers in every room I have been in.  The shuttle boat is great, takes you in a timely manor to your choice of two great locations in Venice to get anywhere else you may want to go.  Concierge's have always been great at getting reservations and recommending good food.  The food in the hotel restaurants is very good as well, and the only thing left wanting is for a longer serving time of wine and beer in the executive lounge (5-7pm).â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 13, 2013Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
