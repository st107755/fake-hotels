It's everything you would expect from a chain hotel. Non-personable service, unreasonable laundry prices, expensive wifi, breakfast not included. The room was nice, but located on a southern island that you have to shuttle to get to the main interconnected islands. The shuttle became an inconvenience after a couple days. You have to pay for wifi unless you sign up for their Hilton rewards. If it wasn't for the following i'd give a 3 instead of 4 star: Amazing breakfast. Everything you can imagine. Cool rooftop pool with great view. Shuttle service ran often enough. Nice clean building. Verdict: I'd stay in a boutique hotel in the main islands before coming here again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
