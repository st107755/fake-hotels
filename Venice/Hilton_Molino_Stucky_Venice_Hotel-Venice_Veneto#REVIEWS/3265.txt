We arrived in Venice for a day trip but decided to stay a night to fully experience it more.  The hotel could not have been more inviting. Very helpful staff, well appointed with facilities. Very large rooms.  The boat provided by the hotel makes it very easy to get here from the local area, water taxi provide direct service.  If you are in Venice, come here!Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2015Dear  Guest,  We are glad that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and we thank you for taking the time to leave your review.
