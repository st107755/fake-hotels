We stayed here for almost a week and it was really nice. I loves the building,the spa,the personnel...everything. I would recommend,in case you can choose,to stay at the 6th floor: the view is amazing. Be careful that the hotel boat usage will be charged at the end. We will definitely pick it again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
