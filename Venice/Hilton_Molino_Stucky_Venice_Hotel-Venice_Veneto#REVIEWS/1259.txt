I'm a marriott guy, but I traveled with friends and they are hilton folks so we used their points for the Venice stay.  I couldn't have been more impressed.  The service was outstanding (especially if you are a member and can access their lounge) and the property itself is stunning.  I've been to Venice three times and this was by far the best. Don't hesitate to reserve.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 30, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
