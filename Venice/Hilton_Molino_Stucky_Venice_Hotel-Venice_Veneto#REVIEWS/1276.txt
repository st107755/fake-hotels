For a picky traveler, this former flour mill dating back to the 19th century is probably the best way ever to enjoy Venice: close enough to enjoy the city, but far enough to avoid the crowds. Located on the island of Giudecca, the hotel is 5 minutes boat trip from “main Venice.” The hotel provides a very on time shuttle to get you there, but in case you rather go on your own, you are also a short 3-minute walk from the public ferry station of Sacca Fisola. The hotel is everything a Hilton should be, great rooms, excellent service, and great restaurants. But best of all is the pool on the roof of the hotel.  This hotel is without a doubt the way to relax after a day walking around the city.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 20, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
