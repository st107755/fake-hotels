This hotel is a boat ride across the Guidecca canal on the mainly residential island of Guidecca.   Although it was only early April it was already getting busy in Venice so being a boat ride away from the crowds was brilliant.   Both the hotel and our cruise line operated frequent water buses across to Piazza San Marco.  The hotel is a massive renovated flour mill which had belonged to the richest man in Venice.   Excellent choice of food for breakfast.  Choice of eateries on site or back across to the many choices in Venice.  We ate a good reasonably priced lunch on Guidecca surrounded by locals.    Dinner at the hotel not cheap but excellent.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 24, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor. I am pleased that you have enjoyed your stay with us and that you liked the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, away from the crowded city centre, which is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice and a fantastic view over the city from our spectacular Rooftop Bar. The Giudecca island  is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Canal.  We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
