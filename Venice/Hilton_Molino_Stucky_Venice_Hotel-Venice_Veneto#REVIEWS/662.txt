Had 4 nights here at the start of our holiday in Italy. Had 2 rooms there. A great hotel and great base to see the city. Very good cheap shuttle to and from St Marks Square and great to escape the busy city centre at night time.   Hotel is really well appointed, with great breakfast and fab roof top pool with stunning views over the city. All the staff were excellent, friendly and helpful.   Overall very happy with this hotel. And of course the kids LOVED the Nutella bar for an afternoon treat of pancakes/ waffles with Nutella of course!
