We booked this hotel from the pictures and reviews which did not disappoint. On arriving they had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. We booked a one bedroom suite and we had beautiful views of the canal. This is on Guidecca Island which you have to take a public ferry boat or they have a water bus shuttle that leaves every 20 mintues to go to the mainland. The views are amazing and there is a rooftop bar and pool that is perfect to have a bellini and watch the sun set.
