Wonderful hotel ! With a fantastic roof bar overlooking the main island of Venice . A great combination of old and modern . Comfy rooms and good facilities . Great view from window , watching the cruise ships come into port .  A good breakfast set you up for the day . Nice restaurants too . Drinks a little pricey but to be expected . Would stay again üëçRead moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
