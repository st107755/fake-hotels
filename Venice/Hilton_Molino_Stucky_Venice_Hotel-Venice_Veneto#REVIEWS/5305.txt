We stayed one night after arriving from a 14 day cruise.  Our ship docked directly across from the Molino Stucky so that was convenient.  It still cost us 50 Euros for a water taxi to get across the canal.  After that the Hotel has it's own water bus - which is free.  The front desk staff was very good and were able to let us in our room at 8:15am-after we left the cruise ship.  They also booked a water taxi for us to take us to the airport the next morning(100 Euros).  The room was very nice with a nice view of the canal.  We ate supper in the bar/restaurant - it was good but a little expensive.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 14, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
