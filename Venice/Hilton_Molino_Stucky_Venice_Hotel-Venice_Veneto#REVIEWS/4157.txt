We stayed here 2 nights as part of a tour group.  Although we were out most of the days it was great to come back to a comfortable bed, a generous size room and a great bathroom with a shower separate from the bath.  The breakfast was excellent and the hotel has a complimentary ferry to St Mark's square which runs frequently.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
