This hotel really is wonderful. Staff are very polite and cater to every need. There is a Hilton Water Taxi which comes reguarly and stops outside the hotel that takes you to St Marcs. It takes no time at all and only charges you €6 a day. It can get very busy during the sight seeing and we found that jumping in the water taxi and coming back to the Hilton was just what we needed. It was quiet and relaxing. We loved that we could escape the madness before returning in the evening for dinner. Only downside is our aircon wasnt the coolest. It did get very warm and felt it was cooler with the windows open. Hotel is immaculate. Amazing facilities! The Sky Bar is quite something.. but i reccomend not ordering a Hennessy & Coke as this cost us €35!!!! We didnt know this until the bill…Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 12, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
