I am a Hilton Honors member, so I got a great upgrade to a little suite. The bathroom was gorgeous, the views (which were on the far side of the island) was nice. The bed was comfortable. The biggest things that I would mention is to pay attention to the boat schedule/shuttle to Venice--and make sure you know WHERE it picks you up near San Marco Plaza--other boats use the same slip. Most everyone spoke English, which was great. Oh, I guess they don't use washcloths there, which was sort of wierd, but it was a very nice hotel. I ate in the Executive lounge for breakfast and around dinner time. Breakfast you need to ask for a pop if you want it. Eggs and bacon were luke warm, usually.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 4, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
