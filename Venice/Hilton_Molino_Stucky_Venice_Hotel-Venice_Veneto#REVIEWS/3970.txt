Great building, staff, free boat shuttle a must and on time. For 5 star you should get free room wifi, pool was closed, food and drink did not need to be so pricey hence nobody eats in!! Rooftop bar amazing, Coffee maker needs upgrade! Walk down to local shop on same side and local bar Botti for local atmosphere, great for people watching and lower prices! All in a v good hotel.
