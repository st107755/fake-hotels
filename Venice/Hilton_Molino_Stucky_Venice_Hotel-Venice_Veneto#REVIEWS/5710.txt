The location is off  the main tourist trails and the impressive  architecture makes it special. We had standard room # 123 and it was good enough for the price we paid (priceline-rate). The Rialto Bar is ok for a drink after a hard days sightseeing. The complementary shuttle service to St Marks square is convenient.Read moreDate of stay: October 2009HelpfulShare
