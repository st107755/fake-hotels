The hotel has great view and location. Beautiful pool with amazing view.  Service and rooms are good and comfortable.  The internet is expensive and the connection is very slow. I personally did not like the breakfast, taste if the food was terrible, too many carbs and sugar, nothing was healthy. Did not try the restaurants but they look good. For its location and comfort I recommend this hotel and I would stay again, there are no many options in Venice, but this is an expensive hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
