We arrived at the Hilton in Venice and asked if they would honor our Hilton Gold Honors? Because the room was booked through a post stay with Viking Cruises, they would not. Others in our group of 8 were given a great room or at least a room that was clean and had a working window. Our rug was dirty, the window would not close, the TV did not work and much much more. The next day, after complaining, everything was taken care of. However, our small window looked out at a trash area. Also, the restaurant served the 8 of us, food that we could get in a fast food place and charged “Hilton” prices. So, be careful. There are much better rooms in the hotel, you can eat very well just 2 minutes from the hotel and it is not typical of what we loved about Venice. Venice is fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 10, 2019Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website.
