We had an executive king suite and it was marvelous! There wasn't a great view from the room, but it was very spacious and the bathroom was nice. We also got complementary access to the executive lounge, the spa, and breakfast due to our Gold Hilton Honors status. Hilton provides a water shuttle to Venice for 8.50 euro per person per stay. It picks up right outside of the hotel, but it doesn't start super early or go super late and there are times of the day when it runs every forty mins, so we didn't end up using it but it could have been convenient if we were staying for longer and weren't so time crunched. The public water bus stop is a five min walk away and has better times so it's not super inconvenient.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.We are pleased to read that you had a pleasant stay with us and that you have enjoyed the hotel services and facilities.
