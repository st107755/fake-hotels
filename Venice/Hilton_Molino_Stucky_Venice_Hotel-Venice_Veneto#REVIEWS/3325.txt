Although I am an HH members Inwould not stay at this hotel on my next visit to Venice. The hotel is located on Guidecca Island and requires a hotel shuttle to get to San Marco Square and the main sites The shuttles run periodically and are not increased for increased hotel patronage. So I found myself waiting in line for a shuttleand being denied a seat because of overcrowding on the shuttle. I then had to wait another hour for the next scheduled shuttle from the hotel. This poor service happened frequently Better to pay a little more for a main area hotel than spend evenings in the cold windy dark waiting for a shuttleRead moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 28, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are sorry we did not live up to your expectations and though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. While it is true that we are not located right in the Venice centre, we are only a few minutes away from the city and very close to the main Venice attractions. Besides our shuttle service there are other ways to reach the city centre. The ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away from us and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
