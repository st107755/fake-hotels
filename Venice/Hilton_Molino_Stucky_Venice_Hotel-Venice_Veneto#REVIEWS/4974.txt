Best view of Venice from the Giudeca island! The hotel offers shuttle service free through the day, free of charge. Mainly focused on a  North American clientele, lavish breakfast buffet included in the price.  The swimming pool is on the rooftop, overlooking Venice. Large common areas and a nice garden, where you can also have breakfast. We had room 709, large room and bathroom, fine amenities. But most of all: a spectacular view of Venice!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
