I love this hotel!! It is on guidecca island which is about ten min boat ride to san marco square the hotel has its own ferry boat which is very convenient. We actually like that it was on its own island. We got the executive room with view that had an amazing view of the canals .. i would def recommend getting the view if you can its totally worth it . We also used the lounge a few times for waters and coffee and snacks. They also have a happy hour with wines and beer which was nice. All of the staff was amazing and went out of their way to make our stay great .. our room was beautiful with high ceilings. It was my husbands birthday and they even surprised him with a cake in the room .. We used the rooftop pool several times .. the water was nice and there is a bar up thereâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 30, 2018Dear Madame, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
