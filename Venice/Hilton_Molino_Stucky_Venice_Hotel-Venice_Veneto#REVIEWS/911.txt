Lovely friendly welcome to the hotel Beautiful situation on the water edge Our first room unfortunately smelled of cooking so we asked to move which was no problem to the staff. The exec lounge was ok - not as well stocked with drinks and snacks as many other Hilton exec lounges but nicely situated at the front of the hotel overlooking the water.  It would be nicer if there were comfy sofas in the exec lounge rather than table and chairs. Spa is excellent - had a lovely treatment there  The gym is reasonable Definitely recommend staying there and the boat service across to St Marco makes getting about so easyRead moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
