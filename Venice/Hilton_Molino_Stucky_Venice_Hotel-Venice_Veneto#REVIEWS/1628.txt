Although not in Venice “proper” I would recommend the Hilton Molino Stucky as a reasonably priced and comfortable entity for staying in Venice.    I actually enjoyed commuting by motor launch back and forth to Venice (nice water views) and one gets a more open sense than staying on the “main” island.  Although it takes some effort to initially learn how to get to the hotel, once learned there are no issues.  The only situation where this location might not work out is if you venture out at times when the boats are not running.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 13, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
