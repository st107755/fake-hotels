We have stayed here many times since it opened in 2006 and it never disappoints. The location is fantastic as you are away from hectic San Marco but only a 10 minute ride across the Giudecca Canal with breathtaking views. There are loads of fantastic local restaurants offering amazing, reasonably priced locally sourced food. The hotel is housed in the most incredible building, a 19th century former flour mill and pasta factory with a fascinating history. Rooms are spacious with large comfortable beds, air con, mini-bar, satellite tv and beautiful marble bathrooms.There is a fabulous rooftop swimming pool - quite rare in Venice and a stunning bar, the Skyline, with one of the finest views in the world. Definitely my favourite place! Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
