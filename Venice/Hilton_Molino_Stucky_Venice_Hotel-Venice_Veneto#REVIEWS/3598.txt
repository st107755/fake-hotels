The hotel staff is very courteous and professional. The location is right on the water and the free shuttle service is perfect. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. The best hotel I have stayed in Italy. I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
