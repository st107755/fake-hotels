My husband and I stayed here on our tour of Italy last summer.  This really is an excellent property.  I was worried that the ferries would be a hassle to get over to the main area but luckily it wasn't that hard to navigate.  There is a shuttle boat run by the hotel for hotel guests but you can also catch the local ferries if you don't want to wait.  However, the views were well worth any delays.  The pool deck has the most amazing views and the rooftop bar also has a panoramic view of all the lights in the evening that is not to be missed.  We were upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival and the room was huge.  After staying in several small hotels throughout Italy, it was nice to have a suite larger than most American hotel rooms for a few days.  Highly recommend for couples.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
