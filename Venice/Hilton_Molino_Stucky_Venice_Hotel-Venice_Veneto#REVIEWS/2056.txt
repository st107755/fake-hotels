My wife and I have previously stay at the Molino Stuckey, and we couldn't think of a better place to return for our 25th anniversary. Amazing service, beautiful inside and out. Most friendly, accommodating staff of any hotel I have visited in Europe or the U.S. Thank you for a most memorable anniversary. We hope to see you again in the future.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2016Dear Sir, on behalf of the Hilton Molino Stucky Team Members please accept our gratitude for your extremely kind words.
