Loved the room with view provided as an upgrade due to Diamond level HHonors status! Sauna was perfect after long days of walking the beautiful city streets of Venice. The Executive Lounge was fantastic for breakfast, happy hour. We visited the night club as VIP one evening and wouldn't do that again, too many other fantastic options, but we wanted to stay in out last night.  Ferry was timely and convenient! Staff was very helpful and accommodating. We exchanged money  daily with ease.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us.
