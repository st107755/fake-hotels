We stayed at the Molino Stucky for a few days to begin our 25th anniversary trip. The stay and the hotel couldn't have been better. The hotel itself is beautiful and incredibly well maintained. the views are stunning. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, whether recommending sights or assisting in navigating the  Vaporetto schedules. The executive lounge was stocked with a very nice variety of drinks and snacks and the in-house breakfast was nothing short of spectacular.  Dont let being on Giudecca and the "other side" of the lagoon deter you, this is a magnificent hotel providing a relaxing, upscale experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
