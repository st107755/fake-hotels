I cannot comment on cost, as we used our points to stay here.  At first, I was dubious due to the cost in points!  However, this hotel was well worth it.  Access to Venice - via a free, regular boat - 5 mins across the water and 20 mins to St Marks Square.  The rooms are very large, with everything you would expect.  We had a view of Venice, which was spectactular.  Great Restaurants, good gym and lovely spa.    Breakfast has everything you would want.  Finally, a roof top bar (highest in Venice) with a small but good pool.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you posted on our property, which will be helpful for travelers looking for advice on TripAdvisor.
