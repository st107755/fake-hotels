I and my family had great time while staying at Hilton at Molino stucky, Venice, rooms were spacious, great view,food and service was just fabulous...though this is not located on main island but I guess that makes this very special as view from hotel of other island is famous, and one can just stand or sit for long to see the world move around...much cleaner as compared to other parts..of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Molino Stucky Hilton Venice.
