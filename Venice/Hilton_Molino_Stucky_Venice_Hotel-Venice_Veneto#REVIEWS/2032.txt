We did not stay in the Hilton but we walked to it from the Bauer Palladio on Giudecca. Both hotels sit on this island across from the main city. It is an easy trip back and forth to the main islands that make up the main city with the hotel's private taxi. It is luxury to sit on this quiet island and view this magnificent city. The hotel is modern and beautiful. Make a trip to the rooftop bar at the Hilton and enjoy a view overlooking all of Venice! The service was excellent and the drinks and appetizers were fun!
