Venice, Italy was the first country Me and my wife visited outside UK.   We went there last March 7 to 9, 2011 and luckily, we didn't know that there was a huge festival going on there which they called Mask Festival.  Going to Hilton Molino Stucky Venice is very convenient coz there's an Alilaguna Lines serving from the sea port near the Marco Polo Airport going directly to Hilton. We arrived approximately at the airport around past 12 in the afternoon and reached the hotel by 2pm.  Our stay in Venice during that time was amazing coz there was festival going on and the best thing  - the weather at that time was cooperating: sunny with blue sky though its a bit cold coz the season is still winter going to spring.  Travelling from seaport going to Hilton is like having mini tourâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
