The hotel is in a very quiet location across the canal from the main island.  If you have a room facing the canal, the views are fantastic.  Our room was also very spacious and comfortable.  The need to take the shuttle boat over to the main island may be slightly inconvenient but otherwise this hotel is great and very highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 16, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
