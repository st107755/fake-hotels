It's a big hotel, but a tad on the expensive side. The food menu is limited, most unexpected of a Hilton. The location is nice..the open water in front is very refreshing. the rooms are good, the loos are good, and the staff is friendly but a bit businesslike. Only the bellboys are very friendly and try and help out.  They have a shuttle boat service to the city centre every hour. Venice airport is better accessed by boat than by road!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 23, 2015Dea Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
