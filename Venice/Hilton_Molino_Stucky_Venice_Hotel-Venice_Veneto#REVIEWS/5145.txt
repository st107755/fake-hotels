My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel and it was one of the highlights of our trip!  The rooms and hotel amenities were great!  It is a bit of a trip to get to st mark's square. But the hotel does offer complimentary shuttle to and from the square and it was kind of nice getting away from all the crowds.  The hotel room was extremely quiet...felt like we were the only ones there.  The staff was amazing!  We had dinner at the hotel our first night because we were exhausted from our travels.  I ordered some gelato, but was told they had just run out of the flavor I ordered. However, they went out of their way to find me some gelato and brought it to me within a few minutes.  We would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear guest, Thank you for a very detailed review and accurate comments.
