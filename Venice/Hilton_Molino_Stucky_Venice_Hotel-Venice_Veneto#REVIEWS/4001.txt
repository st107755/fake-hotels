Our family recently stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel.  Our experience in general was wonderful but what made it an excellent vacation was ENRICO from the Rialto Bar!  He was more than attentive and made us feel right at home.  He is the perfect representative for a fine hotel such as the Hilton.  After a long day of sight seeing on the islands, it was great to be warmly welcomed by ENRICO!Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
