We came to Venice on holiday for 3 days and our stay at the hotel was excellent. Staff were very helpful and friendly. We would definitely recommend this hotel. A visit to the Skyline lounge during the day and at night is strongly recommended.   Great views of Venice to be seen. We will definitely return to this hotel in Venice someday.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 2, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
