Staying at the Hilton now, room good, pool great but limited number of lounges so get in early. Location is good, on another island  but very close and the Hilton provide a shuttle service to St Mark square. Not quite up to Hilton standards. Asked for 2 plates and cutlery and 2 wine glasses. Room service said, "for a fee". Never had a fee for just plates and wines any where else in the world. So went to reception and said I would like some plates so that I don't use your desk top to cut bread. Ohh yeh, yeh. What's your room?, 522. Never turned up.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.
