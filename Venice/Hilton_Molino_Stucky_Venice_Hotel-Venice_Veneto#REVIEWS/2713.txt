My husband and I stayed here for a few days prior to our cruise to Greece.  Having been in many European hotels, this one was quite fabulous.  From the roof top pool and bar (amazing views) to the overly spacious rooms, amazing breakfast and service.  The Nutella bar outside was the icing on the cake !!!  As a diamond member, we had access to the executive lounge any time day or night, free spa services (phenomenal), etc...  Would recommend this HILTON to any traveler.  As others have said, it was actually nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Venice itself.  The shuttle brought you over very frequently but you could escape the tourist area when needed.  Extremely relaxing, fabulous staff in all areas.  Cannot recommend enough !!!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write such excellent review on Hilton Molino Stucky.
