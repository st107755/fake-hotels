On our recent trip to Venice my wife and I wanted to stay someplace unique and quiet.  The new Molino Stucky was perfect on both counts.  We were checked in quickly and shown to a beautiful canal facing room.  The views of the snowcapped Dolomites behind Venice and of passing cruise ships was pretty amazing.  The hotel is an adaptive reuse of the old Molino Stucky pasta factory, so it has some quirks (like cast iron columns right in the middle of hallways!). The rooms are not huge, but they feature blown glass chandaliers, Fortuny coverlets on the beds, beautiful bathrooms, and wonderful furniture. Lots of attention to detail here. The drawers and cabinet doors actually gently close on their own.  The hotel is on Guidecca Island so you are actually staying on a Venetian Islandâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 20082 SavesHelpfulShare
