The hotel has been refurbished to a very high standard and it is spotlessly clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a free boat from Venice to the hotel courtesy of Hilton and this comes in handy as there isn't much to do on the island that the hotel is on. The view from the skyline bar is phenomenal, especially when a cruise ship steams by!  My only criticisms were that the hotel charges are too high - €8 for a bottle of beer, €12 for a G&T. Also the pool doesn't open until May, this would've been one of the highlights of the stay!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 22, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
