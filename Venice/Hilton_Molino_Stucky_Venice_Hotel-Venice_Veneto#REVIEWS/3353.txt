My sister and I had a 4 night stay in September.  The hotel is in a very tastefully refurbished flour mill, keeping the orginal design and utlilising this to provide a modern, comfortable hotel on the peaceful island of Guidecca.  We thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities to swim in the roof top pool, sunbath and just watch the cruise liners glide gracefully past the hotel going in and out of the Port of Venice. The views from the roof top are spectacular. The hotel is ideally situated for those who want the opportunity to relax in a calmer atmosphere than that around Piazza San Marco, yet is only a complimentary water shuttle ride from the main tourist sites and museums.  The hotel water taxi shuttle ran to time and so it was easy to go back and forth to the centre of the city. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your comments about your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
