Stayed here for a couple of nights.  We were in Venice to celebrate my partner's birthday and were upgraded to a Tower Suite which was a huge treat.  We had lots of space, and terrific views.  Being first-time visitors to Venice, we were unsure what to expect and were initially a bit hesitant about staying in Giudecca - but we felt we'd made a good choice.  We rather enjoyed staying here, being able to get away from the hustle-bustle of the busy touristy parts of Venice.  The hotel has a shuttle boat to San Marco, but it was only an hourly service so we ended up mostly using the Venice vaporetto, which was quite convenient (the nearest stop is a 5-minute walk from the hotel.)     The hotel itself was lacking a little in atmosphere, because it was pretty quiet - there seemed to be fewer tourists around, because of COVID-19.   There are several good restaurants just along the water from the hotel so there are plenty of dining options nearby.  The hotel staff we encountered were all friendly, and helpful.  Would definitely recommed this hotel.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20202 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
