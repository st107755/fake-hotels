Stayed 4 nights at Molino Stucky and really liked it. The room was very clean and confortable, with a cozy but upscale decoration. The room wasn't very big (it was a great deal through Priceline), but had a king size bed with many pillows, a big desk, two big wardrobes, a reading chair, and a modern LCD. The bathroom was also beautiful. We had no problem with the location, and used both the hotel shuttle and the vaporettos (bought a pass while still at home). It really was nice to come back to the quiet of Giudecca at the end of a busy day.  The staff was also really nice throughout our stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
