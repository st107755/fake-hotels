We traveled to Venice at least once a year for business or vacation and visited Stucky each time too enjoy their rooftop terrace, cocktails and amazing sunsets.  This time we decided to stay at Stucky and it was a great experience.  The rooms are large, in comparison to any other hotel in Venice and their services were great.  Breakfast was included and it was fantastic.  Plus having a shuttle service to San Marco is a great benefit and am awesome deal!Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 1, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for choosing Hilton Molino Stucky this time for your stay in Venice; I am glad to hear that you liked the Hotel and our services!
