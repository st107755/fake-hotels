Fantastic hotel! Location is 15 miniute boat ride from San Marco Island, The hotel runs a frequent shuttle boat to and from for a small fee of â‚¬3 per stay at the Hotel. The roof top pool and bar gives you amazing views of the city and a place to relax. Only downside is you have to pay for Wifi in the rooms which for such a good hotel this should be included in the price.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments.
