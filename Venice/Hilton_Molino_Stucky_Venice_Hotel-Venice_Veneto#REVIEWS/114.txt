After the crowds of San Marco, we were happy to come back to the peace and quiet of the Hilton on Giudecca.  Another reviewer said that there was nothing to do around the hotel, but we found beautiful, quiet canals to stroll along, beautiful churches to explore and delicious coffee and food in the local restaurants.  Of course the hotel is full of history and charm, the breakfast buffet was plenty and the shuttle service convenient.  The highlight, though, was Ms. Yessie at the concierge who bent over backwards to help me recover a backpack that I (stupidly) left on the boat from the airport.  Thank you, Hilton Molino Stucky, for a wonderful and memorable visit to Venice. We will stay with you again if we ever come back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 20195 Helpful votes1 RepostHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 30, 2019Dear Guest, It was a true pleasure to welcome you to our hotel and we are glad that you have enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
