Beautifully restored hotel, amazing views from the rooftop bar.  However cost to upgrade room with a view expensive when the room was available anyway. Helpful staff, Wifi expensive however free in all public areas. Menus for both restaurants poor ( mainly fish) however we found a lovely resturant called Harry's Dolci which was just over the small bridge at the side of the hotel.
