Stayed here two nights. Unfortunately spent whole of one day organising journey out because of the flight cancellations. However the room was fantastic. Very quiet (stayed one night at a 3 star afterwards and regretted it, would rather have payed the extra and stayed in the Hilton). Room was beautiful, large, very well laid out and quiet. (I hate noisy rooms !)  Hotel allowed colleagues to stay on at the same good rate. Did not profiteer from the flight cancellations so full marks.  Although a boat ride to the man attractions, shuttle boats were always on time.  Only criticism is that the internet at Euros 27 was very overpriced.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
