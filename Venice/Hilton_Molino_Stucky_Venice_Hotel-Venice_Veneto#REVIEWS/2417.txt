Stayed in this hotel with friends last summer.  The views from the rooftop are amazing and especially at night in the sky bar. The swimming pool was a blessing as it was very hot.  Prices are a bit steep but there are plenty of little cafes/bars a 5 minute walk away. The shuttle boat takes about 10 mins to St.Mark square and it's actually a nice trip over and nice to be away from the crowds.  The breakfast was amazing, fresh, plentiful and lots of choice. The staff were polite and helpful. The shuttle boat was full one day and the receptionist noticed and ordered us a private taxi paid for by the hotel.   My only moan is that we had a triple room and one of the beds was a camp bed, I wouldn't expect that from a hotel of this standard .
