this was a great hotel. beautiful place, great pool (on the roof!), and a fantastic location. complimentary transportation brought us where we needed to go. service was great, kind, knowledgeable staff, and beautiful rooms. we had no complaints, and had a wonderful stay. we were there for only a night, but that was long enough to tell that it was a great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
