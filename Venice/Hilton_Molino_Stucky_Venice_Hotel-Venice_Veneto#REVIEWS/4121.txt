This is the first hotel I've stayed at where a boat is required to get to and from it to the main area. The rooms are elegant and the beds very comfortable. Check in was friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are marble and roomy. The best thing though, is opening your window on the port. Each morning we watched the water traffic from big cruise ships to the water taxis. When you close the window it's silent. Still easy to get to whether you take the Vaporetto or the hotel's free water shuttle. The bar at the top has inside and out with views of V enice all round. I would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
