Just arrived home from a wonderful weekend in Venice staying at the Stucky Hilton. Water is took 1.5hrs from the airport to the hotel door (27 euros pp round trip) and run every 30 mins...hotel also has a shuttle bus every 30 mins to get to the mainland (8 euros pp for duration of stay) and last water shuttle back is around 11.30pm. Hotel was amazing. All the staff were very helpful and cheerful. The breakfast buffet was brilliant...and you can ask for omelette, fried eggs etc made to order at no extra cost. We were upgraded to a premier double which was very luxurious and quite spacious. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.
