Was hoping for more since this is a 5 star hotel. Booked a king executive room with view. Room smelled and the walls were very thin. Could hear everything in the room next to us. Breakfast was just ok. The location was ok but would have rather been in the main part of Venice. Thought it was nice that they offered a "free" shuttle until we checked out and noticed they charged us for it. We loved Venice but will definitely try another hotel closer to San Marco Square next time we visit.
