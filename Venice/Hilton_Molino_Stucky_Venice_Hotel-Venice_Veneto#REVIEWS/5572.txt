Location on Giudecca Island is really fantastic and the arcitecture sophisticated, but the "KING HILTON DELUXE ROOMS" are not recommendable for a family with 3 persons - those rooms are definitely too small (there is only one king size bed and an additional folding bed - which was only delivered "on demand" after our arrival- inside).  Breakfast is manifold but we missed some fresh vegetables (eg. cucumbers...). When we booked the hotel via e-mail an explicite confirmation was ignored (refused).Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
