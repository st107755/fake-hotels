This is an outstanding international hotel.  We only stay here when we come to Venice which is once or twice per year.  The staff and the accommodations are outstanding.  The bars give good service and make a damned good martini.  Beds are comfortable and the rooms are quiet.  The private Hilton shuttle will get you to San Marco and back at no cost and, in the evening will also get you to Zattere so you can take advantage of restaurants in that area.  At many Venetian hotels you have to hump your luggage over bridges yourself or hire a porter at outrageous rates.  Here you alight right at the Hilton's private dock for freeRead moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
