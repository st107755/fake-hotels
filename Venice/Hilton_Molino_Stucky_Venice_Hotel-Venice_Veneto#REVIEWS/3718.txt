located at an island opposite of the main part of Venice its a bit isolated. especially getting back after a late dinner is a costly exercise (around 75 Euros for a 20 min ride by water taxi). line at check in was long, staff friendly but extremely slow. same experience later with check out. room was comfortable and bed for Hilton standards pretty good. nice roof deck pool and bar even so bar service is slow. quality and service of the restaurants is far below expectations. in summary good infrastructure if you are okay with a bit isolated location but poor service and in addition HH points declined for a corporate rate without any acceptable justification.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
