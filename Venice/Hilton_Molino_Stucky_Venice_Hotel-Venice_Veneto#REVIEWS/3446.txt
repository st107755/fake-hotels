Beautiful hotel! Wonderful service, everyone is very friendly. Incredible rooftop pool overlooking the city center. Very spacious rooms and bathrooms. Free shuttle from the hotel to San Marco Square, however it only runs every 40 minutes and is sometimes full requiring longer wait. No attractions/restaurants/shopping  walkable from this hotel, so you are restricted to waiting for transportation.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
