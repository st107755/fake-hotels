I was in July 2012 with a party of 12 for a family reunion at your hotel, and I had a positive experience. The service was very good, at the concierge Federica and Carlo were super and at the breakfast room Romoulus was great. But the Giudecca location was uncomfortable and make you loose the charm of Venice. One think was annoying, no newspaper!! I understand you do not have many Italian guests, but walking 15' early in the morning in the heat was bad.... please charge 2 euro more....your guest can effort it!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2012Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical residential area. With some previous notice, we are always pleased to supply guests with a newspaper of their preference. Thank you for being our guest. Sincerely. Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
