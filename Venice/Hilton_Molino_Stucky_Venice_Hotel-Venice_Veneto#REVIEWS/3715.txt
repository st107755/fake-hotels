The Hilton's pool and sky bar and the view from them is fabulous... Just amazing!  And it was the reason we chose this hotel and paid a premium rate BUT both premier facilities were unavailable to hotel guests for 2 days running!!! Yep 50% of our stay.  Not for maintenance mind, but because management had taken more money for a private party!!! In my book that is pure greed and dis-respect of premium paying customers.   I am currently discussing my claim for a discount (compensation) with BA!  It was a great weekend and a stunning weekend, and my partner and I got engaged :-) but the Hilton's management were very naughty.   Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
