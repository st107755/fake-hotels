Stayed here for a few nights at the conclusion of a cruise. So delighted we were situated here looking across the canal......quieter, cheaper, fewer tourists. The breakfast was a huge spread, great selection. Their shuttle was convenient and ran frequently, easy to get around. After spending hours of fighting the crowds in St Mark's etc, lovely to return to this historic gem. Helpful staff, nice rooms.
