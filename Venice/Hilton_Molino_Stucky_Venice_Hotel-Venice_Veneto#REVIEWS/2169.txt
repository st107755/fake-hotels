Across the water from the main island but only a short 15 minute shuttle ride in the boat. Very modern hotel in a converted industrial building. Rooms are small but well appointed. View from the roof top bar are amazing. Would stay here again if I came on a holiday.   The area around the hotel is very quiet but charming too.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
