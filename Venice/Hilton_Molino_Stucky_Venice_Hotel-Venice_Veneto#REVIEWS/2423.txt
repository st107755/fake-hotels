The initial impression of the hotel is spectacular; beautiful exterior and efficient transportation to and from the facility. Once we had entered, the front desk made a extraordinary effort to get us checked into a room early, even though we arrived at a very early time. The room was comfortable  and the extra bed proved to be satisfactory. In the service department the hotel really shined. At our bar the tender was professional and made perfect drinks in a wonderful atmosphere. In the lounge of the lobby my wife and I enjoyed excellent Tea and Coffee service with David in the lobby bar. The topper was the perfect breakfast included on the final day. We are in the Hotel F and B industry and the layout and selection was perfect and the service during the busiest time was spot on.â€¦Read moreReview collected in partnership with Amoma.comDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 13, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
