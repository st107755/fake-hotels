While it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, we are only a few minutes' away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of bars and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Kind regards,   Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
