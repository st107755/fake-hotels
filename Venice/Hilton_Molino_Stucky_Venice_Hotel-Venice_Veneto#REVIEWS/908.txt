Having been a Hilton Honors Diamond for many years, I have seen the best and worst of the entire spectrum of Hilton hotels. This is one of the best - we had pleasant interactions with every member of the staff we encountered - everyone from bar staff to bellman, to concierge took pride in what they do and how they comport themselves.
