We had a great stay at this property. Very beautiful property, excellent location. It was easy to access from the airport via water taxi. Transfers to San Marco through hotel ferry is also very convenient. Alilaguna taxis also stop here, so convenient to go to the cruise terminal. Food and breakfast were also very good. Terrace bar has amazing views.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 22, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for you very positive review about your experience with us.
