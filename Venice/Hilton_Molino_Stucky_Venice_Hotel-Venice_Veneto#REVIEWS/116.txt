This hotel is across the channel from the main attractions of Venice. There is a free shuttle that runs about every 30 minutes that will drop you at one of two drop spots. Directly around the hotel there really is nothing for a visitor to see/do. The hotel itself is nice. Our room overlooked a small channel/alley and was quiet. Beds were comfortable and bathroom was a nice size. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast buffet was really good and offered a wide array of options. The only mark down was the location.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 29, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for leaving you review on TripAdvisor. We are happy to read that you have enjoyed your breakfast experience and it was very kind of you to mention our helpful Team Members. On your next visit to Venice may I suggest a visit of the Giudecca island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. There are always art exhibitions going on and the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to welcome you and your husband again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
