I stayed one night in this hotel. It was not satisfying in comparison to other 5 star hotels I have been to. I booked this hotel for a very high price. Actually didn't worth the money. Hotel is in giudecca and transportation takes time. The internet was not free. There were no complimentary water in the room, and even no slippers. Though the building was really nice and had facilities like spa. I tried one of the restaurants and the food was good.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
