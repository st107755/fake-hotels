Hi there,  We are used to great hotels in Disney World and are often taken aback when they say european 5 star, however this is a great luxury hotel in Venice and the free transfer taxi is excellent and runs well past midnight, so you can enjoy the late night Venice without having to worry.  The breakfast was 2nd to none, everything you could want. Lots of character, being an old mill/pasta factory, you won't be disappointed. My only minor gripe was the 9 euro fee for internet in the room, it's free in the main areas.  Its a great place to stay prior to a cruise.  Try the 9th floor bar at night, the wealthy and beautiful hang out up there.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
