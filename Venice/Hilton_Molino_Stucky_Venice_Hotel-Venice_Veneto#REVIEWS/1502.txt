I had stayed between the 11th and 15th of February . The staff at the front desk are always smiling in spite of the ruckus always in the lobby . The coffee shop next to lobby is very nice . Their breakfast spread is wonderful . Almost most of their rooms have wonderful canal views. It is only a 5 to 10 minute boat ride to the square and the hotel offers very convenient shuttle. The only con with this hotel is once you are inside ,you tend to get lost .I couldnt navigate my way back to my room from the gym for a little while nevertheless it is a beautiful hotel and would highly recommendRead moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
