We stayed here for 2 nights whilst we waited to join the Orient Express to Prague. Unfortunately when we arrived in Venice it was pouring with rain, and as the hotel is on an island, we had to travel there by water taxi and we arrived at the jetty more like refugees boat people than 5* travelers. Once inside the hotel was comfortable but not exceptional, the room we were allocated smelled of damp so we asked to be moved. The location was handy for sightseeing using the free shuttle, but I could not see myself spending a full week there.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
