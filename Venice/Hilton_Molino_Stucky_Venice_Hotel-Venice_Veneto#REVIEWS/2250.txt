This was the second time we have stayed at this hotel and were not disappointed. The hotel is situated on the Giudecca and has some fabulous views across to the main islands of Venice. Staff here are very helpful especially the Concierge (Carlos) for whom nothing is too much trouble and who has a wealth of information about restaurants, day trips , guides etc.  Somewhat disappointed with the facilities in the Exec Lounge - not sure it was worth the extra money as relative to other Hiltons the benefits here are limited.  Great place to stay - worth a visit !Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 21, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review. I am pleased that you decided to stay with us again and that your experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was positive also this time. Thank you for praising our staff, especially our professional and unique Head Concierge: you are right nothing is too much trouble for him and his knowledge of Venice is amazing. On the other hand I am sorry that our Executive Lounge was not up to your expectations as we usually receive positive feedbacks from our Clients. Whatever the occasion may be I hope to have the chance to welcome you once again here with us in Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
