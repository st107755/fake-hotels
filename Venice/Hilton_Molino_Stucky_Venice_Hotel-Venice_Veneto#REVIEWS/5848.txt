We booked our stay through Priceline and the hotel was very reasonable. The hot chocolate in the lounge is a must for chocolate addicts. Great staff! The morning breakfast served in the restaurant is buffet only for about 40 euro. Save your money and get a delicious omelet in the lobby/bar.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare
