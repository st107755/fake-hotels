Stayed here for 3 nights in a family suite. Transferred from the airport using the public water bus service which was a nice relaxing ride. It took approx. 1 1/2 hrs as there are a lot of stops on the way. On our return to the airport we took a private boat as we were in a hurry.Expensive but much more convenient and quicker. Hotel is very nice, huge, staff were very personable. Breakfast buffet was ok, nothing special. The executive lounge is quite small but nice as you can have drinks and snacks all day. Evenings felt very quiet as you're away from the city centre, although right across the water. It's nice if you want peace & quiet, however I found it too secluded. Overall great stay & would come back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 13, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
