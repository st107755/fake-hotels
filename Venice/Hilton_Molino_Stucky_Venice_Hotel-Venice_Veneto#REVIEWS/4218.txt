Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 4 nights, including the night of "Festa del Redentore". The rooms were amazing, staff were so friendly and the food was so good (we had access to their day-long executive lounge, which was quite great).  The rooftop pool was awesome in July! The best view in Venice, specially that it's in the pool :) At the night of Redentore, the hotel organised a gala dinner on the rooftop; it was an 8-course meal, in a romantic ambience ... I proposed to my girlfriend right before the fireworks start and we left as fiancees; couldn't be any better. So, overall, I definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 1, 2013Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
