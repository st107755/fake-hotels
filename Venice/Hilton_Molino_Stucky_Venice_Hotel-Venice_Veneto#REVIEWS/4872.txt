I am sorry that you did not thoroughly enjoy dinner at our Aromi Restaurant and that the menu choices were not up to your expectations. Our selection of meat and fish dishes is equally balanced with the same number per type of course and I do regret that they were not to your entire satisfaction. We do hope to have the chance of welcoming you back again to show that we can do better ! Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
