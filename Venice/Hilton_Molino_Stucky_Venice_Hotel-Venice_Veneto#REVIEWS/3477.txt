Great hotel. Very conviently located coming to and from the cruise terminal or the airport. Take the Aliluguna water taxi service from either location (8 euros one way). Stops right at the hotel. Hotel also has a complimentary water shuttle going to and from St. Mark Square. Staff was great, room was clean and spacious. Excellent roof top pool with great views but small. Breakfast was excellent. Hotel provides free access to computer and wifi in computer area on main floor.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
