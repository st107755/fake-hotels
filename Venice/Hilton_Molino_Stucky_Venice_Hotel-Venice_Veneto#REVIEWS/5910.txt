Just back from a 2 night stay at the end of March with my 14 year old son.  We got a good deal from the Hilton website.  We had a fabulous time - the hotel was amazing, huge room, great breakfast, amazing location, attentive staff, excellent shuttle service.  This is the best Hilton I have stayed in, and one of the most amazing hotels - Venice is a great city and this hotel helped make the holiday even more special.Read moreDate of stay: March 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
