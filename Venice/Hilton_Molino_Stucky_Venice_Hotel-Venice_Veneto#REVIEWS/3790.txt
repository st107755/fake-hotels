I stayed here for 2 nights in December with my boyfriend and 2 of our friends.  The hotel is on an island so you have to take the hotel ferry over to the main land, however as long as you check the times each day (they are regular and run all day) you will find this just adds to your experience.  I was concerned that travelling in December would mean that we would miss out on the beauty of Venice but if anything this just added to it! The sun shone all weekend and the square was beautiful!  The hotel rooms were spacious and had amazing views of the islands. The restaurants were varied and breakfast was always full with lots of choice.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  Would defiantly stay here again. Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
