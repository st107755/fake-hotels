Everything about this hotel is wonderful, especially its position - right on the waters edge. There is a hilton boat that takes you across the river which runs all day and night and is free - excellent because water taxis are expensive. Food is delicious - yummy breakfast! Service is top rate, staff are so happy to help you with anything. The rooms are gorgeous, and the entire hotel is immaculate. WORTH EVERY PENNY :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
