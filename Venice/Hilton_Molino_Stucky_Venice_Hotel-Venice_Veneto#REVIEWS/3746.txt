In a city that seems to be organized to exploit tourism offering cheap accommodations at impossible high fares this venue gives you a fair value to your money. A four star hotel with all the accoutrement you'd expect. Nice rooms, good food and you don't have the constant feeling you're being cheated. What it lacks maybe in "local" taste it gives back by means of good international standards. Located in Giudecca island you'll need to get a boat to get to st. Mark place. A small inconvenient but, in the end, boating around is one of the reasons to go to Venice isn't it? Giudecca itself is a place for connoisseurs. Long quiet walks, great landscapes in a place were real venetians live. Great top floor bar and stunning roof pool with THAT view you travelled so much for.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
