My husband treated me to a stay in Venice for my 30th birthday. I must say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever been to and in such a lucky lady! There was nothing we could fault. The rooms, the staff, the location and the food were all amazing. I actually can't choose which was my favourite part of the hotel... the roof top delicious cocktails, the roof top pool, the Nutella terrace in the sun or the out of this world breakfast!
