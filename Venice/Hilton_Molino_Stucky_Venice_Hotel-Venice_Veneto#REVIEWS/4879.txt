This hotel is located on an island and has greta views of venice from the rooms and the roof top swimming pool. The pool itself is great. The rooms are wonderful almost like a royal setting. The buffet breakfast they served is by far the best that I ever had and is served in a regal atmosphere. The rate is a bit high( for american standards), though by Venitian standards, it is not.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
