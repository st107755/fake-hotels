Quite an impersonal hotel where everything you would expect as standard - wi-fi, mineral water for example - comes at an extortionate price.  The historic building is lovely from the outside, but has a standard Hilton interior.  On one night of our stay a champagne pool party resulted in closure of the rooftop bar and appalling noise into the early hours.   I would not choose this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
