This was a surprise weekend away for my birthday so I'm not sure on costs. Getting over to the hotel was difficult and it was quite hard to get too and fro. I would do my research before hand if I were you. Lovely staff lilli-Anna I think she was called was very nice. Bar staff upstairs not so nice. The upstairs bar was so noisy even in our rooms I'm all up for fun but not blaring music til 2pm especially after i had sat in chewing gum on there bar stool. Pool was closed which was dissapointing. We had enough tea and coffee for one drink each and a chocolate bar was  8 euros!!! They also wanted 60 euros for two people at the breakfast buffet. All in all there charges are ridiculous it is nice and fancy but we have stayed in better hotels for half the price I bet!Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
