We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in July 2012. The views from the top-roof swimming pool are amazing and worth every penny!!! We also had cocktails at the roof-top bar in the evening and again- the views were amazing!!! Very central, very convenient boat service to St Marco. I was also very pleased that it was a little bit further away from all the crowds and noise of the main square. All in all- perfect location! We didn't try any food there, as we read that it was overpriced, so can't say anything on that. But there are plenty of little lovely restaurants and cafes along the water just 2-5 minutes away. Again- very convenient! The only minus, in my opinion, is that the swimming pool closes at 7pm. Why so early? It would have been wonderful to see the sunset from the roofâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
