Apple, Mindy, Gemy and I got high speed train from Milan to Venice 2.30 hours and took water bus #2 from train station to the hotel 25 minute, it cost â‚¬8per person, it was very convenient. Since I was Hilton member I was upgraded to the executive room connected to my daughters room. We find out that the check in staff is very polite and helpful. The hotel shutter bus is very convenient and on time. The breakfast is excellent and the room is well designed. We definitely will select Hilton for our next trip.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
