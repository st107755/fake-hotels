This hotel was a wonderful way to end our trip in Italy.  We had stayed at various apartments rented through vrbo.com which we were pleasantly surprised with.  But after packing up, touring, and training through Italy, this plush hotel was just what we needed to get our energy restored and enjoy Venice.    This hotel is located across the canal, but they do have a complimentary water taxi that will take you across to see the sites.  The view from the hotel room of the canal was a site in itself.    You can always count on Hilton to keep their hotels consistent evern Internationally!Read moreDate of stay: February 2008HelpfulShare
