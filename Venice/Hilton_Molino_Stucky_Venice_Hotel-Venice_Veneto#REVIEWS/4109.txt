Beautiful and big building of the past century which was a mill "molino", refurbished and restored leaving some features of the old times, likes the outside red bricks and the iron columns and the inner courtyards. Our room was an executive with a view in the main building "Arsenale" where there are the lobby, the bar the two restaurant and in front of the shuttle/boat which runs every twenty minutes from 8 a.m. to midnight except for lunch and dinner breaks (one hour) and goes to Zattere and San Marco Square.
