Stayed 2 nights at this hotel on a tour. The hotel did not seem like a 5 star Hilton, although I would have nothing to compare that to, other than my stays at various 3 and 4 star hotels.  The breakfast here was excellent. The pool was very tiny compared to the size of the hotel, which made it crowded.  Fantastic service at the hotel, responded to inquiries immediately.  The location is on a separate island from where you can find St. Marks Square, and you have to take a 15 minute shuttle boat across the water to get there, you can't walk.  If you would like to be away from the tourist traffic, this place is a nice break, and the shuttle boat (free) makes it easy to access the main sites.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2012Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay.
