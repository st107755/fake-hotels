Despite the downpour I very much enjoyed my stay at the Hilton (and my first time in Venice!).  I was attending a conference so didn't have much choice but the hotel didn't disappoint.   Lovely room, well appointed and decent sized with gobs of toiletries etc. to take home for all you hotel toiletry afficionados! out there.  Fantastic view of the river and the Piazza San Marco.  The hotel ran a free shuttle service over to San Marco quite frequently which was handy and allowed a quick break between sessions to see the piazza, tower and even a quick museum break at the Museo Correr (which was showing a fabulous Julian Schnabel exhibit).Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
