There are many hotel choice at Venice, but this one is so one of a kind.  The room is of good size, but with minimum decoration. The furnitures are classic if not old. It's definitely not a fancy or modern place.  The hotel ferry runs every half hours and takes roughly about 10 minutes to get you to major attractions in San Marcos. You need to schedule your time carefully so that you don't miss the last ferry. Nonetheless, it's still very convenient. What I like most of the hotel is that you are in Venice and so close to the attractions, but the Grand Canal sets you just a little distant away from the tourism crowd so that you can enjoy Venice in a unique perspective, possibly from the roof top bar.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
