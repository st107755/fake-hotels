On the other hand we are sorry if the location on Giudecca did not entirely met your expectations, however the Giudecca island is closer to the city centre and St. Mark’s Square than other areas in town. Besides our shuttle and private water taxi, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto / line 2) station is only a few minute walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
