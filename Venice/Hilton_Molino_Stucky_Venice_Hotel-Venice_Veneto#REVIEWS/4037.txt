We stayed here from 28th December and left on the 1st Jan. It was our first time in Venice and found this a good hotel as a base to find our way round. The food was good and we had the new year gala dinner which was great but at 6 courses a little too much. Only think that stopped me giving it a 5 was that the free water taxi to / from the hotel was often full so unless you want to wait for an hour you need to take the local transport. In the end we decided to buy a two day pass which was a well worth it as it got us to see more of Venice. We would recommend a water front room if you can get one.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2014Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
