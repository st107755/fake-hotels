If you want some piece and quiet in Venice this is the hotel. The building itself is beautiful inside an out. Staff were extremely helpful,the shuttle to St Marks Square and  Zattere  were always on time. Whenever we used room service it was prompt  with no problems. Had some clothes cleaned, same days service  expensive but on time. The rooftop bar is almost as nice as the Danieles.  The one thing I disliked was the Executive lounge, no where near as nice as other Hiltons.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
