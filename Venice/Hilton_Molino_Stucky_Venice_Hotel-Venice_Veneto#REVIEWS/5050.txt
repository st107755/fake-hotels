My husband and I stayed here for two nights. We had a corner room with a nice view of Venice.  We bought a Vaporetto pass so we could either take the hotel shuttle or walk a block and take another boat. Which worked out well. The weather was beastly hot so the rooftop pool was a lifesaver. Everyone was very friendly and we would certainly return. There are fun restaurants all along the waterfront, just keep walking. The view is amazing. It was nice to be away from the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
