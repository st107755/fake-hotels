I booked this hotel for the end of a 15 day trip to Italy. We stayed in apartments in Rome and Florence and the last 2 nights I thought an "American" hotel would be nice. It was fabulous!  After walking all day in Florence it was so nice to come back to a luxury hotel with great beds and pillows.  We found everyone to be helpful and friendly. At first I thought "wrong side" of Venice, but after battling the cruise ship crowds it was nice to come back to quiet. The shuttle is very efficient and we used it both nights for dinner. No problems. We booked thru Priceline so we thought the hotel was well worth the price. Would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience.
