Title says it all really... Location is perhaps not the best but the hotel on whole is. Immaculate, has a shuttle boat complementary every 15 minutes to the main areas... Rooms immaculate however 6 euro for a bottle of water seemed slightly expensive in the mini bar..  Sky bar amazing and the pool is fantastic, great cocktails available also!! Highly recommended and importantly.. Would travel back again and again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
