We were booked by a cruise company so had no choice of hotel or room. We were ok with no view but nothing else about the room was even minimally satisfactory. There were hairs in our bath tub, no hot water in the shower, an entire 6 ft. piece of molding was coming off the wall. Plugs are inconveniently located and only one side of the bed had a reading light. The walls are so thin that we could hear all of our neighbor's conversation. To top it off, the "free" shuttle wasn't even free. We have enjoyed other Hilton properties but this one is definitely on our "never again" list.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 29, 2015Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
