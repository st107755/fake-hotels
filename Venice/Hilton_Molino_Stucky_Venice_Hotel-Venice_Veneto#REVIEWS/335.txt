We stayed here as part of an organized tour with Insight Vacations.  The hotel is gorgeous with beautifully decorated and comfortable beds, large rooms. There are several restaurants and bars inside the hotel , including a roof top bar with a gorgeous view as well.  You can walk along the water and have dinner at restaurants, find small grocery stores and shops within short walking distance.   Of course everything in Venice is accessible via a water taxi or ferry and this hotel has a ferry with a set schedule available to take you to the main Venice attractions such as San Marco Piazza.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky We are pleased that you had a nice stay and that you liked the location on Giudecca Island and we are glad that you would recommend us to other travelers.
