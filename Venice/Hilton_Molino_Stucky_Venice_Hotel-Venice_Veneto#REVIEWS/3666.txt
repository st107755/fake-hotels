Being Hilton Diamond member, we thought this would be a great place to end our trip.  The room, a junior suite, was wonderful - large sitting room and large bedroom, both nicely appointed, with a very nice bathroom.  The only thing detracting from the great hotel is the location.  There was a free shuttle boat, but it was very limited in times.  Sometimes only once an hour - and you had to line up early, or you'd miss out.  The boat only holds 39 people.  We managed, but had to really watch the clock.  Otherwise, this was a great hotel with a nice staff. The breakfast buffet was ok as well.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
