Rooms were large, service was good and nice pleasant location. It surprised us how easy it was to get to by public transit with its own dock right out the front door. Very easy to get to cruise port or airport at a very inexpensive cost, even with significant amounts of luggage. While it would have been nice to be able to simply walk to all sights, the complimentary and quick shuttle boat to the city proper was fine. the hotel location allowed for a quiet escape from the city crowds.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory and that you liked the location on Giudecca island.
