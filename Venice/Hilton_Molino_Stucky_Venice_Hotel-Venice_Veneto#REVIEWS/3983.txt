Wonderful hotel, very luxurious! Accomodating and knowledgeable staff! Front desk is great for tourist information. And, ask for the extra bed if you need it (we were traveling with two kids). Great boat shuttle to the Camp Saint Agnese (Zattere stop) and to Piazza San Marco! Also the spa services were great, it was wonderful facial treatment I received and they had a fair amount of appointments available. If you happen to be Hilton gold member then you get 20% off spa services. And we happened to get upgraded to a suite so that was also nice (but that was because we have gold status with Hilton). But, a regular room would be lavish as well I am sure.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
