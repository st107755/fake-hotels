The Hilton Molino stucky is a very elegant, luxurious hotel in a great location. The ferry will drop you off, but honestly I'd pay the $65 for the water taxi because it takes a while- but a great boat ride. The hotel has a very accurate taxi to the main island of Venice. The hotel is beautiful with new areas working around the old architecture of the previous building. I wish we could have used the pool as it is on the rooftop but it was too cold that day. Rooms were beautiful and the best part is the view! The windows open like an old castle like shutters/ with no screen - so you can hear the water, boats and bells at night. Very soothing. We loved it !!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
