I am a repeat visitor to this property and remain so impressed with its quality. I want to note particularly the excellent service from the concierge desk. Both Carlo and Elena are stupendous at their job. They listen to a customer's needs, provide helpful suggestions, and are consummate professionals. I'd go back again just for them! But I also love the rooms with their high ceilings and the shuttle boat service. This is my ideal of what a nice hotel should be.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 29, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
