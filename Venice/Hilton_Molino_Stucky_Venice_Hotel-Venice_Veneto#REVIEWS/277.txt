We had a great stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky. Our room was absolutely beautiful with large windows overlooking a courtyard. The check-in process was fast and efficient, and the staff was very helpful with our questions. Housekeeping did a fantastic job.   The island that the Hilton is on is beautiful and quiet, especially compared to the hustle and bustle around San Marco. There is a free shuttle that leaves frequently right outside the hotel that will take you to the San Marco area, so in my opinion, this is the best of both worlds. You can easily access the San Marco area, but can return to your nice and quiet hotel at the end of the day.   The views from the rooftop pool are not to be missed!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
