We had a great time staying at the Hilton in Venice. We were a group of six and stayed in three rooms. However, at the Check-In I presented my HHonors Gold card and we were ALL upgraded to rooms with Executive Lounge access! I even got an upgrade to a huge suite facing the Grand Canal. This is what I call great customer service!  The view from the rooftop pool is simply amazing and the breakfast was perfect for Italian standards!!!  The free boat shuttle is very convenient and works efficient. My only complaint would be the Executive Lounge which is ok, but I think that the hotel has enough space to find a better location. Because the problem with the current location is that all the other guests can watch you and there is just kind of a fence in between what I didn't like.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
