This is a beautifully restored old mill building and so it is very spacious and the public areas are well laid out.   The bedrooms are well furnished and mine had a nice outlook with big windows.   Naturally the place is quiet and so a really good night's sleep is assured.   The breakfast was first class and there was a huge variety of food available. However, the location is not ideal as it is not on the main island and so a ferry is necessary in order to get to the main attraction.  When I was there it was very windy and so the ferry trip was not a pleasant one for people who find travelling in small boats a bit intimidating.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
