I spent 2 nights here on a honeymoon with my wife and all in all, we were very happy with our stay. It's worth the cost.  The hotel is beautiful and the view from the rooftop pool might be the best in Venice. And even on the first floor, the view from our room was great.  The service was top notch from everyone at the hotel - the concierge, the staff at breakfast, the room cleaning  The room was good too - large, clean and comfortable. Free wifi worked fine. Didn't hear any noise from adjacent rooms.  It's a bit of a hassle to get to Giudecca island from the main part of Venice, but Hilton's shuttle service is just about regular enough. We only had to use the (expensive) public water bus once. And Giudecca island is a pleasant, quiet placeRead moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
