This Hotel was spectacular and as good as it gets.  The Hotel is set almost on its own island and you need to use the Hotel,s shuttle to head over to Venice. Thats is no problem and the shuttle boat runs often and is always on time.  The room was majestic, the breakfasts incredible and the pool area and upstairs bar are incredible.  Venice was such a fantastic city to visit and being at the Hilton was really good to be slightly away from the very busy Venice. Being able to relax and swim in the rooftop endless pool is a big plus.  AS GOOD AS IT GETS!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
