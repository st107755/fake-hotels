This hotel was just filled with Venice charm . The rooms were gorgeous and cozy. The staff were extremely accommodating and helpful. I loved that there were shops and restaurants near by so i didn't always have to take the shuttle to dine out. The shuttle however was extremely reliable and always on time. I will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
