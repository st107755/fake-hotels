This is our 3rd trip to the Molino Stucky in Venice and each time it gets better. The fact that you are away from all of the hot spots in Venice but just a 10-minute boat ride to get there is very peaceful. There are a lot more choices close by to the hotel to eat now than the last visit. Taking walk in the evening is great since there are not many people. The hotel amenities are great and the food was much improved since the last time. We enjoy sitting at the bar and having a drink and relaxing after a day exploring Venice. The day trip to Morano island provided by the hotel is must do activity.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
