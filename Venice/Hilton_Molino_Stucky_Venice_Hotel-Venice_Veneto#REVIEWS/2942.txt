We had 2 adjoining rooms with a beautiful view of the canal. Unfortunately, we could hear all of our neighbors like they were in the room with us. 1 room had a hairdryer and the other did not.

Having the facilities to print boarding passes for our flight home was also a plus.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 22, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and we are truly sorry that we didn't meet all of your expectations.We apologise for the inconvenience regarding the noise coming from the next door room and we are pleased to inform you that we have a project running to improve this.
