The building was originally a flour mill and is a large stunning red brick building.  The hotel just about lives up to its 5 star rating and is located away from the Grand Canal on its own island.  It has a rooftop pool and Skyline Bar which by, most standards, was fairly expensive. We had a corner room which looked onto the lagoon however, some of our friends had drab views of brick walls.  To be balanced in my review my wife liked it and I did not. I felt it was isolated and lacking the buzz that is Venice. Access from the hotel is via a free hotel water taxi service but it was so infrequent that we walked to the public vaporetto  and paid.  At 36 Euro for a 12 hour pass for 2 itâ€™s not a cheap optionRead moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
