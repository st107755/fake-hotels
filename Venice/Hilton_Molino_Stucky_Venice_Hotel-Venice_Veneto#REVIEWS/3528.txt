We are glad to see that you liked our property and appreciated the helpfulnes and professionalism of our Staff but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations. We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed as you were disturbed the most by the Pool Party. Your comments will of course be forwarded to the relevant management for their attention in order to make sure such circumstance do not occur again.  Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
