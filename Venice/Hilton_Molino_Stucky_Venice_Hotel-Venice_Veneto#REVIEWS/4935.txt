We really enjoyed our stay. We enjoyed watching all the cruise ships pass while eating at restaurants, sky bar, and even while swimming. We were really glad they had the complimentary ferry service.  We enjoyed the spa several times and each visit was great.  We loved the cold airconditioner.  Maybe not as authentic venice experience as other hotels in the thick of the city, but we loved the American comforts. We also did an excursion to Lido Beach. It was great!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
