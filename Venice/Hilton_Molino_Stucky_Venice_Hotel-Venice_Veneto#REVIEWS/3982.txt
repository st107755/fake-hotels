A great hotel, around 40 mins from the airport by water taxi. Free shuttle to the main island, including a stop at St Marks Square. Rooms are clean, adequate size. Facilities are fantastic with a good spa and gym, although the pool spaces tended to fill up quite fast as there weren't that many. Food was good, expensive, although thats not unusual for venice! Overall a very pleasant experience that i would highly recommend to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
