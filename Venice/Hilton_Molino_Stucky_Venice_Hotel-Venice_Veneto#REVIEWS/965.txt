I LOVE this hotel.  Excellent staff, beautiful building/rooms, free breakfast, internet- an my favorite part of European hotels is a large bathtub to help me recover from a day a sight seeing!   It is not on the main 'island" of Venice but across the canal that the cruise ships pass through going to sea.  They offer a ferry every 20 minutes or so to the main area- used to be free but it now 6E for your entire stay no matter how many times you use it- a deal.  I like being away from the crowds and with the building being so beautiful it makes me feel very special!  There are excellent restaurants on the same island in walkable distance.  Simply a beautiful place to enjoy Venice!  Thank you so much Eloise for taking such good care of us!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 7, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
