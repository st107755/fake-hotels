We spent 2 night borning some hard earned Hilton points, I can not think of a better place to use them! Excellent service, ELEGANT property in an aweinspiring location. Since the property is not in the main part of Venice you have to take the water taxi from the train station, then the free Hotel shuttle (boat) takes you directly to the property, finding the dock for the shuttle was a bit confusing the first time but afterwards was a breeze. This amkes a nice base to explore Venice, I would highly recommend this property.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
