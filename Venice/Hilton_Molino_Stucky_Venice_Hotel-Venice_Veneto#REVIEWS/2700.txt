Stayed in this hotel on our honeymoon and absolutely loved it. The building is old and industrial with extremely modern decor. The views from our room were exquisite and from the rooftop pool you can see the entire city of Venice. The service was excellent throughout the entire hotel and the food was delicious. The only downside to staying here is that you are quite reliant on the hotel shuttle which is extremely infrequent and  unreliable. However there is a vaporetto stop less than five minutes from the hotel entrance.
