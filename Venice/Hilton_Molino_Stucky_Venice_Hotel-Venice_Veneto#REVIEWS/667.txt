We stayed for 3 nights in the Hilton in July and loved the hotel. It’s full of amazing history and it’s masive. We arrived by boat which was super cool - only £28 each if you book a shared option. We had a lovely large room with huge bathroom. Enjoyed the breakfast (even though it was expensive) but most of all was the location - so nice to catch the hotel boat into the main area and then to leave it behind at night. Had a lovely time sitting by the pool with incredible views. We will definitely return here and such a great place to explore from.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 18, 2018Dear Madame, It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you have enjoyed your stay in Venice.
