The property is beautiful.  The rooms are well maintained, up to date, spacious, quiet, and has a lot of character.  It is everything you want in an up to date Venetian hotel.  The executive lounge is expected.  Don’t forget to stop by the Nutella bar.  Hotel staff was super helpful and attentive.  So the downside.  It is too far from all the main tourist areas.  You take a water shuttle to go anywhere.  If you miss the shuttle you have to wait.  The upside is you get to talk to all the other people that missed the shuttle.  Would I stay there again?  Absolutely yes!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 9, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your kind and positive review on TripAdvisor. We are happy to read that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you would like to visit us again. May I take this opportunity to confirm that our shuttle boat runs every 20 to 40 minutes from 9 am in the morning to midnight with the only exception of a break at lunchtime. In addition, Alilaguna public lines stop also in front of the Hotel, with direct connections to the Airport and the Cruise Harbour. Also, the ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. The Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the crowded city centre and is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
