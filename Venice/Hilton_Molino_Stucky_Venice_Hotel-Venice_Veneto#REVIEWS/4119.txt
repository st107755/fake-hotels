First visit to Italy and Venice, and a great place to get to know Italy.  From arrival at the airport to check in, to waiting on and bar staff the service has been superb.  Staff can't do enough for you. We were extremely well looked after by Enrico in the Rialto Bar, his professionalism and attention to detail and the warm welcome he gave us every day and evening helped to make our stay a fantastic experience. Superb views from the executive bedrooms with an awesome view of cruise liners passing by your room.  Concierge very helpful. Internet and English newspaper service could be better, but all in all a top class Hilton experience, and well worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2013Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your extremely positive comments concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
