Stayed here for a night before continuing our trip to Rome. Landed at Venice airport and took the public bus which took about 90mins and dropped us off right outside! Service once we entered was excellent and guided to our room. Room was very clean and spacious. It was nice that it was a bit away from the noise of the mainland.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
