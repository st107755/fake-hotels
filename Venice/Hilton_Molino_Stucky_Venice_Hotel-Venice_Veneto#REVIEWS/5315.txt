This is a fantastic hotel. Certainly the best hotel I have stayed in while in Venice. The restaurant is fantastic and the rooftop bar and pool area is great, very relaxing. There is also a fantastic spa in the basement on the hotel. Rooms are very, very nice and well-appointed.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 14, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor and sharing your opinion on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
