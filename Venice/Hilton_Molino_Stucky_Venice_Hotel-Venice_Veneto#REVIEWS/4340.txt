We purchased this hotel through a 3rd party and stayed 3 nights. It is rated as a five star hotel and the service was always excellent. Our dinner was okay, looking out on the canal. Found the smaller restaurants in Venice more quaint and to our liking. Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
