This beautiful new facility has large rooms & bathrooms, top notch service and staff and wonderful meeting facilities.  The room top terrace bar is "must visit" with breath taking views of Venice.  The complimentary hotel water taxi that transports you to San Marco was a great service as this hotel is not on the main islands which is great thing when you want peace and queit at night in Venice!  It is a bit pricey but then again everything in Venice is!  If you are going to spend a lot on a hotel you certainly get a lot for your money at the Hitlon Stucky!Read moreDate of stay: June 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
