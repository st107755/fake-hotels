Hotel is beautiful. Nice room.   Few things to improve.  The €35 exclusive lounge ticket which includes breakfast, soft drink & snacks, happy hour drink. Overall not good value. Breakfast. You certainly can do much better. Small selection of food. Hot food only scramble egg and bacon. Then all cold. Not many options not many nice food. All ordinary food. Don’t see you put much thoughts in it. Compare to other hotel I been to they done much better.  And normal charge is €27 per person. I certainly done less than that and much better breakfast before with other hotel.  The exclusive lounge isn’t that exclusive decoder.  Snack & soft drink. Again not many option of snacks.
