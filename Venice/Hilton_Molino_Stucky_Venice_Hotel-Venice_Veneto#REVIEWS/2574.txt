After an overnight flight from USA we arrived at the hotel at 11 and were told that no room would be available until 3 p.m. However, on the morning before we checked out we got to our room and found that the cleaning staff had "checked us out", i.e. cleaned the room, took my husband's jacket away, and were indignant when the staff found us in the room (this was before 11 a.m!) The restaurant's menu was fine but absurdly overpriced. What a shock to get scrambled eggs for breakfast that were slimy and as cold as icie - yuck! Not a place I would want to re-visit when we go back to VeniceRead moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 21, 2015Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
