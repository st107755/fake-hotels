Upon the advice of our travel agent, we stayed there 1 night. The “suite” was cramped and depressing with a view of a construction site, even though our reservation had been booked for months! Our friends changed rooms 3 times and didn’t like the hotel either. The hotel was a long water taxi ride from St. Marks Square which made it difficult to go back and forth. Shame on Regent Cruise Line for recommending this to travel agents!
