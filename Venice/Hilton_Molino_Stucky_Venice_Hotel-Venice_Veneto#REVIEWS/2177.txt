Great city to visit and if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of St Marks square but be only a 20 minute boat ride away this is the place to stay.  We upgraded to a water side room on the 5th floor.  Nice view of the city, comfortable room, excellent food overall an enjoyable hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 16, 2016Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review.
