Beautiful hotel In Venice.  Rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable.  While the hotel isn't in the greatest location they do have frequent shuttle service to the nearby islands.  stayed here three years ago and enjoyed it both times.  The executive lounge is very nice with complimemtary food and drinks throughout the day. Staff is very helpful, polite, and extremely professional!
