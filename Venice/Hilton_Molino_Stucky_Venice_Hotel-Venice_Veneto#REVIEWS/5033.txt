First time in venice and my wife and I were staying on Hilton Honors points.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was so perfect since we were halfway through our 15-day European trip and had just had a pretty rough time in Rome.  The rooftop pool is worth visiting just for the views, and we enjoyed an afternoon up there relaxing after exploring the city all day.  The free water taxi is perfect for getting to and from the main attractions in Venice.  The restaurants within the hotel were superb, I think we had our best meal in Venice the first night out on the piazza in front of the water. Perfecto!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
