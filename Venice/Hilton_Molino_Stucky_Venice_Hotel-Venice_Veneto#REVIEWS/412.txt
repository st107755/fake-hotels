We are sorry that you did not enjoy the Executive Lounge located on the ground floor which offers a nice canal view and is in general one of the highlights of our hospitality and may I confirm that the selection of food and beverage is made available to guests following the international standards applied to all Hilton hotels of the Hilton group. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our guests. We are also sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city from a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical Venetian residential area. We would like to take this opportunity to inform also other travelers that the distance from the Marco Polo airport is more or less the same for all Hotels located in Venice historical centre.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
