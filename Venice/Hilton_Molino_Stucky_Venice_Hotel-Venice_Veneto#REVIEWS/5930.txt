An absolutely beautiful hotel. Got a room with views over the canal to venice. Everything in this hotel was first rate - service, cleanliness, amenities, furnishings. You can only get to/from the hotel via hotel shuttle or water taxi. The shuttle stops at two convenient locations across the canal to begin exploring Venice. Shuttle only ran every 40 mins while we were there, which was good enough for our daily excurions in/out of Venice. Hotel is quite a distance from both the train station and airport, will cost you a LOT if you want to take a water taxi. We took the water shuttle from the train station which took a while (40 mins), but got us there for a fraction of the price.Read moreDate of stay: December 20072 SavesHelpfulShare
