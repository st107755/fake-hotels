It is a wonderful hotel located on the bay across from St. Marks. You need to take a little boat each day to get to the "main" part of Venice ( it is lots of little islands)  The hotel is a proper large hotel with all the modern elements you expect from a Hilton.  Zero risk to the traveler who doesn't want a nasty italian surprise such as no water, no ac and filthy rooms.  I think this hotel is exactly the kind of hotel to stay in whilst in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 17, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
