Stayed here before a 12 night cruise from the port of Venice. Beautiful hotel on the lovely island of Giudecca only a 5 minute ferry hop ( free of charge ) over to Zatterre. Great roof top pool with fantastic views and a great bar. Some nice restaurants on Giudecca and more choice over in Zatterre.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 20, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.
