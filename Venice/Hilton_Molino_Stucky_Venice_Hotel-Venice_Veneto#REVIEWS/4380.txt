Chose this hotel having seen the entries from other Tripadvisor contributors. The Hotel is in a great location with staff who we found very accommodating. Rooms are of a high standard, well furnished and very comfortable. Breakfast is buffet style catering for a wide range of taste and with more than enough to keep you satisfied for the whole of the day.   Whilst the hotel is across a canal from the main parts of Venice, and has no access to those areas by foot, it operates a regular shuttle service from two points on the main island(s) and once you have your bearings you can easily move around.   Well worth a stay and we would use it again tomorrow.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 16, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
