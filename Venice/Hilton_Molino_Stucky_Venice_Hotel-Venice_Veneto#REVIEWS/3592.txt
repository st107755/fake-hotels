Hotel is located in Isola Giudecca just a boat ride away from busy Venice. The shuttle was very convenient to get to Venice and very punctual.  Great renovated hotel, huge property so makes it feel a bit run of the mill Hilton hotel. However, the staff is very helpful and courteous, breakfast was good, beds were big and roomy, rooms were nice and well appointed. The hotel charges for wifi but since we are Hilton Honor members we got this taken out. The hotel rooftop is great and the views are absolutely amazing. Beds were comfy with good pillow top mattresses. Would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
