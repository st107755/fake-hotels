My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights.  We found the location to be perfect.  Although the taxi over to the "mainland" takes a few minutes, it did not alter our experience at all.  We used both the hotel water shuttle, as well as the ACTV 72 hour pass (highly recommended).  I would not have expected such great service from a city with a large tourist population.  The Bacaromi restaurant was fantastic.  Guiseppe, our waiter, spent time to answer our questions about Venezian history and also gave us spot on tips for additional dining experiences.  The hotel is quite large and yet they made it feel intimate.  I cannot think of anything negative about this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
