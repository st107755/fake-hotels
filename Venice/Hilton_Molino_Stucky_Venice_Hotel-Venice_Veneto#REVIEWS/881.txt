The staff here was outstanding, every step of the way... the rooms are in need of some updating, particularly the furnishings. Our mattress was really soft, but the room was extremely quiet, so that was a balance.   The hotel food is very good, with the high hotel prices you’d expect to see.   The spa is AMAZING, and shouldn’t be missed!  Both of the services I booked were better than I receive at the most expensive salons in the states, and the benefit of the Turkish baths makes it that much better.   Make sure you organize your trip in to align with the hotel’s shuttle from Venice to Giudecca, it’s so much faster and more comfortable that the water taxis.
