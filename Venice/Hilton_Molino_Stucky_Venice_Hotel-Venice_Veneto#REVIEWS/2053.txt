The room overlooked the city and couldn't be more picturesque. The staff was attentive and overly helpfully and went above and beyond when a lost FEDEX package was miss handled.  The pool and Sky bar offer an amazing view of Venice that cannot be matched.  If you are flying into Venice I recommend the water taxi, for 130.00E, saves a lot of time dealing with the transit system and canals, only took 40min instead of 90 to 120min.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
