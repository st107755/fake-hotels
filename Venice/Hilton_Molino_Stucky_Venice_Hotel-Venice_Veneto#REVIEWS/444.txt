Cashed in Hilton points on a great off season find with Hilton Stucky! The family and I took an overnight to Venice from Rome and was delighted with this hotel. Instant upgrade to newly renovated and larger room. This property rivals Hilton Toyko Shin  with size/food selection/overall quality/staff. Great almost free water shuttle to St. Mark's square and back. Will stay again if ever in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 15, 2019Dear Sir, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor, we are really happy to read that you were delighted with your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky!
