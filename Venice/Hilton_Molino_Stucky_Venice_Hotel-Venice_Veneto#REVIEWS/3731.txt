Beautiful hotel, lovely location, well appointed room but all tarnished by the greed of the restraunt. You know that Venice is expensive to survive but charged to sit down at a table at your own hotel, really? Then 160 euros for two small salads, risottos and an average bottle of rose is OTT. Little wonder it wasn't doing much business! The roof top pool is fabulous and the executive lounge in the hotel is good for snacks.
