We stayed at the hotel as part of a trip and it did not disappoint!  The hotel is so beautiful.  The view from our window was breath taking.  The rooms are nicely appointed and clean.  Complimentary wifi is only available in the Lobby.  The food was very good as well as the servers.  The location is about a 10 minute boat ride from the main part of Venice.  The ferry runs directly from the hotel every 15-30 minutes depending on the time.  I appreciated being away from the hustle of the main city.  There are only a few restaurants within walking distance.  Some better than others so do your research and make a reservation ahead of time.  If I am ever fortunate enough to return to Venice, I will be staying at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 16, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
