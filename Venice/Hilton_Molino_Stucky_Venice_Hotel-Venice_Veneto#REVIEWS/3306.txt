Good points, impressive hotel , excellent breakfast , large well appointed room, excellent breakfast (mentioned twice deliberately) Not so good, A charge for in room wifi at these prices?. Not much in the way of alternative restaurants and bars in this island.Not the shortest transfer from the airport The breakfast was brilliant(again!), huge selection of hot/cold/gluten free/cake. Can get espresso/cappachino if requested from waiters. There was not always room on the shuttle but there are also public services available. The restaurant was good but pricey 30 eu minimum for a bottle of wine. The room was clean,spacious and well appointed, ours was not sold as having a view , but you could still see a lot of the canals and Venice main in the distance.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 3, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your positive feedback I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you enjoyed our famous Hilton breakfast.
