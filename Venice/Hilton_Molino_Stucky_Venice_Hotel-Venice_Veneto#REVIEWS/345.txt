We stayed here two nights after a cruise to Venice.  The building has character, the room was comfortable and the breakfast was tasty.  The water shuttle to San Marco Piazza was very convenient and ran often.  The location of this hotel was great because we felt like we were staying in Venice but it was quiet and away from the hordes of tourists.Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comments on this website.We are pleased that you have enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice after your cruise and that you have appreciated the quietness of the location on Giudecca.
