We stayed in the Molino Stucky for 3 nights during Easter 2009. We got a really good rate through Hilton website which included breakfast. The hotel is very modern. The room was nice and well appointed. While the located in the island of Guidecca, across from Venice, the hotel runs boats crossing to Venice every 20-30min. Boats go to 2 stops, San Marco and another stop handy for Dorsdouro area (great restaurants, Accademia museum). IAs it was Easter, the hotel was full, but there always seemed to be enough boats to take everyone across. Breakfast was great . We noticed that there seemed to be a  wait for tables if you arrived for breakfast after 10ish.  Did not eat dinner at the hotel, but did have a drink at the bar, which had great views of the city.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
