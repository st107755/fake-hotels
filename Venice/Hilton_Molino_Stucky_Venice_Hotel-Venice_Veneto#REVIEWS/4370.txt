We stayed at this hotel for 4 days during Thanksgiving holiday i.e NOV'2012. Everything literally exceeded our expectation since we walked into the hotel till we left 4 days later. Very warm welcome from courteous staff. They upgraded our room without any additional cost. Room was good size, very clean with fruit basket and a bottle of wine. Buffet breakfast had too many varieties and health club was pretty nice considering a pure tourist destination. One of the most convenient aspect about the hotel was they have their own ferry service to main Venice which made it very relaxing and flexible to move around.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 19, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
