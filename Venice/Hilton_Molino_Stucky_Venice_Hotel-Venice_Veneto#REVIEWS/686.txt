I will stay here again.   We stayed for 1 night pre-cruise and it was perfect.     Location:   On an island across from St. Mark's square, it's a 5 minute water shuttle to St Mark's square - and as awesome as that is - you can't wait to return to the island to stroll the waterfront and eat gelato in peace.    It looks like locals live there with lots of laundry drying above alleys, markets and local restaurants.  Rooms:   Very nice and quiet.   We had a room that overlooked the canal and that was special.  Amenities:    Go to the rooftop pool / bar.   It offers a postcard view of Venice and the ever entertaining grand canal.       Transportation:   Water taxi from airport, hotel has shuttle and ACTV local water shuttle only cost a couple of euros and run every 10 minutes or so. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
