We've both always wanted to go to Venice but were worried because some have described it as the Disneyland of Italy.  We are not really into super touristy spots so for us to stay at this hotel that was off the main path, was absolutely perfect.  We did not go over to the main island unless it was late night for dinner or early in the morning.  The hotel did free boat rides every 20 minutes to 2 different locations on the main island.  Staff was very friendly.  Free breakfast was very good.  Room was beautiful and luxurious.  Bed was very comfortable.  Restaurant over by boat landing (on the second level) was perfect spot to walk to.  Workout room was very nice!  We loved this!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
