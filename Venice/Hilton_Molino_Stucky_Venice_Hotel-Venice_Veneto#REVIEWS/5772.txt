Loved staying on Giudecca Island. Explore this wonderful residential island. Servce was top notch with a friendly front desk staff. Boat service was always on time and very efficient. Rooms were a little on the small side but very well equiped,clean, and comfortable. We were given a room with a beautiful view of Venice. Nice drinks and food with the excecutive lounge off the lobby. It was the perfect fit for our tired bones after a long plane trip. Never made it to the pool but it did seem to have some odd hours along with the near by roof bar. I would love to go back and stay again. Thank you Hilton for a lovely stay!Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
