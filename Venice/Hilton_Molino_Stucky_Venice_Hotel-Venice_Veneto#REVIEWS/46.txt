The hotel staff was excellent, they made us feel very comfortable and at home. Modern and spacious rooms, breakfast is recommended as it’s so worth it. The Plus is the boat service that brings you closer to San Marcos in 15 ’for free. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. And thank the warmth of the entire front desk team again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 13, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
