My wife and I stayed at this hotel arriving back yesterday. We were celebrating a double occasion of our wedding anniversary and my wife's birthday and I can only give praise to this hotel and all it's staff.  Our room was of high standard with the most spectacular view over towards Venice which is only a short trip away via the Hilton shuttle boat service. All the staff from the concierge staff, the bar staff, the staff in the spa, the room service staff and the senior staff were really helpful and hospitable.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit Venice as it is very impressive as it stands at the end of Giudecca island looking out across Venice and the views from the Skyline bar are fantastic.  We'll be back!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 31, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your kind comments on this site.
