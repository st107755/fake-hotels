We enjoyed our stay here.  The staff, especially on the front desk and at breakfast, were very friendly and helpful.  The location is good - a bit out of the way, but well connected both by the free (and punctual) hotel shuttle and also the nearby (Sacca Fisola) regular public boat.  We stayed in a king family suite (upgrading from a smaller "That's Amore" suite) which was very spacious, although not very well lit and with rather stuffy air-conditioning.  Breakfast was good and breakfast service excellent.    A few small quibbles:  we did not get turn-down service for a couple of nights in a row, and I had to call the front desk about it.  Also, I was over-charged on checking out, so just as well I checked the bill against my confirmation email.  The error was sorted out quicklyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear  Guest, Thank you for your feedback which certainly helps us to monitor and improve our services. I was pleased to read that you found the team to be  friendly and helpful and that you tested the efficiency and comfort of our complimentary shuttle service.  On the other hand I am sorry that our Executive Lounge was not up to your expectations and  I do apologize for the lack of care and attention from our housekeeping staff, I have informed our Executive Housekeeper in order to make sure such things do not occur again. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered. Guest feedback is a fundamental source to evaluate our efficiency and determine areas of improvement in service. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
