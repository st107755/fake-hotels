Hilton name stands for guaranteed quality, and Hilton venice  doesn't let you down. The service is impeccable, the rooms very comfortable and furnished with taste, the grounds are beautiful, spacey, lush and well-kept. They offer free yoga and other activities on the grounds. The breakfast is definitely something to write home about. The dinner/lunch buffet got a bit tired after a couple of days, but isn't that a problem in buffets everywhere (you get what you choose!). If you want to feel like a queen for a couple of days, this is your place.
