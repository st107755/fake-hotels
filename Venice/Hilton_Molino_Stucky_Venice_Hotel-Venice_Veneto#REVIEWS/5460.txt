I stayed with some friends at the Hilton Molino Stucky in late February, 2011.  It was impeccably clean.  The service was prompt, courteous and friendly.  It was quiet, peaceful and the finish grade was quite luxurious.  The hotel's stand alone location and water shuttle service offers the wow factor one would expect from a 5 star property in Venice.  Albeit a little off the beaten path, the complimentary shuttle between San Marco and Giudecca was very easy to use.  There are a few restaurants near the hotel if you don't want to make the trek in to town or partake in the Hilton's offerings.Read moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare
