There were so many hotels to choose from but we stayed this time in Venice with the brand that has never failed us - and it didn't this time too. We had a lovely 5 days, restful and yet never too far from the action. The 15 minute boat trip provided by Hilton across to San Marco  always seemed to offer another perspective of Venice. The hotel itself is large with interesting architecture, being an old flour mill. The ride back tot he hotels was always inviting and from the boat the view of the hotel was always pretty. The rooms are large, the view of Venice always worth a second look and the river traffic along the Grand Canal always a reminder that that's the only way to go.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2017Dear Guest, It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you enjoyed your stay in Venice.
