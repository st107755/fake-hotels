Stayed at the Hilton Molino as part odd a cruise trip with Viking Cruises.  Accommodations were first class.  They are conveniently located and have very good in-house dining options.  The bar area is beautifully done.  We were greeted with a fantastic wine/cheese/fruit platter which had been arranged by our son.  He said that the hotel staff were very good to work with.  Room was comfortable and historic.  In a cool foggy December day the hotel was so cozy!Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 16, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
