If you ever get a chance to stay at this amazing property, do it by all means!!! If you are a Hilton Honors member this is the place for you. Truffles were given to us upon arrival. When we came back from dinner, the turn down service included delicious chewy candies. The executive lounge for HH members is very nice. It is generously staffed and stocked. The views from the rooftop pool/bar are sensational. Remember that you can only reach this property by water taxi. If you need an iron ask for it in advance or when you check-in. If not, it'll take them an hour to get one.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
