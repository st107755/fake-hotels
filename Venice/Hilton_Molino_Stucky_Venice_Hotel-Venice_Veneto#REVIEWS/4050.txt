It may be a bit of a hassle to stay here due to the price and if you stay out past the last boat (a boat will take you back and forth from Venice to the hotel but stops at around 11). However, I would recommend going simply for the roof top bar, it's view and, if you are a guest, take a dip in the roof top pool. The views of Venice are unparalleled to only the bell tower in San Marco Square. But if you don't like crowds and elbows vying for a spot along the railing then the roof top bar is for you.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments.
