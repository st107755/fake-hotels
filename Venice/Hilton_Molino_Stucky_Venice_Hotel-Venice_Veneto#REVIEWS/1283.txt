Excellent hotel, and the shuttle boat to San Marco is a blessing....Makes it very easy to get back and forth. The Executive Suite and the Family Suite that we were in were both extremely spacious, and very luxuriously appointed. Great bathrooms!   The staff at this hotel were amazing...all very helpful and extremely friendly, including the housekeeping staff we encountered.  Skyline bar was great.....amazing views and very friendly wait staff!   The views are to die for from Skyline Bar! Especially when you see a cruise ship pulling out to the main lagoon...  Overall, this hotel is by far the best actual "Hilton" property that I have stayed at in all my travels! Could easily be a part of the Waldorf Astoria collection.
