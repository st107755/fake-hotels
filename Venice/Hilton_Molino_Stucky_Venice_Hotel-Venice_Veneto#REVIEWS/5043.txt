We stayed here after a 7 day Adriatic cruise.  It was the perfect hotel for us.  Close enough to the center of Venice, but not in the middle of all the summer chaos.  The convenient water shuttle was great and the breakfast that was included in our rate was delicious.  (Make sure to select a rate with the breakfast included as it is a little expensive if purchased separately).  Our room had a nice view of a side canal, and was quiet and restful.  We really enjoyed the pool for a quick dip at the end of the day.  (It was really hot and muggy when we stayed, so the pool offered a refreshing retreat from the heat).Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
