Venice is a must to visit. Molino Stucky is a must to spend a few nights. Wonderfull hotel, very well kept and very clean. Hotel people are very kind. They look like an orchestra perfectly directed and singing a very actractive song to the host, who feels to be at home and a strong desire to stay longer. A particular mention for people at front desk, at breakfast and at executive lounge. Very kind is Constance STANCANELLI, who deserves a special mention for her ability to make you feel: "I have to come back soon". We will do.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your very kind comments on this website.
