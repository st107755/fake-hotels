I simply cannot imagine a better vacation experience in Venice.  This beautiful new Hilton sits directly across the Giudecca Canal from Venice - a 5 minute free shuttle ride away.  The architecture is fascinating as the hotel has been constructed within the infrastructure of a historic flour mill.  The lobby is spacious and elegant.  The rooms and the view take your breath away.  Our corner room had seven windows in it - three overlooking the main canal and four overlooking the small canal that leads to island of Giudecca.  We definitely plan to return and would not consider staying anywhere else.  Magical.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 3, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
