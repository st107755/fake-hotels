Came here for wedding anniversary trip and loved the hotel and the city. The curtiusy boat to Venice island was excellent and the whole hotel experience superb. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting a quality hotel for their stay in the city. Transport to the hotel from the airport can also be public transport if you wish as this stops at the hotels mooring which is really convenient.
