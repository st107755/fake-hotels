Excellent hotel with superb services and staff. Great point is the swimming pool on the top of the hotel which provides excellent views over the city. It was an old factory now converted so is massive and probably the biggest hotel in Venice.  There is wide selection of food for morning breakfast which suits most people. Room was clean and best in class for in room items, my wife was over the moon with the hairdryer as it was GHD I think.  It's a bit far out from the city and main tourist destinations and is one of the last drop off points on the aquabuses from the airport, however Hilton have their own premium service and once you are in the city, the aquabuses are around every 20 minutes.  Overall it was a pleasant stay and I recommend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary and kind review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
