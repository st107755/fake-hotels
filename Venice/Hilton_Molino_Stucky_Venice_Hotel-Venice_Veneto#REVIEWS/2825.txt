My husband and I stayed here during our Italian vacation. It is a beautiful hotel in a great setting. Separated from Venice by the lagoon we were rewarded with beautiful rooftop views of the city and the ability to escape the crowds. As Hilton Honors members we were treated to full free breakfast and access to a special dining area where we could get snacks and cold drinks all day, with appetizers and drinks during happy hour for free. The room was luxurious, overlooking the lagoon, allowing us to watch the boats. The rooftop pool was an unexpected delight. Stay here if you can, especially if you are a Hilton honors member.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for your positive comment about the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
