The quality of Hilton is unquestionable. The hotel is on Guidetta island and there is shuttle boat to take you across. It is easy and fun. Our room was great, the hotel is very big it takes time to get to the room. I advice you to take time and discover the Guidetta island as well, we had a few hours to walk around and we loved it.
