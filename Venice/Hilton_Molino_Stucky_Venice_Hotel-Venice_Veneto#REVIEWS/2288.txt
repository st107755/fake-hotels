Really beautiful hotel, great food, nice Sky Lounge.   A few hiccups upon check-in but they were fixed.  The room was large with vaulted ceilings and stunning chandelier (Executive Room) but had an intense sulfur odor throughout.  Luckily the weather was nice so we opened the windows to air it out, then kept them open throughout our stay, including at night.  We were told by staff that it was due to very old pipes, that were slowly being replaced (large hotel).  Only wish it was more in the middle of things...kinda like going to Vegas & staying off the strip.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 1, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not completely live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. With regards to the smell that you experienced unfortunately being Venice in a lagoon and also due to low tide, the odors can sometime be beyond control. Your comments will be discussed at our Management Meeting although we cannot change the fact that high and low tides are part of our city. We place great value on your opinion and we look forward to welcoming you with us again. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni   General ManagerRead more
