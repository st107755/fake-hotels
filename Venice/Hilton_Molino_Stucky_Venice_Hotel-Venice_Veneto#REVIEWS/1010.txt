Stayed here for a quick little stop in Venice. This hotel is not located On the main island of Venice. Therefore you have to take a water taxi in order to get to all of the little shops and restaurants and canals. This makes it a bit of a pain as you are beholden to the water taxi schedule which sometimes only runs every half hour to an hour. Otherwise the hotel itself is nice, it offers a nice breakfast buffet, which honestly is one of the nicest breakfast buffets Iâ€™ve seen. The rooms are small but the beds are comfy and the bathrooms are sweet with a stand up shower and a separate tub. Would stay here again, but would have preferred to stay on the island.

I am pleased that you have enjoyed our breakfast offer and your accommodation while we are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations. It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy its vicinity, a great view over the city and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical residential area. Thank you for staying with us and we hope we can welcome you soon again here in Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
