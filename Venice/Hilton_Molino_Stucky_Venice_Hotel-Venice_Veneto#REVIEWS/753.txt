Hilton Molino stucky Venice hotel is the best choice!! Beautiful hotel, amazing service, friendly and professional staff. We stayed 3 days we loved it. The hotel offers transportation to the center of Venice every 20 minutes and they charge a symbolic amount at the end of the stay. We had a very nice room with beautiful view. We spend our first night having dinner at Bacaromi restaurant. It is the best restaurant!! I totally recommend this hotel!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Staff.
