The Hilton Molino Stucky in Giudecca is an impressive old factory turned into a luxury hotel. Th interior is very Hilton like - lots of wallpaper, carpet and wood. But it fits the environment and is nicely done. The hotel is huge. The rooftop and pool is super nice but only open unteil end of September. After that there is still a sky bar. Unfortunatly this only opens in the evening, so that you can not really appreciate the great view during daylight. There is a big breakfast room or - in case you booked that category - smaller and less crowded executive area. The rooms are OK. Not a lot of space for your clothes though and then there are big bedside tables with limited space, too. Very strange design... Not all rooms come with canal view, so you have to specifically book one.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 17, 2017Dear Sir, thank you for leaving your review on TripAdvisor.
