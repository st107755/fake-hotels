Hilton is not always the same standard. This hotel is just great. I stayed in a regular room on the 2nd floor, plenty of space and good amenities. Good bedding, pillows.  The building is just amazing, with a great rooftop pool with breath-taking view. Personnel is nice, there is good choice of restaurants (an Italian-mediterranean and an Italian-Venetian). The complimentary taxi boat is very useful. There is a lot of tourists, which might be a bit noisy and definitely not in line with a business hotel. But overall this doesn't bother.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
