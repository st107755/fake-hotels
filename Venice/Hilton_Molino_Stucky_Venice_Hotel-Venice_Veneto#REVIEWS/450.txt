This is a huge 400 room  hotel right on the Grand Canal , about a 20 min  water taxi boat ride to St Mark's area. Beautiful ambiance , furniture, paintings , decor. Gorgeous public areas . Wonderful attentive staff in all areas . The room was spacious and gorgeous . The bed was heavenly . The canal view was perfect. Water taxi right at the front door ...runs every 30 min to the main square . Bar upstairs on the roof and downstairs too . Restaurants and large and handle travelers well .
