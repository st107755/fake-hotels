I absolutely adore this hotel. The room was wonderful, the view was amazing and the service was impeccable. The bartender was fantastic (I feel so bad I forgot her name, it might have been Lorena, she was a woman with brown hair who had a Russian language teacher). She recommended a great wine for my husband and I and she was just such a nice person! We talked with her about wine a little bit and we could tell she really knew her stuff. The only downside to the hotel is that constantly taking the water taxi could get annoying if you are staying in Venice for a long time. But my husband and I only stayed for two nights so the water taxi wasn't annoying at all.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 18, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
