This is a large hotel, pretty inside. Overall it seems understaffed. In the restaurants the staff is friendly but running a high speed chase to keep up with the demands of the restaurant.  There is no turn down service (at least not for our 3 rooms for 3 nights). Some of our rooms would not get a full set of towels (no bathmat one day, no wash towel another). Other than that the hotel is clean and the breakfast buffet was the closest to American that we experienced. The shuttle service to the main parts of Venice was used quite a bit by our group - for dining and site seeing, overall okay experience.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 11, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
