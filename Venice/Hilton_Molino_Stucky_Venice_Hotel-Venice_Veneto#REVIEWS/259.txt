The hotel is actually over 100 years old (although that is "yesterday" in Italian history terms).  It was easy to get lost in it with all the turns, ups & downs - quite a fun adventure in itself.  Very nice rooms with great breakfast selections & table coffee service.  The biggest knock is the location.  130 Euros 1-way water taxi from the airport or else twice as long on the public boats.  Then, the hotel is across from the main part of Venice requiring boat shuttle to get to San Marco Square. Finding the shuttle was easy and it's a one-time charge no matter the number of shuttle rides which occur every 20 min.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for you kind review on TripAdvsior. We are happy to read that you have enjoyed our hospitality and that you had a pleasant stay with us. Before the Hilton Molino Stucky became a hotel, it was once one of Europe's largest mills, built between 1884 and 1895. It was only later that it was restored converting the original structure into a hotel which opened in 2007. It is considered one of the greatest examples of the industrial architecture in Europe and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage took care of the reconversion making sure to preserve the majority of the original elements of the ancient mill. Thank you for staying with us and we all look forward to welcoming you with us again soon. Kind regards  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
