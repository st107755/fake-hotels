This hotel is extremely nice. It’s in a great quiet location with easy access to Venice. Stayed in Fantastic suite the last two times in Venice, the views are magnificent. The only problem is receiving my Hilton points. You would expect being a Diamond member that it would not be a problem but it seems that this Hilton Can’t get it right. I even mentioned something about having a problem last year and was assured it would not happen again. Will now have too start the process of getting my points, unfortunately it’s a pain.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful vote1 RepostHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for leaving your review on TripAdvisor and for choosing Hilton Molino Stucky again for your last visit in Venice.We are glad to reed that your experience was positive also this time but are disappointed to read that you are having issues with regards to your Hilton Honors points accrual.
