Lovely 5 star just a hop skip and a jump away from the main square.(Only a few minutes on the complimentary shuttle)  Rooms were lovely and the service was what to be expected. Make sure you book te breakfast it's worth it.   Make sure you book in here during the Carnival. The prices are still very reasonable.
