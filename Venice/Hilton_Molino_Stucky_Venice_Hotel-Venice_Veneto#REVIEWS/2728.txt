Been here over the years   Unusual structure  An old mill  Rooms are nice enough but the lounge is not private but in the main lobby. Unusual   Limited menu and only drinks at certain hours  very limited.  Buffet food is good  Drinks are very expensive  $ 18 for a gin & Tonic at the bar in the lobby.   General staff is fine but the check in staff need a course in patience and understanding.  Can be rude and not helpful.  This has been the case on several visits.  Have used them for groups  perhaps for the last time now!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and for your loyalty to Hilton Molino Stucky.
