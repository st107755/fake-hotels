This hotel is absolutely huge and, each time we have been here, there has been a conference going on so it's exceptionally busy. But amazingly the staff still make it seem effortless and calm! Take time to wander through Guidecca island if you can. It's tempting to just go straight across to San Marco but you'll be missing some treats. Trattoria Altanella (along a little alley just before the Iron Bridge) served meals to Earnest Hemingway! It's been run by the same family for 100 years. Try it for lunch, you won't regret it!Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
