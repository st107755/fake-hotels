No complaints about the staff or anything, but if you're planning on sleeping during your stay, just don't come here.  Stayed 3 nights on the 3rd floor, could hear anything the 2 neighbouring rooms were throwing at me, even when they were speaking quietly.  And if you're thinking of taking a nap during the day, forget it, you get the nice monotonous sound of all the boats going up the lagune.  Too bad, really, because the rest is quite nice. But if a hotel does not perform its primary function which is letting you sleep, you have to rate it accordingly.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 10, 2019Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
