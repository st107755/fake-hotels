Excellent hotel, clean, people so friendly, but it is need a boat to go to city center although the the shuttle boat working very good. The other thing dose not has much restaurant only one and the other is a lobby cafe. Basically no night life in hotel. It is good for honey moon. The city is dreaming but no more than 3 day stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on Trip Advisor.  I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you mentioned a positive experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. I was also delighted to read that you found all our Team Members to be very friendly and helpful. As regards our F&B offer, I confirm that our famous Bacaromi as well as our Rialto restaurants are open all year round while the Aromi, with its meditteranean dishes, is open usually from Easter to end of October. During Summer season, our guests can as well enjoy a romantic dinner under the stars on our world known rooftop pool terrace. The hotel is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the city centre and it is especially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good and excellent restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
