Not the first stay at this hotel. Over the years I have developed a taste for La Giudecca, an area away from the mad crowd. Many foreigners have bought real estate in La Giudecca, a quiet area where many restaurants have blossomed. The hotel has everything one may need (spa, pool, a bar with one of the most beautiful views over the city). And, last but not least, motor boat links to San Marco and Zattere. Very efficient, courteous personnel.

The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you appreciate this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for staying with us also this time and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
