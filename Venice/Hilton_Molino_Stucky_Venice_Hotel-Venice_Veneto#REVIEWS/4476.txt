This hotel has been beautifully converted from an old flour mill and has lots of different corridors and nooks and crannies.  Lovely large room with nice bathroom.  Nice and quiet location.  The hotel runs complimentary transport but it is not too far from a vaporetto station either.  Nice rooftop swimming pool but nowhere to change, although lockers were provided.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory and we appreciate being advised of any breach in the usual service for which our hotel is noted.
