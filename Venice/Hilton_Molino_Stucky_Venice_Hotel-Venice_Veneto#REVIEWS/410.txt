The hotel itself, staff and breakfast are excellent but sadly having stayed at many Hilton Hotels all over the world the executive lounge was very poor. The only alcoholic drinks available were Aperol and Campari, the likes of Rum, Whisky and Gin for examples were not available as have been in all other executive loungers we have stayed in. I would stay at this hotel again but I wouldn't book to use the executive lounge. To conclude this point the snacks provided in the evening were repetitive and very basic (variations of cooked cheese snacks). Not the standard I would expect from the Hilton group. This was disappointing hence my 3 startsRead moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 15, 2019Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay on TripAdvisor.
