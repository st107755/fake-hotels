We've really enjoyed Venice and on the whole the hotel as been as expected in most parts; breakfast, quality of room furnishings, staff, etc. But the thing that has been most disappointing is the interconnecting door to our king executive suite. Sadly not fit for a king unless he welcomes the endless playing of Witney Houston and the sound of his neighbours having sex between 1-2am in the morning. I think the basic thing any hotel should get right is providing rooms that guarantee a good night sleep (as does every premier inn in the UK). The Hilton Molino Stucky has failed to achieve that on our last night of four. Shame - and this has been the main motivation for writing this review.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
