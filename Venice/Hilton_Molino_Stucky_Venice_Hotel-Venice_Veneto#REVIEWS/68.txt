Upgraded to an executive room with lounge access.  The upgraded room had major hygiene issues which were immediately rectified by change of room. The executive lounge throughout our four day stay had limited and poor-quality snacks. Room service that was provided was well below any acceptable standards and was declined.  Resulting in us living the hotel and dining out.  Hot Breakfast on our last day was limited and explanation given to us was that they had no kitchen stuff available.  Went to the executive lounge which was closed as according to the hotel staff it was a low season.   Bacaromi restaurant provide excellent service and food.
