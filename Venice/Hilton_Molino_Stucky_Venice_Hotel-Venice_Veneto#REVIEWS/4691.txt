We stayed at the Molino Stucky Hilton in October and it was excellent!  We had a canal view room with probably the best view of Venice.  The service was wonderful from checkin to checkout.  Watching the cruise ships pass our window was an experience I will never forget.  Although you need to take the shuttle (or a water taxi) to cross the canal, we didn't mind the slight inconvenience.  The hotel used to be a grain warehouse and the interior has largely been maintained, giving it a unique historical significance.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and thanks for taking the time to leave your review.
