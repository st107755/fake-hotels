We went to Venice for the first time over New Years a few weeks ago and were extremely impressed with the Hilton. The location was perfect, just off the main island so you had some exclusivity but only a 5 minute free water shuttle ride away from the action in San Marcos. We were a little disapointed that their roof top bar was being renovated but you can't have everything. Only other issue was food and drink prices were a little crazy high but again go over to San Marcos and dine and drink to your hearts content. Overall great place to stay for a Venice visit.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
