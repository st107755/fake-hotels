The Hilton Molino combines two rare ingredients for a stay in Venice: New and high class and still a lot of Venetian individuality. Its built into a former factory, which creates a specific atmosphere. Located in Guidecca, you are slightly seperated from the masses of tourists, but can join them quickly when taking a boat. The view from the terrace is beautiful, the service as expected in a Hilton. All rooms seem to be great (I've been there with a big group and nobody complained), but some are rather difficult to reach as the buildings sometimes serve as a maze. But isn't this Venice at its best?Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments and feed-back on Tripadvisor.
