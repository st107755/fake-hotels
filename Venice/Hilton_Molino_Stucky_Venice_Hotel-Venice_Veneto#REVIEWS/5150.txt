We just returned from our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, and we LOVED it.  The open beams in the rooms were beautiful.  The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and very clean.  This is one of the nicer hotels I have ever been in, and we were very pleased with our stay.  We slept very well--despite the 6.0 earthquake!  I definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
