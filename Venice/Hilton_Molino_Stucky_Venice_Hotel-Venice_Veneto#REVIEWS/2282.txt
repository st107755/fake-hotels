The hotel is a bit far from the rest of venice, and when taking the water bus from the train station you do have a bit of walk (10 minutes) to get to the hotel.  If you have a lot of luggage a water taxi might be a good option.  The lounge was average, and the executive lounge for Diamond members was adjacent to it.  The restaurants were excellent.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
