Before and after our cruise out of Venice we stayed at the Molina Stucky! Definitely one of the coolest hotels and nicer hotels that we saw in the area. The service is outstanding and above and beyond. The rooms were very elegant and well maintained. The breakfast buffet every morning was a favorite! They also have a couple of different restaurants on site to choose from. Itâ€™s very nice that they offer a free shuttle all day long only for he Hilton hotel over to the main island. We were greeted with Bellinis and chocolates as a gift for our Wedding Anniversary!  If I were to come back to Italy I would make sure to stay here again without hesitation.
