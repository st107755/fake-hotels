Just back from 5 nights at this property. I am a Hilton Diamond member  and were staying on points. We were upgraded to a very nice room that included a separate sitting area. We had great cross ventilation breezes when opening the windows. The room was perfect. The executive lounge was however nothing to write home about. The am eggs were really gross.  And the offerings seemed not as good as the other lounges I gave visited. Evening snacks were also not great. I did like however being able to stop in anytime fir a glass of water or juice or a cup of tea/coffee.   The shuttle between the hotel and the main island worked just fine. The restaurant recommendations we were given by the concierge were spot on.  We had a lovely 5 nights. Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
