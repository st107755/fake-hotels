Our stay here was relaxing after an Adriatic cruise. A full breakfast was included as well as the convenient water taxi to Venice Island at frequent intervals. We were here here for 3 days. The staff and facilities were great. This has been a hotel for 10 years, previously an important flour mill, for making pasta. Being on Guidecca Island was probably quitier than being on Venice Island. This island also had some good places to eat, etc If you have to get to the airport, be sure to tell the front desk the night before.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 24, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
