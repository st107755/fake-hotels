Really nice Hotel. Very friendly stuff. I did take an upgrade to the room for 30€ per night and we got a lovely executive room on the 6th floor with a beautiful view. The Spa is really nice. The rooms are clean and lovely. Their is a boat infront of the Hotel who brings you to Zattere an Piazza San Marco and the times are really good. Wifi is free in the whole lobby but in the room you have tp purchase it 3€ for 3 hours. Breakfast is reaaly good with a big choice of food.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
