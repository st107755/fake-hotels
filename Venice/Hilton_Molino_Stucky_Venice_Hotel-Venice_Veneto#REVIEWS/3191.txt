Beautiful hotel, however I would not rate it as a 5* staff on reception unhelpful and rude!! For example i asked if I could have my luggage from behind the counter and staff did not get it for me, i explained I was about to miss my water taxi to airport but this made no difference!!! I then asked again and staff member was rude and snatched ticket from my hand!! When I asked for guidance about Venice staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful!!! Room was nice however quite basic for a 5*!!! Shower was poor!! No mirror in bedroom!!! Rooms were very clean though. Skyline bar has potential, however very quiet no atmosphere and drinks very overpriced!!! Cleaners walked in room without knocking every day. No free wifi ridiculous charge daily however there is free computer use in lobby.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2015Dear Sir/Madame,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
