We stayed here during Bank holiday August. It was truly a lovely mini break. the room we had was amazing and had amazing views of Venice. The service by staff was second to none. Food at the restaurant was lovely and one of the best meals we actually had in Venice. The spa was okay, both me and my husband had facials and they were not the best, again same with pedicure and massages they were very mediocre and overpriced. the Spa itself looks average too, it could do with a make over. but everything else at Hilton was amazing and we would definitively stay again. we also enjoyed the shuttle service Hilton provided as it saved us a lot of money :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
