We stayed 4 days in this hotel with about 300 people. The facilities are very diverse with many meeting rooms in different sizes, comfortable rooms, good food and especially a very friendly and service-oriented staff. A special boot service takes you into the City at regular times while the distance from the city allows you to keep your audience focussed. The only point of attention is the unstability of the internet connections which makes your smartphone run out of battery constantly. Definitely a place to go back to for business purposes.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 26, 2017Dear Madame, thank you  for your positive comments.
