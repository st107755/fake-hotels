Beautiful hotel but the Airconditioning was not working in the room even with individual controls for the termostat! Unheard off and whwn I complained they said that the Heat was on and If I was Hot in the room I  should open the windows--- But be careful of the Mosquitoes and other insects that may come inside at night!!! I think Paris Hilton should experience this!!! She will fire all the Staff!!! The good thing was they give you 2 bottles of water!Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 22, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor.
