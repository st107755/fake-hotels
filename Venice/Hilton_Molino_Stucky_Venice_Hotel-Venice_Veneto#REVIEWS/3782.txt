Shhh...don't tell anyone...this is a great 5 star hotel in Venice Italy...and if you watch hotwire.com you might be able to snatch it up at a 4 star price.  My wife and I recently did just that.  What a wonderful stay we had in this beautifully restored factory turned into the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel.  The rooms were large and the bed comfortable...while I personally would have preferred a softer pillow...the corner room with our amazing view more than made up for that.  If you do choose to stay here...do not forget to go to the 7th floor for the view and the sky bar...there is not a more amazing view of VeniceRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
