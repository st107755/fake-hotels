One of the nicest Hilton's we have stayed in. Breakfast, toiletries etc are standard Hilton format but where this hotel excels is the beautiful Molino Stucky (originally a mill) which has been sensitively renovated preserving some lovely old features from brick walls to wood beam ceilings.  Add the fantastic views across to the main island (from your room if you are lucky or else from the rooftop bar) and you can't ask for much more.    Regular complimentary water taxi service to Zattero and San Marco is supplemented by nearby vaporetto stops making everthing very accessible. On Giudecca, don't miss the Casa dei re Oci, a lovely old Venetian house displaying contemporary Italian and Venetian photos.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
