Even though it was August it was NOT stinking !! The temperature was warm but not hot. We stayed there (in that old mill) 4 nights and it was fantastic Good rooms & food, nice bar/bistro and with the time you feel home in Venice! We hopped on the shuttle a few times per day and discovered Venice by foot or took another vaporetto to farer destinations (Murano). The Hotel is not on the main Isle, but just opposite, so that the shuttle needs only 5 min (Oppenheimer Museum) or 10 min to the Bridge of sighs (Doge`s Palace). It is a wonderful adventure, especially with children... The hotel has a lot of facilities for children.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay of last summer at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
