I'll say this: this is not a typical tourist hotel.  For one thing, the facility itself is a re-purposed grain mill.  I did love that aspect of it.  It is about a 15 minute shuttle ride across the canal from the activity of Venice.  The Hilton "Honors" area has been squeezed into a narrow section of a dining room; I found it lacking in services.  The front desk and the bell desk were both quite accommodating.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to write a response after your recent visit at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. It was nice to read that you appreciated the architecture and the restoration of this impressive old building and that you found the Front and Bell Desk Team Members to be helpful. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guest can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. We regret also that our Executive Lounge was not up to your expectations and that you have experienced a lack of service from the Staff. Please be reassured that I have pointed out the issue to the Department Head in charge for action and review. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
