We stayed in Hilton for 5 days. It was amazing. The hotel itself looked stunning and cleaned. Our room was nice and quite spacious. The breakfast was fantastic. The only that I was disappointed was they run out of blue cheese everyday. When I asked the waitress to get more she said it was all finished. The bar area was cool and relaxing, however it was pricey. If we have to go back to Venice we will definitely book Hilton again. We stayed in August.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
