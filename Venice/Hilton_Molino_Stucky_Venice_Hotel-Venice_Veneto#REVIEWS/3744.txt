Currently staying in the hotel and their advertised shuttle service is not reliable. Around 40 people waited almost 2 hours in the rain whilst stuck on the other side of the canal. At 11pm at night we were all concerned if we were going to get back to the hotel or not. This hotel is only worth staying at if the shuttle service is available, or you can't get in to venice. Don't trust it.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  I do regret that you did not find our shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs; however we can offer a guaranteed maximum number of seats and we are sorry that during your stay you were experiencing some difficulties in finding available space.  May I take this opportunity to confirm that our complimentary shuttle boat runs every 20 to 40 minutes from 8 am in the morning to 1 am at night with the only exception of 1 hour break in the afternoon. Also, the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away from us and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.  Best regards  Antonio Ruano Director of OperationsRead more
