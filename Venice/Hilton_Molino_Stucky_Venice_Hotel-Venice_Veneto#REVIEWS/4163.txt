All good here, clean, comfortable, personable, with an unreal building that was once a Mill and is now a perfect landing and taking off spot for Venice site-seeing. Make sure you get lost in the building. It is incredible what architecture you will uncover by exploring.  Staff was well trained and helpful. The Spa has great potential, but is sort of cut up.   If you get a chance take a morning walk down the shoreline. Neighborhood shops and locals hanging out in this area.  Attempt to stay at this jewel of a hotel.
