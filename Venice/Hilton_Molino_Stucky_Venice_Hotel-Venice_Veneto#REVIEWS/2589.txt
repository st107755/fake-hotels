The adaptability of this structure is perfect for Venice, Italy. Its a beautifully renovated factory. Good, reliable transportation to the main island. Good facilities on site. Great lobby. Breakfast buffet is very good. The rooms are plush for Italy - the nicest we stayed at on this trip, which involved many hotels. Wonderful view of the grand canal.  But Gee whiz - at these prices, couldn't you spring for some free internet. The only hotel we stayed at that required a daily fee. for service.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us.
