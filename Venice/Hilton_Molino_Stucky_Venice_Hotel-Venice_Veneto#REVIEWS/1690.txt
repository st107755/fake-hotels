We arrived at the Hotel to a very warm welcome and a surprise upgrade to a fabulous suite ! We were also given complimentary access to the hotel executive lounge which was absolutely fantastic !! We cannot compliment this hotel enough . Our stay was second to none and exceeded all of our expectations . Superb breakfast , easy access to San Marco and Venice centre yet a relaxing tranquil return each evening away from the crowded tourist areas . If you are unsure where to stay in Venice then this hotel comes highly recommended . Spotlessly clean , modern , fantastic service and surroundings . We will certainly be returning .Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
