Helpful and mostly nice staff. Very nice and spacy rooms and a really great rooftop pool and bar. A good shuttle to Zattere and Marcus Place. There is one big negative point, their so called gourmet restaurant is not worth a dime. Save your money and go somewhere else. The food is below average, the menu is small - no daily specials and the cook is not very inventive. The quality of food was just miserableRead moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
