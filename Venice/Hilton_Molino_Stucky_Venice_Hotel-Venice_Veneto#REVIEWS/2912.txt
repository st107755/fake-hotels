Arrived early so they showed us into the executive lounge until our suite was ready. Lovely room overlooking the lagoon great for watching the cruise lines come and go. Roof top pool a little small for the size of the hotel and the roof top bar was a smoking bar which put us off a bit. The two ground floor lagoon side restaurants were excellent, I've never seen such a large and well organised breakfast room(S)! The free water bus was well used but a bit hectic at times.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
