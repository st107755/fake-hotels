Awesome hotel with great friendly staff. It was a special occasion for us the staff welcome us with a smile were very helpful and gave us a awesome upgrade.  The complimentary shuttle boat that goes from The hotel to to the square is very good and runs every 30 mins which is very continent.  I'm looking forward to going back there soon.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
