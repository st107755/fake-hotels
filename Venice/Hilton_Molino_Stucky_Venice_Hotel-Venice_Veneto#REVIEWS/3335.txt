The location of the Molino Stucky makes it the best sited hotel in Vinice. The property located on the Grand Canal is spectacular as you have a tremendous view of all the activity in the Canal.  Don't be surprised as you open the drapes if you are basically on top of a sizable cruise ship. Don't forget all supplies basically have to arrive by water. It is a busy stretch of water with the best views of Venice. The Skyline Rooftop bar is a must. Great service through out the building.  You may want to not use the hotel restaurants, as there are some fantastic restaurants within a easy walk. Try them !!!!!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 14, 2014Dear Guest,  thank you very much for posting your extremely nice review on TripAdvisor, it i s pleasure to receive such positive feedback!
