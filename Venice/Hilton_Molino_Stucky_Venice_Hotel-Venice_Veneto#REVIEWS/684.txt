Of all the hotels we stayed at while in Italy, this was the best. You might need GPS to get to your room, but the room was fabulous. This hotel offered the most comfortable beds we slept in while in Italy. It was the only hotel we stayed at that had an ice machine in the hall. It had a large bathroom with a shower that had an actual door on it instead of just a water guard. It was also the only hotel that offered...wait for it...washcloths. It was in a great location and offered free boat hops to the other side of the canal dropping you off near St Mark's. The breakfast was fabulous and the fruit served was so flavorful and fresh, it was great! I loved Venice and I'd definitely stay at this place again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2018Dear Madame, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
