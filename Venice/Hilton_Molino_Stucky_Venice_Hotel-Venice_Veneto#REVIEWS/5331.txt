I stayed with friends at the Hilton Molino Stucky while touring Venice for the first time. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, I regularly stay in Hilton hotels. While the hotel is clean and the quality is fine, it is not up to par with similarly priced Hilton hotels. I do not think it is worth the premium price you pay and I would definitely not consider it a luxury hotel. It's a three-star hotel at best.   It is a bit remote and is on an island almost across from the cruise ship terminal. Though you do feel isolated, it is only a short boat ride away to all the major sites of Venice. (The best part is the boat shuttle is free!) A big drawback is if you wait to get something to eat past 8 p.m., you're pretty much stuck eating at the hotel restaurant.

We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. In regard to Internet connection, I am pleased to confirm that we are making progress in improving the service for our guests. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely, Mario Ferraro General ManagerRead more
