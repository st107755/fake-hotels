My boyfriend & I stayed here  from Feb 2 to Feb 4 2012. We first booked it & only then we read all the reviews. We were very indisposed but it turned out to a very nice hotel. The staff was pleasant, rooms clean, huge bathroom, nourishing breakfast. The only shortcomings were: 1. poor spa, 2. dark room, 3. bad weather :) & 4. due to bad weather - the location (we had to travel on a boat for about 10 min). All in all we enjoyed Venice & from now on we don't really trust some reviews ) Good luck!Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
