We did not stay in the hotel but bought a spa pass and had a massage. The spa is lovely with a steam room, sauna, relaxation room, gym and jacuzzi. The spa staff were lovely and I particularly want to thank Ella the spa manager for going out of her way to help us in every way! From helping with storing out bags to replying to out emails late at night (when I wanted to book last minute) to walking us to the waterbus stop so we wouldn't get lost. It definitey made us want to come to the Hilton Stucky next time we are in Venice and was definitely a 5 star service!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your nice comments on our Eforea SPA, where we are pleased to welcome also outside Guests.
