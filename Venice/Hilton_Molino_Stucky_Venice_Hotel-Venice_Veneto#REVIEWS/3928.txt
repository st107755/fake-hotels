Easiest way from Airport, though a little longer, about 1.5 hrs yet a great value for money. Walk out of airport and take a left about 8 minute walk to the jetty. Buy a ticket for the Alilaguna boat which takes you via a few stops to the HILTON MOLINO STUCKY, And stops right outside the hotel. COST IS EURO 15 PER PERSON PER TICKET. We though we would probably take a private taxi as the Hilton taxi was about 180 euros. But all private water taxis are 110 EURO ONE WAY. If you can get 4 people together then the private taxi, which does not need to be prebooked is worth it and just 20 minutes  away.  With the trip on Alilaguna, to the outside of the hotel, you can see the varoius islands as well enroute.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website.  For the benefit of other Tripadvisor’s users, we would like only to clarify that the official rate in Venice for a watertaxi from the airport is € 110,00/120,00 up to 4 people. There are also transfers which are more expensive in case the guests requests a luggage porter and a hostess on board until the destination.
