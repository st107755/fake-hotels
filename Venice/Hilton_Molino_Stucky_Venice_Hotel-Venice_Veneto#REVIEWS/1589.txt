I can highly recommend this hotel due to its location and easy and quick access to Venice main island. Travel books really dont say much about this location but I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. The hotel keeps with the quality of Hilton name and I would stay again when I return. The island also had some of the best restaurants and we chose to eat on island as much as we could as the food was exceptionally good and priced right.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 11, 2017Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
