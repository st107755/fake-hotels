This hotel is just amazing, starting from the lovely lovely romantic rooms over looking the canal where all the cruise liners come in, to it's excellent location just across the main hub, to its shuttle boat service, to the food, to the excellent friendly staff... I can just go on. I think it's a must for anyone going to Venice. It's just a romantic hotel that will make it worth all the money!  n case you're visiting during the summer, the pool area is a little small, with the pool being particularly small, but everything else is a dream!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. It was nice to hear that you found our Team Members so friendly and I am happy that you appreciated our food and the atmosphere of the hotel I would like to take this opportunity to inform also other travellers that the restoration project of the Molino Stucky was designed and approved following strict rules and regulations in compliance with the environmental and artistic restrictions applied to an ancient and monumental complex protected by local authorities. The structure still has the typical features of the old industrial architecture, which has certainly affected the project with some restraints when developing the leisure proposal, including our rooftop pool area. Thank you again for your lovely review and we hope to welcome you soon again in our romantic Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
