The Hilton Molina Stucky Hotel excelled in all categories; service, location, cleanliness, value, etc were all great.  There is a shuttle boat that circuits to and from the main square frequently.  The rooms are clean and well kept and the hotel is very well maintained.  When I visited the wifi is only free in the lobby, but the lobby is spacious with plenty of seating so this was definitely manageable.  There is a Nutella courtyard... hello!... this alone won me over.  The is also a rooftop pool/lounge where you have a view of Venice, beautiful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 7, 2015Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory and that you enjoyed our famous Piazzetta Nutella.
