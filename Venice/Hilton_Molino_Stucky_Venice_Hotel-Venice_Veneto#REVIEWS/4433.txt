i write this review as a man who could not ever afford this hotel but i would save to go there again was here for 2 days for a works thing  and it was shockingly good  well worth the money if you can manage it  food rooms all spot on away from the hussly of main Venice but just a free boat ride away  . its worth staying there just for the pool i have swam while looking over the roof tops of venice that memory is going with me too the grave . tho if you dont have long in Vence dont stay cos because you cant pop out your door and be in the center you have to travel but a week this is the PlaceRead moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
