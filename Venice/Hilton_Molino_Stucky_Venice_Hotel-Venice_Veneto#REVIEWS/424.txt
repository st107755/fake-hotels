The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice is a simply stunning hotel located a short water shuttle bus (shuttle bus provided by the Hotel at a very reasonable price and runs punctual) ride away from all the glorious sights of Venice. The hotel is very well presented and the customer service from the staff is nothing short of exceptional with special mention to Constance who made sure that our family trip was one which we will always fondly remember. A room with a view of the canal is highly recommended. This was our first trip to Venice but it certainly won't be the last and we will have no hesitation rebooking at the wonderful, Stucky Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 25, 2019Dear Sir, dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
