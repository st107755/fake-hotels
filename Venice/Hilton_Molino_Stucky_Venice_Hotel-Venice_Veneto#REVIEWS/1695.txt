The room stunk so bad that u could not stay in it without window wide open. No hot water til morning of departure. No view other than suite two feet across from our window with a continuos exhibition of nudity in window. Wood have closed curtain but we need it open for the fresh air. Breakfast horrid, powdered eggs and bacon baked in one pound clumps. This has left us with a horrid memory of our experience.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 11, 2016Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
