lovely big hotel. its a really nice setting to be away from the centre of venice.  it can be a bit annoying to wait for the water taxis and they do get quite busy, especially the ones late at night. the sky bar (on the top floor) has the most amazing views. really would recommend a drink up there.  We went in august and it was  busy as you would expect. The pool in the afternoon was soo rammed. You couldnt get anywhere near it really. I would avoid if you had a young family as it would be bit stressful with the boat crossings and baby buggies etc.  We had a nice big room, (no view though). we really enjoyed getting the water taxi across each day as it was good fun.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
