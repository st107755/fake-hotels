The hotel was lovely although there were a cobwebs in our room.   We utilised the rooftop bar for cocktails and the staff were excellent.   We asked concierge for food at 1045 and a stern woman who resembled Joan ferguson off prison cell block H told us that we couldn't get food so late. We returned to the rooftop bar and Enrico and Enrico were keen to assist us in our quest for food and supplied an excellent array of antipasti.
