We told the check-in clerk that we wanted to make a reservation to use the pool (reservations are recommended). She said the pool is closed for the season. Now, here on Tripadvisor, I see that other guests who also stayed during the first week of October used the beautiful pool - they posted photos! I'm a Hilton Diamond member who paid more than $300 for a room. We chose this hotel because of photographs of the pool.Read moreDate of stay: October 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 22, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor. We would like to take this opportunity to confirm that information on the seasonal opening of our pool is available in our website, where it is specified that opening is seasonal, usually from mid May to mid/end September. I feel sorry that you were disappointed but I can assure you that even this year we closed it on September 30. We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our Guests. Although you express some disappointment, we do hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you again to regain your confidence in our brand here in Venice by demonstrating the high level of service we are renowned for.
