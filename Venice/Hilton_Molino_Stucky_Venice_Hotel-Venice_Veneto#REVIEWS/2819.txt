An amazing and unique hotel. Service was great and the rooms were beautiful. Breakfast was good but rather than pay a surcharge to have it as room service like in other hotels, we were surprised to find we had to pay for a full breakfast when ordered to our room. The executive lounge was quiet and well-stocked with food and drink. One thing that we thought would improve the hotel would be to offer free WiFi throughout the hotel rather than just in the executive lounge. Really enjoyed taking the boat from the hotel's island to the main part of Venice each day. Have booked a return trip for next year!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear Guest, I do appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
