We loved almost everything about this hotel :-) We stayed one night to spoil ourselves on the end of our Venice / Florence holiday. The rooftop pool was amazing!! along with the view! And just what we needed to chill out on our last night. Rooms are fab. Reception staff were fab and very helpful - breakfast staff in the exec lounge not so great... but hey we can't have it all lol   Food and drink VERY expensive  - â‚¬35 for two cocktails....  but we ate out across the water in one of the many restaurants so you're not tied to the hotel.   Would love to stay again - I've bought a lottery ticket ready....
