Stayed at the Molino Stucky for two nights. The room was pretty, large, and quite, with the beds being remarkably comfortable. The view from the room on the Canale della Giudecca, together with the one from the rooftop lunge, was worth the price alone.  Location-wise, the hotel is located on the beautiful, mostly residential island of Giudecca, devoid of tourists for the most part and very interesting. Very recommended indeed.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
