Seriously impressed with the hotel.  The hotel offers a shuttle boat with plenty of options for time to reach the centre of Venice, which drops you just outside St Marks Square. The shuttles run from early morning (8ish) to late evening (11ish), with at least 2 boats within each hour.  You do not have to pay for the shuttle from the hotel or going back to it, and it is a great start to the day.  The room was perfect and cosy. Spacious bathroom with excellent lighting to do make up, loved the touch of the pull out enlarged mirror for close ups coming off the wall.

I am pleased that you found the service great all over the hotel, in particular the Breakfast Team, and I am so pleased that you would highly recommend us to all. We are sorry that you were expecting the terrace pool to be open. However winters are rather cold in Venice with freezing temperatures and for this reason, while our Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day throughout the year, the pool area opens in the later Spring. The pool entrance door is closed during winter for safety reasons but the views over Venice from the bar terraces are also breathtaking and unique. I hope to welcome you back to the Hilton Molino Stucky in the not too distant future, maybe in the Summer period this time, so that we can provide you with the high level of service you are accustomed to. With kind regards, Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
