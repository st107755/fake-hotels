It was not a problem that this hotel was not on the main island of Venice as there were regular complimentary shuttle boats accross to St Marks square and another part of the island. A less advertised service was the free water taxi to Merino - the hotel are in partnership with one of the glass factories/museums - this meant we were only shown round the one museum but I didn't mind as we got there and back for free! I really appreciated that there was a pool at this hotel as by 3/4pm I was ready to cool down before heading out again in the evening. The rooms were clean and spacious, however, the food was very expensive so we never ate in the hotel. All of the rooms have air conditioning but wifi was not free.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
