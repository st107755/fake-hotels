Our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky was excellent.  Excellent value with a first rate staff.  The concierge was the best we have ever had.  She made sure everything was perfect and she gave us hints.  The hotel is wonderful and remodeled in a very authentic manner.  We will recommend this hotel to anyone going to Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 22, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
