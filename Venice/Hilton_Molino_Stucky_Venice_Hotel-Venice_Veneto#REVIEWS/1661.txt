Situated a ten minute shuttle ride from St Marks Sq and away from crowds that gather there.The hotel overall is excellent and our room was large and very well appointed by Venice standards and overlooked the main canal.   But be warned. We booked on line [ HH Silver Members] to take advantage of the discounted rate. However when checking our confirmation when we returned home against our card statement we found that out credit card had been overcharge and we dont have the refund despite several promises.  No explanation has been given to date,therefore I have marked down the service.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 18, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your comments on TripAdvisor. We are glad to her that you liked our property but are on the other hand sorry about the inconvenience that you have experienced. I may suppose that it is related to  the pre-authorization amounts charged to your credit card (which should be considered as temporary transactions and not sales) which I confirm are always automatically released on check-out and the hotel does not hold any deposit after that. The procedure is an international common practice which is applied by major brands, as well as in all Hilton hotels worldwide. Please do not hesitate in contacting directly VCEHI_GuestRelations@hilton.com if the amount is still blocked to fasten the process for a request to release it. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
