This hotel was where our tour group stayed for the Venice portion of our tour. It was the best place we stayed on the tour. Nicely appointed with a great rooftop bar and pool area that offered great views of the city. The rooms were very roomy by Italian standards. The beds were very comfortable. It is located on the waterfront of Giudecca Island and runs a shuttle boat all day to St. Mark's Square. Overall a great place to stay.
