We stayed at the Hilton Molina Stucky for three nights at the end of a 10 day trip to Italy.  It just so happened to be St. Mark's Day, the patron saint of Venice.  We didn't know it when booking, but we got a deal stay at this luxe hotel just a boat shuttle away from St. Mark's Square and all the festivities.  The shuttle takes approx. 20 minutes and gives you vistas of the island not seen by most.  The hotel rooms were extremely spacious even by American standards.  The foyer and closet with its built in light and drawers were very luxurious. The black and white marble bathroom was outstanding!  One of the things we enjoyed the most at the end of our trip was the high quality bed and pillows.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
