Spent 3 nights here and had a great time; given a view room overlooking the Grand Canal.  We are Diamonds so also given access to the lounge, right off the lobby; great drinks, desserts, and finger food.  You can also order off the menu there if you want a complete meal.  Overall thumbs up, liked it better than the WA Cavaliere in RomeRead moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
