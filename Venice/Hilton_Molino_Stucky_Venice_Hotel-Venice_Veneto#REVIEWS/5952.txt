We visited this new hotel in July just a month after it opened, and it's location (on the island of Guidecca) is perfect as we were able to sit on the terrace and watch all the hundreds of tourists troop past on the other side of the water! However, better than it's location is it's rooftop pool, which is simply spectacular, and the view...!!! Other than that, well yes it is expensive (an orange juice is 8 euros), but the service is faultless, our bedroom (although smallish) had a really five-star bathroom and the best thing is that everything (the beds, the furniture, the bathrobes etc) is brand new. The hotel also has a free shuttle boat which takes guests across to Piazza San Marco - a real bonus. The only downside is that it lacks a little on Venetian atmosphere.
