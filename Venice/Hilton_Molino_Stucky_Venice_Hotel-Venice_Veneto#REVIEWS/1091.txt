This 150+ year old flour and pasta factory is now an incredibly comfortable hotel. Rooms are spacious. Bathrooms are beautiful. We rented a larger family room for 4 and had lots of space, but unfortunately no privacy. Although the bedroom was separate from the large living area, there was no door separating the rooms. The family room had 1 + 1/2 bath. Bedding was comfortable and room was well attended to.  Breakfast buffet was excellent. Hotel offers a very reasonably priced boat shuttle service back and forth to San Marco square and the airport. Rooms were very quiet. Staff was professional and friendly.
