As a regular guest at Hilton hotels this is arguably the best we have stayed at. We were upgraded to an executive room which was large, quiet and comfortable. Rooftop pool and bar are a nice addition, worth a visit (if only for views). Boat shuttle worked well and linea blu Alilaguna from the airport stops outside. We liked the location as quieter than central Venice, nice selection of restaurants on the island.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
