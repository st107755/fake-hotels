The service was top class.They have very large breakfast spreads, which is great if you are a Hilton Gold member. Very responsive staff and very helpful. The views from the rooms were beautiful. They have rooms that can fit a family of 4. The swimming pool had incredible views of Venice. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to Murano Island where you can see how the glass is manufactured.The island also has a big show room where you can purchase the Murano glass. In the return trip, the water shuttle boat will drop you off at the square on the opposite side of the Canal and then you will have to take another Hilton water shuttle back to the Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
