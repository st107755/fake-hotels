My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed 6 nights at the Hilton Molino Stucky and loved that it was comfortable, clean, beautiful, and away from the crowds of Venice.  The location gives you a terrific view of Venice from across the canal and provides a chance to relax and exhale after a long day of wandering the back streets and canals of Venice.  As Hilton Diamond members, we enjoyed complimentary buffet breakfast and access to the Exec. Lounge, which provided wonderful cicchitti, prosecco, wine, beer and any other adult beverages you'd like.  Whenever we needed anything, we found that service was prompt and professional.  Food quality was very good all around.  With free shuttle boat service from 8 a.m. until around 1 a.m., it's convenient to get to and from San Marco or Zatterre. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
