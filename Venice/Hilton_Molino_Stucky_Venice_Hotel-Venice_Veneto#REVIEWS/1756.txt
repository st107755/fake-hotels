Our room (402) directly faced the canal and it was very spacious and comfortably furnished. The large bathroom had large fluffy towels and nice robes to slip into after a long day exploring Venice. We utilized the shuttle service to & from Plaza San Marco every day. Hint: shuttle only holds 39 people and that's it, when the seats are full it leaves & if you didn't make it on you have to wait for the next one. Hotel lobby is large & quite stylish, breakfast buffet is very pricy but with a lot to choose from, although the omlet I ordered was way overcooked...brown on the outside...couldn't eat it. The rooftop bar on the 8th floor offers great views of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
