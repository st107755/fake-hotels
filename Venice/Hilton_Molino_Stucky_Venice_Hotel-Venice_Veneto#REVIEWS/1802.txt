A great place to explore from - water shuttle to the city. After busy days exploring Venice, it was nice to return to a clean, friendly hotel. Not an inexpensive place to stay, it was worth the extra for high end service and facilities. This property is a former four mill and beautifully converted by Hilton preserving many of the original attributes.   A pampering that we felt was well worth it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 22, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
