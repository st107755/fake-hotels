Stayed here after our cruise. First stop off the waterway public transportation. We celebrated our 30th anniversary and they had a special treat for us waiting in our upgraded suite. Executive Lounge was a little strange surrounding regular bar and restaurant but good selection. Pool rooftop view was stunning however it closes at 8PM and a private function closed the bar area so we missed the sunset and late night view of venice. Glad to be off the main island as hotel was very quiet. Hotel arranged a water taxi to the airport. Very efficient and cool way to get around. However did not realize the walk from the dock to the airport check in was so long. With all our luggage, maybe a coordinated land taxi may have been better. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
