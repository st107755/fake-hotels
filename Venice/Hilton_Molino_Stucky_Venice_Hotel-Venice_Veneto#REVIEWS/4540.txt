This was a luxury!!! We got upgraded to the suite on their executive floor ( thanks to Alessandro who was a great help) with a marvelous view of Venice. Suite was excellent with all amenities you could wish for. Breakfast was delicious and a lot of variety. Hotel's shuttle service to and from main island was very convenient - boats are clearly marked with Hilton logo. There is a shuttle service from Airport which has a stop right in front of this hotel but it takes like 90 minutes so we decided to get a taxi - which was very convenient.  Their executive lounge also had some good items for that evening snack time.  Overall a great experience and the highlight of our european tour.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
