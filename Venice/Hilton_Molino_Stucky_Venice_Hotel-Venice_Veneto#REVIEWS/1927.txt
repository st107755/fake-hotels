What a fantastic hotel! Before we even arrived the staff were already extremely helpful responding super fast to my email regarding my late check in and advice on getting to the hotel from the airport.  Upon arrival we were met by Daniel, he was polite, professional, friendly but also had a great sense of humour (a credit to the hotel - best receptionist ever!) Don't even know how I would start to talk about the facilities, roof top pool, skyline bar, breakfast, bedrooms & the Hilton ferry were all just excellent! As if you couldn't already tell I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Venice!
