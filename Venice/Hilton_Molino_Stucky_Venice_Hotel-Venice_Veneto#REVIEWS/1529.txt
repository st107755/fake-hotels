This is by far the most grandest and beautiful hotel in Venice... The building itself is just stunning the staff are very friendly and helpful with the boat taxi timetable easy to follow. I was worried about getting around with the boat taxis but found it very easy once you get used to it.  The rooms are clean and spacious couldn't fault it. The little gem of this hotel is the roof top bar which had the most amazing views and staff was so helpful in choosing from the wide range of cocktails.... Spot on after a busy day sight seeing.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 21, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
