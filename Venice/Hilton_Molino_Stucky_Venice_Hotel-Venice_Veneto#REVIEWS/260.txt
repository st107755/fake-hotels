Hotel is great but very busy with tour groups. Gets very overcrowded at breakfast. You can wait a while to get a table early in the morning. Another problem at early breakfast it can take time to refill the food. They have water transport to get across to the other side and takes 25 min.  Rooms very comfortable and clean. Nice restaurants nerby and no need to go across.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for leaving a review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your impressions with us and other travelers.
