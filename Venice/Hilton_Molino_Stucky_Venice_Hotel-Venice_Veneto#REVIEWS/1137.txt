First time we came here was in 2015 and we were impressed. The hotel was beautiful with a unique character (an ex-mill). We loved it so much that we had to stay here again in August 2017. Nothing has changed: beautiful, very clean, great views of the Giudecca canal, nice rooms, quiet (a short boat trip from the heart of Venice).  A room with executive lounge access is a must. The staff is very professional. There is also a Nutella stand in the middle court of the hotel.  If you are Gold-Platinum member with Hilton, they will upgrade you without asking (unlike Hilton Milano which I will review shortly). If you park your car at Tronchetto Parking, don't forget to ask the hotel for a coupon to save 20% on your parking fees.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 1, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
