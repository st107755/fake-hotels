A nice hotel located on an island about 10min boat ride from San Marco. The boat pier is right in front of the hotel. It is an old flour mill converted into a hotel - so you get the charm of the old industrial interior complete with high ceilings and metal beams combined with venetian decor. The service is friendly and efficient. The rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel is relatively new, so it still retains the freshness. The views from the rooms on the city are just fantastic. The only drawback is that  the vaperettos from Tronchetto car park or the train station stop on the island next to the hotel, and it is a good 10min walk from the boat stop to the hotel. Not a very pleasant thing to do if you are dragging 2 suitcases behind you.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 3, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you very much for sharing your positive experience at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for posting it on TripAdvisor.
