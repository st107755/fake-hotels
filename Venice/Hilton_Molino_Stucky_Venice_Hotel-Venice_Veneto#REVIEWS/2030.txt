We loved and enjoyed our trip to Venice. This hotel is wonderful !  Great for couples but not for families ;-) Great bar at the roof and swimming pool. Not to be missed !!! ;-) When standing in front of main hotel entrance please go to the left along the waterside around 300 meters and you will find a great little Italian restaurant with fantastic food. Go there by night at the terrace and enjoy a calm and romantic evening with a great view.   This hotel is a absolute must visit !!!
