Enjoyed a couple of nights break at the Hilton Venice, beautiful views overlooking Venice and the hotel as one would expect was immaculate with all the modcons. We had a junior suite, without a view, which looked brand new with big screen tvs, amazingly comfortable King size bed, kitchenette and marble bathroom.  Bar and restaurant downstairs very pleasant also, although never busy - but rarely get much of an athmoshere in the big corporate hotels. For the size of hotel, reception area was incredibly small which was a little strange and made for slight queueing at reception.  Overall lovely hotel - only criticism would be the lack of restaurants you can walk to from the hotel, quite poor quality although we generally found this across much of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 27, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
