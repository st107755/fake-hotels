Having stayed at this hotel some time ago this time we  had executive rooms with access to the executive lounge which was of a very low standard compared to other Hiltons. The canapes consisted of low quality cheese snacks and were  not the usual high quality items such as a vegetarian and meat assortment along with fish canapes. The lounge was basically a tiny corridor with a gate at the edge of the main bar so not a private lounge at all. Hilton really should get this lounge up to a quality standard as one would expect in Venice and as is offered at other Hiltons around the world. The hotel itself is very nice and used to be a flour mill.The hotel offers shuttle boats into Venice. We would not book the executive rooms again as they do not offer good value at all.Read moreDate of stay: March 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 25, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your feedback which certainly helps us to monitor and improve our services. we were pleased to read that you tested the efficiency and comfort of our shuttle service but on the other hand regret that our Executive Lounge was not up to your expectations.
