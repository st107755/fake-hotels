A very classy hotel across the water from Venice proper.  Really enjoyed our stay here and will stay here again.  Great views of Venice.   Easy access via hotel shuttle (for which there is a small charge). Excellent breakfast.  Executive lounge.  Rooftop bar.  Other restaurant choices on the same island.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you very much for being our Guest and for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
