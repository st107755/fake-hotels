We took the train from Milan for a quick one day tour, This was one of the best hotels , ever--- Beautiful, spacious room with an incredible view. The Venice water taxi is minutes away. They also have their own taxi right in front of the hotel. All just minutes from St. Mark's Square. We stayed on Hilton points which was a great value.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
