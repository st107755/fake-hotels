If you want visit Italy you have to go to Rome, Milan, and Venice. But Venice is something special. First of all, the Airport, water taxi (expensive, but remarkable). The way to the Hotel is about 30 min. While you are boating to the hotel you can watch all the place of interest, of course you have no stops. You can watch and breath such kind of Venice' air. And at last you can see a great ancient red brick building. You can read the name on its roof Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. There is Hilton's small berth (absolutely free of charge for their guests). You enter to the Hotel and walking round its ancient walls. Very good hospitality and friendship of the hotel staff. Great room service, tasteful breakfast. If you want to visit Venice stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
