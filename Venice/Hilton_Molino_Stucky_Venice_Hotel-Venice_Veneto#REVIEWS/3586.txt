I stayed with friends in lovely Venice  Jan. 2014.   I had a sea view room that was fantastic. The hotel is very nice and the room was super with old and authentic interiors and spacious bathroom. Amazingly there was a water hose beside the toilet which was a v. nice surprise for me as an Arab.   The views were great, staff were helpful but internet was slow.   I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it for couples for a romantic stay.   Take the sea view room, it's worth it.  The only drawback is the limitation for the return time to the hotel from the mainland/nightlife places. If you missed the hotel taxi, you'll have to hire one.
