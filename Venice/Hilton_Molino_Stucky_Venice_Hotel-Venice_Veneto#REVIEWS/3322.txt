I attended a conference at this hotel during one week in march this year. This hotel is a busy hotel most of the times and a lot of life all the time. The only down side to this hotel is the shuttle back and forth. If you would like to see the city then you have to take the shuttle or a boat taxi. The service is good at this hotel and the rooms are ok - average Hilton standard.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 28, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your recent business stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
