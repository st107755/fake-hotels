Arrived to the hotel to find we had an amazing room with wonderfully beautiful views, hotel boat takes you to st marks square and was a huge bonus at â‚¬7.50 per person for whole length of stay, excellent!, friendly staff, really good breakfast! And the skyline bar was simply amazing! Pricey drinks, but well worth it for the views. Could not fault one bit. We had the most amazing stay in a simply amazing place.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 1, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your kind comment on TripAdvisor.
