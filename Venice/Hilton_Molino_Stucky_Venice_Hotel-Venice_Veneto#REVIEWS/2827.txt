As you may already know, Venice hotels are generally old, dark furnish style and expensive. If you're looking a hotel room with modern furnish style, clean and easy to reach Venice city center, I would recommend Hilton.   But I must say I was very surprised to see that hotel was big and crowded. Every week they host several business meetings and it doesn't help you to get romantic mood in the hotel. Hotel boat service great but not enough, so you should also consider taking public transportation.    If you're not going to stay at Hilton, you should least visit this great building and have some Processo at Skybar. Excellent view.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
