Great location, away from the crowds but close enough to visit everything easily, and with a convenient free shuttle across the Giudecca Canal. Wonderful building, converted from a Victorian flour mill, but badly let down by the little things:  - No bedside table or reading light on one side of the HUGE double bed  - No soap in the bathroom, but all kinds of un-necessary toiletries  - All broken door stops  - Shower adjustments (height and angle) seized and useless  - Poor sound insulation to corridors, so that sleep disturbed by late nighters  - Coffee in lounge as expensive as in St Marks SquareRead moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
