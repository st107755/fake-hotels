We arrived in Venice after dark (train was 3 hours late!) and it was very difficult to figure out how to get from the train station to the hotel.  If you are not familiar with the water ferries, arrange a private taxi for this.  Once we figured out where we were going, it was still a long walk in the dark along a mostly empty sidewalk along the water.  The beds were very comfortable. The ceiling was weird - I know, a weird thing to say - but they had these peaks that stuck down two feet. Just odd.  Breakfast was great.  Taxi from hotel to main island was a bonus.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
