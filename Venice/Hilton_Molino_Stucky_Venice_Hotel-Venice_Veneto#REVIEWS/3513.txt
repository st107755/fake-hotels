As you would expect from a Hilton 5* hotel, there are lots of positives - helpful staff, multiple facilities, great breakfast, a wonderful rooftop pool and bar (try the MoÃ«t Imperial cocktails!) and spacious rooms even if our view was of the opposing wall.

Great to escape the concentrated tourism of the area, although at a price.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
