This hotel was absolutely one of the best 5-star hotels I've ever stayed at! It has it's own private water taxi (one of only 2 hotels there who has one!), and is right on the grand canal! Best breakfast buffet of our entire trip in Italy! Unique old 17th century flour mill that's now restored to a beautiful hotel! Love, love, love!Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
