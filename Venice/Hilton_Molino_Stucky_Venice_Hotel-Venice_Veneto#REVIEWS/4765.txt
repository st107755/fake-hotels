What a beautiful hotel, great service on arrival, amazing room that was very clean and spacious.we had breakfast included with our hotel package which was really worth it and lots to choose from. The free transport was fantastic, u get given a time table at the beginning of your stay and the water bus was always on time, we even stayed over in Venice til midnight one evening.u really can't get any better for location only down side to the hotel is the prices of the food and drink! It's such a shame they charge these stupid prices, €30 for a buger and chips?? And €20 for 2 half largers. Other than the prices of these everything else is just amazing and would recommend it to anybody. One of the best trips we have ever been on.
