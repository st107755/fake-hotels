The Roof top pool and bar overlooking the city is spectacular.  Calming after fighting the crowds all day. Some very good uncrowded restaurants nearby. Wonderful spa at the hotel.  The hotel itself is wonderful, quiet and clean.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on our Hotel.
