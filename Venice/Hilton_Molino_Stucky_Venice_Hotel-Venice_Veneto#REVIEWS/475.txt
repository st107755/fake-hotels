I think this is the most luxurous hotel in venice and it will leave great impression to yourself and your quests.  Hotel is located a bit further away to the center but the hotel has private boats to the center almost every 30 minutes.   Food, drinks and service is the best quality and rooms are very well decorated. Wifi speed is excellent, only downside of the hotel is the minibar prices so dont forget to bring your water :)Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 14, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
