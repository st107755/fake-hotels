We chose this hotel for two main reasons, one because it is not on the 'main' island of Venice, it's just over water and well serviced by the free Hilton water taxi (services every 20mins until late, it takes 5/8mins to cross), public water buses (EUR 7 per person per trip, also regular) and the expensive private water taxis.  Being on the main island would have been very busy and noisy.    Secondly we had a look at a lot of the more famous hotels in Venice but they all seem very dated inside with old looking carpets and old style decor, which at EUR750/1000 a night we did not want to go for.  The Hilton provides you with a nice and modern rooms and new hotel, at a decent price, away from the hoards of tourists - it must be said Venice is beautiful but it is literally overrunâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
