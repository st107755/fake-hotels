I was disappointed that the room was not bigger, I just expected it to be larger based on the photos I had seen. There was nothing to complain about but it just lacked the wow factor. THe hotel building itself is huge and imposing and a bit of a complex. The onsite restaurants are really good and the restaurant 'Bacaroma' was great and worth a visit (I think I got the name right).  The concierge was great, especially Irene !
