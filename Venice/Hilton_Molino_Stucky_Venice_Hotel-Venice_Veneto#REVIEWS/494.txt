This is our third time to stay that Stuckey and we love the quality of the rooms and 5 star service of the staff! This in the newest, cleanest and most spacious hotel you can stay at in Venice. Their personal water taxi shuttles you every 20 minutes back and forth to San Marco Piazza which allows you to recharge your energy, check emails/review photos and on a WiFi equipped first call shuttle boat. The Stuckey is the place to stay!!
