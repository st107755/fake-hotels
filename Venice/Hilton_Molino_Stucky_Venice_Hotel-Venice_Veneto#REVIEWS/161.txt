Picked out this hotel because I am traveling alone. For me it’s an ideal location. It’s out of the way but easily accessible. The city is so busy - even in September- and this hotel seems like a quiet island. Once you check in you have canal boat access. My room is possibly one of the most beautiful rooms I’ve stayed in (including Paris).  I have a view of the water.  So happy with this choice. Staff are helpful and friendly. Food is good.
