We were guests at the hotel so I have no idea how much it cost (probably a lot).  It's a great location and the free shuttle to Venice is fantastic.  The room was fairly large, with a comfortable bed, good bedlinen and a large bathroom with separate shower and tub.  We were lucky to have a corner room with large windows, overlooking the courtyard.  Good buffet breakfast and very attentive staff at breakfast, they were all very professional and friendly, happy to bring you another coffee or more orange juice.  The blueberry muffins had a strange taste to them (very American, almost like they were made from a muffin mix) but the croissants were fabulously light.  On the low points, Wifi is extremely expensive and should really - for a hotel like this - be offered free of charge inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
