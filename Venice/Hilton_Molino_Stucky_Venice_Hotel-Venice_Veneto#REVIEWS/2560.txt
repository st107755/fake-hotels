We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and it was wonderful. We were upgraded to a room that over looked the canal in front of the hotel and it was great. All of the staff from the front desk to the breakfast area were VERY friendly and helpful! We are already looking forward to our next stay at this hotel! Also we used the hotel shuttle boat frequently and it was very convenient for getting back and forth to either San Marco Square or Zattere.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 28, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for your lovely comments about Hilton Molino Stucky, I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us!
