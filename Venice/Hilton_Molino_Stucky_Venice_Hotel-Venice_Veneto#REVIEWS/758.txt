Checked in at this Hilton a few days ago in Venice for two nights and this hotel was magnificent.  Although our room didn't have much of a view, the room and bed was spacious for two adults and the bathroom was luxurious.  The buffet breakfast was very good and there was a wide variety of breakfast items, including cheeses, meats, croissants, fruits, etc.  The service including the desk staff and concierge and doorman were wonderful.  Enjoyed the view of the rooftop bar.  Access to the hotel was satisfactory via shuttle, but we found a short walk to the vaporetto station a few blocks away and over a bridge much more to our liking.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
