Stayed here with my husband for 7 nights. Hotel itself is beautiful , has its own private shuttle boat to take you to and from the hotel..   We had breakfast in the upgrade area.. which served snacks and tea/coffee facilities . Which came in handy in the morning before we headed out to explore Venice.  Also it serves alcohol after a certain time. Wine and beers.   I think 7 nights was to long to visit Venice as there didn't Seem to be much to do after the tourist spots closed..  The Hilton spa is worth a visit. Great massage and sauna steam room was good.  Overall a beautiful hotelRead moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 4, 2017Dear Madame,  Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our Hotel and services as well as the Executive Lounge which offers nice views over the Giudecca canal. We are also pleased that you tested the efficiency of our shuttle boat service which is very convenient to reach St Marks square and the city centre. On your next visit to Venice may I suggest a visit of the Giudecca island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. There are always art exhibitions going on and the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommen. We thank you for being our Guests and we hope to welcome you and your husband again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
