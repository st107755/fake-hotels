We struggled to pick a hotel to stay for our first visit to Venice - and settled on this one. It was a nice hotel and we were upgraded to a beautiful, very large suite.  As others mentioned, the hotel is not part of the main island and, despite others, is not quite so convenient. Boat pickups are regularly 40 minutes apart giving you little leeway if you have specific times to get places.  The hotel itself is a Hilton. If you travel frequently, you know what that means. A Hilton is a Hilton is a Hilton. Most of the more modern ones have the same furniture, decor and style regardless of the location. It's fairly boring.  We did have massages at the spa and both of us were very happy. The spa was high-quality and incredibly affordable.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 28, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
