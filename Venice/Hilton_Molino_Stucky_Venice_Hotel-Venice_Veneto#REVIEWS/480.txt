We stayed at this hotel before going on our Regent Cruise. It was easy to get to from the airport by a delightful water taxi ride. Great location on a small island with San Marcos Square just a water taxi ride away. The restored flour/pasta mill was a fun place to spend the night.  We enjoyed dining and drinking in the restaurant and rooftop bar, and would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends traveling to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 7, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
