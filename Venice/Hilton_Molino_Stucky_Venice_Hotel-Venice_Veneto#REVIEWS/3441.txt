We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and upgraded to a executive king suite which was lovely . Complimentary drinks and snacks available throughout the day in the executive lounge with free wi -fi no wi-fi in the room!!!! We telephoned and emailed the hotel before we came to see if we could pay cash rather than run up a hefty cc bill and were told no problem . However on arrival we were told italian law forbids more than 999 euros in cash so we have lost out on 2 accounts and we will be making a complaint as we have the email saved . However the staff were courteous and the rooftop pool and champagne bar was very pleasant in the sunshine .
