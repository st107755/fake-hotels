A fabulous hotel, amazing rooftop bar & pool, cocktails a tad expensive but you get what you pay for. Rooms are of a very high standard. The taxi bus is a lovely touch and although this hotel is slightly off the beaten track it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle and have some downtime around the pool. Fabulous restaurants nearby on the front near palanca stop. We got engaged in the roof top bar, much better views than in a gondola and less cheesy, always have a special place in our heartsRead moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 7, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
