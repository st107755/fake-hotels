Stayed for one night in this hotel and it was a great experince. It might be a bit far from the main attractions in Venice, but they provide a free shuttle to solve this. In addition the rooms were super clean with an excellent standard, especially the air condition as 90% of the hotels in Venice have a weak air conditioning system, but in this hotel it was completely impressing. People also were friendly an give us an optimum service.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
