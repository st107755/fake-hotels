Due to flight problems, I arrived late night instead of in the morning. The experience was rather traumatic when I arrived San Marco from Airport, and apparently there was no shuttle service, water bus or water taxi. I rang the hotel and they help find a water taxi to pick me up. Upon arrival I seek their assistance for connecting flights. The staff were very professional and helpful indeed! I have got a very pleasant stay, enjoying their hospitality and service in a rather relaxing atmosphere. The room service for breakfast was well organised, with excellent value for money too!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 4, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
