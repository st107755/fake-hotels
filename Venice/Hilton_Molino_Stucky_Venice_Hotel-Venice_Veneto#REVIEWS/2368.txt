Great hotel on Giudecca island but only 10 mins away from st marco.  Hotel provide ferry service.  Breakfast was great with lots of choices.  Roof top bar serves cocktails and we had a great view of the fireworks.  Nutella crepes in the lounge were yummy.  Would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2016Dear Madame, We are delighted that you had a good time over New Year at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review posted on TripAdvisor.
