To get the best out of this hotel, you really need to ensure you get a room with a view, which we did. It was so amazing to sit by the window, opan the window and watch the world go by on the water. It was the perfect spot for our honeymoon trip. Convenient to the main part of Venice with free water taxi (the ride is a little rocky!) or nearby ferry, but away from the hustle and bustle. Great old building, converted very nicely. Very comfortable bed and room. Great choice of food at breakfast, buffet style, but get there early if you want to eat in the mainr estaurant. One it fills up you're shunted into overflown side rooms which aren't half as pleasant.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
