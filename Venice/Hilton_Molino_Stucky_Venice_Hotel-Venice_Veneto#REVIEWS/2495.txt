Perfect location if you want some peace  Its all down to personal preference but i wouldn't rush back to venice its overrated and just full of the same shops selling souvenirs, theres some nice buildings but some are very rundown  so this hotel is a contrast to that  it is stunning inside and out, the staff helpful, prices are a little expensive clenliness of the hotel was ok but not perfect  lounge was a bit small and not a lot of choice  breakfast was good but sometimes not fast enough to replenish generally service was good but the last day it was a bit slow mainly because some inconsiderate guest was talking to a waiter for a long time instead of letting him work Overall enjoyable stay Great food tooRead moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 30, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
