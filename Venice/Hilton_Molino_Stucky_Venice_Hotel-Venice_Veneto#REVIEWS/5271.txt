I am very sorry for the inconveniences you are experiencing with your account and with payment charges for your stay with us.   We have carefully checked the status of your reservation, as received from the conference organiser. Your booking was indeed confirmed for 3 nights, with first night to your charge (self-payment) and only 2 nights included in the event package which have been charged to the event planner.  In this respect, our financial department have replied directly to your personal e-mail at the beginning of January and again last week and yesterday. Please accept our apologies if you have experienced a certain delay with our first answer, as your first enquiry was received during Christmas / New Year period.  May I suggest that you contact the event planner and clarify with the them payment terms of your accommodation for your stay. Kind regards. Mario Ferraro - General ManagerRead more
