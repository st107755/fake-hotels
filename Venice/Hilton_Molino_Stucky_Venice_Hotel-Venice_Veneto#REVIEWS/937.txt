Our aim is to provide each and every Guest with a wonderful and memorable experience, and I am sorry that this was not evident in your case.  As regards bed bugs, as you can imagine, we take this very seriously and we rigorously follow Hiltons procedures and protocols as rooms are inspected on a regular basis. Immediately after you reported the issue the night of the 22nd of November, our Housekeeping Supervisor went upstairs to check your room and she did not find any evidence of bedbugs. The morning after the team and I have again visited the room with no positive results. This said the room was taken out of the operation until we received the visit from the pest control company who confirmed no evidence. I will be more than happy to share their report with you if you can share your e-mail address with me on VCEHI_GM@hilton.com I do hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for.
