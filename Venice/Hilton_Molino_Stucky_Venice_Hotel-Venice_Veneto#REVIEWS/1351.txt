The hotel is located close to the Vatican, but much too far from town.  The hotel runs a shuttle, but its hours are not convenient.  The hotel is great and we had a very good experience, but  the hotel needs to make different arrangements to provide for more shuttles and a faster drive to town.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 22, 2017Dear Sir, thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca island did not entirely meet your expectations; it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and St. Marks Cathedral and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city as well as a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
