This hotel is an awesome hotel however, it is not in all of the action of Venice. They do have a shuttle boat that takes you to the main island but that makes it somewhat inconvenient. If you have never been to Venice and need to have the feel of it I would stay on the main island, preferable close to St. Marks Square. If you are going on a cruise ship then it is better to stay near the Plaza De Roma. The hilton has all of the amenities you would expect from them. They have a spectacular swimming pool on the roof top that is beathtaking. The service from the front desk is top..top best! If you have been to Venice before and want to be out of the hustle bustle then this is the Best place to be.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
