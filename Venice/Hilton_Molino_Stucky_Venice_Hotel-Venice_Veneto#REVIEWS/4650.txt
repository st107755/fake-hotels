My partner and I recently stayed two nights at Molino Stucky for our 10 year anniversary. We had an amazing time and were extremely impressed with the staff at this hotel. All the staff we came across were very friendly and helpful and could not vault any of them. I would definately recommend the Molino Stucky for a special occasion, as the rooms were emaculate, the beds were like sleeping on clouds, the views are lovely and the people were exceptional.  The only downside is that as it is on the Island, there isn't many options for food apart from the rather expensive on-site resaurants and room service, so I'd suggest stocking up on a few snacks before arriving. On a nice day, the free ferry is a nice way of travelling to and from San Marcs to get some stunning views of Venice.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 25, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
