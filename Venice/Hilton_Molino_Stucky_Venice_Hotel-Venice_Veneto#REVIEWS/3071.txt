My husband and I have just returned from a magical trip to Venice. It was a gift from our son for our 30th wedding anniversary and we must say that the wonders of Venice were truly highlighted by our stay in this fantastic hotel. Friendly efficient staff, fantasmagorical breakfasts! wonderful room, amazing bed and pillows, clean, airy, quiet, skytop bar at the top and spa below. The hotels history was fascinating and the refurbishment was brilliant. The boat trip there and back to our little island was fabulous after the hustle and bustle of Venice itself. We would like to highly recommend it and thank all the staff for a wonderful week.
