the good:  so much!  this hotel is relatively new, very clean, and the location ain't bad.  the room was very spacious, as was the bathroom.  the decor was what you would expect from a five star hotel, but with some touches of venice (exposed wooden ceiling beams).  we took a vaporetto there because we weren't sure where the free shuttle would pick us up.  but once we found that, we made much use of it.  a grocery store is just across the water, and the major sights are very close.  the free hotel shuttle actually drops you at san marco.    the bad:  none really.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
