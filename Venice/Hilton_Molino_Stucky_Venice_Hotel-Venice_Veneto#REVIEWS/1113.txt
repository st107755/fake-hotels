This Hilton is posh but not pretentious. You have probably the best views of Venice from the rooms from the rooftop bar and pool. The hotel is super clean well fitted with a great buffet breakfast. Located off the beaten track, this hotel provides a free water shuttle across the water to the main sites in Venice. You get the best views with none of the crowds, the staff are friendly will tend to your every need. They have a nice spa and wonderful pool located on the roof which provides stunning views of Venice as does the skyline rooftop bar. May be the best Hilton I've stayed at so far. I cannot say enough how stunning the views are from this side of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
