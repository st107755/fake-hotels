Stunning hotel-amazing exterior and the rooms were phenomenal. Perfect romantic hotel and also good for families. We also enjoyed the food in the lounge and found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly. Highly recommended! The only criticism is not enough chairs on the pool deck area.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 27, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience at our property.
