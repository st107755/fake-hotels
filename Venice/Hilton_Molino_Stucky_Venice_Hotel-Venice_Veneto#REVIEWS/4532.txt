Excellent stay here and love the fact it is out of the way of the main island of Venice but only a short boat ride over to St Marks Square. Lovely room with huge shower and seperate bath. Lots of choice at breakfast. The only downside was the spa was very tiny and if I would have known I would have not wasted money to enter it. Other than that had lunch on the rooftop overlooking Venice - could not have asked for a better 25th birthday present treat from my partner. Unforgettable.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
