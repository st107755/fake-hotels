Well worth the money for a 3 night short break. Prices at the hotel are sky high as you would expect, coffee ?6 cheeseburger ?28 so be sure to head over the river for dinner at a much more affordable price. The hotel as a FREE shuttle boat but be sure to be on time as there are limited spaces when busy! Room was very spacious and very comfortable. Sea view room after askinf for a room change from a building site view. Pool on the roof is amazing along with the Sky bar at sunset before heading out. 100% would stay here again. Airport shuttle bus to the hotel front door ?27 return. Enjoy.
