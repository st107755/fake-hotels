We stayed at the hotel for 3 days in May.  The positives were many.  The staff were professional, courteous, and helpful.  We loved the location on Giudecca away from the hordes of tourists but with easy access to the main points of interest in Venice.  Our room was beautiful, clean, spacious, and comfortable. Our accommodations overlooked the lagoon which had very interesting traffic such as river and cruise ships and racing yachts going by.  We also had "club" privileges which gave us access to a lounge where we had breakfast every morning and drinks/appetizers pre-dinner. We spent an hour or so at the rooftop pool which is pretty cool because you feel like you are at a resort but are overlooking the city of Venice.  My only complaint is that we did not stay longer.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
