It's a huge vacuous hotel, got lost several times trying to find the room. Rooms are ok, a little old fashioned where as the rest of the hotel feels more modern.  Club room was large in size and food aircon. Breakfast was a bit of a bun fight, constantly running out of items. Lovely to sit in the garden and have breakfast however.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 20, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
