The hotel was a real treat. Architecturally stunning, with lovely rooms, great views (especially from the roof terrace) and a staff any hotel would be proud of. The boats to San Marco worked a treat, but it does add a little pressure on knowing that if you miss it, your aching feet will need to wait another hour until you get home. The food in the hotel was mediocre, and if possible, I'd suggest getting over to The Riviera, a short walk from Zaterre stop. Amazing food and service at roughly the same prices as the hotel restaurant. Be prepared for a mammoth trip from/to the Airport. What they pitch as a short 15km boat trip is in fact close to 2 hours. Get your sea legs ready, hunker down and admire the views, you'll be there for some time.
