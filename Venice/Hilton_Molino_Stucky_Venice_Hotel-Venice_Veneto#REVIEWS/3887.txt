5 Star hotel on Giudecca Island across the waterway from San Marco Square. Beautiful d√©cor and artifacts dominate the public areas of the hotel, and the view from the roof top lounge is the best in Venice! Convenient water transfers to mainland every 15-20 minutes connect you to all the action.  Guest rooms are huge by European standards and decorated in rich gold and burgundy. Concierge was quick to offer maps and excellent directions.  Excellent high class experience in one of the most romantic cities in the world!  BTW, no complaints about high prices people, what did you expect? This is Venice!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
