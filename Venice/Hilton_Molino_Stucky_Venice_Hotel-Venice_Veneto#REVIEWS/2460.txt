First of all, a bit off from the main parts of the city center. You need to take the boat and you can be on the main square in 10 min. @ night can be tricky to move around. Rooms: very dirty carpet and really need some refurbishment... this is not a 5 stars. Large room with everything you expect from an hotel. Breakfast: disappointed. Worst black coffee I ever drunk in Italy. Staff was very friendly and always there to help you.

We are sorry if you were not completely satisfied with your stay; it is true that our hotel is not on the central part of Venice and you need to get a shuttle boat to get here, but this is clearly explained on our website and is easily understandable once you take a look at our position on a Venice map. Our location, away from the noisy crowds of San Marco, is one of our best features and is appreciated in tens of reviews; we are sorry if you did not like it.   We apologize if the coffee at breakfast and the cleanliness of the carpet in your room were not up to your expectations, we will definitely inform the relevant Managers to improve our service.   Thank you for your feedback and we are glad you liked the service given from our staff.   We look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
