Really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky, we had a King Hilton Deluxe room with a courtyard view. Big room, lovely bathroom, huge comfortable bed. We stayed for four nights and were glad we had booked the breakfast, wonderful buffet, breakfast staff are charming and efficient. The swimming pool is a good size and stays open until half 8 in the evening. Internet free in lobby. Hotel shuttle to Zattere and San Marco is great. Hotel quite expensive for food and drinks but then so is Venice generally. Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
