I have stayed at Hilton Molino Stucky numerous times since it opened mainly on business but unfortunately standards have deteriorated recently. The customer service is virtually non existent and don't even bother asking to speak to the manager as he has virtually no concern at all for customer's satisfaction.He does not respond as one would expect a Hilton manager to.
