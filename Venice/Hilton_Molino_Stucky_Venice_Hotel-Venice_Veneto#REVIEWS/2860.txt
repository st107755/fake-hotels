Although it is on Giudecca Island, there is a free shuttle boat to Piazza San Marco frequently till midnight.  Sitting on bench of the jetty in front of the classical building in the evening, you can view the beautiful lights of the canal and Venice Islands without noises and crowds.  We had a very good breakfast in the garden.  The bed was very comfortable.  It is such a calm and nice hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
