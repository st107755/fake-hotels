We'd booked a deluxe room for 5 nights. When we arrived, we were very disappointed to learn that there was no room left giving onto the canal. The young man at the reception, after consulting his boss, managed to upgrade us to a junior suite overlooking the canal. On the day of my birthday (the reason why we'd gone to Venice) I was presented with a lovely birthday cake and a bottle of champagne... They really know how to treat guests in this hotel. The only negative point : they don't have free wifi, even in the hall of reception.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2012Dear Sir, Thank you for your review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
