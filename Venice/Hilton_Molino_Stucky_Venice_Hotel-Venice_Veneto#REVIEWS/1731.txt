This was the perfect place to stay for a post cruise couple of nights before heading off to Rome.  The rooms were very good - spacious and quite luxurious with very good bathroom.  Hotel has all the amenities including quite a good breakfast and a good lounge area to enjoy a drink with friends.  Shuttle boat from hotel to St Marks Square was very regular and easy to use.  Lots of restaurants just along the canal for an evening meal or morning coffee or just a walk if we had had enough of the crowds over by the Basilica and Doges Palace.  Staff arranged a water taxi for us to go to the station on the morning of our departure and they couldn't have been more helpful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
