Absolutely a gem of a place to stay on Giudecca island opposite Venice The hotel was,as you would expect,exceptional and all the staff were approachable,freindly and helpful. We stayed for 4 nights in a deluxe room with a Venice view which was large and spacious and very comfortable. Being on the island opposite Venice there are lots of local restaurants nearby and the prices are much less than Venice itself (but to be honest if you keep away from St Marks square the prices in Venice are quite reasonable) The views of Venice from both the rooftop pool and the Skyline bar are amazing.It is great to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice and chill by the pool on a hot afternoon Getting to Venice by the hotel shuttle only takes about 15 mins and they run all day every 20â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
