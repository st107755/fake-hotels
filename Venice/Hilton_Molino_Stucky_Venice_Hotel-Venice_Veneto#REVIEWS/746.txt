Really good hotel. We had a room overlooking the canal which was very nice and the decor, as a refurbished mill, is tastefully done. The hotel water taxi worked well and we were never unable to get one due to capacity. There is an absence of dining options on the island but there are lots just the other side of the canal (free water bus again) and it's an excuse to get out and about. Also worth pointing out that the pool is excellent. I've deducted 1 star for the breakfast which was okay, not great. Overall I'd definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.  We are happy to read that you had a nice stay and that you liked our property. We are delighted to read that you would like to return and on the next occasion I would suggest a visit of the Giudecca island, where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
