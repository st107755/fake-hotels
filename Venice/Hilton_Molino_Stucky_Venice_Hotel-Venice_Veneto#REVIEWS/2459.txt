We stayed for a week at this hotel in October 2015. The room was good, the staff were very helpful and welcoming. The breakfast buffet had a great variety of foods and we enjoyed the dishes we choose. The hotel offers an efficient shuttle service from Giudecca to the main centres of Venice. We enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review.
