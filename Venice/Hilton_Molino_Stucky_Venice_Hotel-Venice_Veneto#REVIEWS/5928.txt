After getting a excellent deal on my weekend away, I paid 3 star hotel prices for our stay. It was the first time to Venice, the Hilton staff made us very welcome. Loved the room very clean and tidy with a  27inch lcd tv! Breakfast was excellent. Only had one downside they tried charging us for breakfast both mornings, had been a mix up with reception and restaurant. Good job as its Â£30 a head! In the evening go to the skyline bar its amazing, very romantic but its expensive!Read moreDate of stay: January 2008HelpfulShare
