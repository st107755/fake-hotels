Nice Hotel on its own island across the San Marco Square. But it never to far as the hotel operates its own shuttle ferry on frequent intervals. we stayed in the family suite and the rooms were large. It had a small kitchenette but no amenities like utensils or crockery to make use fo the kitchenette. The Executive Lounge is great with free snacks and drinks (non-alcoholic). The location is superb as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the main square. The Hotel also organises a free trip to the Murano Glass Factory for its guests. Breakfast is awesome and certainly one of the best I have seen in Italy. Overall a very good stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
