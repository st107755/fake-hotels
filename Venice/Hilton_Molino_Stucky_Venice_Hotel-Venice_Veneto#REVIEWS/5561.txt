First of all, the location of the hotel is not convenient, but it's pretty quite and mordern decorated.  They have shuttle boat between San Marco Sq and the hotel, but the dock near the San Marco Sq is very difficult to find.  Starwood has the big sign at their dock, but Stucky Hilton only put a tiny one facing the other direction (east).  People often come from the west, and you have to pass two bridges from San Marco Sq. Secondary, when we finally found the shuttle and tried to check in, we were told that all rooms were sold out because a conference or something.  The concierge tried to send us to another hotel which we don't have any idea about.  What?  Is it because we booked from a discount website?  This is not acceptable, we had a contract for three rooms and we've paid. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
