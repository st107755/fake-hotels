We like this hotel for it's secluded location and it's rooftop pool, especially when there is a pool party at night (sadly this time there wasn't one). The room was just as nice, especially the bed and we had an amazing sleep, when we weren't disturbed. Our room overlooked an internal courtyard and Nutella bar, which plays relaxing music as long as it's open. On our first night we were disturbed in the middle of the night by the sound of some tacky techno music, which didn't stop until the morning. Than at 7 am sharp it was gone. We complained to the reception, thinking that maybe some guests were having a party, but that wasn't the case. After much thought we found out it was the music from Nutella bar, which switched on automatically and the next night the problem was gone.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
