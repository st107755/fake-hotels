This landmark hotel which was once a flour mill was renovated into this luxury hotel.  Our room on the 7th floor had the most superb views over the channel, mesmerising just watching all the boats hustling along.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfasts were bountiful and the staff friendly.  The Sky bar was really a treat after dinner to relax with a drink and soak up the night views of Venice. I would recommend this hotel as you have space which is a premium in Venice. Tips would be watch boat shuttle schedule as peak times you are not guaranteed to get on and would need to wait. Also check in and out give yourself time as it tends to be busy.
