Stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Was our first time in Venice and I was a little worried about staying here as it is on another island to mainland Venice but there was no need to worry.  A shuttle water bus is provided but we didn't need to use it as we used the local water buses they are very frequent and no problem at all getting anywhere. There a a few nice restaurants on Guidecca also which we tried. Hotel is very modern nice clean rooms and a lovely roof top bar with fantastic view of Venice! Pricey drinks but same everywhere really! Will definitely be back Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 8, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your positive feedback and for choosing Hilton Molino Stucky for your wedding anniversary celebration in Venice.
