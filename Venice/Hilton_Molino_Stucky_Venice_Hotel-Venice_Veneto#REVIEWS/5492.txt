Loved this hotel from start to finish, when we saw it from the boat as we arrived we thought wow and it didn't disappoint. Rooms were immaculate and lovely, bed was extremely comfortable and the complimentary boat from the hotel to the centre was excellant. Staff were very helpful and I would highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
