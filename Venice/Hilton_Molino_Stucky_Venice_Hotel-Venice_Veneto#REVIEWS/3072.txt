Very clean rooms, extremely nice and helpful staff. Very attentive to customers' requests and needs. Great breakfast! The hotel has a boat service to St Mark Square, but can be busy at peak times. Meals at the hotel are quite pricey for what you get. However, rooms on the 7th floor under directly under the Skyline bar can be noisy at night, but they are more than happy to move you on request. Highly recommended and would consider staying there again when in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 25, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to review us on Tripadvisor.
