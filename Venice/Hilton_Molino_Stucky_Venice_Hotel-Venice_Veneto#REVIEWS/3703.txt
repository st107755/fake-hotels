I was a guest at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice in June 2014. This hotel is amazing and the service was fantastic! I visited Italy with a tour group and stayed in the Veneto Hotel in Rome and the Club Hotel in Florence. These 2 hotels have a lot to learn from the Hilton! The Hilton was a welcome change at the end of a our tour. The service was what you would expect from any high end American hotel which was awesome! I found the room to be very clean and everything working they way it should! I would definitely stay there again!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
