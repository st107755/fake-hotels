This was a beautiful hotel very well done but very cold.  The staff was more interested in the big meeting they were having and cared less about the other guest.  We were with a tour group and had no choice but to stay here.  The roof top pool and view are outstanding.  The breakfast meal was very good and one of the young men that worked there was great.  Staff as a whole very sad for a Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 29, 2016Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
