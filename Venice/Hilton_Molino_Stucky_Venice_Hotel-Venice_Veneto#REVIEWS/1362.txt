Accommodation is always a big problem when you stay in Venice during the opening period of Venice Biennale.  Hilton Molino Stucky is certainly a good choice!  Not only that this hotel has a group of beautiful buildings adapted from a former flour mill.  You enjoy quietness here by staying away from the main island but you are well connected with frequent boat shuttle service.  The staff are extremely helpful and provide marvellous support service like the booking of water taxis.  You will be in good hands if you stay here.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 15, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting a positive review about us.
