We have had the most amazing time in Venice! The hotel is amazing and absolutely 5*. Service is excellent. Food is excellent. We ate at one of your restaurants and that was also excellent. Breakfast choice was immense! And the rooftop pool is just out of this world! Also we got engaged in Venice after a lovely night at the restaurant, everything just made our whole trip perfecto!  Definitely returning! Thank you!
