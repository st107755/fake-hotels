Very nice hotel at Giudecca,comfy rooms,bed and bathroom, free wifi overall. Great breakfast buffet, best i ever had in hotels! Transport to San Marco with boat every 20 minutes or 40 minutes depending on the schedule, they charge only 4.5â‚¬ pp during your stay. 2 restaurants in hotel and a nice bar. Friendly staff. Great Bar and pool at the top but be early, not much room up there with a superb view of Venice, Party every Saturday night and the hotel is set in an ancient flour mill. Nearby restaurants with better price quality than San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Sir, We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
