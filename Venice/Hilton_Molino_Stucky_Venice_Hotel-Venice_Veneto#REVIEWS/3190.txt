We loved this hotel. the happy hour is very good, nothing like good Italian wine and fresh olives , atmosphere was great. The room was very comfortable with the best view by far of our entire trip. I plan to come back and stay longer soon.   There is a boat every 15 min and very easy to find your way to and from the hotel. The people at the hotel were amazing with excellent service.
