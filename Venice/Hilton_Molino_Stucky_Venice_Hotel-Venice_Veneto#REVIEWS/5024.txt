We have just returned from a four night break at this hotel.  Everything was fabulous.  Staff in all areas were very friendly and accomodating. Facilities were exceptional with 24 hour gym.  Amazing breakfasts (I dont think there was anything that was not available). Water shuttle to main areas is frequent and efficient.  Fabulous views of Venice from the Skyline Bar and rooftop swimming pool.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
