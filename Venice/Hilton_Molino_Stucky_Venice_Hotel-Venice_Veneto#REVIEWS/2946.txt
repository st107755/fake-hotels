Amazing hotel, amazing bar staff especially in the reception bar! Big hello and thank you so much to Ofeao and all his bar staff! We miss you! For such an expensive hotel they made a few mistakes ex: my birthday flowers weren't there wen we arrived, no view from our room and they wrote happy birthday to my partner instead of me! Breakfast is also very slow if you order extra from the additional buffet! Don't mean to sound petty but for Â£1500 for 3 nghts stay you expect almost perfection! Ps: very expensive bar but the two restaurants in the hotel are 10/10Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 23, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
