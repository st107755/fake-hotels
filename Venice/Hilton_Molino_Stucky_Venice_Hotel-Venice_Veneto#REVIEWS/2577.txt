While this is a very nice hotel in  historic landmark, it was inconvenient to always have to take a water shuttle (provided by the hotel) to get to the main part of Venice. The water was very choppy which made boarding & leaving the shuttle a big challenge & dangerous. One woman in our group even fell & broke bones becuse it was so unstable. Our room was comfortable though small & breakfast was good although service was mediocre. Check-in staff was very friendly & helpful.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 21, 2015Dear Madame, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity while staying in a quiet and relaxing residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
