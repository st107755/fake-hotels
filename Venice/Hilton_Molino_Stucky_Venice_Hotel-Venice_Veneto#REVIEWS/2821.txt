Overall very disappointed with this hotel.  Our bed linens were frayed. The lamp shades were damaged, torn and worn.  There were stains on the carpet.  We didn't get a room key until hours after our check in because the system was down.  The view of the trash heap next door was disappointing, especially as a Gold member.  The fitness room was terrible.    On the positive side, the staff was friendly and made the best of a bad situation and the rooftop pool was very cool.  The pool seemed very cloudy though.   I would not recommend this hotel.  Too many negatives including having to take the Hilton water Taxi across the water to get into Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2015Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
