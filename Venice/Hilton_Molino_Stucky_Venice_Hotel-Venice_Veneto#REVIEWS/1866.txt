The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel is situated on the island of Guidecca, easily reachable with taxi boat or public transport. It is a huge hotel with great sized and very clean rooms. The bar is super to have a drink before hitting the sights.  The rooftop terrace and pool are breathtaking, though a bit expensive.  Overall, a hotel that I can absolutely recommend for a stay in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
