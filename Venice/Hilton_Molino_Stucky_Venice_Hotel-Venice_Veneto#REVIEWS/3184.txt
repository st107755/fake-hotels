Amazing property with fantastic staff.  I love old places converted to grand hotels and this does not dissapoint!  I had a waterfront room with windows that open to a spectacular view 24-7.  Food is excellent and my Gold status gave me access to the Executive Lounge which is top-notch so I'd recommend buying into that level if you are not that status level.  My room is visually amazing with high ceilings, crown molding, marble bath, and beautiful wood doors.  Easy access to town with free frequent boats at rhe doorstep.  Room has no noise from neighbors and traffic is an occasional boat passing in the night.  Beds are the European firm models and the spa sets the jacuzzi a tad chilly for US folks but it it a solid 5 stars and Venice should be on every travelers must-see list.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 4, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
