In terms of Hiltons this is certainly one of the better-located ones, its on the island of Guidecca just across the main channel from Venice, the hotel has a shuttle boat so no worries about getting amongst the crowds and tourist attractions anytime you like. The hotel is a renovated set of mill/factory building, this has been done very tastefully indeed, lots of exposed brickwork and cool rooms. We ate lunches outside overlooking the water , drank in the rooftop bar at night overlooking Venice on one side and the sea on the other, just superb. Rooms are great, all the usual Hilton luxuries, plenty of space, good aircon and lots of English TV channels ! When i come back to Venice i will definitley be staying here !Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
