We were part of a tour group and stayed here for a couple of nights. The view we had was fantastic,considering we were from a 38 people tour. We must've got the lucky straw. Canal views and could see Venice city centre in the distance. Even got to see the cruise ships cruise by!! The room was immaculate and very large for European standards. I had the best sleep ever in this hotel, so quiet and the beds so comfortable!! I wish I could've stayed longer! So much to choose from for breakfast and even tho it rained in Venice while we were there, the Hilton Stucky Hotel was a pleasure to stay in :)Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
