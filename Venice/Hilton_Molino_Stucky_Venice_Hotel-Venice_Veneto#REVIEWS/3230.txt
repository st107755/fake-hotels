This is a luxury hotel which gives you great value for your money.  Bedrooms are very spacious and the shower room is also large and very nice.  Service is excellent and the breakfast is wonderful with very fresh and high quality products.   In relation to the fact that the hotel is located in an island, in my opinion it actually makes it charming and didn't result in any inconvenience whatsoever.  It was very nice to take the hotel boat to either the island of Dorsoduro or to Piazza San Marco while getting a view of Venice from another angle.  In addition to the hotel boat there is also a possibility to take the public transport boat from a nearby stop.  So unless you are always on a tight schedule, the hotel location shouldn't be an issue at all.
