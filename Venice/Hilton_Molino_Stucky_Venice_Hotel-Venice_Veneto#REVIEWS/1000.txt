This location was amazing, it was so nice to be off of the island and away from all of the tours! The room overlooking the water was breathtaking, the renovation was beyond belief; extremely well done! The breakfast was pretty impressive too. The staff made us feel special from the moment we arrived in the water taxi to the moment we left -- a must stay if staying in Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 19, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotelâ€™s facilities. It is a pleasure to read that you appreciated the location as well. The Hilton Molino Stucky is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, which is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. The Hilton Molino Stucky is an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important pieces of the XIX century industrial architecture in Italy and we are happy that you loved it the way we do. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you appreciated our Staff and hospitality. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.
