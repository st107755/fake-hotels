We stayed at Hilton Molino Stucky and in regards to hotels it was the highlight at the end of our trip. It is in the Giudeca island of Venice and the hotel provides a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes to St. Mark's square so it very very convenient. It was nice to get away at night back to our private beautiful hotel away from the noisy streets of Venice. The views are amazing!  Venice overall was a wonderful experience and a beautiful city to visit!Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
