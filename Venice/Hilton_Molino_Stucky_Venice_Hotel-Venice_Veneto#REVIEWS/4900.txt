Nothing can go wrong at hilton Molino Stucky. Be it a room, service, food or staff. We stayed for 2 night in Hilton Molino Stucky and Hilton quality made it sure that we get the best of Venice. Free Shuttle to the main tourist locations makes you feel that you are not far from them and yet you get to Venice with no crowd around. Staff is again a prime difference between hilton and Other hotels. Food, Room, Flexibility to provide the guest satisfaction makes this hilton a perfect choice to be in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
