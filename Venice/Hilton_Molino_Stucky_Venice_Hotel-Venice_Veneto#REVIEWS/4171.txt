Spent 3 nights here and LOVED it.  Great staff.  Hilton Gold member and was upgraded to a room with a view looking out at Venice.  Rooftop pool had an amazing view.  Also loved the executive lounge, free food all day and a happy hour for 2 hours each day.  Shuttle took us back and forth to Venice, often enough not to be a big issue.  Also, great restaurants on the island, so we stuck close to the hotel most nights.  Great time!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 17, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
