Nice hotel and friendly staff. Room for a family suit is small.  And if you are not an executive member there is no water in the room.  Well there is in the mini bar and that is over priced.  I do not know when water became a luxury in hotel rooms.  And I have stayed at some of the best hotels and there is always water.  Next the boats to travel too and from the hotel.  Well if it’s busy and you have been waiting a while and the boat is full the guys on the boat just say next boat in either 30, 45, or 1 hour. It is a real pain having to wait round for these boats. Don’t think it’s all part of the fun as it’s not !!!!!  If you are looking to book a hotel book one that you do not require a boat to get the the main areas..

We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and Guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. Besides our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
