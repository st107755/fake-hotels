We booked a premium double with a view, it was expensive but we felt the location and the view were going to make our stay. We liked the location, it is on an island but allowed some peace from the hustle and bus of Venice. Room was small, it had been renovated. It seemed like someone had spent lots of money on decorating the inside of the cupboard to replicate the outside of the building however no bath robes and scant on  toiletries. Also there are no electricity sockets by the beds I had to charge my phone on the floor.... just a bit annoying. We expected a proper view it was more of a ‘stick your head out the window to see the water’ type of view which was disappointing. Breakfast was lovely.
