The Molino Stucky is the perfect base for Venice, free shuttle boat to and from hotel to St Marks Square and a boat to airport every hour. Fantastic views across to the city of Venice and from the roof top pool and bar watch the cruise liners pass by. Restaurants in the hotel are on the expensive side.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
