This is also a review of Hilton Reservations, the hotel was very nice and deserves four stars, Hilton reservations promised a free nights stay until I arrived, the room charge changed to $365.00.   Hilton reservations made the error, Hilton representatives admitted it yet no accommodation.  The hotel is very nice, rooms are modern with nice amenities, the staff is polite, friendly and competant.  It is not easy to get to the main attractions of Venice, a water taxi is necessary, they provide one but location is poor compared to many areas on the main island where we have stayed prior.  Stay here if visiting Venice is secondary to a nice hotel stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 17, 2015Dear  Guest, We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we thank you for taking the time to leave your review.
