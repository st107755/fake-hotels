Stayed here with my wife 5 days for a convention. The hotel is beautiful and has well appointed rooms. However, don't expect housekeeping to make up your room before 3 PM, if you're lucky. Since we were there on business, we occasionally had to have private meetings in our rooms. Although we called more than once to have rooms made up early, it never happened on a timely basis. We were told that housekeeping didn't start until 9:30AM. One day they showed up at 12:00 PM; another day at 11. Other members of our party didn't get service until 3 PM and another not until 4:45. Since they were changing to go out, they asked them to come back in 15 minutes but were told that they go off at 5. Internet service was extremely slow and costly, unless you are a Gold Hilton Honors member.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
