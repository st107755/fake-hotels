My wife and I stayed at this hotel from Aug 15 till Aug 19, 2016 I would like to say we really had a bad experience. I am still in the hotel and can't wait to get out of here tomorrow morning. Room 547  Beautiful hotel, great lobby, boat service all the things you expect from a 5 star hotel but here comes the serious issues:  1. Check in is handled by a bunch of young staff with no smile, no welcome and rude as hell. 2. Room was nice and breakfast buffets are good for 19 Euros per person.  3. At the end of the 2nd day it rained in Venice and the entire hotel lobby corridor to elevator 3 started to leak. I mean there was water pouring down the roof inside the hotel lobby. The staff scrambled to put towels on the floor as the marble floors would make everyone fall to the ground.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Sir, I am sorry you feel this way and hope you are feeling better.
