This hotel is a restored sugar mill and is gorgeous and historic.  The staff is amazing.  It is located in the Grand Canal across the canal from the main square.  There is a free water shuttle that takes you back and forth every few minutes.  Truly an amazing experience.Read moreDate of stay: March 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 19, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
