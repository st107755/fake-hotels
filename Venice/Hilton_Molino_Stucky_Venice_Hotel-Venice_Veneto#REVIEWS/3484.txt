Our large suite at the Molino Stucky provided a wonderfully relaxed respite at the end of each day.  The staff was courteous and helpful in all matters. The views of the Grand Canal at sunset from the rooftop pool were extraordinary and our restaurant experience on the terrace was a delightful tribute to classic Italian cooking with superb service.  Venice was a fitting finale for our two-week visit to Italy and the Hilton made it perfect!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
