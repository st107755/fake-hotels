Wonderful room. Great staff at check in and concierge. Easy ferry to see the sites - frequent schedule, fast, easy on/off, great locations.   Breakfast was excellent. However avoid the executive lounge as it is very poorly set up and between the staff and the guests it is totally jammed up even when there is almost no one there.   Also terrible signage - they have not updated signs in elevator in where things are. Lack of attention to detail. And the hotel map at check in is useless, could benefit from a real graphic designer not just thrown together.   Lastly, beware if you booked via Hilton.com as the US systems and international systems don't connect 100%. Didn't have that I booked on points and tried to charge full room rate. Easily resolved, but who wants to deal with thatâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 3, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
