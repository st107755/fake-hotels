The arrival to the hotel was a fun experience.  Taking the water taxi is the easiest, but will set you back 50 Euro.  The hotel is a very nice property.  The staff, for the most part, was not so great. The door men were very pleasant, but the desk people and the "Executive Lounge Host" were a different story. I paid for a premium room with a view.  I am also a Diamond member which I hoped would guarantee my request.  So,  I was told I was upgraded to a "Suite with a wonderful view".  I was happy to hear that everything was going as expected.  I have read, in previous posts, to be careful about the view because their idea of a view may be different than yours.  So we get into our room to be accosted with a terrible view!  I would prefer no window at all.  Please see attachedâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
