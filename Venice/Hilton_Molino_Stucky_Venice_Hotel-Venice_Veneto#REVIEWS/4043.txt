We stayed here on a family vacation last summer to start off our tour of Italy.  What a great way to start off the trip! The hotel was absolutely beautiful. The hotel was modern and very spacious. The employees were very kind and took care of all of our needs. The biggest perk was the free transportation to and from the hotel via the water taxi. Definitely take advantage of it throughout your stay. Time permitting, make sure to try and catch the sun setting from the rooftop pool. Stunning view of almost all of Venice! Couldn't be happier with this hotel!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice with your family last summer was satisfactory.
