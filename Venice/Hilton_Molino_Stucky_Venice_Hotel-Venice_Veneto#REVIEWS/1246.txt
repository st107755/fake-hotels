Excellent choice for hotel stay.  Better food can be found in the city but not terrible.  Breakfast in the executive lounge is decent.  Rooms are very clean and comfortable.  Location is not too bad.  Only a couple stops to the popular parts of the island on the commercial boats.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 5, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
