Hotel was definitely the right choice. Lovely surroundings staff very helpful room a deluxe so extra space well worth the cost.  It is also worth knowing the hotel provides water boats to & from the square throughout the day & night at no cost.  Restaurant Aroma very nice but pricey worth a visit for a special occasion.  They will also arrange water taxi to Murano factory free. Make a visit to Burano village a sight to see beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
