We recently stayed in this hotel while traveling in Italy.  The hotel is a water taxi ride from St. Mark's Square but the hotel provides a free shuttle throughout the day.  The rooms are beautiful and large.  The bathrooms are also very comfortable, with both a shower and a tub.  We had two adjoining rooms with a view of an inner courtyard rather than the lagoon view I had requested, but our stay was lovely nonetheless.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
