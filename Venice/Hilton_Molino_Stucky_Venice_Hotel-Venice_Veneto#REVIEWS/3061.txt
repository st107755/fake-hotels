New, modern hotel in an historic property. Large rooms.  Having to wait for a boat to get to Venice proper and back is a little inconvenient, but it's also likely a lot quieter here than other places right in the heart of Venice.   Staff was very helpful and friendly.   Restaurants were good. Bars were nice. Lovely artwork and architecture.   I'd stay here again if (when) I come back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 7, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
