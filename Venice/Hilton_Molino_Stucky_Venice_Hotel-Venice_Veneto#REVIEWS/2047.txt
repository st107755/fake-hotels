On arrival at the hotel we were kindly greeted by the staff and they checked us in immediately. As the room wasn't quite ready (it was only 1 pm) the lady offered us a key to the executive lounge, where we could have something to eat and drink while waiting. Our room had a view over the canal - which was so lovely! We could keep staring at all the boats passing by. We took breakfast in the executive lounge, where the staff was very friendly and attentive.  Another pleasing feature was the rooftop pool, from where you had a great panorama over Venice.  There is nothing to complain about. When I should return to Venice, I'll certainly stay at the Hilton at Giudecca Island.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
