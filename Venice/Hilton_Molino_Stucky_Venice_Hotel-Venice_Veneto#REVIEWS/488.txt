This hotel was very nice and worth the money you spent. The room was furbished with nice furniture and the bed was very comfortable. It was separated from the main Venice island but the hotel provided a shuttle boat running on schedule. There are all facilities a 5 star should have in it. We stayed for 2 nights and felt it was very worth the money we spent. Staff and doormen were all very friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 2, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
