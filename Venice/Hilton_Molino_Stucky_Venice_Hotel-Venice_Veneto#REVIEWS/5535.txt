I arrived for 3 nights with my husband, exhausted and hungry. I purchased this stay with Hotwire and upon arrival at 8pm the check-in attendant (who was a snobby, almost rude man) gave us a room with 2 twin beds. I asked if it is possible to get one bed and he said "No you booked with Hotwire at a low rate (165.00/night) so it is such a cheap price so that is the room you get"  The beds were small and my husband, being 6 feet tall did not fit on it, so as he slept, I got up at 5am and went down to reception and talked to a woman who after speaking wsith the manager, switched rooms for me and got a bellhop to transfer our things.  The other room was MUCH BETTER although dusty, with a big bed and nice decor, and a little view too. All in all, it was not my favorite hote in Italyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
