Beautiful hotel located in a quiet and peaceful part of venice- The executive lounge had great selection of drinks and coffee along with snacks, including breakfast in the mornings. The staff is extremely attentive to all needs. The roof top pool was really neat, giving you the whole of venice. Great selection of restaurants on the island also. It was very hard to leave this hotel!
