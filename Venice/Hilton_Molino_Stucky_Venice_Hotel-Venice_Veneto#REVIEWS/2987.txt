Rooms are very nice, building is old but very good spaciously used for the hotel. Restaurant and food is great, nothing to say here, really Hilton quality, nice pool on the top. They have shutle boat wich drives every 45 min to the center of Venice because the hotel is on Island across the main island. Staff is okay, except some mistakes they've made with our group and some extra services, they were too easy going, so this hotel does not deserve full 5*review.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 4, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your business stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
