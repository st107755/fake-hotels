We stayed here as part of a Disney tour of Italy. This hotel is GINORMOUS because of its history as a mill. Itâ€™s beautiful. The rooms are very nicely decorated and we had a great view of the main island. The ferry service was prompt. The rooftop pool provides incredible views of Venice and the food was very good. Some of the adults got together in the courtyard to drink some wine we purchased outside of the hotel, and we were provided with corkscrews, glasses, and buckets of ice from the very friendly bar staff. I had an issue with my departing flight and the front desk did everything possible to help me. We do plan to return to Venice and will stay here again!
