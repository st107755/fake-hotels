We LOVED this hotel.  We had an amazing room, KING EXECUTIVE COMFORTABLE WITH A VIEW OF VENICE.  2 of the 3 nights we didn't go out but just sat up by the window and watched all the non stop activity on the waterway.  Had we booked a basic room, I think we would of been disappointed.  The room was large, the bed very comfortable.  I found the staff very friendly.  We loved Massimo, the ferry man.  The roof top pool is very cool.  Loved the lounge chairs.  The only negative is there aren't many of them.  It was very easy to get to from the train station (one of the public water buses that take you to Zaterre and the HIlton ferry picks you up from there) and to the airport (an hour and a half boat ride for 18 euro).Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
