The hotel stucky is wonderful .our twin room was perfect with an inward view of the gorgeous court garden . bathroom huge with bath and separate shower. the staff were so kind and helpful ,nothing too much trouble .the restaurant we went to for dinner was awesome ,steak out of this world .breakfast was a buffet with all sorts of delicious foods.my spa experience was heaven ,one half day felt like a relaxing week in there being pampered. the Hilton shuttle to St marks was fantastic and made it easier to find everywhere. the masked ball was cancelled but we didn't care because the skyline rooftop bar made up for it.what a place this Hilton is ,its like stepping out of life into unbound luxury but feeling recharged to step back home .Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 12, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
