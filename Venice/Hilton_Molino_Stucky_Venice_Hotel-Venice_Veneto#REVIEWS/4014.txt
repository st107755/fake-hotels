What a wonderful hotel. Very clean with great friendly and polite staff. Coffee little pricey but who cares you are in Venice drink that cappuccino or wine and you will be alright. Loved the scenery every time we used the free boat service to Zattere and San Marco. Definitely coming back.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  thank you very much for your excellent feedback on TripAdvisor.
