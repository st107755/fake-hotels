My wife and I stayed on our honeymoon trip.  The hotel is a (free) shuttle ride from Drosodoro & St. Mark's - the shuttle only leaves once an hour from the hotel so generally, all your plans will be somewhat dependent on figuring out which shuttles to take.  They are very timely and reliable.  Rooms --  The rooms are the smallest that I experienced during our entire 15 day stay in Italy.  We had an "Executive View" room.  Staff -- The staff is helpful and courteous.  Location --  Requires a shuttle ride to go anywhere (it is a short ride, but only runs once an hour, and there is a "break" from 8:30pm to 10:30pm or so in both directions.  Last shuttle is at 12:30am or so.  So you have to very carefully plan your days and nights unless you want to take a very expensive watertaxi. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
