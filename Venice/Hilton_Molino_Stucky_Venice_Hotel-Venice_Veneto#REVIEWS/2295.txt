Took a executive room but neither size of room nor window made sense. Too small, too dark. Executive lounge is not at level to Hilton standards , Internet included in hhonors is not usable , you have to pay. Shuttle is insufficient in frequency and size so you wait 40 min ! Staff is nice but understaffed.
