I would have rated the hotel a 3.5 but this option wasn't available. Overall, the hotel and rooms were very good. The location is good but not great if you want to be in the thick of Venice. That being said, the hotel's pool area was closed and the air conditioning was broken. Check In and out services were way too small for the number of rooms in this hotel. The lack of these services does not justify the claim of being a luxury hotel. Finally, I think the restaurant prices were high enough without having to add a charge of 3 euros a person for the tablecloth on the table. For these noted reasons, the hotel does not merit a 4 star designation.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
