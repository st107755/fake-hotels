We are Hiton Honors and the stay was a good example of Hilton service.  The boat service to main attractions was reliable and free.  We were very comfortable except for the limiting and slow Internet service. Food was acceptable and room was large and very comfortable.  We will stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
