The hotel was wonderful!  Superb location and excellent attention to detail by all the staff. Would definitely love to stay there again. Only comment would be if the hotel had a shuttle from the train station to the hotel so as to avoid having to use public transit.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
