We stayed here last march for five nights it is a superb location, The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the staff were freindley and efficient. the hotel is acroos the waterway from the main island and the hotel has a shutle boat that takes aprox 5 to 10 mins to get across but it is well worth staying here as it can get very busy on the main island and by staying here you can come back to some where that is a bit more quiet.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 5, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
