Excellent stay, we were on points and got fantastic service.  hotel is on Guidecca Island but they have a shuttle to and from Zattere and San Marco all day.  Guidecca is a wonderful residential island with several very good family restaurants.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
