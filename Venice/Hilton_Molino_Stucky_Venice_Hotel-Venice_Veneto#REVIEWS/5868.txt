I recently had the pleasure of staying at the molino Stucky for 2 nights with my family. we had a Grand Canal facing suite on the top floor ( executive floor). and wow what a hotel. the rooms are beautifully decorated, the view was divine and the pool which is situated on the very top of the hotel was absolutely stunning. the Executive floor clients have access to an exec lounge/dining room which offers free drinks and snacks until 23h00 every day which was perfect. although the hotel is not situated on the mainland it is a short complimentary ferry ride across the canal to St Marks square. All in all if you want to treat yourself , I can highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
