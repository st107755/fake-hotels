Really great hotel. Nice big rooms, very clean with all the amenities you would expect. Brilliant selection at breakfast. All staff very friendly and really helpful. The only problem was the amount of conferences being held in the hotel as the lounge areas were very busy with delegates and the rooftop bar was closed to other residents on one occasion. After saying that would still return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 22, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
