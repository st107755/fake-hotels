We stayed at the Hilton in May.  Though the hotel is on the island of Guidecca we actually preferred this than in Venice proper.  They have a nice executive lounge for those at the upper levels of the Honors program and a breakfast buffet is included for Diamond members.   The Alalungia boat shuttle from the airport drops you off directly in front of the hotel.  No need to drag your suitcases thru town.   The hotel shuttle (for a fee) brings you to and from St Mark's on a posted schedule.   The ACTV boat service has stops a short distance (3-5 minute walk) from the hotel.  The ACTV service will take you to and from the train station and out to Murano, Lido and Burano.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
