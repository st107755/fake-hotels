I stayed here for 5 days and was truly pleased with my stay, the hotel is excellent and the staff really go out of their way to help you, the Hotel is far from the normal tourist haunts but has its own water bus that runs every half hour to St Marco, there is also a Vappretto stop (Palanca) within 5 mins walk.  All in all i cannot rate this highly enough and would recommend this hotel to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 6, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
