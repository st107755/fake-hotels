I always try to stay at a Hilton hotel when traveling. I have to say that the Molino Stucky was a great choice. Yes, it's away from the tourist areas and you will have to catch the water shuttle, which doesn't always run on schedule. However, I really enjoyed being away from the crowds at the end of the day. More importantly, the roof top bar and pool have the absolute best view in all of Venice. The hotel is very large and layed out in a crazy pattern. You can get lost easily, but it was neat seeing how the old mill had been converted to a hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
