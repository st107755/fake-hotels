Stayed over carnival weekend. Very nice, clean hotel and customer service was excellent. Free shuttle service made life so much easier as it dropped you right outside the hotel, unlike many others where you had to walk to with cases in tow once you got off the public boats. Breakfast was excellent with soooo much choice. Not cheap but as with everything 'you get what you pay for' and was not overly expensive when you compared it to other hotels.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
