The food was outstanding at the hotel restaurants.  Better to at hotel  than anywhere else. The is breathtaking is better to stay there than in the crowded San Marco venice because you can cross over to San Marco in a water taxi free from the hotel in less than 10 minutes. The rooms are big clean and the airconditioner works. There is a laundry 3 blocks away from the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2018Dear Madame, We appreciate the time you took to post your kind comments about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
