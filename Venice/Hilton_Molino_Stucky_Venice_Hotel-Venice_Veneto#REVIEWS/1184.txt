Stayed here for 3 nights...our first leg after arriving in Europe for our 17 day tour...  The hotel is clean, nice rooms, pleasant and helpful staff.  Fitness facility was ok...at least they had one.  Nice water taxi service from our "island" to main Venice.  The Rooftop Pool and Bar were Superb!!  Great views up there too!  Would definitely stay here upon returning to Venice!Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments.
