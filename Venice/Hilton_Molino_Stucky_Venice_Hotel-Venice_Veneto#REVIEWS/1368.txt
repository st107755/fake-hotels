I'm a Hilton Diamond member and this hotel is way better than those Hilton hotels in the United States and inline with the Hilton hotel in Shanghai(I'm from Shanghai). The breakfast buffet is really good , I had many different choices and it's free for us so it's really good. The executive lounge is in the lobby and you can walk in any time with the key card. The only problem that I only give out 4 of 5 is because of the location, it's not good at all, you have to travel with a boat to any place other than the hotel itself....And I get dizzy every time...  位置不好，其他还不错。。。晕船的千万千万千万别住这家，我不晕船都晕了。。而且浪费时间。。。Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 15, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments and feedback on the hotel’s facilities. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you appreciated our services and hospitality. It is a pity that you were not happy with the location of the hotel on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, only a few minutes boat ride from the crowded city centre which is especially appreciated by Guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. We look forward to welcoming you again soon in Venice. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
