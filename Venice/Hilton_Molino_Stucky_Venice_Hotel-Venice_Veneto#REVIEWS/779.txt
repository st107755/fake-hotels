We stayed in Venice on a split trip, and on our return for our final night, all the staff we interacted with remembered us.  Special mention to Anna from the front desk who helped us with everything we needed.  The dinner at the Aromi resturant had some great Lamb and the Duck with plum sauce was very good as well as the avocado suprise.   I am very sorry I do not remember the names of each staff member but everyone was great.  Thankyou.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 27, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
