The Hilton rarely fails to deliver and this was no exception! The location was perfect, 5 minutes from the hectic tourist trail of Venice centre.  Service was excellent as was the food. The sky bar was extremely expensive, a brandy and coke and a cocktail came to aprox Â£50!! The view alone was worth one or two tho!! Definitly recommend this hotel to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you very much for writing about us on TripAdvisor.
