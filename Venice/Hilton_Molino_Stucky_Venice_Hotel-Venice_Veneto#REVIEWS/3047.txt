This Hilton is in a converted mill on Giudecca Island across from principal islands that make up Venice. The hotel water shuttle was right out the front door and only  takes 5 or 10 minutes or so to go to San Marco (St. Mark) square. (All travel in Venice is by boat of some sort)  The guest rooms are very well appointed and good size. Front desk staff are friendly and efficient. Housekeeping was very accommodating throughout our 5 night stay. The breakfast buffet was very good and opened at 7:00. Early risers could find coffee and modest treats in the lobby starting around 4 a.m.   My wife and I truly enjoyed the location of the hotel. In addition to the hotel shuttle, the very popular water bus was only a short walk from the hotel. Also, water taxis could be easily summoned. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 13, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
