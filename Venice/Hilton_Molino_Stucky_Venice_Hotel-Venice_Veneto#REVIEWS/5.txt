Stayed here with my wife to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. Four nights in the hotel in September. Have been to Venice a few times before and wanted to stay somewhere with a pool.  Hotel beat our expectations. Upgraded room on arrival and a bottle of Prosecco given to us to celebrate our anniversary. Room was very good and we both enjoyed the swimming pool which we had booked before our stay.  Resting in the sunshine, a swim and a drink was great after being out and before going out for dinner in the evening. We ate at several of the restaurants on Giudecca and had great food at all of them. Canâ€™t wait to plan our next trip back and will stay again at the Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: September 2020HelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded 5 weeks agoDear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
