Although I do want to give a fair feedback, we were upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise and might be taken into account while reading this.  Property is vaste, staff is friendly and helpful.  Suite room was big, something like 60 mÂ². Hotel is calm, bed is fine, so a very good rest. Furniture was not new and might soon need a replacement. The pool I on the roof = great view = very hot (probaly too much) water at the end of the afternoon.  Hotel has its own shuttle to go to san marco and vaporetto stop is 5 minutes walk to the hotel. From there, you can go to main island or to tronchetto parking (one or two stops.  A very pleasant stay overall, a refreshing oasis in the hot august weather.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 22, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
