 Venice is just one of those cities on everyone's Bucket List, and when you go there is no better place to stay than The Hilton Molino.  We arrived by water taxi and were greeted by a very helpful and knowledgeable member of staff.  We stayed in one of the renovated executive rooms and it was finished to a very high standard.  The two highlights of the hotel have to be the roof top pool and the hotel's dedicated water taxi service to the main island.  Are we going back again, absolutely, there was no question in our minds that this is a great hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 25, 2019Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
