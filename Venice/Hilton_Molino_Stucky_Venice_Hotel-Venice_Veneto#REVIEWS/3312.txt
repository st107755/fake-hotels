Nice hotel a five minute complimentary boat ride to the sights of Venice. This means the hotel is nice and quiet at night and away from the main tourist areas. Nice rooms. Good breakfast. The hotel is an old flour mill very tasteful renovated.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 1, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
