Everything you would expect from a high-end hotel.  The Hilton was run very professionally with attentive, helpful staff.  Spoke English and communicated easily.  The Hilton is on a seperate island from the main island of Venice, but a quick ride via Hilton's complimentary water shuttle.   The hotel is massive, with several restauraunts, a spa and small workout facility.  We found the food to be decent at the restauraunts and thought the rooms were great.  It is a convention hotel as well, so the business center was nice and there were many people working while there.  The hotel offers a free water shuttle to the island of Murano which was a perk and it isn't the easiest or cheapest place to get to.  Overall, a very nice experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
