Although it's in Giudecca , the hotel provide free shuttle boat that make it easy to access to main attraction in Venice and can save money. ( the one way ticket for venice public boat is 7EUR !!!) I like Giudecca island because traveler can have the best veiw to see Venice, especially on the top of the hotel. You can enjoy the swimming pool and have a cocktail to see the beautiful view of Venice. The rooms are comfortable and you can find best price in Hilton official website.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 22, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, we are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.
