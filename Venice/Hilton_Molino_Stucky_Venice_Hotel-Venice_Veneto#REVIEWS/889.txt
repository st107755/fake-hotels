One of the best if not they best Hilton I have ever stayed at worldwide .  We stayed for Xmas and New Year and loved it  .  The staff was nothing short of extremely helpful to guide and arrange any trips or dinner arrangements needed and the nutella crepe bar combined with executive lounge keep us happy every minute.
