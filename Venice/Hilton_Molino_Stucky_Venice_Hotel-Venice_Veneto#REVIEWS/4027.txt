We have spent 2 nights in this wonderful hotel right in front of Giudecca canal. Closed by S. Marco square and the other beauty of Venice. Room is spacious and very well equipped. Breakfast gorgeous and very good. Restaurant is good as well. A great place to spend a weekend.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
