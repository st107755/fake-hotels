Large room, beautiful roof terrace with pool with a view to the lagoon. Good Service. The hotel is situated in La Guidecca which is a 15 Min boat ride from San Marco. So if you like to stay away from the masse but still easily acces the main attractions of Venice this hotel is ideal.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 6, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your nice review on this website.
