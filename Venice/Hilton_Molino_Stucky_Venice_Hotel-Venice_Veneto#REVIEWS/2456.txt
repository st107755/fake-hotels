Very nice hotel but it has the draw back that you have to take the water taxi to get to it. The hotel has its own taxi or you can take the public taxi, it's a pain not being able to just pop back to the hotel, you have to plan around taxi times.  Great roof top bar and where you get a great sunset. The rooms was very nice and it's a smart business hotel If I went back to Venice I would find a hotel more central which did require me to grab a water taxi to get to.  Venice is a wonderful place, you can see it all in a couple of days, make sure you visit Murano early in the day, the demonstrations will stop later in the day when tourist numbers slow down.
