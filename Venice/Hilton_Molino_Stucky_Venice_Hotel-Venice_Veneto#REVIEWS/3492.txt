I don't give 5/5 unless it is fully deserved. This is a wonderful older building which has been immaculately converted for hotel use. It's a short transfer to two local stops convenient for exploring the sights and the transfers were on time and reliable. The hotel service was good in every aspect we encountered. I was particularly happy to have been upgraded to a suite as We were travelling with our young baby. All in all an excellent option in Venice.
