This hotel almost did it for us but not quite.   We will stay somewhere else next time.   It has a great location with beautiful views overlooking Venice.   The roof bar and the pool really take advantage of this.  The room was in decent condition.  However, while the pool was gorgeous it was not heated and there were no / few sun loungers round it so you couldn't relax in the sun.      The problem for us was the smell.    The ground and first floor had a strong damp smell.   The reason we stayed here was to avoid the smells of Venice and this hotel was worse than the island!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your kind review on TripAdvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property and its location but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. With regards to the smell that you experienced unfortunately being Venice in a lagoon and also due to low tide, the odors can sometime be beyond control. I have discussed your comments at our Management Meeting and we are glad to inform you that we have a project to improve this in order to avoid the reoccurrence of experiences you have highlighted although we cannot change the fact that high and low tides are part of our city. We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
