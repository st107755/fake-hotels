The hotel is beautiful and my room was amazing however the customer service was hit or miss. When first arriving on a bank holiday weekend in Europe, there should have been at least four or more people maintaining the front desk for reception. There was one and i had to wait 20 minutes just to be serviced. The breakfast at the hotel was decent for a breakfast bar but I definitely would recommend going early as when it gets pack the service seems to start to go away. No one came to ask me if i wanted tea or coffee as i wanted to get an omelette made since this Hilton didn't have a station and I'm not sure if it was cause i was single but they seemed more accommodating to a family.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 23, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
