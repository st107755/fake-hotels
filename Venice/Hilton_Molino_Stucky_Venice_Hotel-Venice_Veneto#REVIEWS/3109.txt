As a Hilton Diamond member for many years I was happy to find one in Venice. The great thing about this hotel is it is on an island away from the main tourist section of Venice. A quick shuttle ride gets you to all the attractions and then you shuttle back to the island, far from the maddening crowd. The service was exceptional, breakfast was good.We had a beautiful canal view. The Executive Lounge was a bit disappointing. No view and a little claustrophobic. Also, the Skybar was closed for a private party the night we tried to go. Otherwise great stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 9, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on TripAdvisor.
