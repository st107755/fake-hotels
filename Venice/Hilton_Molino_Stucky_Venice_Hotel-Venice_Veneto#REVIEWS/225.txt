Fabulous location on Giudecca. May seem awkward not being on the main island but the hotel provides an excellent boat service for 8E for the entire duration of your stay which runs over to San Marco every 20 mins. It is well worth it for the ability to get away from the main hustle and bustle and relax over on the island. The pool and Roof top bar are fabulous locations to relax and look out over the city with an excellent range of beers, wines and cocktails. Have stayed here twice now and will certainly stay here again on future visits.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 31, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the kind review on TripAdvisor.
