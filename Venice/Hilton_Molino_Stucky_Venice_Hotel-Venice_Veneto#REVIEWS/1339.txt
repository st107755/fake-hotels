We are glad to see that you mentioned some positive impressions but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. We regret that you have not enjoyed the hotel's location on the Giudecca island as our Guests usually are very happy to come back at night in this relaxing atmosphere, away from the city centre crowded area. I would like to confirm that, besides our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
