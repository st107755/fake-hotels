We booked this Hilton knowing that it wasnâ€™t on the main part of Venice.  They have a 15 minute shuttle that runs to and from the hotel to the main square. The staff was amazing and helpful.  We also went to one of their restaurants and had a fabulous meal.  The downfall is that the hotel is pretty isolated, and only has a rooftop bar, and a couple of restaurants.  The shuttle does make it easier to get around tho.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 7, 2018Dear Madame, Thank you for posting your kind review on TripAdvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property and it was very kind of you to mention our helpful Team Members for which we pride ourselves. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island; it is in fact true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for staying with us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
