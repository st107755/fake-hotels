I loved this hotel. It was off of the main island so you were away from the craziness. The rooms were great. We had a suite with a room and a separate living room. If you are a hilton honors diamond member, it is nice because there is free breakfast, snacks and dinner offerings.  The hotel has a free water taxi to the main part of venice, but it is easy to catch the water taxis from the hotel also. Service was greatRead moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare
