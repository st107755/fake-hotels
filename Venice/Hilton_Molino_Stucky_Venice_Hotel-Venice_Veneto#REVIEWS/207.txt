Alexia, supervisor at registration desk for check in, provided horrible service to my family and over the phone to me. I had reserved an executive suite for 3 adults and 2 children (8 years and 1r years) and diamond desk confirmed that I did NOT need to reserve 2 rooms. Diamond desk even called the Vemice Hilton Molino and agreed that we all can stay in 1 Executive Suite room, but Alexia was very rude and denied our requets for 1 room and forced me to buy another room.
