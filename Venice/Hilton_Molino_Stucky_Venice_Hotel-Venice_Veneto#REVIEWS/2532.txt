They pool is closed for the season, there is no AC for the season and the only food available is at the hotel reasturant where you get a cover change for going to the only dinning option. The rooms are falling apart (there are holes in the furniture,  stains in the carpet) to start with. The people who work here are some of the rudest I have every meant. The spa is incomplete, either you have one or not, having something thrown together and calling it a spa is unfair for any clientel. If you are trying to have any kind of romantic experience, stay on the main island, there at least you have a dining option worth paying for.
