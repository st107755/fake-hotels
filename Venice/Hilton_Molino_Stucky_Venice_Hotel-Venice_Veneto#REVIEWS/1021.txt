3rd time at this magnificent hotel. Came mainly for the Art Biennale, taking place in Venice. Got a room with view to Giudecca Canal (highly recommended).  Most convenient transport to the two main Biennale sites including hotel free shuttle. Great lounge service and most efficient concierge services headed by great Carlos. We'll come back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 4, 2017Dear Sir, thank you very much for your kind review and for visiting us again this year during Biennale Art Exhibition.
