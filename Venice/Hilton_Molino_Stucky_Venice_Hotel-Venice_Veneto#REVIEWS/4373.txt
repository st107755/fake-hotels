We stayed two nights in the Hotel Stucky July 10-12, 2013. We paid a little extra for a room with a canal view and it was well worth the extra amount. The view from our room was better than the view from the pool on the roof which was also quite spectacular.  The room was clean with two different views, one of the canal and one of the courtyard.  Room 410 if you can get it. Tall ceilings, big room, great bathroom and plenty of storage.  The boat shuttle over to Zettere or San Marcos ran on time every day. My only complaint with the boat was that they take a break between 8:45 pm and 9:45 pm each day which is prime time to return from Venice to your hotel, and 1 night it started to pour and we were stuck until the boat arrived or pay 60 Euro ($90) for a 5 minute water taxi ride.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 19, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
