We stayed here one night on our way back from a cruise. We had to wait to get into our room but they had a very secure area to keep our luggage and we could use the pool while we waited. There was not much within walking distance of the hotel but they provided free shuttle service to get across the canal where there was an abundance of shopping and dining. There were also several restaurants within the hotel that were very good.  The staff was nice and very accommodating. I had injured my ankle on our trip and they brought me some ice while we were waiting by the pool.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
