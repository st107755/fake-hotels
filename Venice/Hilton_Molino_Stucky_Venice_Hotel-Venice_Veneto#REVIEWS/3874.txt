i had the worst experience with them, i was staying for one night. the room size is very small. the AC was not working after making a complain they told me to open the window !!! well this is not one star hotel considering the night club next to my window ! after requesting them to change the room they have informed me that the hotel is fully booked, so i spent the whole night awake.. i will think a lot before going there again!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
