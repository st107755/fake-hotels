The best air conditioning found while in Italy in August. It is in avery beautiful location; however you must take the water taxi over which the Hilton has that can take you to San Marco. Also a short walk but a little bit of a pain if you have a lot of luggae there is a water taxi service that can take you to the train station and any points you may need.  The Skyline bar on the roof is a great view. It is very calming to come back in the night by water taxi after being in the crowds in Venice and seeing the lights of the hotel. The staff is very helpful. The Wifi has something to be desired as it does not work in the rooms, better in the main area, and the hard wire in the room I had allot of droped connections while trying to to get out emails.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
