First time that I had bid on priceline but paid £119 for a £240 hotel room.  The hotel is on Guidecca which made a pleasant change from the tourist hotspots of St.Marks where we have stayed 3 times before.  The hotel has a shuttle boat. Hotel big, rooms very nicely furnished with plenty of room but expensive to eat and drink there.  Fantastic views over venice from the rooftop pool and bar.  Not to be missed.Read moreDate of stay: August 2008HelpfulShare
