We paid 140 euro (exclude breakfast) for one night we stayed in Hilton Molino and we thought it was quite a good value for five star hotel in Venice. The rooms are clean and spacious by Hilton standards.  The downside is that there's no free wifi (9 euro per day) and the hotel shuttle starts a bit late at 9 in the morning (from November till March). Otherwise, the staff are friendly and the hotel itself is beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Molino Stucky Hilton Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
