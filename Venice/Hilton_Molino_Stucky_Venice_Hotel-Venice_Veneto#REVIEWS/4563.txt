We returned to Venice after 9 years and I really wanted to stay somewhere nice - well this certainly lived up to my expectations. We loved the Hotel and were fortunate enough to have a Grand Canal view. Being on Giudecca was a bonus for less noise and great local bars and feel with the shuttle boat making the more touristy areas very accessible. Loved the private boat to Murano wonderful bonus. Breakfast was busy with a conference on at the time but no problems. Beds were so comfortable and rooms large. Pool area was closed which was the only disappointment. Bit of an ordeal to get their with the Blue Line available but takes almost 2hrs. Would recommend saving for water taxis each way about $110 euros . Had a wonderful stay!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
