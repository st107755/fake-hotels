The Hilton Molino Stucky is beautiful, inside and out.  The transformation from flour mill to hotel is fantastic.  No detail is overlooked, from the travertine floors throughout the hotel to the retention beams which bring nostalgic history into the modern decor.  Everything about the Hilton Molino Stucky is first class, from the bellman to housekeeping. The Executive Lounge is perfectly located so you can enjoy a beverage or snack and never loose sight of the beauty of Venice. The roof top bar is a great area mingle, and the view of the canal from the 8 floor is stunning.  For me the added bonus was seeing the full moon on the 16 rising over the water.  My suite #365 was everything I expected and more.  I tip my hat to the Hilton Molino Stucky, and promise to return soon.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
