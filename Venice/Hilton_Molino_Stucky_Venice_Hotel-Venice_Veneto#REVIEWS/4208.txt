We stayed at this hotel as part of a large convention held in the City. Without doubt the hotel provided some of the best service considering the scale of such an event. Initially the layout is a little confusing, however it is soon possible to find your way around. Food was excellent with a very good choice at breakfast. The spa area, including swimming pool on the roof is spectacular and just worth going up there to see the view!! Rooms large and well appointed. Easy access to the main City via the hotel's private and free motor launch.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
