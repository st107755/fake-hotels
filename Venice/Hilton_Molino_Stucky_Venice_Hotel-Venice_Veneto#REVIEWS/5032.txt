What a shame....a great location and a few nice staff...however the service is extremely poor and the attitude of most of the staff is not good...the feeling that 'everything seems complicated comes to mind'  Rooms ok but porters are clueless and if it rains...good luck getting one of them to come outside to help...  Even the water taxi commented that this hotel makes sooo many mistakes!  In fact they should rename the hotel 'Hilton Hotel by Mistakes'  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 2, 2012Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.
