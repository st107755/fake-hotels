Location: The hotel is on the Giradella island, which is a bit unhandy, but not a big problem. The hotel has a shuttle, there is the water bus + you can always take a water taxi. (We took a water taxi to the airport - 120 Euro, 30 minutes). They pick you up just outside the hotel, drive through the canals and deliver you at the airport. Nice!  Rooms: We had a family suite, which was great. Nice and spacious, a great bathroom and a seperate wc in addition. There even was a small kitchen. The sofa bed could have been better...  Rooftop: Nice bar and pool with a wonderful view. The pool area is small, but nice. The prices are on the other hand crazy! 8 Euro for a small coke (it was mostly ice...) and 15 Euro for a glas of prosecco. Put the prices down, walk around to take ordersâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
