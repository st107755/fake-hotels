This hotel is spacious and seems fairly new. It was clean. The staff in the restaurant weren't personable, and the meals were overpriced - paid over $100.00 for two cocktails, one pasta (no meat) entree, and an uninspiring appetizer. If it wasn't for the overpriced meal with the smug service, my review would have been five stars....you do have to take a water bus to Venice, it is not actually on the island of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 22, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for your comments on TripAdvisor.
