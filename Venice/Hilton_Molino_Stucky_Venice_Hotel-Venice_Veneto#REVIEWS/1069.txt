3 nights at this hotel and paying over $500 AU per night, I thought a little attention would be nice and even a turn down of an evening.  I could see the staff kissing the buts of the club guest )been there in the past), the rest are nothing.  Mould in the shower, old door hardware Needs attention.  Location is a pain as you deleting the hotel shuttle, again they say it's free but still charge you 6 euros per person for the stay. And to top it off you are charged 3 euros per person for eating in the restaurant even when you are sleeping there. I guess wouldn't have minded the charge if the food was good, but it was not.  Great nibbles with any drink you had, that was good.
