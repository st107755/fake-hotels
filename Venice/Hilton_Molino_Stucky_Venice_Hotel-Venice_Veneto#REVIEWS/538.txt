Third time to Venice but first time staying in Venice accommodation. Our stay at the Hilton was an extravagance, and a wonderful experience. Most expensive accommodation we’ve ever booked.   The service was excellent and reflecting in our stay there whilst it didn’t seem great value for money the stand out was the staff. In our 2 days we would interacted with some 30 staff from porters, check in, breakfast, bar, pool, day spa and more. And every single one of them have excellent service.   The location itself was great, minutes to the main hum of Venice tourist attractions but in a far more peaceful setting. With no shortage of good restaurants in easy walking distance.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 27, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
