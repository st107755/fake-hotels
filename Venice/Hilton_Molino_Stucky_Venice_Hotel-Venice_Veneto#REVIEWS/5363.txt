Not to be too dramatic but I felt like I had died and gone to heaven when I arrived at this hotel. It was so beautiful. My favorite thing about the hotel was the views! View from my hotel room, view from the restaurant windows, and view from the pool. I had spent the first half of my trip at a local hotel in the main area of Venice and although it was also a great experience, the Stucky made me never want to leave. If you want to go all out in Venice, do it right and stay at this property.  Only negative (and who really cares, just letting you know) is that wifi gets really spotty after the third floor in the main tower, most people were using their tablets and phones in the lobby or breakfast area. So if internet connection is your thing, keep this in mind.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
