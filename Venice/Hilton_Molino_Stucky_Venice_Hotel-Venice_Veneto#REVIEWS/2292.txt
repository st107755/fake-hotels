We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. While it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. I also regret that you did not find our shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs and I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that besides our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12 minutes. Thank you for your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in the future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
