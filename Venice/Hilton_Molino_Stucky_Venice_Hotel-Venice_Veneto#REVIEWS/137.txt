Though it may seem that this Hilton is not conveniently located, it truly is very accessible! The hotel is beautiful, the accommodations superb, and they make Venice island easily accessed by their own shuttle boat. After a busy day of sightseeing, the quiet location was most welcome. Their attention to guest comfort makes this a stay that enhances a visit to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 10, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor, we are really happy to know that you have enjoyed your stay with us and that you loved the location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
