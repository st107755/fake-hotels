This is just a Fantastic Hotel. A real treat if you want to stay somewhere you'll never forget. That's my experience anyway. This hotel is first class all the way, right down to the rooftop swimming pool. It's a converted flour mill and Hilton's have spared no expense in refurbishing every square foot. The hotel off the main island with easy access by Hilton Shuttle Service, a delight to come home in the evening and relax away from the crowd. The island also has a number of traditional Italian restaurants with superb food. Have breakfast at the Hilton if you can, it's brilliant.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel.
