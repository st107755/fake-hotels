This is a first class hotel. Our room was comfortable clean and spacious. The service was excellent. A good buffet breakfast. Didn't give it the 5th star for only one reason, that it was across the bay from historic Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comments on Tripadvisor. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you appreciated our overall service. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minute away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can enjoy the vicinity in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere of this residential area.  We do hope to have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
