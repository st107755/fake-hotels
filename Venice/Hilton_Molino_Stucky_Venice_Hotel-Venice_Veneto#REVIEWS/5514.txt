First for the positives  The hotel was peaceful and whilst not in the main tourist part of town there were very frequent and quick free transfers to the main tourist areas, including St Marks Square.  We booked directly with hotel on a rate which included breakfast - the breakfast buffet was very good and extensive (although service for tea and coffee was slow due to how busy it was at times).  The concierge was very helpful and gave good recommendations on where to go and where to eat.  We got a good rate for the hotel and it represented good value for money.  The less good bits:  Our hotel room did not have a view at all - our room looked out at a piece of wasteland.  The hotel's roof top bar had no atmosphere and we did not use it which was a shame given the views were great.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
