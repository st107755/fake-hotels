Booked through Hilton Honours and arrived to a family suite with 2 windows facing brick walls, even using all the lighting in the room, the room was still dim. After bringing my disappointment to management twice, I was upgraded to a higher suite, with a view, not a great one, but a view all the same. only it was not a family suite so no sofa bed so a rollaway was provided. The suites themselves are lovely and spacious but the family suites fall very short of 5 star. The location though is perfect...just across the canal from St Marks etc with a Hilton shuttle provided every 20 minutes for only 5 euro per room for the entire stay. A must is a visit to La Majer... a local café and restaurant 5 minutes walk from the Hilton. Beautiful food at a great price, made all the difference…Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2017Dear Madame We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
