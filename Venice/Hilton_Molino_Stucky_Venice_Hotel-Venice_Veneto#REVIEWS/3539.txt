This is a truly great hotel in a great location, you only need to look a the timetables to get a good idea of the boat and shuttle service the hotel is superb, and the pool just wonderful in the summer, looking over the city is truly inspiring! You'd struggle to find better hotel at this price. Few hotels have a pool, and even fewer a shuttle of their own. Stay here for an enjoyable city hotel break.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 2, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for your extremely kind comments on this website with regards to your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
