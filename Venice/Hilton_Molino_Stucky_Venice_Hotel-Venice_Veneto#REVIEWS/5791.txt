We stayed only one night at this fabulous hotel. The room was nice, very comfortable bed. Nice walk-in shower. The breakfast was great, lots of options. We loved that the shuttle took us to the main tourist area. The view from the rooftop was amazing, definitely take a trip up there if you decide to stay here! Only wish we had more time, so we could have had a relaxing dip in the rooftop pool. Will definitely stay here if I make it back to Venice!Read moreDate of stay: May 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
