I stayed here for a conference recently and was fascinated by the area and the building which was very impressive. Whilst there was some literature in the hotel shop about the builder/owner (Stucky) of this huge former flour mill nothing was made of this history inside the building which was a pity. The staff were very helpful and we got great advise about eating locally on Guidecca. Water taxi's arranged by the conference organisers were super and on time. I would strongly recommend this hotel. We were fortunate to be allocated a room overlooking the water and the location is perfect. It is a very impressive building when lit at night and we found the complimentary water taxi invaluable.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 1, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to write a review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
