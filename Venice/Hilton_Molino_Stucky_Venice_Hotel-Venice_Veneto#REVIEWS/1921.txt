Overall a lovely hotel, located on a peaceful island across a canal from the main Venice islands.  Access is easy thanks to a frequent private hotel shuttle boat to St Mark's Square, as well as scheduled city waterbus services.  Breakfast was great and the rooftop pool and bar were amazing!  Highly recommended.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Amoma.comDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
