Had never been to Venice before....We defenetly  choose the right hotel. Beautiful, convenient and what a view ! As gold honors member we were upgraded to a junior suite, it was spacious and grand. The concierge lounge was an added bonus, they served food there all day long...I would absolutely go back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
