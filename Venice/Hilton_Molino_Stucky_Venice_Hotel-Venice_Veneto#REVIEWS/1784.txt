Huge rooms & bathrooms, super comfortable bedding and fantastic buffet breakfast.  The hotel is on an island so you can either get the free Hilton shuttle or the public ferry which can be inconvenient but is the price you pay for being in a quiet area.  The hotel is huge so can feel a little impersonal but the compromise is that you get lots of facilities ie, restaurants, bars, pool, room service, spa, etc (not that I used any of them).Read moreDate of stay: September 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 26, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
