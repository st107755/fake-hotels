Beautiful hotel away from the crowds in downtown Venice.  When checking into our room I noticed the doorframe was loose.  I called the front desk who sent maintenance and a manager up to review.  Maintenance said they could fix and the manager offered to buy us a coffee.  We said we did not mind the noise but he said we should not have to hear the maintenance.  After our coffee, the manager informed us the door was fixed, but to come down the next day and they upgrade us to a view room because of the inconvenience.   When a hotel goes above and beyond to fix a situation, you know they care.  Very happy with the hotel and the staff.   Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor in regard to your recent stay with us.
