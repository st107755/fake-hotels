From airport take Taxi Boat directly to Hilton's' pier If you stay in hotel in Venice city, will have to roll your suitcase on cobblestone streets - no valet will meet you at the pier  Free boat shuttle every hour to Venice. Beautiful ride and leaves every hour Pat end of day you leave the hustle and bustle of Venice where there are 1000's of tourist Concierge and staff are great and helpful Restaurants good  Highly recommend  Worth the extra cost  Beautiful 5 star hotelRead moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
