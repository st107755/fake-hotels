The hotel is beautiful but beware of traveling to and from GUidecca Island. the shuttle that will be charged to your room whether you use it or not stops running at 1145pm which is understandable because venice seems to shut down at 11. But shuttles to and from the city are 5 euros. Take a chance and hop on and off the shuttles. They usually do not check for tickets if you get on at a stop that is not a major point.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 15, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations. While it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  As regards the ACTV public transport may I advise that passengers without a valid ticket are fined and I would avoid to suggest other travellers to get on board without it. For more info please visit the ACTV page http://actv.avmspa.it/en/content/fines-actv We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
