On our tour of europe we stayed here for three nights and it turned out to be a great choice of hotel. The location is great as the hotel sits on a small island a 3 minutes by water taxi away from the bustle of Venice but or a slightly longer by Hilton’s courtesy water taxi which runs every 20 minutes. The hotel itself is quite special, enjoying the best of an old building whilst offering very modern & stylish, good sized rooms with lovely en-suites and views towards Venice. The roof top pool is a must along with the skyline bar !  The breakfast is awesome with a great choice and the staff couldn’t be more helpful.  This hotel is certainly one I’d highly recommend staying at and I’d definitely go back !Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 2, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this kind review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
