We visited in early October, which is not during the busy season.  It was nice because the free shuttle boat was not very full, so there were no long waits.  The breakfast buffet was excellent, consisting of typical American and European selections.  We didn't eat at the restaurants at the hotel, since they were kinda pricey.  The rooftop pool was closed for the season, so we couldn't check that out.  The room was very spacious, especially for a European hotel.  Overall, we had a wonderful trip.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
