My sister and I (ages 65 and 70) stayed at this hotel for 6 nights,  Our room on the second floor (overlooking a courtyard) was very nice  and quiet.  The beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was large, the breakfast was excellent with a huge selection, the staff friendly and helpful (a special shout out to Gloria at the check in desk for helping us with phone/wifi isues) and the view from the rooftop pool was outstanding. Also, the artwork in and around the hotel was lovely. The shuttle was convenient and on time, though sometimes tricky to board because of rocking boat and dock, but someone always at the ready to assist if needed. We felt safe and well cared for at this hotel and would return in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 24, 2015Dear Madame, We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
