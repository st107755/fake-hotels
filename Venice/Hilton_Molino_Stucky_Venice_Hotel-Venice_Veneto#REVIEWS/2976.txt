Firstly the shuttle service to and from San Marco and Zettero are only every hour. Given that we were automatically charged per day for this service it would have been more considerate to put these services on more regularly.  Secondly the executive lounge was very disappointing, no Prosecco and the food was unappetising having the same dried out selection everyday.  The sky bar had a spectacular view and prices to match - 18 Euros for a mixe,d brink..... Other than that we enjoyed our stay and found the staff more than helpful in every way.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor.
