The hotel staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable which is just what you need if you haven't been to Venice before. Our room was beautiful with a great view of the lagoon, it was so lovely we slept with the curtains open so we got the view first thing in the morning as well as the last thing at night. We dined one night in the hotel and the food was great, breakfast were always good with a nice selection of foods.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 20, 2018Dear Sir, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
