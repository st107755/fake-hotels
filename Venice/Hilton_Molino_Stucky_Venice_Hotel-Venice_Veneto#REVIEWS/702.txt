A very nice hotel in a converted factory. Well laid out room. Very helpful staff. Concierge gave excellent restaurant recommendations. Only slight downside is the location, across the lagoon from the main parts of Venice. You need to take their water shuttle, which runs regularly to get across. Other than that, a definite place to return to.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 27, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
