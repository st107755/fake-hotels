Our 6night stay at this hotel was very nice. The transportation to the Piazza was on time and comfortable.  The room was large for Europe and the bathroom was good size. The only negative thing is the tub in the bathroom. It was very narrow, with curved insides resulting in only about one foot width of the flat bottom. I stepped too far to the side and slipped on the curved side, falling onto the marble floor of the bathroom. Luckily nothing broke.  I enjoyed the service and the in-room coffee maker. The breakfast buffet was nice as well.  We. Did not use the restaurant or the bar so no comments about that. We did check the view from the rooftop bar at night and it was beautiful.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 14, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
