This Hotel is rated 5 star but did not live up to expectations. The shower head was broken, 1 cup for 2 people for coffee and the weighing scales not working ( Why not remove it) This is the first time I ever had a problem with a room in a 5 star hotel.The reception staff were very professional and welcoming and the staff in the diningroom for breakfast were very efficient but not housekeeping or the rialto Bar. We received a very welcome bottle of Belini in our room. Waiting for the courtesy boat in the cold is a pain and dominates how you spend your time. I have been to venice many times but this was a huge mistake,much better to be in a 4 star in the centre where you can walk back to your room anytimeRead moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare
