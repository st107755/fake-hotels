My only complaint about this hotel is the price- the rooms are nice, but certainly not worth $300-$400 per night. That being said, our room was clean and had a very nice bathroom with a shower and a bath. The hotel is a bit out of the way from the rest of Venice but this wasn't a problem because the Hilton water taxi service takes you to Zaterre or San Marco, and it is always on time and efficient. I personally preferred being away from the huge crowds on the mainland of Venice and enjoyed the water taxi ride. The highlights for us were the rooftop pool, Skyline bar, and the hotel restaurant, Bacaromi.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your comments on this website.
