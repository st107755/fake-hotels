Our 3 night stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky was something amazing, a very large hotel with an incredible layout and quite historic. Our room was okay, a little dated but comfortable and spacious. We didnt have a great view as we around the side of the building but we didn't mind as we spent many hours out and about in Venice and used our downtime at the hotel to relax and unwind. We chose to eat out for breakfast and diner and would recommend visiting La Palanca, Giudecca which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel provide a shuttle boat to get you to and from the main islands in Venice and come very 10/15 minutes which is handy. They also have an amazing infinity pool on the rooftop which gives you amazing panoramas on the city and harbour where the cruise ships dockâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 14, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
