I have been various times in this hotel. This time, I was quite disappointed: room pretty expensive, view to walls. AC not working, lock st window broken. Carpet outside the rooms pretty disgusting. The bathroom was not clean - lots of hair (!) on the inside of the shower. Gross. Breakfast very expensive, and certainly not worth it. Not again.Read moreDate of stay: March 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 25, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website; we are very sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at the hotel.
