Nice location, big building, in fact a few buildings.. just 15 min shuttle to san marco... not bad!.. and shuttles on till late very late night...  Breakfast was terrific with so many options...again  a bit impersonal there..need to get some attention in on what people are asking and waiting for.. 2 days in a row, they missed serving coffee..  the hotel is a maze, when especially trying to get to the Gym .. so ask for directions !  we had a great deal in this place, so a nice place to stay, nothing outstanding yet. They can get a bit more on the service side of things..Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 7, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the detailed information about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
