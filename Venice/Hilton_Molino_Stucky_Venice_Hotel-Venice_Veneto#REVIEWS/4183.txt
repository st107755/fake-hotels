Lovely hotel but a bit difficult to find after getting off water taxi (public one).  Hotel needs to put a sign by water taxi stop to guide people on how to get to the hotel - a walk through apartment blocks then over a bridge, and eventually in the 'trademans' entrance to the hotel, not the best first impression, but after, the rest of the hotel was beautiful, especially the bedrooms - pure luxury! Choice of food a bit limiting and very overpriced - but I suppose this is Venice.  Unfortunately didn't get to use the pool and outdoor bar on the roof due to the appalling weather, but it looked gorgeous. Nice to be a little outside the hustle and bustle of Venice but would recommend the Hilton at Mestre if going on a cruise - easier transport links!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
