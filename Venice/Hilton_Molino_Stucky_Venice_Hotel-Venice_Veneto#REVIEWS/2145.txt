This is an excellent and beautiful hotel deserving its high TripAdvisor ranking.  We stayed in canal facing executive non smoking room with breakfast included  The silence was good, bedding was excellent as per Hilton standards.  Good water pressure. Spacious room and bathrooms by Venice hotel standards.   Wifi was free and at 2 Mbps up and down was excellent for a hotel   Please do take advantage of the excellent cooked buffet breakfast which had an excellent variety.  Staff friendly to a fault  There are regular water shuttles from the doorstep to and from the San Marco attractions every 20 minutes   You can buy water shuttle tickets from the reception area.  I recommend taking a private water taxi direct from the airport to the hotel. It costs about 120 euro but so worth it. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 30, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
