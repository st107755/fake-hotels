Was very pleased with my recent three night stay at the Hotel Molino Stucky. A former flour factory beautifully renovated into a top class hotel, my stay was very comfortable and the caring staff went out of their way to assist me in every way. Originally doubtful about staying on Giudecca, it turned out to be both convenient and cheaper than paying for the vaporetto; with the hotel shuttle stopping three times an hour at Zattere and San Marco, I never had to wait very long for a boat and could easily walk wherever I was going from one of those two stops. Will certainly stay there again and recommend it to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 14, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
