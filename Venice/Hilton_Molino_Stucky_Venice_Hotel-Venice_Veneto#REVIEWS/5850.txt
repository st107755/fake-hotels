Good hotel with very nice view over Venice. The shuttle boat is great and runs on time several times every hour. Our experience would have been greater if we not would have been given a room at the first floor, quite noisy and not quite the view as the other floors. Had dinner one night at one of the hotel's restaurants, was ok, recommend that one books other restaurants in Venice that the very professional conciere can assist you with. Dont miss the rooftop bar.Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare
