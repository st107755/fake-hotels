If in Venice... Do as the Diamonds do, go to the Stucky for a week or two. A short boat ride to the heart of the attractions for a day of shopping and history.  Then back to across the river to the small, quiet island of Giudecca for an evening strolling along the waterfront.  Many small, local restaurants are steps away.   The building, like all structures in Venice are grand. The hotel rooms are spacious and clean. The staff was helpful.  I can't image seeing Venice any other way.
