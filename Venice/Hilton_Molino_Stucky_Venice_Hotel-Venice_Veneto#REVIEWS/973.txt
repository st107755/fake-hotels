We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our Hotel and services as well as the Executive Lounge which offers nice views over the Giudecca canal, and we are also pleased that you tested the efficiency of our shuttle boat service which is very convenient to reach St Marks square and the city centre. On your next visit to Venice may I suggest a visit of the Giudecca island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. There are always art exhibitions going on and the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend. We thank you for being our Guests and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager  Read more
