My family stayed in two rooms; one bath was a bit nicer than the other and the room also had two windows as opposed to one. The rooms/baths were immaculate.  The views not so great, but that is due to the converted building.  Overall it has the feel of a big hotel where staff is courteous but has no idea who you are.  I did have an issue with wet luggage (thank you, TSA) and the woman they sent to my room to assist went out of her way to be helpful.  We found it best to sightsee earlier in the morning; the crowds became overwhelming later in the day.  We just timed the shuttles and it worked out great.  We actually loved being a bit removed from the crowds - gave us some breathing room.  Overall I found our stay at this hotel a bit pricey, but worth every cent.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
