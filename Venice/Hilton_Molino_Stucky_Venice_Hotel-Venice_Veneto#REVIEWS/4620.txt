We stayed for two nights pre cruise and wish it was more, we will certainly return. We booked a standard room and were upgraded to an executive king with view. The location could not have been better, we were right at the front over looking the water and it was a delight to open the huge windows and take in the view and atmosphere.  The room was excellent, bathroom beautiful. We had room service dinner the first night and ate with the windows open soaking in the scenery, very romantic!  Breakfast is a feast, if you can get it included in your rate then do so, service was excellent.  The shuttle over to the mainland is quick prompt and easy to use.  We will return and would recommend to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
