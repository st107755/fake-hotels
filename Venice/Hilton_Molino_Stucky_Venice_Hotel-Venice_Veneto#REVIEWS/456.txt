The hotel is top notch, everything I wanted and expected out of Hilton. Not disappointed. My only disappointment and surprise was (what I would consider) less than friendly service. I was told by some locals that Venetians get weary of the tourists. I get that, but hide your disdain while at work if you can. That was my only complaint. I'd probably look at a different hotel if I went again - just because of the way the front desk staff made me feel.
