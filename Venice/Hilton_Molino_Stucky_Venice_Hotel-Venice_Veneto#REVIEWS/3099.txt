Stayed here for a week for my birthday. Was an amazing hotel. Felt like a princess from start to finish. Room was nice with excellent views over the city. There is a good choice of restaurants within the hotel. Super skyline bar on the 8th floor..again..fab views of the city. Hotel provides a regular boat service to the two main parts of the city so getting about is very easy. Hotel were accommodating with our requests. .e.g. adding breakfast etc. Breakfast was very good... spoilt for choice. Staff were attentive and always ensured we were happy. Would go back any time!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 13, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
