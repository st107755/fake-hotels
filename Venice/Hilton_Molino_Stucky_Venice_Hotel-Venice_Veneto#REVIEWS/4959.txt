The rooms are incredible.  The location could not be any better. You just take a quick 5 minute water taxi (Free) across the channel. The water taxis come often.  It is nice to get away from the hustle and bustle squares but you are just a a few minutes away from all the action.  The breakfast is delicious- many options. I used my points to stay here and I felt like a queen. The gym was very nice.  The rooms were kept well.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  If you are a diamonds member then you can use the executive lounge and get drinks and food for free.   I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
