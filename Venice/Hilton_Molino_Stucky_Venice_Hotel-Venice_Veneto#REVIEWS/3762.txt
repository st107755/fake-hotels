Guardian Life, the company I'm employed with, held their sales convention,one day business session at this hotel. A Venetian ball and gala diner was also celebrated there before we boarded the Splendor of the seas for a Mediterranean cruise. We arrived on May 22nd. The staff was quite courteous and offered great SERVICE. What a dream and a great experience. A hotel situated on water. The meals  prepared at both restaurants were quite delicious.
