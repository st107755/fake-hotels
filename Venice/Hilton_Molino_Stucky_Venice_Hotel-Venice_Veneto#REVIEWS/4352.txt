Lovely hotel, great views from the top.  Quite a nice, spacious room, our views were brick walls (bit disappointing)and it was a bit like a rabbit warren inside to find your way around but position on the water made up for that.  We arrived there from the port after a cruise, used local transport, (we bought a round trip ticket which also took us to the airport) bit of a struggle with large suitcases, but we managed.  Hotel staff were quite helpful.  The hotel has it's own shuttle, so it was 5 mins to St Marks Square and cost nothing, boats run often so come and go as you please. Great breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
