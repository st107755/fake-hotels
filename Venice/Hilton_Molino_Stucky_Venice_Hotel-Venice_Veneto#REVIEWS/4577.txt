we stayed in an executive King with amazing views, but could hear every sound from the room next door - not what i expect when paying â‚¬400+ per night. it is a real design fault. also the boat across, although, generally good can get busy (max 40 persons), and if you are unable to board may have to wait up to an hour for the next...and if course you are dependent on the boat. so it does become a bit of a stress. otherwise the hotel is large, business like. service good and friendly. ideal if you want to get away from the hassle of venice, but it comes with some 'gripes'Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
