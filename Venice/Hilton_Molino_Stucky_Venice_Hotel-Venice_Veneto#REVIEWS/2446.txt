Cant say enough about location and building, both excellent   Wait staff for breakfast  best I have seen so far in Europe  , attentive  and pay attention to guests need.  Hotel away from the crowds of St Marco with shuttle boat back to hotel every 40 mins, once only fee charged to your room.  Rooms are acceptable size but are starting to look worn  As you exit the hotel turn right, cross over 3 bridges and  go along  waterfront and there is a self service laundry for your washing.  Make sure you have â‚¬1 coins for laundry as local shops will not change for you.  A bit further on there is a small supermarket.
