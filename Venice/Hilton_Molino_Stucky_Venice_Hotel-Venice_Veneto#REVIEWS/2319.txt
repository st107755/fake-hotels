The building is beautiful, as are the rooms, the breakfast and the service. Everything about this hotel was superb. It is situated on a separate 'island' to the main part of venice, what's great is the hotel put on a boat every 30/40 minutes that takes you away on your journey around Venice. From the airport you don't need to take a water taxi, you can take the water bus, it drops you off at the Hilton, I think it us the last stop. Join Hilton Honours and you can get free WiFi.... ðŸ˜‰Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
