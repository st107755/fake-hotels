This is a beautiful hotel, the staff is very helpful and rooms are large.  Our room was on the side of the hotel but we still had a great view of the canal and Venice.  I think the rooms on the upper floors will give the best view.  The hotel shuttle is very convenient.  There are two drop off locations (one is St Marks Square) and they run frequently.  Free wi-fi only available in the lobby, not in the rooms.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 14, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
