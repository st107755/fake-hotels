This was the only  "name brand" hotel that we stayed at during our trip to Italy and it was pretty much as expected.  Much nicer accommodations, responsible staff and a nice upgrade from the other hotels.  Only thing to be aware of if you are considering this hotel is that is located across the lagoon from Venice.  This was really not much of an issue for us, but getting to Venice (and to the hotel from the train station) can be a little tricky as the private shuttle the hotel runs only runs to Venice once at hour at some times.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
