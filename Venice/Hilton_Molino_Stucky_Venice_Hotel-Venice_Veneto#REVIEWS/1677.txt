very nice hotel at a unique location. it offers free transfer to Venice and back.  The rooms are small in general for 5star hotel, but clean.   The breakfast is very nice and includes everything one can ask for. The staff very polite .  The concierge staff is not always helpful with giving accurate details of where to eat , etc, maybe because of the crowd with the groups in the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
