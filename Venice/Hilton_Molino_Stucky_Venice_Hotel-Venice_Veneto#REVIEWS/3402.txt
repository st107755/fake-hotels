My husband and I with our 3 year old daughter had a wonderful stay at the hotel. Service was excellent and as we were Diamond members, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  We had 3 luggage with us throughout our trip and it wasn't inconvenient at all. When we arrived at St Lucia, we took a water taxi that sent us straight to the hotel's private dock and was greeted by bellman there.   Beautiful hotel away from the touristy San Marco. Frequent hotel shuttles make trips to San Marco and Zetterre convenient. Would definitely stay here again.
