On the surface, this hotel is very nice.  As noted in other reviews, the rooms are large by European standards, and the bathrooms are magnificent.    However, the walls are paper-thin -- the thinnest I've ever experienced.  You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbour does and says next door. (In conversation with other guests, they noted it, too -- so we weren't simply unlucky with our room choice.)  The other thing that spoiled the visit were two pesky mosquitos that dived bombed us all night and ruined our sleep!  We didn't think to bring bug spray, but now we think about it -- Venice's canals must be bug-heaven.   Be warned.Read moreDate of stay: April 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
