We stayed here prior to our departure on the Celebrity Silhouette and we weren't disappointed.  We arranged for airport transfers through the hotel given our party size of 6.  The transfer was seamless and we were met by an energetic representative who coordinated the transfer.  Upon arrival we were promptly checked in and our rooms looked out over the canal.  The views were terrific.    The Executive Lounge was among the best I've had at various Hilton properties and we were satisfied with the choices for breakfast and evening snacks.  The rooftop pool needs a few more lounge chairs but the views from the top were great.  We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them.  The shuttle to St. Marks was convenient and we had no trouble with the schedule. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
