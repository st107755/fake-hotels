Great hotel and location!   Staff are well trained and genuinely helpful.  On the expensive side, but well worth the money if you are looking for relief from the crowds of Venice.  Great little pizza place walking distance close to the public transport ferry.   Made to order pizza for 6-9 euro, beer, soft drinks and water are 1.50 euro as opposed to 5 euro in the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
