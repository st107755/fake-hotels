It's a good hotel to stay at away from the madness....  Couple of nice upmarket restaurants.  Friendly staff at those restaurants apart from the lobby one and the Nutella one where they seemed to be a bit grumpy and service was slow.  The furniture and fit out in the rooms is a bit dated and could do with a refresh.  Rooms are a good size for staying with family.  Breakfast was good (not great) and Wi-Fi worked!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
