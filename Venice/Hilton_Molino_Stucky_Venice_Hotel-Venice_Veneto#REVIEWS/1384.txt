The Hotel itself is beautiful and meets the expectations of a Hilton location. However, the counter staff is extremely rude and unpleasant. Be prepared to be treated like a filled bed and not a guest.   However, kudos to the bar, cleaning, and taxi staff. That is where the true Hilton guarantee came in.   The clean room and the water taxi to and from Piazza San Marco (6 Euro per person total for your stay) is the only reason I would recommend this hotel; and I love the Hilton brand.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2017Dear Guest, thank you very much for sharing your experience on TripAdvisor.
