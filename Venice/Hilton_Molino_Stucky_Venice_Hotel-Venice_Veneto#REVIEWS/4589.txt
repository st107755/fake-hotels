Nice hotel, great location, quite a few areas are closed out of the main season, which the hotel don't tell you, like pool and some of the restaurants, bars in the hotel. A 5 star hotel who then charge for Internet access, when a number of less patalial hotels include it. The prices are 5 star as well, a bottle of win that's £6 in the uk and £20 in the bars on the waterfront just down from St Marks Square is £ 50 in the hotel. Two sandwich's and coffees were £45. So overall a great location, and lovely hotel but overpriced for its location.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
