We stayed here 2 nights as part of an Insight tour. This was not our originally scheduled hotel, but we are glad the change was made. Our room was by far the largest room of any we stayed in during the 13 days in Italy. The bed was very comfortable with a nice selection of pillows. The television actually had several English speaking channels, allowing us to catch up on world news. Breakfast was very good, but not exceptional. The hotel's water taxi ran on schedule. It was a pleasant ride across the Grand Canal to the main tourist areas, but it was nice to be in a hotel away from the crowds. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We would definitely choose this hotel if visiting Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 15, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
