We spent the last few days of our vacation at this location just to get a different type of experience. The best feature of this hotel is its pool and bar on the top floor (8). The suites are varied in what is offered as far as views and amenities and I consider the overpriced except for one or two that I viewed. I didn't have to stay in the hotel to get the rooftop view, I could have visited, had a dink and leave. I would not book this hotel if I went to Venice again as I think you can get better value for less money elsewhereRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 31, 2018Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
