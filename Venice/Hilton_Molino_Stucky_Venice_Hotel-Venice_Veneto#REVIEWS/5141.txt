We spent 9 nights here and found that it was very comfortable.  I was particularly pleased to find that the location on Guidecca was so opportune:  It is within easy reach of the tourist areas of Venice - in fact the hotel runs a regular ferry service, as well as the nearby Vaporetti stop of Palanca - but there is a very "villagey" feel to the neighbourhood which I enjoyed.  There are several very good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback !
