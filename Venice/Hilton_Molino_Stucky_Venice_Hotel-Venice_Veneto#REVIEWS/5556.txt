We got Hilton Molino Stucky via priceline bid.  The hotel itself is very impressive.  It's a HUGE buildling; all of which was well kept.  There was always someone around to help the guests.  It's amazing!  The night we arrived; we were assigned a room.  Upon arrival, we found the room was a bit smokey.  I was pregnant and didn't want to be doing too much 2nd hand smoke.  We requested for a room change.  We were immediately upgraded to another room.  The quick response was impressive.  The room is spacious and charming.  The areas are well kept.  You always see housekeeping people wiping things down constantly.  The hotel run a free shuttle service between the hotel and San Marco area every 15/30 minutes.  Be sure to get there early as they are limited to 40 people per trip.  Youâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
