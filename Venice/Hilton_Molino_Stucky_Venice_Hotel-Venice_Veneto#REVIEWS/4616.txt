Having discovered the Molino Stucky last year, we returned this January with our family to celebrate my wife's birthday. The hotel setting, facilities and service are outstanding. We were treated like royalty and could not fault the stay.   We've stayed at various hotels in Venice over the years and now couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. The combination of staying on the quieter Giudecca, an efficient courtesy waterbus and ready access to Alilaguna and ACTV stops too, with a hotel of this quality is just fantastic. And the staff couldn't do more to help.   Our rooms were incredible, with views over the Giudecca canal and Venice city. In all, a faultless experience. Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 28, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review.
