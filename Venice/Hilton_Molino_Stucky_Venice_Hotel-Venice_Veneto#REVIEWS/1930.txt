This is a very good Hilton hotel. Staff were friendly and well trained. The rooms were modern and ours very quiet. It was the middle of summer so Venice was busy but the hotel seemed to cope well and staff were very attentive. The roof top pool area is small and the pool was disturbingly cloudy so we didn't go near it. Breakfast was great and worth paying for but again busy after 930am. The hotel runs a shuttle boat to San Marco but it doesn't run that often (1-2 times an hour maybe) and it can be full during evenings. Other water taxis are available or the public vaporetto service is a 10 min walk away.
