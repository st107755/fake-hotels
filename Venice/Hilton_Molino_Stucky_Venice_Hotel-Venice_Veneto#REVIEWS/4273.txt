We stayed here for our honeymoon in July 2013. The rooms were just ok large bathroom and comfortable beds but old carpets and small overall room. Very noisy in the morning also. Convenient shuttle to the main land which was fun and great cafes on the island of the hotel. Breathtaking views on the rooftop by the pool but don't plan on getting a lounge chair bc there are not many. Restaurant and bars were way overpriced. Overall a nice place but not worth the price.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
