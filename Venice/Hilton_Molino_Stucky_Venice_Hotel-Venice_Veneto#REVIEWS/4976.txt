This was an overall great hotel. I am a Hilton Frequent Traveler so I get all of the Diamond perks. But regardless, the hotel was clean and in great shape. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is on the Guidecca island. The room was gorgeous and had a great view of the canal and the rest of Venice. The spa was nothing special and was a bit over priced. The breakfast was excellent (buffet). The executive lounge was a little odd in that it is off to one side of the main bar/lounge. But the executive lounge was comfortable and well stocked. The hotel provides a free shuttle boat to take guests to Zaterre and San Marcos every 20 minutes. Private water taxi (for 4 people) to the airport was 105 euros.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
