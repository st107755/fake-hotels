My wife and I spent six nights at Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel and enjoyed a large room with a high ceiling, a big bathroom and a big soft bed.  The free water taxi from the hotel to Venice was a very nice feature that we utilized every day.  The staff at the front desk and concierge were very helpful especially Carlo.  His pleasant demeanor and smile came to be something I could count on every time I saw him.  He seems to embrace his job and taking care of guests is a high priority with him.  The breakfast buffet every morning was plentiful with eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, juice, coffee, fresh fruit and more. Our thanks to Lorena who went out of her way to have our coffee and tea for us every morning.  We ate most of our evening meals at the hotel and were never disappointedâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 23, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
