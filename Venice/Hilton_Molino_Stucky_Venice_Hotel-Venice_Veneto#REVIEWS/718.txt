We had two executive suites one overlooking Venice. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.   The hotel is absolutely charming and spacious and has everything one could hope for.   The suites were spacious, well appointed and the beds comfortable.   The pool on the roof top is gorgeous with lovely views as is the skyline bar with its great views.   The breakfast buffet is extensive and the quality of the food very good. I loved their cappuccino.   They have a boat that runs to St. Marks square every twenty minutes so very easy to get around.  I have no complaints and would definitely go back.
