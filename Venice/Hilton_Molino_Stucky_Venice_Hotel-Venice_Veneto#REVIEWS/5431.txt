My wife and I really enjoyed the Hilton Molino Stucky.  While the hotel is not located on the main island, the free water shuttle to the main island and the quiet (less touristy) location was ideal for us.  We enjoyed walking the back alleys on Giudecca and the break from the hectic tourist environment on the main island.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The hotel is beautiful and well appointed.  As a Hilton Gold Member, we enjoyed the free breakfasts and the evening hors de vors.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Venezia.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
