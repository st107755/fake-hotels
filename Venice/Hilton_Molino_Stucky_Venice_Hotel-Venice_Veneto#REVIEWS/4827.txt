This hotel is fantastic. Amazing rooms, great staff, great location (with regular shuttle service to the main part of Venice). It is a 5 star experience, and we would go back again in a heartbeat. Amazing stay for our honeymoon, but this place would be great for all types of visits. Highly recommend, you will not go wrong with this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
