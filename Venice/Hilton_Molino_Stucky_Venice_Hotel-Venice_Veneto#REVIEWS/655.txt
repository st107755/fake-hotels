Stayed 3 days in this magnificent hotel with the best view of Venice with a family of 5. The top pool or skyline bar are both outstanding to relax or recharge after a busy day in the city or even an afternoon break.  Breakfast is sometimes busy - but never too - and serves everything one can expect for a healthy start of the day.   The complimentary shuttle service makes transfers to the city easy and fast.  We will surely come back during our next stay in Venice !Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review posted on this website.
