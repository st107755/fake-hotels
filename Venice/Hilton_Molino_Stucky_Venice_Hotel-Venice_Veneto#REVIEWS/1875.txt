The hotel was beautiful and well presented. Staff were friendly also. However, upon arrival we looked at our room and found excessive dust, rubbish lying around and the general condition was just not up to scratch. After having reported the issues on arrival, management tried their very best to rectify the issue by offering us two other substandard rooms which we were not impressed with, so we opted to stick with what we had.  Things did not improve during the stay but in fact worsened. The room was not hoovered once during our 7 night stay, rubbish was left lying around and dust was not cleaned.  The hotel quality is very impressive but is hugely let down by the upkeep of the rooms which is no less than appalling.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
