Wish I would have booked my entire stay there. The rooms were just comfy and clean. Its a 15 min boat ride from S'Marco but the hotel provides a shuttle every 15 mins. The spa was great after a day of touring venice on feet and the sky bar and sky pool is a nice way to spend the evening. I recommend it for singles and couples and business travellers.  Double check your bill before you leave, I paid on hotels.com and they still charged me for the room.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on Trip Advisor.
