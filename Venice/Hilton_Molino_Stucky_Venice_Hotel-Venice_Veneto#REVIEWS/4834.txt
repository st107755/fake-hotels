We stayed on the executive level during our recent stay. The beds were incredibly uncomfortable, had to ask for a trash can and wash clothes for the bath, breakfast included what appeared and tasted like powdered eggs, inedible bacon and sausage. If you are looking for a qualtiy American hotel this is not it. I was much happier at our last 'Rick Steves' recommended hotel in Padua at 1/4 the expense.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website. We were sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at the hotel.  We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations.  I am disappointed that you did not appreciate the comfort of our beds and did not enjoy our Breakfast as we keep receiving lovely feedback from our guests. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future. Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
