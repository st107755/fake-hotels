This is a cracking hotel. It is vast, but it retains character. It is a converted pasta mill and dominates the area. It has excellent service with a good executive lounge overlooking the canal. The rooms are well appointed. We did have an issue with the AC, but it was fixed after reporting it.  The beds were amazingly comfortable and sone of the best I've stayed in.   Breakfast is a mammoth affair with lots of choice.   I was disappointed not to get an upgrade, because we booked 2 rooms for 3 nights and I'm a diamond member.   The hotel provides a regular shuttle boat to the main areas.
