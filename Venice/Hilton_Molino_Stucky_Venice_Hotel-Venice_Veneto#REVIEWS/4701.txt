We used our Hilton rewards to stay here, so it was free...otherwise I would have been extremely disappointed.  This hotel is not convenient to anything in Venice and the staff will give you the wrong directions every time. The breakfast buffet is extensive and pleasant, but their executive lounge is a joke compared to others I've seen in Europe, very few amenities.  And while the hotels renovations are beautiful, its a cavernous space.   I would choose a spot on the main island.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback about your recent stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice I am truly sorry that we did not meet all your expectations and I do hope that should your plans bring you back this way, you will give us another chance to serve you and.
