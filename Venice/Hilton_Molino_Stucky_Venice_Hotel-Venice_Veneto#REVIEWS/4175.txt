We disembarked out ship, hopped a vaparetto, and were at the Molino Stucky in one stop.  The hotel is steps away from the dock.  We arrived at 9:00 AM, checked in immediately, and our room was ready.  After dropping off our bags, we took the hotel's private shuttle and headed for central Venice.   We found the shuttle to be punctual.  We were 100% pleased with this hotel.  Beautiful marble and wood were in abundance in our large, nicely decorated room.  European rooms are for the most part small, so this was a real treat for us tall folks.  The breakfast was very good with all you could want and more.  The roof top bar was wonderful with a beautiful view of Venice at night.  Murano glass was on display throughout the hotel.  We would definitely stay at this hotel on our nextâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
