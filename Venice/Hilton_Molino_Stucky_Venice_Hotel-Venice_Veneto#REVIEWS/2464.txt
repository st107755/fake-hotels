We stayed for two nights in Venice. Beautiful location and extremely good hospitality. Well maintained rooms and superb view from the hotel. I wish to stay in this hotel once more. Great experience..Value for money....  Awesome Breakfast..... The hotel is not on the main island but the approach is very comfortable and easy. Good free ferry service is available from the hotel to the main island and from there you can go to any place .... Great experience.. I recommend you should definitely stay....Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear Mr. Khandelwal,   Thank you so much for your kind review.
