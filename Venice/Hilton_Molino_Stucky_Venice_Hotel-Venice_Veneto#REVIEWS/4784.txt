The Regent Cruise line (as do others) uses this hotel in Venice. The hotel is huge. It is on one of the islands. To get to the hotel from the port is an adventure with water taxis on top of each other. We paid $153 to be met at the ship and taken to the water taxi's. A young lady met us when we were getting our luggage(5 pieces). We had to carry our luggage about a quarter of a mile  by ourselves. When we got to the hotel we had to wait  3+ hours to get to our room.  The "luxury room" wasn't. A Hamburger fries and a Coke cost 33 Euros. Yuck!! The service people were friendly, and tried to be helpful when they were not swamped>Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear  Guest, Thank you for your feedback which certainly helps us to monitor and improve our services.
