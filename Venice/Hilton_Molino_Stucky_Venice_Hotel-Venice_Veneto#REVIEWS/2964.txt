Paid considerably more for a room with a view. Checked in only to find hotel was fully booked. Our room not only didnt have a view but it also wasnt big enough to swing the proverbial cat. Extremely disappointed. Spoke to the assistant night manager Daniele Carluccio who was extremely abrupt and rude to myself and my husband. He refused to move us room even though our booking confirmation states 'deluxe room with a view'.  If this is the way this hotel treats its loyal Hhonors Diamond, I recommend to give it a miss. Nice building though.
