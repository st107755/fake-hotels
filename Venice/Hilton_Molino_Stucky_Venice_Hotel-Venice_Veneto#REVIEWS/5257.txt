We liked this hotel, View was especially fromm the rooftop where the swimming pool is locates is fantastic.  Staff were courteous. Breakfast superb. They have their own water taxi shuttle to bring you places or you can use the vaporettos to go to even more attractions. (Station platform is 5 minutes away) One minor mishap was when we checked in, we were given a room  with luggages inside but this was changed and rectified immediately. I recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
