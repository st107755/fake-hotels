I checked out 15.2.2015 and now twelve days later, the hotel is still holding the deposits (none of which I was informed beforehand and some of which still remain unexplained despite of my inquiry).

Though we are sorry for the inconveniences you are experiencing with the pre-authorization amounts charged to your credit card (which should be considered as temporary transactions and not sales), we are pleased to confirm that these are always automatically released on check-out and the hotel does not hold any deposit after that. The procedure is an international common practice which is applied by major brands, as well as in all Hilton hotels worldwide.

Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
