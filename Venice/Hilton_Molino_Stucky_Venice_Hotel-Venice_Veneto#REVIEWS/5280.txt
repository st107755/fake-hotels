i was worried about the location before we stayed....how wrong was I!  This is the perfect place to experience Venice. When the main island overwhelms you, get on the shuttle back to this little paradise and unwind.  The island of Giudecca is also worth some exploring.  We stayed for 4 nights and wished it was longer.  The staff was great.  The property was clean and comfortable. The spa was so relaxing.  We loved sitting by the windows watching the boats go by.  We will be returning some day.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 27, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
