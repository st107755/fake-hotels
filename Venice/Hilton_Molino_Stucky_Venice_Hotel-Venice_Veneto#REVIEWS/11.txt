This was a fantastic stay all around. The rooms were quiet and clean. I got the best sleep of my entire trip during the nights I was here. The entire hotel is nice and the food is great for both breakfast and dinner. The hotel also has several nice lounge areas. Be advised, to get to the tourist places in Venice you will need to take a boat as this is on an island. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just know before you get here that it will be required. Overall this is an old flour factory that was converted into a fantastic hotel that I will stay at every time I visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 20202 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 9, 2020Dear Guest,   Greetings from Venice and thank you for your nice feedback on TripAdvisor.
