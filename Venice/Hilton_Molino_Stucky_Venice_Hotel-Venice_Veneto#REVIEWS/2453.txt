Very nice hotel, excellent location.  Good schedule for the water taxi to take you around.  I would not recommend the pool bar, you can get a larger, cheap snack or meal within a short distance.  The main restaurant has excellent food & service.  The roof top pool in the summer is very nice and offering amazing views!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 22, 2015Dear Ms. Deanna,   thank you for your positive review about our hotel.   We are pleased you enjoyed your stay, in particular the shuttle boat, location, restaurant and pool. We are sorry you found our pool bar overpriced, however please note that we are talking about the bar of a 5-star luxury hotel, on the 8th floor of a building (highest rooftop bar in Venice). Other bars may be cheaper, but they would not offer the same level of service, and most certainly not the same views.   We look forward to welcoming you back   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
