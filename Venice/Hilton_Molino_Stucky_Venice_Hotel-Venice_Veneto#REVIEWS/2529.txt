This hotel is new and very nice.  The challenge is that it is across a canal from Venice.  They provide a free shuttle, but it takes time and only goes to San Marco and, after 6pm Zaterre.  The distance makes it hard to stop back at your hotel for a short rest.  We ended up using the water bus at 7.50 Euro per crossing several times.  But that was because we were in a different area than central Venice.  The Hilton employees are well trained.  The concierge Elena was especially helpful with directions and dinner reservations.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor. We are glad to see that you liked our property but we are also sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations.While it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and still it is possible to enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of bars as well as a few good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  Thank you for your kind comments with regards to our professional Concierge, she will be glad to know that she contributed to your enjoyable stay. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
