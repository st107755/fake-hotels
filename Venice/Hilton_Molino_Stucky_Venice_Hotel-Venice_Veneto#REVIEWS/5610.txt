Wonderful hotel that has made the most of its historic setting in a former industrial building. We were using Hilton points but that did not matter to the staff who were courteous and helpful.   Our room was great and the cocktails at the Sky bar added to the overall experience of a quality hotel. The massage we treated ourselves to was worth every cent!  Relative to the main island, the island of Guidecca is very quiet and peaceful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
