Nothing is lost in this hotel with its free water bus back and for the to the main venice island. Lovely roof top pool which was unfortunately not open when we went as it  was off season. Rooms were very comfortable but what ever you do - don't open the windows!!! I made the mistake and regretted it - the following morning they had to change our rooms as both me and my 3 year old were absolutely bitten to death!! Unfortunately the air con in our room had broken and as it was april I though I'd be safe just having the window open slightly - mistake. The staff were very apologetic and moved us immediately and gave us money to spend that night on a free meal as way of compensation. People talked about a smell - I never noticed, maybe it was the time of year.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
