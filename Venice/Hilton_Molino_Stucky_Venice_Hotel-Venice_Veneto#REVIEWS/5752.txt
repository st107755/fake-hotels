Although the hotel is not central - we thought this was one of the biggest plus points as Venice can get quite hectic and it is nice at times to be an onlooker....  Some times you come to expect second rate hotels and service in big tourist towns like venice but we were blown away by the quality of this hotel. Our room was small but definate luxury.  The breakfast buffet was as good as any I have seen and the service was always efficient.  The free boat shuttle was always on time and comfortable.  We paid a brief visit to the sky bar, it looked very nice but was too pricey for us to hang around for too long!  If you're looking for real class in Venice, you would be hard pressed to find better.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
