nice 5 star establishment away from the main island. however, waiting for the free shuttle was pretty annoying. if free shuttle is no longer available, walk 5 minutes to Palanca and take the public ferry there. The hotel itself was very classy and i believe to be the biggest hotel in venice. however, the rooms were not impressive and if you have a water view room, that comes with noise from boats on the river. great stay at a discount and a very helpful conceige team, thank you ladies!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
