Very nice hotel. The location is nice because it's away from the busy city center and the shuttle is easy and convenient. Our room was spacious and clean, the staff was very friendly and helpul, and the breakfast was very good. The hotel was pretty busy which some people may not like after a full day of sightseeing in overcrowded Venice, but overall, it's a very nice place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 4, 2019Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
