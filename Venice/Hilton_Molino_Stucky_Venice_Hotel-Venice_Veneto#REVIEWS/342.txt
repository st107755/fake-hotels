It's been a few years since we have visited Venice and the Hilton Molino Stucky is always our choice. The staff was friendly and helpful, providing a smooth check in and assistance throughout the stay. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety to satisfy every need and the team makes sure to cater for all requests. The Executive Lounge is great to hang out between trips to the other side and the Skyline provides great views of the city. Special thanks to Gabriele the Reservations Manager for making sure to provide the most adequate accommodation for our family. We will be back for sure!Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us on TripAdvisor.
