Absolutely gorgeous hotel with a stunning roof top pool overlooking Venice.  Staff were very friendly and efficient.  Location: beautiful..on a stunning remote island. You will need to book a water taxi to get there. To get to main city points you can you use the Hilton complimentary water shuttle which is frequent.  Rooms- clean and spacious with luxury marble bathroom.  Negatives:  No free wifi provided.  Can be quite frustrating travelling with luggage to the hotel by water taxi.  Breakfast - scrambled eggs at buffet if you wanted fried/omelette you could ask for this to be specially made but would have to wait.
