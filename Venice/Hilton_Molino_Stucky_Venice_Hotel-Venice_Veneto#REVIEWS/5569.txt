We booked the Hilton Molino Stucky. I cancelled the hotel due to a cancellation of our trip. We cancelled well in advance , and were given confirmation number. My credit card was still charged for the stay. I contacted the hotel. They agreed we should not have been charged and I still have not received a refund. Now, 2 months later, I re- e mailed the hotel and have not gotten  a reply.  Beware, before booking.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
