Our stay at the Hilton was truly amazing.The staff extremely courteous and helpful and as we were a special occasion they upgraded us to their family suite along with a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates. The complimentary timely shuttle service to San Marco was great and made staying away from the mainland a pleasure away from the crazy crowd. Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Venice.  Would highly recommend visiting their rooftop bar and trying their signature cocktails as they are truly amazing.The breakfast buffet was vast and appetizing however would suggest trying the local restaurants in the mainland for your other meals as i felt that was the only slight negative with the hotel - the restaurant menu was slightly limited specially for meâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
