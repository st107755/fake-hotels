We stayed at this hotel for two nights.  The hotel is not on the main island, but there is a convenient shuttle service that will take you to Piazza San Marco in just a few minutes.  As for the room, the one we had was very spacious and a lot bigger compared to most hotels in Venice, and it was very clean and comfortable.  The service was excellent and the view of the Venice from the hotel was breathtaking.     Overall, I think this is one of the better Hilton hotels I've stayed at.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 23, 2015Dear Sir,  thank you very much for your kind review posted on TripAdvisor with regards to your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
