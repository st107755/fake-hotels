A fantastic and all too short 2 nights at the Molino Stucky - we had a great room with a view of Venice. There is a convenient shuttle boat to the island and a rooftop pool as well as several restaurants. Above all though, the service was impeccable, from the concierge, guest relations, wait staff etc. we hope we can come back!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
