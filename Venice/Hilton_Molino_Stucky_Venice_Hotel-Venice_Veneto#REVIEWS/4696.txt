It is easy access from VCE airport to the hotel. We took water bus( public transportation) so it cost us only â‚¬15 per person each way- take Alilaguna blue line. But if you don't want to waste any time, take a water taxi.  This hotel provided us wonderful amenities for us. Since we are gold members we were upgraded to executive room which over looks the canel and access to executive lounge. And also we received free breakfast at il Molino. Fantastic experiences at this hotel every time we come.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comment about the hotel and for your loyalty to the Hilton Molino Stucky!
