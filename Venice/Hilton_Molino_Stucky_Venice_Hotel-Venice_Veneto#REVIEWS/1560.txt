For our first trip to Venice we chose the Hilton as my husband is a gold card member. We were not disappointed. We found it useful that the water boat stops right outside the hotel. There is a shuttle servicw boat to take you across the waterway to St Marks square usually every twenty minutes. We had a fabulous room overlooking the waterway . The hotel and room were very modern and clean. We liked the fact we were away from the hustle and bustle of Venice itself. It felt very tranquil even though we were in the low season. We enjoyed cocktails in the rooftop bar while looking across at Venice itself. We had a great time. Thank you to all the staff .Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 25, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
