Was staying local to this hilton in venice so my friend and I popped in to try out the skyline bar for a few cocktails .  Very impressed . The two guys that were serving were extremely attentive .  Although drinks are not cheap , it was the view and surroundings you paid for . Very nice touch that you were given nibbles free of charge and they were topped up continuously .  Would recommend this bar if you want a nice setting or perhaps to watch the sunset .
