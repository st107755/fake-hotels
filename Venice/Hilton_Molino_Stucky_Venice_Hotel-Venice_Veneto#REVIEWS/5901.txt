My husband booked this hotel using HiltonHonors points for a one night pre-cruise and one night post-cruise stay.  We had no problem finding the free hotel shuttle.  It shares a waiting room w/ one of the San Zaccaria Jolanda vaporetto stops. There is a white Hilton sign to indicate the appropriate vaporetto stop. Both nights we were upgraded to suites and the second night to the Executive Level suites w/ access to the executive lounge.  Perfect.  Whatever kinks that were problematic last year at the hotel seemed to have been worked out with their staff at this point.  The views of Venice from the roof top pool were stunning.Read moreDate of stay: May 20083 SavesHelpfulShare
