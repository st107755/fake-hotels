We paid a small fortune to stay for 5 days in an "executive" room with a "Venice view", which was actually at the side. The room was fairly typical for an international hotel, although the shower was feeble. We chose the hotel for the rooftop pool, which was lovely. However. it is very crowded in the afternoon and early evening. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the Palanca waterbus stop and there are a reasonable selection of restaurants on Giudecca. We went to the Skyline bar for pre-dinner cocktails. It was full of screaming kids and smokers. Very disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your review and for mentioning the hotel facilities and services that you have enjoyed during your stay.
