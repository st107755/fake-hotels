Located on an island a 5 min shuttle complimentary boat ride from all the main attractions. Lovely hotel and the standard you expect from Hilton.  All staff were very helpful. We chose the breakfast option, I thought it was very good however my husband was disappointed not to be able to have any fish choice ie kippers which we would expect a 5 star hotel to offer.  It is a large hotel and the layout is quite confusing when you first arrive - particularly if you enter the wrong lift!  As commented by others the views from the sky bar and the rooftop bar area are stunning. Beware the drinks are expensive.  However these are minor points and overall we had a super stay at the Hilton - would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
