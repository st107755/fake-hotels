Experience at Hilton Venice was great. Location is premium particularly from those interested in staying away from noise and crowed. Giudecca is more quiet with at least 2 great restaurants options, giving alternatives locations for meals. SkyBar and pool area are also good, with perhaps the best view of Venice. We were there during Redentore and the fireworks/celebration view from the rooptop was amazing!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 27, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on TripAdvisor. It is a pleasure to read that you appreciated the location on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, only a 12 minutes boat ride from the main crowded city centre which is especially appreciated by guests and visitors like you who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. The ideal place to enjoy the famous Redentore celebrations and its amazing fireworks! We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.
