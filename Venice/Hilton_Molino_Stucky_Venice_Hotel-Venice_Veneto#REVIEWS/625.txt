Its exactly what you would expect from a 5 star hotel apart from the fact some rooms have no views or views of constructions.  The staff are fantastic and so helpful particularly the people who work around the pool area and rooftop bar.  Even if you are not staying here I thing you should visit the rooftop!!!  The views are amazing, having the bus to Piazza St Marco is so handy for getting around.  If you go out of the hotel and to the rights to cross three bridges there is a selection of lovely local restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and gelateries everything at a fraction of what it costs in the city centre.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 28, 2018Dear Guest, thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
