Comfortable room. We had one with a view of the front waterway with Venice across. Very good service. Good executive lounge with good snacks in the evening enough for dinner. Don't miss the skyline rooftop bar for panaromic and sunset views. There is a charge of 6 and 10 euros per day for shuttle and tax.
