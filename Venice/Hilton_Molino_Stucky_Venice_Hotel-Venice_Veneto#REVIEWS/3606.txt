Excellent staff, and potentially great hotel, but a few niggles spoilt the overall impression. No free Wifi( please talk to the Sheraton Hotels, or Mandarin Oriental Group if you want to do it properly!) How much for Bottled Water? Free to guests in above mentioned hotels. Executive Lounge too small for number of guests, understaffed, and full of rude, indoor hat-wearing Americans. Executive Guest Room bed next to adjoining room's toilet - no privacy? The superb views, and staff still made this a good place to stay, but it could have been so much better. Keith LRead moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
