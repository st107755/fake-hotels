This was our first trip to Venezia and we stayed at Molino Stucky for 2 nights. The property is very beautiful and ideally located with a breathtaking view. The staff is very friendly and hotel offers free shuttle to San Marco and a free boat ride to Glass factory. Their offering in executive lounge is simply unmatched. All in all, I would stay at Molino Stucky everytime we visit Venezia.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
