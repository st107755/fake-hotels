We stayed at this Hilton on 25 and 26th of december 2015. We were visiting  Venice  for the first time and were delighted by the  beautiful location of the Hotel we chose. The hotel had a splendid facade and looked amazing when lit up at night. Must mention that our stay was made memorable by the Chef MR.ERICO...from room service who took much trouble and ensured we had the perfect italian dinner ever ! Mr.Ahmed from room service was also very helpful. Thankyou Hilton for the great hospitality.
