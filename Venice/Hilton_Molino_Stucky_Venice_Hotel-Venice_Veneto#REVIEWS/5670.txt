Arriving in Venice after a Delta flight from Hell, the hotel was a much needed breath of fresh air.  The airline had lost our luggage, and the hotel staff helped us with shopping for a new wardrobe.  We were upgraded to a huge suite with beautiful views of Venice.  The staff worked very hard at making our stay a pleasant one (comp wine, food, Vaporetto fares).  I just can't say enough.  Regarding the issues with the private shuttle schedule, we would just use the Vaporetto when the shuttle wasn't available.  Only had to walk a few blocks to the launch.  All in all, just a wonderful place.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
