This hotel was the best in all of my Euro Trip. The bar tenders were very generous, the offered me a free drink when I told them that I did not like the drink which they suggested me. The room upgrade was nice. Hotels location is near from San Marco and the price paid for two nights was also reasonable, I booked it directly from their website as the same hotel was a little expensive on booking.com. The concierge was very helpful.
