Wow, this hotel is simply amazing. The staff were fantastic and simply couldn't do enough. The location is great, the shuttle boat takes you right to the heart of Venice. We loved being able to escape back to the quiet island after a busy day. Executive lounge was nice. We ate in one of the restaurants and the food and service was simply incredible. You would struggle to beat it. The view from the Sky Bar was magnificent and a great place to watch the sun set. We would give this hotel 10 stars if we could! We definitely want to come back.
