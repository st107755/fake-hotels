What was supposed to be three days to visit the Bienalle turned into a nightmare when hubbie got sick and was admitted to local hospital.  So I stayed 6 days here. It would be easy to think the superb superb service I received was a result of my hubbie's illness - or the fact the we are Diamond Hhons guests BUT - the staff really went out of their way, these were genuinely caring and thoughtful people.  In my anxious state they became my friends - human friendly caring - I honestly don't know how I would have coped without their help and concern.  So go - be nice to the staff -  and enjoy all the rewards of a beautifully located hotel on the doorstep of one of the most fabulous cities in the world surrounded by beauty on every corner. (p.s. Hubbie is recovering! )Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
