We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  still enjoy the vicinity in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a residential area.

We thank you for being our Guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Alessandro M.Cabella  General ManagerRead more
