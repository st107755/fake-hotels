The main reason we had booked this hotel was for the rooftop pool but it was closed for a week.  Hard to believe the maintenance could not have been done when it's closed for maintenance Oct - April.  €16 for 2 take away coffees is the price you can expect to pay for anything in the Hotel - I'd suggest getting boat across the water to Zattere and going to a wonderful café and having a slap up brekkie for €16!  Location really is great, cannot be faulted.  Have a Nutella bar which I didn't know about on booking so a lovely surprise.  Concierge was good, didn't eat a meal in the hotel so cannot comment.  Wanted to sample all the locals wares which did not disappoint.  would stay again - assuming they decide to open the pool.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you very much for all your positive comments.
