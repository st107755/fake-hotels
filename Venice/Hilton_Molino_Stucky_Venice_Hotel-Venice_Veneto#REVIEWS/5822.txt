Beautiful new hotel in Giudecca, a 10 minute boat ride from St. Mark's Square in the heart of florence.  Beautiful rooftop patio.  Spacious rooms, elegant lobby, and charming decor.  Service was somewhat disappointing for a hilton -- our room was unbearably hot as the A/C was not in service for the duration of our stay -- would have expected more from a 5 star hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2009HelpfulShare
