Absolutely loved this hotel!  Only was able to stay one night before our cruise.  But was a wealth of history and beauty.  My regret is not taking the time to walk to the st. Maria church.  I loved the out door markets and how the artist have transformed old factorys into homes.  But more about the hotel, was originally built as a flour factory.  The staff will eagerly print you pages after pages of historical facts at your request.  Great food and amazing beds.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 30, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
