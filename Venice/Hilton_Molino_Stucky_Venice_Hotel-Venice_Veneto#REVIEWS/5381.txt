We've just spent a five day break in the Molino Stucky and cannot find fault with it!  The 6th floor room was lovely with stunning views over Venice.  Because we are diamond members of HHonours we had access to the executive lounge which was great, nice wine, lovely snacks and extremely helpful staff.  We ate in the Aromi restaurant on our last night and it was the best meal we had during our stay, fabulous food and exceptional service.  The hotel's free shuttle was a boon and the fact that the boat from the airport stopped at the front door was a welcome extra.  I'd recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
