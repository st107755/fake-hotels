Couldn't have been better! Stayed here with my girlfriend just before Christmas in 2013, (lovely time of year to go but wrap up as it does get extremely cold!) From when we first checked in to the time we left everyone was so helpful and made our stay delightful. The hotel restaurant is authentic and really good. American breakfast in the morning is also really good. Comfortable and clean rooms. Complimentary ferries run to two different locations - really couldn't have been better! Next time we come to Venice we will definitely be staying here!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 17, 2015Dear Guest, We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and thanks for taking the time to leave your review.
