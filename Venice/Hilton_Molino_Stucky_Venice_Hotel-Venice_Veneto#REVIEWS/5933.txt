Wow!  I was tempted not to write a review in order to keep this place to myself - but that seemed so unfair on others.   It was brilliant - a beautiful conversion, with fantastic attention to detail.  The staff were all extremely helpful.  Bedroom was amazing - couldn't fault it.  The buffet breakfast was something else - lasted us the whole day!  So convenient with the free Hilton shuttle boat across to St Marks Square, but also handy for the waterbus stop too.  It was really quiet at night and the rooms were so spacious - which must be a first for Venice!  Food not cheap, but it was well worth 2.5 Euros for a cafe latte in such fantastic surroundings.Read moreDate of stay: January 20082 SavesHelpfulShare
