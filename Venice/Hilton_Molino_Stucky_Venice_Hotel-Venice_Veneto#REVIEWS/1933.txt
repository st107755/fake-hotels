This charming flour mill, turned hotel is amazing. From the cruise ship, you can take the vaporetta (?) for 8eu (vs water taxi at 120eu). From the bellmen upon entry, to the same upon departing, this is been a great experience. The shuttle to St Marks runs every 20 mins, so getting back and forth is easy from 1 of 2 locations. The view from our room which overlooked the Grand Canal, was amazing. And anyone coming to Venice MUST go to the rooftop bar, it's the only one in Venice overlooking the city.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 6, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments.
