We have been two nights in the Hilton Venice and enjoyed the Hotel very much. Only breakfast has been a bit too simple for such a 4-5 star Hotel Pricing in high season around EUR 300/night is fully acceptable considering the value you get. Positive: Nice and modern rooms fully equipped, very good shuttle Service from Hotel to downtown Venice. Negative: Transportation from Tronchetto Parking not offered - only public Transportation for EUR 7 per Person.
