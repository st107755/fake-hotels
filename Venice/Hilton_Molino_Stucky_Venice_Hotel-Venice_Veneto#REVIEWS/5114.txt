We stayed here for two nights after our cruise.  It is a beautiful hotel and the staff was wonderful!!  We stayed in a spacious suite with a large bathroom and a very comfortable bed.  The executive lounge had drinks and food all day long.  The breakfast buffet was excellent!!  We loved the rooftop bar which had a beautiful view of Venice.  The hotel is away from the crowds and there is a water shuttle right in front of the hotel.  I would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your kind comments on Trip Advisor.
