The hotel was fine and if you like swimming pools you cannot miss this one! However it broke the magical spell of being in Italy because it was SO Americanized. Everyone spoke English, even if I tried to speak Italian, they spoke back in English. The bar upstairs had a sushi lounge, and generally it was unsatisfying. Also they charge for internet which is crazy considering how expensive the room (with no view) was. Overall if you want to step out of Italian culture, this is a good choice. The rooms are fine, but nothing special.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind feedback which certainly helps us to monitor and improve our services.
