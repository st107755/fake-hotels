The location was somewhat annoying given you had to keep crossing the water; when youve had a few drinks during dinner, you kind of want to skip the whole waiting for the water bus.

We are glad to see that you liked your accommodation and that you appreciated the helpfulness of our Team Members but we are also sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island; it is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our Guests still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. I also regret that the experience at our restaurant didn't meet with your expectations as we usually receive lovely feedback. I have passed your comments onto the our Executive Chef and his Team to review and do hope that should your plans bring you back this way, you will give us another chance to serve you. With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
