Now this place is good.  It is absolutely one of the best hotels I've stayed in and I've stayed in a few.  I'm not saying it's cheap but you know the adage; you get what you pay for. The staff are so friendly its like they are family members. The room we were allocated was fantastic. The Skyline bar offers a fantastic view of venice. The water taxi service to San Marco was very convenient and always on time. The food was good, the Peroni flowed and the Barolo was sublime.  I wholeheartedly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
