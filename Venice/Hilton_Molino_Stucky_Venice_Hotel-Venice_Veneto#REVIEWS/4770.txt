When I booked this hotel I did not pay attention to the fact that it was on the main island so I was a little worried; however, they have a shuttle that takes to the san Marco Square every hour and back. They also have the service to take you to where they make the Venetian glass. The service at the hotel was good specially at the restaurant. The breakfast buffet is very good! Do not expect wow, but it is definetely a good option!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
