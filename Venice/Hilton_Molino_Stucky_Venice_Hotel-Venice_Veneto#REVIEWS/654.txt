Amazing Hotel and staff. Right on the water with a shuttle to take you back and forth. The restaurants and bars have great food. The pool on the top floor is great for relaxing and the spa amenities are reasonably priced. I suggest staying here, an award winning hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our day here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
