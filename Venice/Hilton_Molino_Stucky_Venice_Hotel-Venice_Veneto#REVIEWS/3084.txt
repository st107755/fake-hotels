I have stayed a few times in this hotel and it is definitely my favorite in Venice, although you always need a boat to get to the 'busy' and 'touristy' part of Venice. The rooms are covenant and spacious although they might need some refurbishing. Breakfast buffet is great. I was there last February for a seminar and on my way out I bumped into the Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis who was attending a seminar too. Funny to see a communist here.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 20, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you so much for taking the time to review us on Tripadvisor and for choosing us again, this time for a conference.
