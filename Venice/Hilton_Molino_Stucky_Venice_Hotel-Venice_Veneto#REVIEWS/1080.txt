This is the second time, I have stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice and both have been great.  The hotel is lovely with great views, a very good restaurant and an awesome rooftop bar, and a rare Venice hotel with a Pool.  Rooftop Pool with amazing views of Venice.  I like the location, but it is not in central Venice, but on one of the surrounding islands. They have a shuttle boat that runs constantly back and forth to St. Marco's Square and it works very well.  You just have to make sure you catch the last boat, or you will have an $$$$ water taxi bill.  I love this hotel and I have only one minor issue.  Why is the pool kept so cold?  I was happy to cool off after a hot Aug day walking in Venice, but there pool is like getting in an Ice bath.  We still did :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor. I am pleased  that you decided to stay with us again and that your experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was positive also this time. It is also important to know that you like the quietness of the Giudecca island and to be away from the centre of Venice and from the more crowded areas. We appreciate your comments with regards to the pool water temperature and I would like to confirm that due to high occupancy we usually change the water very often in the summer period. Thank you for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back very soon for another memorable experience. With kind regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
