We have stayed here before and it is still top notch. Location is great with shuttle directly from hotel to San Marco and other places. Rooms are just perfect, with tasteful decor and great functionality. We parked the car at the main terminal and went by public transportation to the hotel. Very convenient!  Staff is outstanding and very attentive. We loved everything about this hotel. Will continue to come back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 24, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
