When I came to Venice, I was expecting crowds, tourists, and everything else that comes with an overly burdened place. My experience at Venice was made all the better by staying at the Molino Stucky. I kept my expectations low and ended up coming away with a good deal. Everyday I was treated better because I was alone, not something everyone would do. My room was clean, quiet and had a wonderful bathtub. Every day I had a warm and delicious breakfast replete with Prosecco. This hotel is not everyone. But for someone who wants a good and safe place to stay, this would be a good bet. The old adage when traveling in Italy is you get what you pay for. If you want to be treated for EU80, then you will get that. I always stay at a Hilton when I'm abroad and I got more than I wanted.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
