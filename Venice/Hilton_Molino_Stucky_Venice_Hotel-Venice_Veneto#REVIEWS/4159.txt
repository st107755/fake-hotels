As a diamond member with Hilton I always get treated very well and the Hilton Molina Stucky was no exception. Everyone from the front desk to the breakfast attendant was very nice. We got upgraded to a suite and it was very nice with a great view across the water to St Mark's. The hotel provides a free water shuttle that is easy to use and runs most of the day and night. The bar on top of the hotel is very classy (and expensive) and provides a modern experience in an old city. The breakfast in the morning was full American buffet and kept us full until dinner.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
