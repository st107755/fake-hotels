Outstanding customer service with friendly staff. Excellent breakfast and away from a crowd. This hotel offers ferry services to the main area where all actions takes place which was fun. Its just 15 to 20 minutes ferry ride away from the busy area of Marks Cathedral, Duomo and other museums. Great view from the ferry and very gorgeous hotelRead moreDate of stay: July 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 5, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
