This hotel is magnificient. Room are very moderns and bright. Huge space even in signle room. The hotel is all about exposed brick and wood beams. The food is great and the bar and pool on the roof gives you a fantastic view of the city. There is free shuttle that run every 20 minutes to San marco place. The hotel is very easely accessible either by public transport or private taxi. The staff is amazing and they will assist you with anything you need.   the only downside is that the hotel is located on an island in front of Venice, so you need to take a shuttle every time you want to go out.   I would recommend this place to anyone going to visit venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
