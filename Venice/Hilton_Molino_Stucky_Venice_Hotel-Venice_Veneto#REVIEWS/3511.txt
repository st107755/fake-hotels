I stayed her in April 2012 and in March 2012. Well appointed Rooms. Caters to an upscale crowd. Cost is high compared to the smaller classic hotels of Venice, but you are staying in a historic building and right on the judeca canal on La judeca island. The Molino Stucky was the site of the Stucky Flour Mill in the mid and late 1800's. They have several restaurants to choose from and have a variety of room types too. Very accommodating staff and Management. If you want a bit of American Hotel concepts you will like this place over the smaller European hotels. Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
