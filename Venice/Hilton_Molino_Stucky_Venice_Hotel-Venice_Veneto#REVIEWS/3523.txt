Stayed here and found the location and the transportation into Venice well organised, especially if you had a ticket for the public system and were prepared to walk less than 5 minutes.

I am pleased to read that you appreciated the history of the Molino Stucky, an ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, recently restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice.
