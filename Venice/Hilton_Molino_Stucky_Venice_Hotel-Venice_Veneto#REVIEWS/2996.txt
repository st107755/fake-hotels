Beautiful hotel and very scenic, ridiculous prices for food and drinks. The hotel served raw gluten free pasta and tried to charge 25€ for it. They accused us of using the mini bar and added this to our hotel bill, we genuinely never touched it. When we questioned it we were treated like liars: Breakfast is expensive at 30€ per person. The hotel also add 10€ a night tax so expect this at the end of your stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 1, 2015Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We regret that we did not entirely meet your expectations and are sorry that you have found prices to be expensive as we always strive to meet our guest’s expectations and to comply with their requests. We acknowledge your comments, though we assure you that prices of food and beverage in our bars and restaurants are in line with other 5-stars hotels in Venice. May we take this opportunity to explain the invoicing procedures of the minibar: our Minibars have an automatic billing system. When items are removed (to store for instance other products) or moved for a minimum time (20 seconds), the corresponding amount is automatically added to the hotel bill. For this reason guests are always asked at check-out if they have used the minibar. In case of a negative reply, if a minibar item appears in the invoice, it is automatically deleted and not charged. Although you express some disappointment, we hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
