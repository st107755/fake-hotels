We remained 2 nights having booked an executive room with sight of venice through a tour operator. When we arruved the front desk told us that the room was not a room with sight of the city. We neded up in a very large executive roome that however was old and ran down. In he middle of he nihht we realized that the room was resting over a massive generator room and the floor was shaking. The following day we complained and were moved to another executive room, again wihout sight.  We were suppposed to have a welcome pack in the room that never arrived...we stopped at tje concierge desk to inquire and they gave us a pack of pasta!! Despite the terrible experience we were only offered apologies...a discount or free drinks would have been a partial conpensation...will never returnâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
