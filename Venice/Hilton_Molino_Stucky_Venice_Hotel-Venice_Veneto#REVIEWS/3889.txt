The Hilton Stucky Hotel in Venice is a superb 5* hotel on an adjacent island with a fast and frequent water taxi service to San Marco (10 minutes). It is ideally placed for Zatere and leading to Accademia on the Grand Canal. All just a few minutes away.  In fact I think better than staying on the main island or in the north of it.  Booked through Fleetway Travel, which was a very good deal indeed. This was especially so as our original room was so hot due to Italian laws prohibiting the the use of air conditioning at certain times of the year (beware!) that we asked to be moved during the first night. The hotel was superb, giving us a cool room for that night and then upgrading us to a suite for the rest of our stay. The whole cost of the holiday would not stretch to this roomâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
