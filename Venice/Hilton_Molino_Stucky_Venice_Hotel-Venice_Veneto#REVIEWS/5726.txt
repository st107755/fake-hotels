Spent the night at the Hilton Stuckey prior to flying home. A wonderful facility in the heart of Venice. Great dinning, pool, lounges and all. The hotel provides a water shuttle across the canel for easy access to the bustling main areas of Venice. Once  across you are a short walk to St Marks, great shopping and numerous attractions. The staff of the Hotel were excellent and very helpful. Great dining in small sidewalk cafes nearby also.Read moreDate of stay: June 2009HelpfulShare
