We are sorry if the location in Giudecca did not meet your expectations and we do regret that you did not find our complimentary shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs. We can offer a guaranteed maximum number of seats (39) and we are sorry that during your stay you were experiencing some difficulties in finding available space. As an alternative the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutes’ walk away and it connects any part of Venice with regular departures every 12 minutes until late at night.  We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
