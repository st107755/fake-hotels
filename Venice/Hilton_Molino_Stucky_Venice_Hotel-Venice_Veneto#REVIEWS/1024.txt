Family trip, stayed in September. Had an "Executive Suite, with View" which was spacious and well appointed although looked a little tired. There is no balcony or outdoor space, but there was an amazing view.  Hotel operate a great boat service to and from the St M's Sq and we made good use of this.   There is a rooftop pool, the view is stunning. The water temperature is shocking (not heated!!). It's a real shame as if this was a heated pool it would have been a great feature, but as it was, no one was on the roof other than to take a photo and go back inside.  Staff were all friendly and very helpful, room was clean and well kept. Restaurants were excellent, although a little above the market rate.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
