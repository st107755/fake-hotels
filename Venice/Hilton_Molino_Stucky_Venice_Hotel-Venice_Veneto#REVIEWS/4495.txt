Hotel is three stops from San Marco but at least has a free shuttle service to the piazza. Coffee in Italy is 3 - 4 euros. The Hilton charges 6 Euros. It's not just excessive it's rude. Guests should be encouraged to use the lobby and not feel ripped  off by greedy management. The rooms with a view are great. Is not an intimate Hotel. Lots of corridors and rooms. Venice has become shabby and smelly. It is over priced and tourists are not stupid.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
