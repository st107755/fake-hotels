The check-in process was fine, however upon getting to the room it began to go downhill. To start the TV didn't work (not a huge issue as we're here to enjoy Venice) and we called reception and it was sorted out quite promptly which was good.  We then noticed a wad of human hair on the bathroom wall. This I found to be quite disgusting and not what I was expecting from a 5 star hotel. It made it clear that the room had not been properly cleaned after the last guest. This was confirmed when I found that one of the glasses on our table was dirty.  Housekeeping didn't really seem to care. I also contacted the customer relations email but they just blew it off as an isolated incident.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 3, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
