We went to Venice as a wedding anniversary break. We booked the Hilton Molino Stucky because of advice from our travel agent. So glad we took her advice the hotel is nothing short of superb. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating, the three restaurants were so good that we didn't have dinner out at all during our three night stay. The room was lovely with a view of the city and every possible extra, quality hair drier, safe, TV, mini fridge etc. The hotel has a rooftop pool from which you get amazing views of Venice it has a bar as well as permanent supervision. I really can't think of anything to fault this place.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
