We just stayed here one night but enjoyed out stay.  The prices for necessarues seemef a bit high.  The lobby bar was telaxing and the staff wss pleasant.  The view from the rooftop bar is excellent, especially at night.  The food was ok.  Our room had an inside window viewing the Nutella garden.  The room was nicely decorated with normal hotel amenities.  The hotel runs a shuttle boat ever half hour or so across the canal to a central location.  It is free.  We did not take advantage of their health club.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
