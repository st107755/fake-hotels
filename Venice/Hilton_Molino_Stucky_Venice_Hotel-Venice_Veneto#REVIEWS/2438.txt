My son treated me to a wonderful break in Venice at the beginning of December and had the good taste to book this hotel. What a marvellous time we had! Venice was beautiful and not overcrowded. The hotel, staff and food was fantastic. The room was very generous and comfortable. The breakfast selection was the best I have every seen and the restaurant food was delicious.
