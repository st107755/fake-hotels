I was staying here during Superstorm Sandy and my flight home was cancelled. I tried calling the airline from my room and my cell phone, but couldn't get a number that would work in Italy. I went to the front desk and a lovely concierge named Federica Tomaino went out of her way to place the call and help arrange my flight home. By the next morning, travelers were being told they would be stranded for up to a week. Thanks to Federica, I made it onto the first international flight to land in Philadelphia after the storm, in time to attend a wedding that was really important to me. Thanks so much, Federica! Your excellent customer service made all the difference.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 18, 2012Dear  Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience.
