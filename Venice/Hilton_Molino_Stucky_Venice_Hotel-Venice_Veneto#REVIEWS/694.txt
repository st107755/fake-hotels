We are also sorry that you did not enjoy our location on the Giudecca island and with regards to transportation, I would like to confirm that the Alilaguna blue and red lines stop in front of the hotel and the boat goes to/from the airport until late at night. Thank you for your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you with us again in the future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
