First time in Venice and couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay in. Spotlessly clean apart from a LOT of dust on top of the wardrobes. No, i wasn't doing a '4 in a bed' trick. I put our cases up there and when i pulled one down, i was actually showered with dust. Apart from that, lovely place. Staff very attentive and pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them. We were on the 7th floor and the rooms were very hot even with the heating turned off but kept the windows opened all night, it helped. Massive beds and huge marshmallow pillows. If you can, take some brew kit with you because they only give you 2 milks a day even when we asked for more. And don't move anything in the mini bar. It goes on your room bill. We had to prove that we hadn't drunk anything.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 17, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for taking the time to write this review on Tripadvisor.
