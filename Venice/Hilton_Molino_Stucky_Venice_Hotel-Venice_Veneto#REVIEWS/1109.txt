I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I have been to Venice many times but never stayed on the Giudecca before. This was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Venice. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and it is so nice to be on the Giudecca away from the crowds. You get an absolutely amazing view of the city from the roof deck bar and pool and the shuttle to San Marco is quick and easy.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
