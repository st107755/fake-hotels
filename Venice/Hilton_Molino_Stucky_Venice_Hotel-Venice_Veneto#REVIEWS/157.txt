Best feature, for us, was the rooftop bar. Great drinks and snacks, accompanied by a fabulous view. It had a cool breeze, even on a hot day. We had a delicious dinner on the patio.

Charming and amazing service.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 24, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
