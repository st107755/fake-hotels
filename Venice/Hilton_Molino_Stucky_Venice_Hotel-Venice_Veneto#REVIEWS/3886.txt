The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was a great choice for our first trip to Venice.  We were only there for 3 days but the staff made us feel welcome and at home.  The room amenities were nice for the smaller rooms you see in Europe and we really enjoyed the location on Giudecca.  The shuttle boats were quick and convenient to get to other parts of Venice.  The little restaurant that's just a 10 minute walk from the hotel is amazing as well - the best meal I had in all of Italy!  We would stay here again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
