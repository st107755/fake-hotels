Recently stayed in Venice on a work conference, fantastic place to visit for a few days only. We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky, very nice hotel indeed and were lucky enough to have a Venice view room, fantastic to wake up to that view even when a cruiseliner passes by. The skybar in the evening is a very cool place to have a drink whilst watching the sun set over Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
