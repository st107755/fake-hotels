No complaints this was a beautiful hotel.  The fairy to get back at night always had a dreadfully long line, but it was ok to get out during the day.  The gym could be better,but I could say that about every hotel I stayed in while in Europe.  Overall it was a great stay, and I would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 31, 2015Dear Madame,  thank you  for your positive comments.
