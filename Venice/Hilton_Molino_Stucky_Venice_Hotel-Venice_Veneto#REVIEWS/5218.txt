We stayed at the Molino Stucky for 2 nights. We visited Venice for our anniversary and this hotel did not disapoint! We were upgraded to an executive suite with a view of the lagoon. Amazing! We were also surprised with champaign and strawberrys as an anniversary gift.The location is perfect, the complementary boats are frequent and timely. The staff are helpful and friendly. The roof top bar is a must. We can't wait to get back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Sir, Thank you for your excellent review of the Molino Stucky Hilton.
