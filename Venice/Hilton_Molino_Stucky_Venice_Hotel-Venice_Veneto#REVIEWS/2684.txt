I would highly recommend this hotel as it is beautiful, clean and spacious. Easy to reach here from train station and also easy and quick access to San Marco by the complimentary hotel water shuttle or by public vaporetto. Nice to come back to this hotel after a day sightseeing as it is away from the crowd and at the same time not far too. Breakfast spread is excellent. One of our favourite hotels so far.
