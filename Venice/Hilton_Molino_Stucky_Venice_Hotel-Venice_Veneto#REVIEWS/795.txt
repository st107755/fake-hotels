We didn’t spend to much time in the hotel due to being outside exploring Venice. However the time spent in the hotel was fantastic. All staff were very helpful and attentive.  We dined in the restaurant for one of the evenings, we didn’t have a booking but they were able to squeeze us in. Food was good and staff were very attentive.  The added bonus was the shuttle boat which took us across the water which was very convenient for us as we were constantly going backwards and forward from the hotel.  All in all very goos stay here with brilliant staff.
