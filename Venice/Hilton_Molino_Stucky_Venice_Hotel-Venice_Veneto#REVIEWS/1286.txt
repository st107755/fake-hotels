A wonderful hotel, and it IS worth the upgrade to get a spectacular view of Venice from Guidecca island.  Makes it a little less chaotic from being in a cramped hotel on the island, which is relaxing. Just allow for boat time to get to the main Venice island (and you see beautiful views).  You can pay for the Hilton shuttle boat or buy an ACTV public pass which can include not only unlimited boat rides to many stops, but also can get one-way or round-trip bus passes to Marco Polo airport. We did the ACTV 3 day pass and worked perfect.   Executive lounge privileges are nice both for a limited breakfast and evening snack/drink. Rooftop pool is open air with great views. Nice walk in evening to have outdoor dinner, and days are gloriously long.   Would definitely stay here again.
