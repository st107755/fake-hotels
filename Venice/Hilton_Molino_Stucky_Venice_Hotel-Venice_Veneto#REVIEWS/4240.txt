Beautiful hotel, got a suite, amazing view from the pool, breakfast could be better, busy but very helpful staff.  Even though it's not on main island, free shuttles cross the canal all the time, so you hardly miss it.  Definitely would stay there again!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
