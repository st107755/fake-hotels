Great location just away from the main islands of Venice with a shuttle boat that runs regularly (but is not free, check out the hidden cost when checking out). 1st room we were offered smelt bad, 2nd room was great. Quiet and spacious with lots of natural light. The bar is a complete rip off. 75 Euros for 4 drinks. However, overall, friendly staff and a couple of good local restaurants near by.
