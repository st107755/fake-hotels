I stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky for 3 nights and really enjoyed the hotel. I liked the quiet island and found either the hotel shuttle or valporetta service to work well for me. It made wandering over Venice an easy adventure to always know where the shuttle would pick me up to return home.  I had no problems with being lost trying to find a hotel.  The breakfast was terrific and the afternoon HHonors lounge was excellent.  I was upgraded to a suite which was lovely. The staff was very helpful.  This was a great experience on my first visit to Venice.  The rooftop bar was fun in the evening and the pool was beautiful.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
