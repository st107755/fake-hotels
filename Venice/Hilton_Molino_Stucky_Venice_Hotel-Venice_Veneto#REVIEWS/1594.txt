We stayed in a city-side, two-room suite that was spacious for two married adults and an adult child.   The breakfast buffet was very crowded and the lounge was not very luxurious.   The shuttle service from the hotel meant that it was not easy to return to the hotel during the day, but we didn't mind staying out all day.   We enjoyed sitting in the spa and the view from the rooftop bar.   If you are a Hilton Honors member, it is worth staying at this hotel to visit the city of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
