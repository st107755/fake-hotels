I cannot say enough good things about this property.  The staff were great, the rooftop pool was amazing, the property is beautiful and we could see the crowds of Venice from the windows in our quiet room. We stayed here because we have been to Venice several times and wanted something less hectic before boarding a cruise ship that left directly across the canal from the hotel. However, they had a water taxi available for a nominal fee that would have allowed us to explore Venice and return to a much quieter environment.  While the property food was good, we found several great places along the canal with great food and views!
