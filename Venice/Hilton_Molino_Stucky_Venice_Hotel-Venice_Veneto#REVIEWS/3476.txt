Spent two days at the hotel pre Eastern Med cruise and one day afterwards. It was a good way to explore the city before hand and then afterwards, we were able to see finish up our visit. The hotel is less than ten minutes from the port, on the Guiadecca Canal. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. They offer a complementary  shuttle to and from St.. Marks Square. They also offer a shuttle to Murano. This includes a tour of a glass blowing factory. Executive lounge very well stocked and has beautiful views of the canal. Take your camera to the pool as the views from there are breathtaking.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you  for your positive comments on TripAdvisor page.
