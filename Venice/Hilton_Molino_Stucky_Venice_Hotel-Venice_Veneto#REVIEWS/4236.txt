Hotel rooms with US standards in Italy are hard to find. Thank heavens my husband has the uncanny ability to pick the best for an economical cost! He found this one for $242 a night in Sept in Venice. They had a free shuttle to and from the city -was SO nice!  The room was fabulous and the people very kind. It was so quiet it was perfect. Bed was firm and air was great. Free wi-fi in lobby was lightening fast. Would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
