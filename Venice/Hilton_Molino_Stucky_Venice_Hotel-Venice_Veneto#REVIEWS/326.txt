The dock is literally in front of the door leading to the check in counter which was great. A really pleasant boat ride from the airport (about 15 min). The hotel is really lovely and the service by everyone from the check in counter, concierge lounge and rooftop bar was superb. Everyone spoke flawless English and were so helpful and friendly. The room was nice and had old world charm. One flaw--being from South Florida, I am used to air conditioning....there is a "lock" on the thermostat and you can only move it by 3 degrees. We were really hot in the room and had to call the desk several times to ask them to make the room temperature more comfortable. They complied each time. It was easy to get around and the walk along the waterway was exquisite. Highly recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 31, 2019Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind review and comments on TripAdvisor.
