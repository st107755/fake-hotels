This hotel was a nice break from the chaos of Venice.  It was great that it was on a separate island than Venice - much quieter and great views.  I would recommend buying a pass for the water bus instead of waiting on the hotel shuttle which is pretty small and enclosed. The rooms were great and the air conditioning was just like at home.  We received vouchers to use the wireless internet for free, but it only is in the common areas.  The pool is small and overcrowded so we did not use it at all.  The breakfast buffet was amazing, but make sure you pre-pay to have it included in your room rate otherwise it is pretty expensive.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
