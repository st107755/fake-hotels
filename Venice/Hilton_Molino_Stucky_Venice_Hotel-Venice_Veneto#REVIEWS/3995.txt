This was a surprise from my husband for our wedding anniversary and we went for four nights in August - the hotel was amazing - it looked stunning from the outside and been well refurbished.  It was well situated we used the water taxi after breakfast to go across the water to all the sights - the weather was amazing and we did spend one day sunbathing on the rooftop hotel and looking out at the views which were spectacular - the rooms were comfortable although a little small for 3 people - breakfast was excellent with lots of choice would definitely recommend and would return - had a wonderful time visiting VeniceRead moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
