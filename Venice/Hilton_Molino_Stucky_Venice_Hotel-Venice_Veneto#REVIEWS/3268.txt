A nice enough hotel. Staff not all that friendly/helpful. Nice breakfast buffet...lots of choices. DO NOT GO IN WINTER. Not all of the restaurants are open in winter and too cold to leave the hotel for dinner. Also, hard to find at night. Try to arrive before 4pm.   This is a Summer hotel for sure  (rooftop bar etc)Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor. We are sorry we did not live up to your expectations. Though you felt isolated, we still hope you enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city.  May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
