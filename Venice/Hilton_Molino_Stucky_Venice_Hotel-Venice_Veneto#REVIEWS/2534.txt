We booked this hotel because we are loyal Hilton Diamond members. We wanted something close to the cruise port and central location for things to do. This hotel is perfect! Our room was sooo nice with tall ceiling, great decor and facing the Grand Canal. Our water taxi from the airport took us to the pier at the front door of the hotel. We had a large window that would open to give us a great experience watching the activity on the canal. The lobby is great. Location is just around the corner on the canal from St. Marks Square. I highly recommend!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 9, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor.
