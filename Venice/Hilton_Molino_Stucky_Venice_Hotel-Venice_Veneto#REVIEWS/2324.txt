Although I did not stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, me and my boyfriend visited for dinner at the Bacaromi Restaurant and drinks at the Skyline Rooftop Bar at the hotel very recently.   We were incredibly impressed with the professionalism and service from the hotel staff, who pointed us to the right direction of the restaurant and the bar. The Bacaromi restaurant and Skyline bar were excellent and again first class service from the servers and bartenders in these also.  Would recommend to visit!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your nice comments on our Bacaromi restaurant and Skyline Bar, where we are pleased to welcome also outside Guests who can enjoy a great offer of drinks and beverage, while taking pleasure of the fantastic Venice and lagoon views.
