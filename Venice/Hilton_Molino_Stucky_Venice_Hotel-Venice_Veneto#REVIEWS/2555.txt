It represents one of the most important pieces of industrial architecture in Italy and though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture.

We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.   Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
