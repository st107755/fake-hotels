This hotel was perfect in every way! We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed it very much! The staff where very friendly and always happy to help, the breakfast was delicious with so much choice and variety and the gym was spot on with a cardio room and a weights room. The location was lovely, outside of Venice's main islands but an easy 15min boat ride to them. The hotel has a shuttle boat charged at â‚¬4.5 per person for duration of stay. Will defiantly stay there again if I return to Venice!
