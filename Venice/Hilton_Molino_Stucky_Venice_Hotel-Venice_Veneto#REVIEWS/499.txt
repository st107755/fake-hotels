Back in June, I stayed at this hotel two nights pre-cruise.   The hotel has a beautiful lobby and lounge area.   The hotel is unique in design as it seems to combine sections of buildings so you could be going around a number of halls to find your room.   As has been mentioned, a nice roof top pool area.  The hotel is located on island across from the main areas of Venice so you will need to take the ferry back and forth.   One is in front of the hotel and runs limited hours and another is walking distance from hotel.  Nearby the hotel itself there are only a few places to eat/drink and not really any place to shop.   Hotel is elegant and nice place to stay as it is out of the hustle and bustle area of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
