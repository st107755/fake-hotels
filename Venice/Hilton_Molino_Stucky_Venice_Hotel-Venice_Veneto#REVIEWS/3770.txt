Fourth stay at this hotel. Great location across from Venice proper. Quiet streets to walk on island. Rooms and staff are excellent. I still think the executive lounge should be moved back to the top floor where it was when the hotel opened. Would always stay here when in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 10, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for your positive review. I am pleased you decided to stay with us again and that your experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was positive also this time.
