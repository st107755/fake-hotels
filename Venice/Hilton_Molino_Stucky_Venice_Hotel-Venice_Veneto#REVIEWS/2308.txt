Love Hilton hotels!! The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel didn't disappoint either! We had some feelings prior to arriving that maybe we needed to be on the mainland of Venice and not the Guidecca island where the Hilton is located. But we had no trouble getting to and from the hotel and the mainland. Our breakfast was fantastic each morning! The buffet was amazing! Nothing left undone! Such great service! Thank you Hilton! We'll be back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2016Dear Sir, dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review.

We are looking forward to welcoming you soon again here at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni   General Manager Read more
