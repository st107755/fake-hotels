We booked at a 'special' price.  Lovely interesting hotel on Guidecca Island. Nice spacious classic room with marble ensuite and quality fittings. Check in and out no problems, staff very polite. The shuttle service is excellent  and reliable. Great casual pizza and pasta place ( eat inside or by the water)  as well as a great gelati shop straight accross the water at Zattere (Vaporetto stop). You can also walk through to the Acadamia bridge and on to Rialto or San Marco.  Saturday night at the hotel is Latin Dancing night which was fun. The swimming pool area and lounge is superb. Have a drink and a snack and enjoy the 5 star views. Superb! Yes, its expensive however it is 5 stars and it is an experience not forgotten!Read moreDate of stay: September 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
