I don't usually give 5 stars to a hotel, but in this case its deserved...  Great hotel, i really enjoyed it. The room was fabulous, we got a corner room with a view to Venice. The bathroom was very clean, the room was modern, and nicely decorated.The bkfast buffet was large with lots of options.  The only worry that we had when we booked the hotel was the location, but after arriving we found that the free shuttle was perfect. We actually preferred the shuttle as we enjoyed the ride into Venice...  Highly recommended!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
