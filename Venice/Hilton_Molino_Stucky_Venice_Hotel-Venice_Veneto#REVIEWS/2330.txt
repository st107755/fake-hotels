I have stayed at the Molino Stucky on three occasions and for me it is the best Hilton in the world. The beautiful old building, stylish decor and the setting on the Canale della Giudecca is hard to beat. But the very best part of this hotel is the staff who go out of their way to be helpful and are always charming and friendly. There is one member of staff who epitomised all those qualities and more, the Assistant Front Office Manager, LLaria Carini. Ms Carini quite literally made our stay one of the best short breaks we have ever had and I would like to thank her and all the great staff for their wonderful service. Will I be returning to the Molino Stucky?  You bet, as soon and as often as I can.
