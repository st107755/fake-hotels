Please accept our apologies for the problems in your room, which have been addressed to the Housekeeper for action and review. We are also very sorry you did not enjoy the mattress and duvet, as we receive lovely feedback on their comfort level. The Roof Top Pool is indeed open on a seasonal basis (15th May to September), however the Skyline Bar and terraces are open every day of the year (from 5 PM until after midnight) and our guests can enjoy a unique and spectacular view over the city of Venice and its lagoon.  I am sorry to hear that you have been disappointed here at our hotel but I hope you'll give us another chance to welcome you and prove you that we can do better.  Sincerely  Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
