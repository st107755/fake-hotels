This is an amazing property located in the Giudecca portion of Venice. The hotel is a converted pasta factory and the decor reflects a substantial amount of work done to turn into a world class property while maintaining a lovely homage to its' history. The room we had was absolutely exquisite (King bed, executive suite) with wonderful views. The hotel has several great dining options (will be reviewed separately) and the hotel staff is incredibly friendly, helpful and accommodating. We are already planning a return to the area and this hotel given how convenient it is to the #2 vaparetto line (the magic boat line)!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 4, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting a positive review about us on TripAdvisor.
