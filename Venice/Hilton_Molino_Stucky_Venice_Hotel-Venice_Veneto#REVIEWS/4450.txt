This is a very nice hotel that is on the banks of Giudecca Island just across the water from Venice.  They have a free shuttle boat over to Venice with two drop off points, including St. Markâ€™s Square.   The views from the rooftop pool are amazing.  Do not eat at the hotel restaurant, Rialto Lobby Bar and Lounge, as the food is expensive and very poor quality.  Make the effort and go over to Venice for all of your meals.  Due to the high cost of this hotel it is a great place to use Hilton points for a free stay.  To get there from the Piazzale Roma train station you can hire a private water taxi for about 50 euros or just take the water bus (7 euros) line 2 to Zattere. From there you can take the free Hilton hotel shuttle boat.  The hotel staff was very friendly.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 8, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
