We stayed at this hotel during a recent visit to Venice.  The main areas of the hotel were impressive and the reception staff friendly.  Our room was a bit disappointing - small and facing an interior courtyard, looking at the dining room.  We found that it was too far away from Piazza San Marco where the action is.  There is a free hotel shuttle but it does not run very frequently and takes time to cross over to San Marco.  Breakfast buffet was very sumptuous and dining staff were very accommodating and not snooty like in other five star hotels in Italy.  Since we were in Venice for only two days, we would have preferred a more central location.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2012Dear guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky  We are sorry that the room that was assigned to you  was not up to your expectations.
