This is a luxury hotel, the location and the facillities are excellent! Nothing was too much trouble and when we were missing a bottle opener in the room it was here in a flash using the "magic" Service We got a free upgrade to a sea view room when we checked in for no extra cost! we stayed three nights and was so sad to leave The place was magical, the hotel and staff were excellent and we will definately be returning! Free shuttle boat and free upgrades, the breakfast was amazing! I could go on forever! Thankyou Hilton Venice for out magical romantic 5 year anniversary trip!
