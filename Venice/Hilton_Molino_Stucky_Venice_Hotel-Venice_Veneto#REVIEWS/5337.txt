Beautiful hotel, great views (we were on the 7th floor), but the shuttle service was not very convenient.  If you missed the shuttle at the top of the hour (i.e. because there were too many people waiting to get on) then the wait for the next shuttle is 40 minutes.  Thought the cost of the breakfast buffet was too expensive.  The rooms were nice and clean.  Bathroom offers both a bathtub and separate shower - which is a nice option.  Would not opt to stay here again as it was a bit out of the way.  The shared water taxi to the airport was a good value, but again, the time options were not very traveller friendly.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2011Dear Guest,  First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
