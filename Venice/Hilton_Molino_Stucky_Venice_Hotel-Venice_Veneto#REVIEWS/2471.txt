Must stay here when in Venice. The view across the grand canal onto Venice is nice. The rooms are cozy and  clean. The restaurant is fantastic. Private shuttle on site that takes you for 3.50 Euros (total per stay charged to your room )  to the palazzo Ducale and the basilica de San Marcos. The main attraction in Venice.
