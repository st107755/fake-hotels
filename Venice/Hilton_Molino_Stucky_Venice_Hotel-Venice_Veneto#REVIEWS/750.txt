My husband and I were really  happy with the service food and location. The best part for us was the the rooftop club. It has Pretty view. Great Music and dance floor. This Hotel would also be good for families with children old enough to stay in room alone since the club is in the Hotel. Breakfast bar was very basic. Rooms are nice clean and comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 29, 2018Dear Madame, thank you very much for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
