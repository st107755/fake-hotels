My husband and I celebrated our first year of marriage and belated honeymoon in Venice and had the pleasure of staying at this magnificent hotel. We had a lovely suite with everything we needed. My husband used the spa and had a fabulous treatment. We used the incredible rooftop pool with the most wonderful uninterrupted Venice views. The roof top restaurant is worth staying on this hotels private island for, but then a trip across to the main town was so easy with the hotel's private water taxi service. We were made to feel so special during our stay and have recommended this hotel to many friends and family since.
