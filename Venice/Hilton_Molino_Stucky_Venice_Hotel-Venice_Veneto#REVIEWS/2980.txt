This Hilton, in a refurbished old Flour Mill, is situated 15 mins boat ride away from San Marco. We found its location and the cheap hotel boat gave us the best of both worlds - easy access to the main tourist area of Venice plus the delightful island of Giudecca. Staff and food excellent. We found wifi slow at times and the fact that it did not work on the pool deck was aggravating and a shame!
