For something different take a vaporetto over to the Giudecca Island and visit the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel.  This is truly a modern Venetian masterpiece. They took an old flourmill and restored it to offer 379 rooms and suites, a conference center, and the second largest spa in Venice - along with bars and restaurants and the incredible views from the Skyline Bar.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 27, 2018Dear Madame, thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor. This ancient building, originally a flour mill and factory, was restored and reconverted to the biggest hotel in Venice. It represents one of the most important examples of industrial architecture in Italy and though not typically Venetian in style, it is a milestone in the XIX century architecture. The hotel is located on the Giudecca island, a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minutes boat ride from the city centre and it is especially appreciated by visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition. We thank you for visiting us and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
