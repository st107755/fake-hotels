Hilton Molino Stucky made our 3 nights/4 days so special and memorable. The hotel is lovely with the roof top pool fabulous to cool down in after a day of walking around Venice. You can swim and take in the amazing views over Venice. From the Skyline bar you can watch the sun set over a glass of Prosecco. Breakfast  is fabulous and the free  boat  service to San Marco is worth its weight in gold as the crossing to San Marco would normally be 60 Euros in a water taxi . We had an executive room on 5th floor overlooking the water and Venice. Couldn't fault it and wouldn't stay anywhere else if we go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
