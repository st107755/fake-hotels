Had a great stay which dates included my my birthday. All the staff were fantasic and could not do enough for you. The hotel is very different to most hotels and this just made our visit more enjoyable, love the boat trips from the hotel to St. Marks. On the day of my birthday got back to our room to find a bottle of wine and a cake, how nice was that (how did they know?). Hope to visit again soon, thank's Molino Stucky Hilton for a great holiday and birthday.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 3, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
