We bought a package through Secret Escapes and if we hadn't I don't think the stay would have quite been worth the money. There were a few issues with the room, it was old, no free Wifi, shower was slippy and the air con just didn't work. The lobby, bard and restaurants were all lovely however, and the staff were excellent. We had a particularly nice waiter call Enrico in the Rialto Bar who was just fantastic the whole holiday.  Would recommend if you get a discount, otherwise could probably get a more luxury hotel closer to the city center for the price.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
