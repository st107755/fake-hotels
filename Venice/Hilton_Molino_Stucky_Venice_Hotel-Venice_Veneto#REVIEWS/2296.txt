The room is excellent, the staff is great, and it is in a perfect location.  We stayed here for two nights, and boy was it worth it.  Incredible hotel, and had a great experience.

This must just be a thing in Europe, but wow.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 30, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
