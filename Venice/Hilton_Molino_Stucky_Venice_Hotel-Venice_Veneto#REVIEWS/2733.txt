This will be my fifth visit to the Hilton Molino Stucky. It is an amazing hotel with wonderful staff, a great position, great breakfast ( love the chocolate muffins) and a superb roof top pool from which to watch the cruise ships come in and out and also have a refreshing dip. The skyline bar is also amazing with stunning views across Venice. The shuttle boat is helpful to get across the canal although it can be a little difficult to get on at peak times. I was also disappointed to find that on this last visit it is no longer complimentary although the charge is minimal.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 28, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on Tripadvisor and for your loyalty to our brand.
