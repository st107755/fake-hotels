We spent two nights here prior to getting a cruise and it was excellent. The room was superb and the service overall was very good.  We had B&B and although the breakfast was OK it was chaotic at times as they have several rooms for seating and it is a self service buffet.With this in mind we decided not to have any further meals here. The location is across from the main Venetian island however the shuttle boat service works well and the views from this side are excellent. Would definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 28, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
