Great hotel, great location, slightly away from the maddening crowds, shuttle boat service makes it all work. Spacious rooms. But, But, But - watch the incredible prices that are charged for just about everything, food costs ridiculous, drinks the same and they even charge for internet (€27 per day!). Great shame as the costs drive residents out of the hotel and in to town. Amazing how many people are on the early shuttle boats heading across to get breakfast at a cafe, instead of paying the inflated price in the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 15, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on this website.  We are glad you enjoyed the location, our complimentary shuttle boat and your accommodation. Howewer, we are sorry you found that our prices are not convenient and on the lack of information you might have experienced on the charges for breakfast at our Restaurant, which may vary: if the package is bought at the moment of the reservation or at check-in for the duration of the stay with us, the rate is more convenient and – in general – our guests express their appreciation for the quality and the value of the service offered.  We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely, Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
