We are in Italy for 3 months and our daughter flew in to Venice for a brief visit. We used the Hilton because of the great experience at the Florence Hilton. The Hotel is very well appointed and the rooms a good size. The staff are very helpful and friendly. We booked executive rooms so that we could take advantage of the lounge but were disappointed to find that this did not include WiFi (except in the lounge) which was disappointing. We asked for rooms next to each other and were assured at check in that this was the case - but it was not so and would have been to much bother to change so we did not complain at the time! The lounge "happy hour" was good with a good selection of food and wine. We went to the roof bar and the barman gave us a great tour of the Venice skyline.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 23, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor. I am glad to read that you appreciated the helpulnes of our Team Members and that you had a positive breakfast and Executive Lounge experience. With regards to the Tronchetto car parking may I confirm that only the public vaporetto service connects it to the Giudecca island while our complimentary shuttle service goes from the Hilton Molino Stucky to Zattere and S. Marco area. Unfortunately to have a public ACTV stop exactly in front of the hotel is not permitted but the walk to the Palanca station is only few minutes away and easy to find. Thank you for being our guest and I hope to have the chance to welcome you and your family soon again.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
