I had visited Venice many years ago and was not particularly impressed, in fact I said I would never come back. This hotel changed all that. I stayed here for 2 nights as part of an organized tour and have to say this hotel won me over. Great location, spacious clean rooms made a welcome change after all the tiny hotel rooms across the rest of Italy. Breakfast was excellent, and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. I have since returned to Venice and I am booked in to this hotel again this August.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
