My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights with our Insight Grand Tour of Italy and Sicily Tour. We had a lovely corner room surrounded by floor to ceiling windows, with a view of the interior grounds. The bathroom was large and luxurious, and we loved the Murano glass chandelier in the bedroom. Most comfy bed in our whole tour. The location is beautiful with far reaching views. The rooftop pool and bar have even better sweeping views. The cruise ships literally pass right in front of the hotel. There is a boat shuttle to take you straight to the heart of Venice. This is a converted flour mill with tons of history and ambience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
