My husband fell in love with Venice on this trip and I feel it has a lot to do with this hotel. We were lucky enough to use out HHonors points to stay here and it was well worth it. The staff was amazing and the hotel is beautiful.  Some may complain that the boat back and forth takes to long but as long as you look at the schedule and show up 20-30 mins early your fine. I also.love the priority room they had off to the side. If your a Hilton member it was great for snacks and refreshments. All in all we are going back to Venice in 2015 and will be staying here again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory and that you will come back next year.
