We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Venice! We enjoyed our stay att he hhotel, we took a water taxi in since our lilttle one was just too tired and we didnt want the hassle etc.  We arrived and were greeted by the reception team warmly and upgraded to a suite which we didnt expect at all, it was lovely! The hotel was very clean and well kept, location was not brilliant and if we go again we would probabaly stay somewhere closer to the main area however with a child it was nice to get away from all the craziness and relax in luxury. We ate at the Aromi too which was just lovely, very good wine and food, attentive waiters and good service. Breakfast was good too, a wide selction and attentive staff again! We really enjoyed the stay and would maybe stay here again if weâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
