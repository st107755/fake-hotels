We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky for 5 days and loved it. The refurbished old building has a good vibe to it.  Although we didn't like the room that was appointed to us, the Reception quickly changed it so we could enjoy the beautiful views over the canal. The hotel is located outside the center of Venice, but the hotel shuttle conveniently takes you there throughout the day/evening. It's well worth the extra time it takes you, if you compare the roomprices to those of the hotels in town.  I would say the only thing that disappointed us were the snacks in the executive lounge. We've stayed in many Hiltons, and they manage to serve something really delicious. In Italy of all places we expected more than rice balls, cheese balls and other deep fried stuff.
