Stayed May 2016. Overall 4+Stars.  It is new, classic modern, luxurious with great location and convenient water taxi to San Marco Square. Crazy expensive bar drinks.  Friends complained about lack of hot water on 4th floor and other friends complained about only having a tub without walls. Clean. Good complementary Internet. Breakfast was killer. Would stay again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 23, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
