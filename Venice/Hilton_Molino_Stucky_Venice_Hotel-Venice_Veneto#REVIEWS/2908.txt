One of the only hotels in Venice that has a pool. We stayed without 2 children in the Family Suite, it was perfect. Very spacious although only 1 bathroom. Breakfasts was amazing and the rooftop pool has a 360 degree view of Venice. Spectacular both day and night. Service staff were excellent!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
