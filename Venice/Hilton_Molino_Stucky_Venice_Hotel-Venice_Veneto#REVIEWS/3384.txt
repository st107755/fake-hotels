Really nice property with outstanding service. Easy arrival from ship via Vaporetto (8 euros). Water taxi to airport was 120 euros ( at 4 AM) plus 20 euros to transport the luggage from the taxi to the check in location at the airport. I would gladly do it all over again.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting an exhaustive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your positive comments on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
