Facilities are very nice especially if you want to feel like you are staying in the US.  It's not very Venetian.  Desk staff and concierge weren't very friendly and welcoming. There is a free shuttle service to get to the San Marco and all the main attractions.  However the times are limited and during peak hours there may not be enough room so you have to wait.  Everyone says Venice is sinking; the Hilton Molino Stucky is definitely adding to this mess.  For example, they have huge fluffy bath towels that are washed daily.  There aren't any towel racks in the bathroom to hang them to dry nor the option to keep them an extra day.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 2, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.   May I take this opportunity to confirm that the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice takes part in â€œConserve to Preserve" Hilton Worldwide program. An information card is placed on the towel rack along side clean towels. If a guest elects, they can re-hang the used towels on the rack and they will not be laundered daily. If the guest would like the towels changed, they simply place the towels on the floor or in the bathtub. The room attendant will then replace the used towels with clean fresh ones daily.  We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again.  Best Regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
