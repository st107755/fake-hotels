Beautiful Hotel, Very welcoming and friendly staff, skyline bar is a must, cleanliness, shuttle boat service is the best perk. Overall the Hotel is well worth 5 stars, and I would stay here again when visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 19, 2019Dear Madame,  thank you very much for your kind and positive review on TripAdvisor.
