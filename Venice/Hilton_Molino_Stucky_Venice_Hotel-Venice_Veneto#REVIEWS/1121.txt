We stayed here the last night of our vacation before flying home.  We wanted something luxurious and relaxing. The staff was very helpful and offered us an upgrade which turned out to be a three room corner suite with windows on two sides.  We had a gorgeous view and a warm breeze all night.  They have a private water shuttle to the main island.  I recommend using a water taxi to the airport.  A 30 minute invigorating ride.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
