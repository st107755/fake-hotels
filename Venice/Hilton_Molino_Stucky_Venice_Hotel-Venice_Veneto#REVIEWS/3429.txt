Great place to stay! They have a free shuttle to San Marco square that runs frequently and late evening. Great happy hour and free breakfast. I saved a lot of money with these. Great staff that helped me with trains to Rome and even got a hotel in Rome for a night for me. They have great roof top pool and a bar up there also.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
