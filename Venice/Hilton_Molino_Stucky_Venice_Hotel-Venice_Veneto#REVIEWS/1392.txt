This hotel by far doesn't meet nor exceed the expectation of a 4 or 5 star.  Based upon the previous reviews I took a chance and was extremely disappointed.  My room in particular was on the 2nd floor had an odor and a very odd layout.  The noise was very loud as it was near the kitchen and I could hear talking, dishes, etc.   In addition, The carpets were dirty and torn and lacked cleanliness.  In addition, my bed sheets were dirty with a black substance.  I proceeded to contact the front desk in person and received an insincere apology.      To sum it up...  this is a luxury cost for a poorly maintained hotel.  I had high hopes and great expectations that Hilton Molino Stucky quickly diminished.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
