I took my son for his 18th.. We had a brilliant time, the hotel is indeed 5 star.. From the moment we arrived until we left every member of the staff from porters, maids, bar staff etc were friendly and nothing was too much trouble.. The room was great also the food and spa. Quite exciting each day just going outside and hopping on a boat to take the 10min trip across to the town, Highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 17, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
