We have booked a room in this hotel in last minute, then I called them to make sure the room is double, but when I arrived, they had only one available which was twins. They couldn't change the room but they offered free breakfast instead. There was a good water taxi service every 15 minutes. Also there was a free water taxi to glass factory in Murano. The pool on the roof was closed. The breakfast was good but noting special, like other 3-4 starts hotels. the room was very clean and the staff very friendly and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
