Good clean efficient hotel. Easy to reach from airport, boat direct to hotel jetty, same to access main town. Staff helpful and polite. Breakfast great choice, hot food was hot. Dinner good but bit expensive especially wine. Room clean and well serviced. If we return to Venice would probably stay here.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us.
