What's wrong with tripadvisor ranking this 75th in Venice?  The reveiws seem very good and I can only add to the postive notes: it's definitely one of the best hotels in the city and in my experience one of the best Hiltons I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world (and we've seen a few...)  The building is amazing and very unique, the views from the front rooms and rooftop pool are breathtaking, the food in the executive lounge is excellent and the location is perfect: away from the crowds but with a very convenient shuttle service straight into San Marco.  I couldn't fault this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
