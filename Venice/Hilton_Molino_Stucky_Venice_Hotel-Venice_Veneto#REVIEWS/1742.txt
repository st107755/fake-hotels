Molino Stucky is a great hotel in an old industrial building, and the rooms are all unique and the rooftop pool has great views. The hotel is opposite Piazza San Marco and has both public vaporetto service and it's own boat service to Piazza San Marco. The executive lounge is next to the lobby and has an endless supply of local wine all day with beer and spirits during the evening.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 19, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
