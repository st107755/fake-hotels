This was by far one of the most optimal experiences of a high-end hotel in the perfect location (just a short boat ride away from Venice island) that my family and I have ever experienced.  Nothing less than perfect: The location was romantic & convenient.  The property was a perfect blend of an old factory salvaged and restored into a wonderful 1st class hotel.  The pool on the 8th floor rooftop, with its priceless view, was icing on the cake! Rarely do my wife and I savor waking up and looking out of the window of our suite, like we did with this stay.  We will be back again...Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
