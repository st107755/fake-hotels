Conferences in exotic destinations are always a mixed bag. Will you sneak away to indulge in some of the sights? Whilst this Hilton is in an old flour mill, it has been modernised and glammed-up to within an inch of its life. It is opposite St Marc's square- 20 minutes by hotel boat, which goes hourly- this is rather civilised really- you would not want to be in the heat or summer stink of things in the center. The rooftop bar has an enchanting view of this enigmatic city. Rooms and public areas are without a sign of Murano glass, which depending on your sensibilities might be cause for celebration or despair. The Molino Stucky takes a very cool view of the multiple layers of its City- and this makes it a perfect base for a business trip.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
