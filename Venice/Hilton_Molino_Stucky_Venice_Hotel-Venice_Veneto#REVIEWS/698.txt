In Venice on our last stop touring around Italy - and ended it at the best hotel of all.  The Molino Stucky is on Giudecca island, a short water taxi ride to the main island of San Marco.  The location was perfect - away from the hustle and bustle and influx of tourists on the main island, but easily accessible to it via the free water shuttle with frequent trips to the island throughout the day.  There are also several restaurants along the waterfront down from the hotel, so are not completely without other food options if one does not want to go to another island.   The building itself is an old spaghetti factory (Stucky)- with all the charm of an old factory with its beams and brick.  The rooms are spacious, the bed (King) comfortable, with Peter Thomas Roth amenities.
