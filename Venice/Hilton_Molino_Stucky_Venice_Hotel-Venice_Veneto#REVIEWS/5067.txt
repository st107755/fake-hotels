This is a terrific hotel. The service was outstanding. The cleanliness was very good. The rooftop pool is a pleasure and the view from their is outstanding. The room was very comfortable. They provide a free water shuttle to travel over to the main Venice area with two stops. You just need to be mindful of the times both over and back. In fact, they make more frequent stops at the zatterie landing and that is an easy walk to most primary Venice sites. We really enjoyed this hotel and would strongly recommend it as a place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for  your kind comments on TripAdvisor.
