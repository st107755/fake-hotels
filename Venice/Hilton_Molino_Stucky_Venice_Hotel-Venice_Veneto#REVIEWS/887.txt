So we decided on Venice for New Year....why the Hilton....one reason.....rooftop bar at New Yearâ€™s Eve!! So we decided to book the Hilton. It was more than we would normally pay but what the hell....New Years eve we made our way up to the rooftop bar...with a very excited 13 year old. Imagine our disappointment when we were told that only diners that had eaten at the hotel that evening were allowed on the terrace. Bloody outrageous...we were not informed of this upon booking. Shame on you Hilton......will think twice about spending my money with You again.Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 8, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor. We are  sorry we did not entirely live up to your expectations and saddened to read that you and your son were disappointed. I was surprised to read your comment as the pool terrace was open to all in house guests to admire the New Years Eve fireworks from there. The Skyline bar was also open but I confirm its terraces were fully booked by Guests who had dined at our restaurants. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General Manager  Read more
