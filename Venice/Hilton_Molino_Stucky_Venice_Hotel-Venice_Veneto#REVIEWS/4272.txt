Hotel is a short boat ride from St Marks square and the Zettarae stop. Pool up at the top has great views overlooking Venice, good pic's.   Bar also up there is a neat place to have a drink and take in the sights.   We caught an upgrade (Dia member with Hilton) to a corner suite and room was huge.  Not much of a view but nice just the same. Ordered room service our first night in as we arrived after 11pm.  Rm service was timely and reasonably priced.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
