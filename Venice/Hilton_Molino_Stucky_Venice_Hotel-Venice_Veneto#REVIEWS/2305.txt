Stayed in March; weather was pants unfortunately. The hotel is big and very nice, the rooftop bar is wicked but very expensive; although the plate of biscuits that they give you free of charge with your drinks makes up for som of that :)  The boat shuttle is good value at â‚¬4 per person for the entire stay. The boat to the airport stops right here too which is handy.  It's in a bit of a weird position as there is nothing around this hotel which is a shame.  Not your normal type of Executive lounge but is a nice bonus nonetheless.  Great brekkie :)  For HHonors members; you get offered he chance to have breakfast in the lounge or the main breakfast hall; go for the main room every time; it's much much better.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 29, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
