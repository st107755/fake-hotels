Lovely hotel within easy reach of the main part of Venice - just catch free water taxi that run very often across the canal. This is the second time we have stayed at the Molino Stuckey and find it very convenient. Venice is so great to just walk around and investigate all the nooks and crannies, no cost to do this type of sightseeing. Drinks at music cafes in St Mark's Square extremely expensive - nice to do once then just walk and listen next time!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 8, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor and for the loyalty to Hilton Molino Stucky!
