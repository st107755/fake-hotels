My Wife, Father and I rented out two rooms for New Years Eve and Day at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice for 2013.  The rooms and hotel location, AMAZING!  The service at the restaurant and throughout the hotel, extremely poor.  The only great service they had was the Concierge Irene who is AMAZING and I highly recommend requesting concierge services should you be traveling to that hotel.  DO NOT eat at any of their restaurants as we had horrible experiences with the European wait staff every single meal.  The executive lounge was basically a hallway so not much really there but it saves money from having to buy evening of afternoon beverages... overall I am sure you can find a better place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Sir,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
