A great place to stay. View and room were excellent. We included the buffet breakfast. It had a good variety and selection of foods. All the staff in the hotel were pleasant and helpful. The shuttle bus to St. Marks Square was frequent, easy to use and pleasant. The pool on the 8th floor had a terrific view but lacked areas of shade. Would stay there again...felt the location was excellent and certainly more relaxing.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 16, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotel’s facilities.
