The hotel staff and the service we recieved was outstanding! Everything was great and the room was gorgeous. However, my only negative comment is that the room service was expensive. I know that this is with any nice hotel you might stay at. On the other hand, this one was particularly expensive. They charged 8 euro just to deliver the room service, which I have never experienced before. It may have been a normal thing, I don't stay in hotels very often.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 5, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
