This a very grand hotel situated just along from the main attraction St Marks Square, just a very convenient water taxi ride which is included when staying at the hotel, and always running on time. The views from the rooftop pool/bar is breathtaking, you see the whole of venice below you and great to watch the sunset and sunrise from. The rooms are of course very modern and luxurious. I would definitely recommend this hotel when staying in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 17, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
