I would recommend this hotel to anyone who does not mind taking the water taxi to and from the main area in Venice. We stayed the Hilton Stucky  for two nights in September  2012 and really enjoyed it. The pool on top of the hotel is great. We our gold so the breakfast was included, that was the only bad part of the hotel, if we had to pay for it I would have asked for my money back. Rooms were clean and newer. Ask for a view of the water, I think if we would have had the inside rooms they view a courtyard and would not have hd such a high review of this hotel. The water taxi run every 20 minutes so you don't have to wait long. We looked at the other hotels right in Venice and were happy we stayed at the Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 23, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
