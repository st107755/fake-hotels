I was taken to the Hilton Molino Stucky,Venice by my boyfriend(now my fiancee) for my birthday. We arrived at the hotel and immediately the staff were friendly and very polite! I have gold status with Hilton and so was given a complimentary upgrade, however what I didn't know was that my boyfriend had previously contacted the hotel telling them we were arriving and that he was planning to propose! When we entered our room there was roses shaped like a heart, with flowers, chocolates and champagne all complimentary!  He then got down on one knee proposed  - and of course I said yes!!
