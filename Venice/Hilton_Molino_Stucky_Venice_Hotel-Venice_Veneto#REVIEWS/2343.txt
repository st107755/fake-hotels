Visited the spa at the Hilton this morning.  Staff were pleasant and professional. Facilities were modern and adequate. Robe, towel and slippers were provided within the cost. As was shower gel, moisturiser and liquid refreshments.   A little on the expensive side though hence only a 'very good' rating.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 3, 2016Dear Sir, many thanks for your kind review on TripAdvisor.
