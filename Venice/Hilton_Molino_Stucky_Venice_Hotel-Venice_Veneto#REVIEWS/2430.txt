The hotel is situated at a nice spot overlooking Venice on the opposite side of the canal. The Hilton shuttle was so frequent and helpful taking guests to st Marks square. Room was clean and comfortable. The only down side is the toilet paper was not Hilton standard at all, only better the tracing paper.   Food was too expensive, breakfast was ok. Wifi should be free to the guests, but the price was too high for â‚¬12 per day. Luckily I am Hilton member, so I had a free wifi.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 7, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
