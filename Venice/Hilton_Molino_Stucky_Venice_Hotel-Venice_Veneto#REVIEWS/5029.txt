Now this is a hotel! Loved everything about it! Very luxurious and accommodating. They had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room. It is a little on the expensive side (the sky bar on the 8th floor sold a bottle of water for $8.00) The pool is amazing! You have a view of Veniceâ€¦ stunning!!!! Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Venice! Our room was beautiful and the bathroom was gorgeous!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
