WOW this has been the highlight hotel thus far. After small mix up at reception the adjoining family rooms are perfect for 2 adults and 2 kids. Rooms 351/352. Rooftop pool, easy access from airport (water taxi a bit expensive at €130) and a short boat ride to Grand Canal. Suggest you give the hotel restaurants a miss esp breakfasts (€25 pp is a joke) and enjoy the local Giudecca cuisine from cafes to amazing fish and gnocchi Overall 5* Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for your detailed review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
