This is a quite new property with huge amount of rooms. My room was standard, some where in a central wing of the hotel (Arsenal?). No view, no height, like in a bunker, fortunately no noise. Breakfast is ok. Transportation is acceptable. Unfortunately the roof pool was closed. Spa was nice, but not intimate and is fit only for max 6-7 persons (reservation advised!!). The staff was nice. So all together the hotel lack of charming and extremely overpriced.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 21, 2012Dear guest, Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback and I am truly sorry that we did not meet all your expectations.
