As far as Hilton's in Europe, this one is not near the top of the list. Overall, rooms, staff, and the 'executive lounge' leave a lot to be desired, especially for the price here. The Hilton Prague, the Hilton Giardini Naxos, and Hilton Brussels City for example are far superior in every way. Honors Diamond? Don't expect the usual welcome here.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
