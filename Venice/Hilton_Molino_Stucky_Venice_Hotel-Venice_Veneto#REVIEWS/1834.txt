We started our wedding week at the Hilton Stucky Molino.  Our guests loved arriving by water taxi and our rooms were great.   The rooftop is an awesome place to hang out: there's a pool and bar.  We stayed fueled on spritzes and appreciated learning the history about Giudecca and the hotel in the bar's menu.  The water taxi to San Marco makes it very convenient to explore, but if you're looking to stay near the train station or by the main attractions in Venice, this may be too isolated for you.  It's pretty much the only hotel on Giudecca with a few restaurants along the canal to explore.  I'd say it was more for couples than a group of friends who want to stay out all night.  If you're traveling on a budget, this hotel isn't for you either (those spritzes were NOT cheap).  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
