Mixed impressions.  A good location with free shuttle service to St Marks Square and Zaterre. Our room was beautifully appointed, clean, comfortable and quiet. The breakfasts were up to the standard you would expect and the staff were slick.  But, the converted Molino lacks a bit of character and warmth.  The ground floor bar and dining area was reasonably busy, but the atmosphere and service was slightly unwelcoming so we didn't linger long.  The rooftop bar was an improvement but you pay a premium for the view.  We stayed at the end of March (technically 'out of season') and the rooftop pool was closed, even though the weather was glorious.  Sad, as we would have enjoyed a post sightseeing swim.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for the feedback about your stay at our hotel.
