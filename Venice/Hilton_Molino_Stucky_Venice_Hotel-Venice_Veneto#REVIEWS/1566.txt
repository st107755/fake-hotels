We caught the ferry across to visit this bar briefly before making plans to head back and grab some dinner. However mainly due to the engaging, friendly and funny Enrico (the bar manager) we stayed for many many many more drinks than we intended. It turned out the path the night took was an incredibly fun one - had we been left to our own devices, I'm sure we would have still had a good night elsewhere - just perhaps a bit more low key!  It was enough for us to decide to visit the bar again later this year, as well as stay at the hotel - the power of an excellent host in the hospitality industry should never be underestimated - many thanks Enrico :)Read moreDate of stay: January 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
