My wife and I Stayed in the Hilton for 5 nights after a week crusing the Adriatic. The hotel was fantastic, we were checked in at 10am after arriving earlier than planned. The room was ready forn us and really was excellent. The location of this hotel is perfect, just 10mins on free shuttle takes you to Zattere. The hotel has a fantastic roof top pool, everything about the hotel is first class, this is the first time I have taken time to write a review however felt I should recommend this hotel. If you are planningn a trip to Venice then this hotel would be an rexcellent choice. WE LOVED IT.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
