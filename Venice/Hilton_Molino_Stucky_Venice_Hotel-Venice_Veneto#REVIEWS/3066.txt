It was a pleasure to read you enjoyed the hotel and that  you found the staff to be attentive and helpful. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and guests can still enjoy the vicinity from a quiet and relaxing residential area. In regard to internet, to improve guest satisfaction Hilton Hotels constantly review their pricing policies. With this in mind, complimentary internet has been introduced at the beginning of 2013 in the public areas of all Hilton hotels.  We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.   Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
