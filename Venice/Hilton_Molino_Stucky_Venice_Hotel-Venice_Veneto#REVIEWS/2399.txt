We stayed here for my husband's 50th and to visit Venice during the Carnivale. We were last in Venice on honeymoon 20 years ago and this stunning building was sadly derelict. It is now a jewel in Venice's crown and the perfect place to stay. We really enjoyed the short boat ride to St. Mark's square each day. After a busy day in Venice for the carnival, it was great to come back to the hotel and enjoy some 'Down time'. Without fail, every member of staff was courteous, helpful and a credit to the hotel. Nothing was too much effort. The Skyline bar is a must visit for unrivalled views of Venice. The cocktails and nibbles are wonderfully presented and blankets were kindly provided on a chilly evening.
