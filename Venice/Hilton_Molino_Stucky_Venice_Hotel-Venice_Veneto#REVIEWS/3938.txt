The Hilton Stucky was a superb hotel in a great location away from the busy main centre with a free shuutle bus to St Marks Square. Our upgrade to the Executive Suite provided hot drinks and snacks most of the day as well as beer wine and hors d'ouvres between 5 and 7pm. The breakfast was fantastic with lots of choices both hot and cold. The staff were very friendly and always helpful. Difficult to find anything negative to say about this. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2014Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
