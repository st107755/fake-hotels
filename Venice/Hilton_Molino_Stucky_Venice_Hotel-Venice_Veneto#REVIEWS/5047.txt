Beautiful hotel.  Horrible service.  No accommodation for early check in, not even for Honor member.  No wifi service in room, but when provided access codes no communication that it was only good in public areas.  Told bags in room, only to be found in hallway.  Getting a drink in the bar a challenge.  No one took responsibility for anything.  Very disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Molino Stucky Hilton Venice.
