We have just returned from 3 nights in the Stucky and would definitely recommend it.  We had a room with a canal view which was definitely worth it, beautiful view over the canal to the main island. We didnt pay extra for the breakfast but there were several local restaurants within a 5mins walk which were more than adequate.  We had also purchased a 3 day vaporetto pass so didnt use the hotel shuttle, but the vaporetto service was every 10mins so it was a good service.  Hotel is very well presented staff were all helpful and spoke great english.  Swimming pool had closed in September so we couldnt use that, but the rooftop bar is worth a visit.  All in all a really enjoyable stayRead moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 17, 2017Dear Sir, thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
