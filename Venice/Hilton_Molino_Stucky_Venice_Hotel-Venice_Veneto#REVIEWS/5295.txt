It couldn't have been a better experience in Venice.  We visited in November, so the rooftop bar was not open ... I believe this is a reason to return!  (The only drawback was arriving by boat from the train station, the closest dock is a bit of a walk, over two bridges and with a rolling bag ... it is a little hassle.)  However, from then on transportation was a breeze.  The Hilton has boats to San Marco and another stop a few times an hour.  A lovely, lovely 15 minute ride with grand views in every direction.  Our room was very nice, the executive lounge breakfast, afternoon coffee and evening wine offerings were very pleasant.  The staff in every contact were Hilton-Professional.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 11, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
