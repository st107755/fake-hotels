We booked this hotel as a secret saver and while we were slightly disappointed that it was on a separate island to the main city, our beautiful room made it worthwhile. The boat shuttle runs frequently and quickly at all hours so it's really quick and not inconvenient to get to the main island. We received the kind of service you would expect at a 5 star hotel. No complaints at all.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 14, 2011Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
