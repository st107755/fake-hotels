We acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism regarding the shuttle service, but on the other hand we would like to inform you that our boat leaves to/from Zattere and St. Marks square (city centre) 2 time an hour (Saturday and Sunday and in high season 3 time an hour) and it takes only 5 min (Zattere) 15 minutes (St. Marks)  to arrive there.

We place great value on your opinion and hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again in a not too far distance.  Best regards, Mario Ferraro, General ManagerRead more
