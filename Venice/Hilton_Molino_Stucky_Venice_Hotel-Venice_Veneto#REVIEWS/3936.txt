I stayed at the Molino Stucky with my mother for one night during Carnevale and really enjoyed it. We had a beautiful room overlooking the water that the staff generously blocked for us at arrival. We had dinner and drinks at the Rialto bar and Bartender Enrico made are evening just delightful. He was very attentive, professional and friendly and even allowed us to have dinner at the bar since the tables were very, very busy for a long time.  In the morning w enjoyed the fantastic breakfast and headed back to Florence. I recommend this hotel for your stay in Venice.  Just know the water taxi from San Marco is very expensive so plan to wait for the complimentary Hilton shuttle.
