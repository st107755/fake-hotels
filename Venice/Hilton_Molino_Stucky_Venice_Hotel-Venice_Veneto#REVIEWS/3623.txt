Even though this hotel is located on an island away from San Marco, there is a free shuttle that operates from the hotel every few minutes. We were there in Feb during the carnival and the hotel upgraded us to a beautiful suite, free bottles of Bellini everyday and impeccable service apart from the good food. What was interesting is a free access to a business lounge near the reception where one could sit and work, free drinks and snacks were generously placed around for those wanting to snack. If this were not enough, we were given complimentary masks from the hotel given the carnival was on. We are back again here in August and naturally looked no other place than this and are enjoying our stay here.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
