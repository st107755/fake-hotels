Nice Hotel, rooms were not bad but the bathroom was a bit weathered. It was unfortunate we had some maintenance guys doing maintenance near my room as they were pretty noisy. Complimentary internet for elite members was great but it only allowed me to connect a limited amount of devices. Shuttle service was punctual and convenient. There's also a free water taxi service to murano glass islands.   Great stay overall, service and room were quite good.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
