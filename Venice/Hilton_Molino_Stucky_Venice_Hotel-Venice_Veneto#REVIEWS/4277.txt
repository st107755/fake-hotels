We stayed here as part of our honeymoon in August 2013 for two nights. It's a great building with history, it used to be a flour mill (only flour mills in Italy would look like this!) the hotel is ideally located, it is just outside the main islands, however this gives amazing views over Venice and the hotel run a shuttle service boat over to piazza San Marco frequently. It's a large hotel, very well kept, everywhere is very clean and tidy, lots of marble and shiny services. A highlight is the rooftop bar and pool, the view from here is fantastic. I did have a dip in the pool which feels good to be swimming so high up with that view, however is was freezing! The bar is nice in the evening when Venice is all lit up, staff are friendly here, the prices are a little high though,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
