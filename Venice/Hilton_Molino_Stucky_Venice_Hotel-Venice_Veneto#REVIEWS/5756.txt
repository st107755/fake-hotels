This hotel is amazing - simply amazing.  The converted flour mill structure has been fantastically restored, and the wood beams are stunning.  The bell boy spotted us on arrival over the other side of a walkway bridge, and stopped us there to take luggage  - a very nice touch.  Got room upgrades and a complimentary bar due to HiltonHonors status, and then enjoyed all the facilities which included complimentary water taxi, Turkish steam room and great buffet breakfast.  However it was the roof top infinity pool with stunning views over Venice that really took are breath away.  A very difficult experience leaving this hotel to sight-see around Venice each day! Experienced only one problem which was one of our rooms was not made up on arrival, but overlooked this as they checked usâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
