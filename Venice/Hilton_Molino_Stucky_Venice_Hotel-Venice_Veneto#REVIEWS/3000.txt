We stayed here post cruise for two nights The hotel is a refurbished warehouse. Our room,which overlooked a scrapyard with the city in the distance, was spacious and comfortable, but we were surprised not to be given fresh towels in the evening after showering etc. following a day sightseeing. Service was generally good, and the breakfast magnificent. Disappointingly there was no free WiFi. Prices in the bars were as inflated as one expects in Venice! There are several reasonable value local restaurants within a short walking distanceRead moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 29, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
