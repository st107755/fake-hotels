We stayed here for 5 nights with our two kids. The pool at the rooftop terrace was wonderful. The nutella bar was fun, too. We loved being away from the crowds of the Venice. The island where hotel is very authentic, there's a simple pizza place, local restaurants, back streets where locals live. Great buffet breakfast. We used the spa as well which was nice but the masseuse could be better.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 4, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
