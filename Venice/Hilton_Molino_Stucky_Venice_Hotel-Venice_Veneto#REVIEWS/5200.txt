A great hotel in a fantastic location.  The hotel feels special the moment you get off the water taxi.. The check in is very quick and efficient and the rooms are great! We got an upgrade to a fantastic suite... (even though we paid through reward points). Access to the St Marks Square is by complimentary water taxi running at least once an hour between 6 am and midnight (or beyond at the weekends) so travel is very easy... The hotel has great faciilities and is very relaxing, particularly being on the waters edge. The staff are very friendly and helpful... Nothing seems too much trouble...get to the rooftop bar for sundown for great views and good atmosphere. A must if you are visiting Venice , we will be back (again!)Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 8, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for writing about us.
