Hilton Molino Stuckey is located on the island of Giudecco, so it requires a 5 minute boat ride to Venice, but that was an enjoyable part of our stay.  We had a nice view of Venice from our room and from the rooftop bar/pool, and the hotel was a nice quiet break from the crowds in Venice. Hotel staff were very helpful, and room was beautiful. Food is relatively pricey (as is typical of hotel restaurants) but we expected that. This was the only American hotel we stayed at during our 2 weeks traveling through northern Italy and was a pleasant ending to our trip.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
