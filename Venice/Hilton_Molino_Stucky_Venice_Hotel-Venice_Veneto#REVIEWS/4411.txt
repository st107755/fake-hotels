A modern hotel and despite its use by cruise ship parties is a quiet hotel in Giudecca and so away from the bustle of Venice. However the hotel is reachable by the hotel's water bus several times an hour to Zattere and St MarK's Square.  Getting away from the crowds is a definite plus.  I was advised on check-in that wifi in rooms incurred an extra charge but it turned out to be free.  The breakfast is varied and plentiful with good service. However the coffee is poor watery Americano style and not espresso.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
