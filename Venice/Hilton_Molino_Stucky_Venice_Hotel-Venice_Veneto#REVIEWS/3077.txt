We have just returned from a fabulous three day break here.. Hotel was excellent the junior executive suite was huge and luxurious, we made use of the executive lounge with free drinks and delicious snacks .. One of our couples did have a problem with their room which was dealt with promptly and efficiently and they were moved to a fabulous suite overlooking  venice with a bottle of champagne. Cannot fault service and attention to detail. The shuttle boat was great , on time, and free.. Will Definately recommend to friends.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 23, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to leave such a nice review on Tripadvisor!
