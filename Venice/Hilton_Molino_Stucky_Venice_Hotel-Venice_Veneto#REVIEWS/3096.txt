Hotel was lovely. The rooms are very good, spacious enough and designed well. The character of the hotel is fantastic, really like the mixture of modern class and the features of the old mill. The staff were in the main very good. The cleaning staff were a good laugh and some of the breakfast team also particularly outstanding. Breakfast was good, sometimes replenishment was slow, but the quality of the food in the main was good.   The hotel was, of course, situated away from the main islands - yet this really does not matter. I would say it was in fact better to be placed away from the main island as it was a quiet location, whilst still conveniently placed to explore the city centre. The hotel shuttle service was both regular and fast. I would definitely stay here again.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 17, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
