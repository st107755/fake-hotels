The hotel is fantastic. Rooms were comfortable, with great bed and bathroom. Views of Venice form the roof top bar are not to be missed. We stayed here as part of the Insight Easy Pace Tour Package. Staff support was excellent. The breakfast buffet was very good with a large assortment of foods to choose from. The hotel provides boat shuttle service to St. Mark's Square.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 8, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments and for praising our professional Team Members.
