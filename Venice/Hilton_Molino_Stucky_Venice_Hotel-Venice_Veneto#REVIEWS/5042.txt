From the moment that we were talking about going to Venice, I wanted to stay here.  Both inside and out are absolutely beautiful and you have the free shuttle to St. Mark's Square, which was awesome!  Honestly, it was the best buffet breakfast we ever had and I've been teasing the family that we should just fly over for breakfast!  The front desk are amazingly nice and extremely helpful.  And...I booked this from Travelocity!!!!  Our room was gorgeous, would have loved to have stayed a week here, but I am glad that we stayed here for our last night in Venice.   Really, don't book anywhere else, you will be disappointed!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
