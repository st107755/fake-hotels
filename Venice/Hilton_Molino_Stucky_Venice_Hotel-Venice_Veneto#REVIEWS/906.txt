We stayed here for a weekend. The room was large with a seperate shower and bath. But the hotel failed to charm, in my opinion it is worth the 5 stars it has. We stayed at several other hotels that had less stars and were cheaper that were way better. The personel was friendly but not exceptional. There were several little things that were broken/lacked maintenance. When we arrived we had to pay for the Wifi but after one complaint we got free access. (Like really paying wifi for the price we payed for our stay? It should be free for everyone) But I also heard in general Venice is really expensive and its hard to find an affordable hotel that is ok.Read moreDate of stay: November 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2017Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
