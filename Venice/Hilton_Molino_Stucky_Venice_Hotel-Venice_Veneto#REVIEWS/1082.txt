What a beautifully situated hotel! Very friendly staff and a very efficient shuttle boat service, which makes traveling to Piazza San Marco and back hassle free!Would definitely recommend!   Both dining restaurants at the hotel serve Venetian dishes, which are both exquisite in plating and in taste!   Executive lounge was also a nice addition to our stay. Open for breakfast till 11pm.   Overall this hotel is perfect for travelers looking for the perfect gateway, ensconced with the right dose of relaxation while being only a short boat ride away from the city.
