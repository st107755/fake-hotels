I considered hilton my home away from home, had a wonderful 3 nights 4 days at stucky hilton. Everything is convinient the barca at the palanque stop is at waking distance from hotel, the hotel has a charter service compleately ferry, the wi-fi is free for diamond and gold members. Lido beach is 20 minutes away you take the barca 1 from san marco is amazing I enjoy every second of it. I found a little restaurant that became my favorite call " ostra di botti" the hotel has great restaurants but if you want something outside that's the place to go. The spa and gym are amazing I got to relax and enjoy my self everyday. Hope this helpful enjoy your stay.  Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
