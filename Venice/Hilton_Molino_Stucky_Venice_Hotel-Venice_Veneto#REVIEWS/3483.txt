Stayed here a few years ago, so sorry for the delay in posting, but i came across the name of this hotel and remember it very fondly.   Very spacious rooms for Europe, beautiful lobby area, great breakfast and outstanding lobby bar & snack area that includes excellent local wines.   The only negative is having to wait for the ferry to take you to San Marco area, but even that is fun once it arrives. Would be my first choice if we return.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for your positive comments on our hotel services and facilities.
