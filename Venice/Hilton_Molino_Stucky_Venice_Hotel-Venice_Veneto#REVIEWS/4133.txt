Great Hotel, it is located on the primarily residential island of Giudecca, which is about a 15 minute hotel shuttle boat ride from Piazza San Marco.  Note that we at times, depending on where we were, we found it easier to take a vaporetto.  Some other reviews complained of the location, but Giudecca is quite and away from the crowds, has some nice local restaurants just 5 minutes walking, and the views from the hotel are awesome.  It is well worth the little bit of extra shuttle time to be away from the crowds (especially when cruise ships are in!). We are already planning a return trip. Also, highly recommend the Bacaromi Restaurant, part of the hotel and outside facing the canal.  The seafood was wonderful!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
