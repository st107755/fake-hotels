We stayed here on our honeymoon in December 2012 and couldn't have been happier.  From the location to the AMAZING breakfast to the supremely comfortable beds, it was an awesome experience to stay here.  The staff are genuinely nice and helpful. In fact, when I got strep throat while I was there, the concierge called a bunch of local pharmacies to see who could prescribe me some antibiotics on a Sunday (when most everything is closed). It was a truly special visit and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and for sharing your experience.
