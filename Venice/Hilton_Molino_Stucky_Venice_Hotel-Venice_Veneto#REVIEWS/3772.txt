This was our third hotel in our tour of Italy, and by far the best.  The rooms were large and lovely.  Beds and pillows- super comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was unbelievable- huge, with so many options.  I guess you could say it wasn't a "traditional Italian hotel", but I have to be honest, I was thrilled to be spoiled a little!  It's not centrally located, but I found that to be nice, actually.  Venice is very crowded with tourists, so the hotel being off the beaten path was actually refreshing.    A few in our group had a hard time getting a shuttle boat, as it was full on the way back, which was a challenge, but overall, a great experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 10, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience about your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor.
