This was a very nice place to stay.  Good service.  Lovely corner room.  We were able to open windows to get some fresh air as well, but apparently there is a major mosquito issue at some times of the year.  We were there in October.  Great breakfast buffet which was included.  Food in the dining areas a bit pricey and not outstanding, but good.  Free shuttle to main part of Venice near St Marks.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 4, 2014Dear Guest,  We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and thank you for taking the time to leave your review.
