We had 4 rooms for 4 days at this fantastic property.  The rooms are gorgeous.  We tried everything from a regular room to a romantic suite.  Suite was considerably more expensive and the view was not nearly as nice as my king room with view of the canal.  We had a few minor niggles during the stay, but staff were very attentive in sorting them.  Will definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 25, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
