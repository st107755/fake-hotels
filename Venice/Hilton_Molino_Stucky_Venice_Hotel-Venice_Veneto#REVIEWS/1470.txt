Just checked out of the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice and we had an amazing stay.  The hotel is stunning and very comfortable. The rooms are lovely and the high ceilings and wooden beams make the room much bigger.  Breakfast was always superb and the rooftop bar is stunning.  Most importantly, and what made our stay so memorable, were the staff. Every single one looked after us so well and we were made to feel very welcome and special. They went out of their way to look after us and exceeded our expectations.  In particular, Cristian on the Concierge desk was very helpful and his advice about Venice made sure we had an excellent visit.  This hotel is excellent and well worth staying if you are visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 21, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
