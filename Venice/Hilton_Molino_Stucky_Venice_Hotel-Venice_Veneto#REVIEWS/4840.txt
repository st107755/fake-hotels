The Hilton Hotel in Venice, Italy is absolutely wonderful. It appears to be a new property, but it has the feel and look of an old, European hotel. Yes, you have to take a water shuttle to get anywhere else in Venice, but that is part of the experience. Hilton runs their own shuttle on a regular schedule - free. Plus, since the hotel is not located amongst the rest of the Venice hotels and restaurants, it is a lot less busy.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
