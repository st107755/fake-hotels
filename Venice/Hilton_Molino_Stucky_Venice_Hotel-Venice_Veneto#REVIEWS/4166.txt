Everything worked out very well for me and my husband: I loved the fact that the hotel is located on the Giudecca Island, away from the hustle bustle of the city main touristic attractions; the roof top bar view is breathtaking and service impeccable. Shuttle service works perfect, breakfast abundant and our room size was very good for us, as couple. My husband appreciated the early morning run along the Canale della GIudecca up to SAn Girogio island.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
