We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. I do apologize for the lack of care and attention from our housekeeping staff, I have informed our executive housekeeper in order to make sure such things do not occur again. Guest feedback is a fundamental source to evaluate our efficiency and determine areas of improvement in service. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that since 2015, in order to improve the shuttle service for our Guests, there is a fee of 6 euros per person per stay. Although you express some disappointment, I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future so that we can demonstrate the high level of service we are renowned for. Best regards,   Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
