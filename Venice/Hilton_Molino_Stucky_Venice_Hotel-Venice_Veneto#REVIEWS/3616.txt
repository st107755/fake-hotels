We are a  family of 4, with kids aged 8 and 5 1/2. We were concerned about the location of the hotel, being that it is in Giudecca and it requires a shuttle to get to it from 2 stations in the main Venice area. We were already exhausted coming in and seeing the crowds waiting on the water buses, we took a water taxi from the train station and it was 20-30 minute boat ride. The fee we paid was 55 euros. When we arrived, the lobby impressed us. The staff was very helpful and we were able to check-in quite easily. The room was nice, spacious, clean with an elegant design. unfortunately, we had no view but that was not our priority. They served appetizers, with a variety of drinks, coffee, snacks from 11 am to 11 pm and the food was enough to fill us that we did not have to orderâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
