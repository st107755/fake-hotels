Hotel location was really good, offering a free boat shuttle service to the city center. I spent 02 nights and they were amazing from view and location prospective, however the service was not as expected from a Hilton hotel, staff were not helpful at all and breakfast is not that great. Upon check in they denied the room category that we have booked (canal view) despite it was clearly mentioned on our voucher and we had to get into so many arguments; after a long flight the problem got escalated to the deputy manager who explained that they were full for that type of rooms, which wasn't my mistake as a traveler. He apologized for the inconvenience and solved the room issue by upgrading our room for the first night and we moved back to as booked for the 2nd night.
