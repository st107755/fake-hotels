Very nice hotel - would stay here again.  Wish we could have used the pool, but it was winter time.    We got two rooms next to each other since we are a family of 6. Rooms where very clean and comfortable.   Breakfast was amazing and the water taxi to and from Venice was awesome!!  Executive lounge was nice option to have throughout the day even though we only used it a handful of times.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
