We stayed at Hilton Molino  Stucky in Venice in the beginning of October for a week. I am a HH Diamond member, so I had a room upgrade and access to a Executive Lounge and SPA. The view from our room was incredible  and we had a sparkling wine and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived. The best ever Executive Lounge I have been. The receptionist at the Executive Lounge was lovely and always there to help us to find places to visit and restaurants. The view from the swimming pool area is very nice, and the location is the best ! And you can go to San Marco in only 15 minutes using the hotel shuttle. If we have an opportunity to go to Venice again we would stay at Hilton Molino Stucky again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2012Dear Guest, We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay.
