Our stay was a nice experience, thought it would be a little better considering it is a Hilton though. The beds and rooms were nice and clean, but it kind of is an inconvenience to stay on the island. They have a free shuttle back and fourth, but they don't run enough, take a break in the middle of the day, and during peak times aren't big enough to carry everyone so it can mean a long wait time. There are restaurants on the island and it is quieter than the main part of Venice which is nice. My advice, stay during the hot summer months to take advantage of the pool and to avoid the crowds but any other time I suggest staying in the heart of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
