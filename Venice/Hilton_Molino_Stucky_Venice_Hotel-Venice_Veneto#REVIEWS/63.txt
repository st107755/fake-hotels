Decent hotel. Free water shuttle every 20 minutes to the city. Isolated on the island though so not many choices for food within walking distance.  Some rooms are renovated but I chose an older bigger suite for two room privacy. Nice gym. Good food. A bit confusing layout. Easy to get lost inside.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 8, 2020Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor with regards to your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky. Though you felt a bit isolated, we still hope you have enjoyed the Giudecca island. It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and visitors can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. On your next visit to Venice may I suggest a visit of the Giudecca island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. There are always art exhibitions going on and the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend. We thank you for being our Guests and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
