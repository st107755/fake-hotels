As a gold or diamond member you will enjoy more. This was best use of Hilton Honor points I've found. This was an incredible stay! The staff was great, room very comfortable, the view from the 6th floor overlooking the canal was unmatched. The executive lounge(for Hilton Honor gold and diamond members) offered free breakfast, snacks all day and drinks until 11PM. The island of Giudecca was quiet and fun to explore. Mostly locals but a few good resturants and markets. A quick water shuttle and you're in the heart of Venice.(Shuttles are complimentary and run about every 20-30 min). The rooftop pool and bar offer stunning views however the drinks were no bargin.  Wonderful trip to Venice,expect to spend some $$$$.Read moreDate of stay: August 20083 SavesHelpfulShare
