We stayed here one night during our trip through Italy. The hotel is beautiful. We were in a junior suite with a view of Venice.  They have a free shuttle that will take you to Venice. Make sure to check the schedule. They take several breaks during the day. We parked our car at the Tronchetto (21euros/day) that they recommended on their website and were able to take a shared water taxi to the Hilton. The cost was  30 euros for both of us. The trip back however cost us 60 euros because we did not have anyone to share it with.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 17, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  Thank you very much for your positive comments on our hotel and for sharing your experience.
