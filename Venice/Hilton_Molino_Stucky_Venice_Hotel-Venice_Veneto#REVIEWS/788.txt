Myself and partner spent three lovely nights here in April. I had emailed hotel before hand and asked how to get here from Marco Polo airport they were very helpful. We arrived by the blue line water bus which takes you directly to Giudecca (the last stop) this is the island hotel is on. It took a while but was very cheap and allowed to see some of Venice. On arrival I was impressed by prompt service of staff and the grand reception area. Our room was a good size with an incredible view of main Venice. The room cleaning was slightly inconsistent. But overall rooms were clean and bed comfy. It would be good to have more English speaking t.v channels. We decided to add on breakfast when we arrived so we paid 27 Euro each per night for this. The buffet spread was amazing everythingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 20, 2018Dear Guest, thank you very much for your kind feedback on TripAdvisor.
