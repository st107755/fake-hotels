We used our Hilton Honor points to stay at this gorgeous hotel.  We never had to wait long for the shuttle to Piazza San Marco, but be aware that you'll have to factor in the time to get to the sites you want to see.  My sisters stayed at the Hotel Canaletto, not far from Piazza San Marco, and if I returned, I'd probably stay there for the location (but not the beds, my sisters said they were rock hard). Another issue, the shuttle starts at 8:00a, if you want to beat the crowds to Piazza San Marco, you'll need to stay somewhere else, or hire a taxi. On the plus side, the Alilaguna stops right at the hotel, so it's very convenient from the airport and to the cruise terminal. The beds are wonderful, the view from our window was good, and the breakfast buffet was fabulous.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
