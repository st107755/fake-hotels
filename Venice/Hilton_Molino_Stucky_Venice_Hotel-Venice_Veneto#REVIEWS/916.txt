We have stayed several times at the Hilton Molino Stucky and this one didn't disappoint. As it was an anniversary celebration we were very lucky to get an upgrade to a beautiful room overlooking the canal with a gorgeous view. The staff as always were very friendly and inviting especially Elisa & Vicenza. We love the location of the hotel as you see more of the local life & local restaurants/bars etc. A fabulous break from start to finish.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review and for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky again.
