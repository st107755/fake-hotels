We stayed for 2 nights in March. The hotel was a 40 minute boat ride from the airport (we booked a shared transfer with Venicelink which I would recommend). Check-in was quick and the staff member was very friendly. Our room was a good size with good amenities and a side view of Venice.   There was a great choice of food for breakfast and the service was good throughout the hotel. We had a few cocktails at the rooftop bar which were expensive but well made.   The hotel shuttle was very convenient and only takes 10 minutes to the main part of Venice. It runs all day and seemed punctual. There's not much around the hotel, but it felt a lot calmer than central Venice (despite being a large property) and nice to be away from the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 18, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
