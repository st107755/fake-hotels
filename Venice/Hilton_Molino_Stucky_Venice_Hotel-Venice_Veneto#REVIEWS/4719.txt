This was our first time in Venice.  We loved Venice despite the floods and this Hotel was excellent.  They upgraded us without us even asking, they were very friendly and helpful.  Its great being across the river and out of the main tourist area.  Shuttle bus was free and regular.  The roof top bar was brilliant, has outdoor heaters and cocktails were fantastic.  Everything in the hotel is shockingly expensive like the cocktails but I suppose thats what you get when their is nothing else around you.  One thing I would say is whatever you do pay for breakfast its the best breakfast spread ever including Prosecco with your bacon!!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
