Stayed here for 3 nights (4 days) 9th March-12th - wonderful location on the Guidecca island away from the hustle and bustle of real Venice - this hotel is excellent 5 star well deserved, our only criticism being the restaurant prices were astronomical even for a 5 star - on our first night, tired from travelling we had a toasted cheese and ham sandwich, a mozarella and parma ham  panini a small beer and a non alcoholic cocktail and spent 53 euros!!  we thereafter ate out of the hotel and had 3 courses with a bottle of wine for less than we spent for an actual "snack" rather than a meal - glasses of wine were 10 euros and a bottle 50 euros!!  excessive I think and that would explain why the restauarants in the hotel were hardly used! our executive room was lovely and so quiet -â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
