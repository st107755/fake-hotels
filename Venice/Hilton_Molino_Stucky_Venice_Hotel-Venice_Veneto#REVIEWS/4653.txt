We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. We were delighted with the room. Huge comfy bed, kettle and complimentary tea and coffee and chocolate. Robes, slippers, toiletries were all greatly appreciated. Mini bar hugely overpriced but that's not unusual for popular hotels. Staff were very helpful, accommodating and approachable.
