My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful 5 nights at this hotel for my birthday. We stayed in a suite but were very disappointed with the view.The service was exceptional and the concierge even more so. The only complaint I have is that I did not enjoy the food in the hotels main restaurant. Well worth a stay but I would definately recomend dinner at the Ciprianni one of the most memorable evenings ever!Read moreDate of stay: July 2007HelpfulShare
