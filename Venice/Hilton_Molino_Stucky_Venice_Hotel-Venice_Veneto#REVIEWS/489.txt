Had the pleasure of staying in venice for three nights.  The welcome at the hotel by the bellstaff was very friendly.  That was a great first inpression!  After that our experience was actually not that great anymore. The front office and breakfast staff was not that friendly.  At the breakfast I actually felt burdened to ask for a capuccino.   The WiFi password what something like: be exceptional. It was clear the staff was NOT living up to that standard.   The ambiance and the staff of the Bacaromi restaurant was actually really nice.  The room was beautifull and clean. WONDERFULL BEDS.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 31, 2018Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
