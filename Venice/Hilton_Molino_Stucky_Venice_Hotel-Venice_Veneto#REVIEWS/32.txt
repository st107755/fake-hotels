The hotel staff all amazing nothing was too much trouble,,, food excellent,,,, our view from the hotel was disappointing as by mistake we hadn’t booked a room over looking the water ,,,,  how ever the hotel did move us,,,, which was very good of them ,,,, how ever if you like a peaceful  room ask for a room at the back forget the view !!!! It’s too nosey listening to the boats and ferry’s crossing the canals all day  Thank you to the management for doing there very best to make it a special celebration though,,,, would I go back to this hotel definitely!!!!!
