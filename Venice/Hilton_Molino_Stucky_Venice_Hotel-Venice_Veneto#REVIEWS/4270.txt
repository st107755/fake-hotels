What a beautiful place to stay. Our room had a lovely view of Port Venice. They offer a shuttle boat to Plaza San Marco, which comes helps a lot, if you want to take a short break to return to the hotel. The building is enormous. They have several different restaurants where you can enjoy your breakfast. The breakfast buffet has everything you can ask for. We didn't try the restaurants for lunch/dinner since there are so many restaurants around. The rooftop pool has a amazing view over Venice, but the water was very cold. At least it was refreshing. This place seems to be very busy year around, since we tried to visit it earlier. But now I know why!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
