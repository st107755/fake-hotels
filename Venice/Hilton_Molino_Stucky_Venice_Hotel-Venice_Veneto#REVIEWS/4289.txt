I booked this hotel thinking of getting a standard good one but it was an excellent experience. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. Even when there was an inconvenience due to a private party on the rooftop (which by the way is an amazing view), they gave us free access to the executive lounge. The regular shuttle service is very handy and makes the fact that you're not on one of the main islands, barely noticeable. All in all, this made my first anniversary extra special. Would recommend this to anyone. Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
