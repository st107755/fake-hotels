We had a great time at the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice. The hotel is gorgeous and our rooms had a beautiful view of the canal. Venice is on the other side of the canal, and the hotel does provide a free ferry shuttle that will take you over to Venice, but during the day, the shuttle only goes about once an hour. So if you end up buying anything in town, you'll be carrying it around all day rather rather than waste the time to go back and forth to the hotel.   Other than convenience, I loved everything about the hotel. The rooms were spotless and the wifi was fast. The breakfast buffet was also quite good.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
