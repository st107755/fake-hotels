Stayed here over last 3 days with family and friends. Our room was outstanding and the facilities and staff was also 5 star. The boat shuttle to San Marco from the hotel was also punctual. A great place to visit and an added bonus was access to the executive lounge. Which was well stocked and the snacks varied and superb. Would throughly recommend. Venice on the whole is well worth a visit but very very expensive.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 21, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
