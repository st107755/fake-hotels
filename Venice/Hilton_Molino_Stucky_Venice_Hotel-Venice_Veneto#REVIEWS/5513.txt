My husband and I stayed here while I attended a conference at the hotel.  We could not have been happier with the hotel or the location for our first visit together to the beautiful city of Venice.  The staff were wonderful - everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful - we felt they genuinely wanted to make our stay with them enjoyable and memorable.  Our room on the 6th floor had a great view, even though it was on the side of the hotel and it was spacious and well set out.  The Stucky is well serviced by a free shuttle to San Marco and other parts of Venice.  There are a couple of really nice restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare
