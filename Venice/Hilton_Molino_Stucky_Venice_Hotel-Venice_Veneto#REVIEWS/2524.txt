It was a very nice and comfortable place to stay.  The hotel staff offered a water taxi to St Paul Square every fifteen minutes to a half hour free to all hotel guests.  Everyone was very helpful with all requests that were made and met all of our needs as they came up.  They assisted with touring suggestions as well, and provided us with a reserved water taxi to the airport on the day of our departure.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2015Dear Madame, thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
