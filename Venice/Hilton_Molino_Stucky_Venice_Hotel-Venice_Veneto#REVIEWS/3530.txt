Arrived in Venice minus our luggage. The Hilton Stucky took over to ensure all was well, even taking our luggage to our room when it arrived. When we first saw our room we had sweets on the pillows & rose petals sprinkled in the shape of a heart, cheered us up no end! Superb room, superb view from the rooftop swimming pool! Excellent staff, friendly, helpful & enjoying being there. Breakfast choice was perfect too. We had a wonderful stay!
