My friend and I stayed here on our recent trip to Venice.  Our room had a wonderful view of the islands and had a few cruise ships float by at night (smile and wave :P)  The room was a large with a nice size bathroom.  The hotel was busy the night we arrived as this hotel is popular with the cruise ship set.  Once those took off, it was nice and quiet.  There is a nice, but small executive lounge off of the lobby.  You have to take a boat in order to get to the hotel.  The shuttle service was always on time and easy to use.  We never had to wait (we would time it right), but I imagine in the summer the boats might fill up quickly.  We also used a private water taxi to the train station and from the airport.  Much faster than the water buses.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 11, 2015Dear Madame, thank you very much for your excellent feedback. I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hilton Molino Stucky and our services, including the shuttle boat to/from the city centre. It was also important for us to know that you enjoyed our Executive Lounge on the ground floor which offers a great canal view and is one of the highlights of our hospitality.
