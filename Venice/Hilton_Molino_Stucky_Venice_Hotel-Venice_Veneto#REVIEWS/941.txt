I am pleased to read that you had a nice stay and that you appreciated our service, it is a pleasure to receive such positive feedback. We also acknowledge and appreciate your criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our Guests and I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that information on our pool is available on our website where it is specified that opening is seasonal, from mid May to mid September. We are sorry if this was unclear and that you were expecting the pool to be open. We also regret that you felt a little bit isolated; Guests staying at the Hilton Molino Stucky, can relax away from the crowded city and enjoy a fantastic view over Venice and the lagoon. On your next visit to Venice may I suggest a visit of the Giudecca island where you will discover a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. There are always art exhibitions going on and the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend. We thank you for being our Guests and we hope to welcome you again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
