This hotel is fantastic. We stayed here for a long weekend and I always review a hotel based on whether I would stay there again and would I recommend it to my parents - this case YES. The staff are very helpful and the rooms HUGE. There is a shuttle boat that runs you across into Venice and it's only 5 mins ride PLUS it runs on time and late into the evening. The staff are very helpful and always acknowledge you as you walk anywhere near them :-)Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
