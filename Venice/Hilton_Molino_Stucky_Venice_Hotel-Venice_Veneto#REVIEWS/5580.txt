If you're looking for a large mainstream hotel in Venice, this is the place.  Nice rooms, very good breakfast, great pool bar on the roof.  The hotel was pretty unprepared for the group that I was traveling with and were completely over-whelmed.  But, without the massive number of guests, they might be a bit better on service.  Some food was good, some not so good.  This hotel was good, not great.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
