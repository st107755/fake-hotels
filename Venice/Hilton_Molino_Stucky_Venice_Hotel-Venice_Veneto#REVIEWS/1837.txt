We spent a couple days in Venice after getting off a cruise ship and the Hilton Molino Stucky was our base camp. This property is very upscale and all the staff we interacted with were amazing. Our room was very large and comfortable. Bathroom was marble and well appointed. The pool is on the roof and offers a great view of Venice. Best of all the Hilton has a private water taxi that runs continuously between the hotel and Piazza San Marco. We highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 14, 2016Dear Guest, thank you very much for your excellent feedback!
