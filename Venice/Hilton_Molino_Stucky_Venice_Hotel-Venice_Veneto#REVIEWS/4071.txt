This is simply an outstanding hotel.  Location is a little bit out of the way, since you have to take the boat the cross the canal but the shuttle is complementary and really not an issue.  Rooms are magnificent, big, clean...perfect.  Service is top, from the bartenders to the concierge, receptionists.  Breakfast is magnificent.  All in all a great hotel, and we will be back.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you for your fabulous review of the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
