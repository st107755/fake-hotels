We stayed here for one night and was upgraded to a massive suite. Was also provided ; free spa entry (usually â‚¬25/2 hours), breakfast (not just continental) in the executive lounge. The free shuttle is a perk that saves you time and money. Excellent views and service; definitely one of the best Hilton's I have stayed at. Will recommend and return!  I prefer the location - it is outside the noise and loudness of St Mark's square - makes Venice more beautiful!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
