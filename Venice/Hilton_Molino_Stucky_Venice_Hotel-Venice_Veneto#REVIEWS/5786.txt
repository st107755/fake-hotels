I had booked and paid for two rooms for two nights in June 2009 and arrived at the hotel after 18 hours of travel only to be told that the hotel did not have rooms available since they had agreed to allow a large group to extend their stay.  Although the hotel moved us to another (less expensive and inconveniently located) hotel, they were not particularly apologetic about failing to honor the reservation and did not offer to compensate us in any manner for the inconvenience and disappointment of our reservation being refused.  If you are not troubled by a "reservation" meaning only that you will be provided a room if they don't choose to give it to someone else, by all means, book this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
