We have stayed at the Molino Stucky 3 times now and it has been a good choice every time. Well situated with a convenient shuttle service to St Marks Square. Rooms are lovely and breakfast has everything that anyone could possibly want. It is situated in a lovely neighbourhood with a lot of great food choices if you would like something different to eating in the hotel. Will stay here again.
