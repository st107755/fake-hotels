The Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel is a great place to stay while visiting Venice. This is a showcase hotel, with views from the rooftop bar that are incredible.  One of the most unique things about staying here is one gets to arrive by boat! The hotel itself is an art gallery and historical museum! So many items to look at while strolling through the hotel itself. The rooms are very clean, all the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and patient with foreigners.  This would be top of my list if I ever get to return to Italy.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Guest, It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel, and we are very glad that you enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
