We visited this place in end of January. The dates mached with agrand opening for Carnaval. The place is easily reachable from Airport just take a public bus to Venice and from there a water bus takes you straight to the hotel. After that you can always use free hilton's boat shuttle to city center. No need to buy water bus pass as you can reach all the places on foot. Atleast you wanna visit Burano and Murano island you need to buy an extra ticket. If you visiting this place in January watch out as it can get pretty cold. As long as you have good shoes you should do fine. The hotel itself was amazing! Has a great italian touch in its design. The place is huge and has many f&b outlets were you can enjoy a good quality meal. On top of the roof you can find an amazing skyloungeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 5, 2016Dear Guest, thank you for your kind comments and for recommending us to other travellers.
