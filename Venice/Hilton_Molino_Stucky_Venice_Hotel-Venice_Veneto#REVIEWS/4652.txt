The hotel is very nice right on the water and the service is very good, the concierge was gentle to suggest different locations for the night and to book the theatre for us even if he did not know the time schedule of the shuttles to San Marco and that the Carnival parade had been postponed to the following day due to the weather conditions. However the main downside is that there is a very limited number of rooms "executive" facing the canal, while most of the rooms face a kind of trash..., they need to do something about it!Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 25, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
