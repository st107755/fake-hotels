We arrive by private boat from the airport after traveling 30 plus hours from Australia before check in time but that was not a problem for the Hilton staff they arranged our room and checked us in with warm Italian hospitality. This place is close to the action away from the crowds a locals destination good restaurant choices at the hotel and close by. The free shuttle boat transports you across the water when you want to explore the tourist side of Venice. When we return this will be our number one locals choice of a true Venice stay you might even bump into Elton at one of the great waterfront restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 24, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
