Located on "La Giudecca" Island, facing the main Venice Island, this Hilton provides a great location (free hotel shuttle from/to San Marco within 15'), apart from the tourists'crowd  and with a very nice view. Very professional and friendly staff in a historical so well renovated building: nice rooms with enough space and all the comfort (rooms with view on the Dorsudoro recommended),  Executive Lounge to relax (located in the lobby), great view on illuminated Venice from the skyline bar, buffet breakfast proposing enough variety of foodstuffs and drinks, wellness area to be improved (not very spacious, necessity to be booked). Hilton “with a spirit” I highly recommend for both business or leisure.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
