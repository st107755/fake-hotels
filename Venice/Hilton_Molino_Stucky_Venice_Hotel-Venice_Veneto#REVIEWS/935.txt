Overall a beautiful hotel, beautiful location, and great executive lounge privileges.  Hotel offers a shuttle to take you to the most popular part of Venice and runs until late in the evening thereby allowing you time to really explore the city.  Complimentary breakfast buffet was impressive.  Hotel staff is very nice and helpful.  Highly recommend.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 27, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
