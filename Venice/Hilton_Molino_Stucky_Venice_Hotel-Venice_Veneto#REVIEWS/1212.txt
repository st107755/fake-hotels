We loved our stay here when we visited Venice. Our room was overlooking Venice. We enjoyed our boat ride to the hotel.  Important: If you are driving to Venice, you will have to rent a boat to come to the hotel. There is no free shuttle ride to the hotel from parking garage. Giving 4 stars for this as this was not clearly mentioned on the site. I recommend hotel website to clearly write this for people who are driving in.  They do offer free shuttles to Venice city center and they are awesome. Executive lounge was ok, have seen a lot better ones.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 21, 2017Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review on TripAdvisor.
