What a perfect way to end a cruise holiday in Venice with a couple of extra nights at the Molino Stucky.  Stunning hotel, perfect location to the port and the main tourist area of Venice Island. The complimentary shuttle boat to St Marks Square saved us time and money.  The roof top pool and bar have some of best views of Venice at day and night.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 24, 2014Dear Sir,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
