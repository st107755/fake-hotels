Thank you for praising our Staff, I will personally relay your feedback to our Head Concierge who will be glad to know that he contributed to your enjoyable stay.  I regret you were not able to catch the Shuttle boat on one day however we can offer a guaranteed maximum number of seats. We usually suggest our guest to be on the dock at least five minutes before leaving hour but I am glad that our Concierge was helpful and quick in organizing a transfer for you to start the scheduled tour in time. May I take this opportunity to confirm that the ACTV public transport station Palanca is only a few minutes’ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. We are looking forward to welcoming you once again here in Venice.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
