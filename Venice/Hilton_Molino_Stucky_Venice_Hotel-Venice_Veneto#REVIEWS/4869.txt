I booked the executive plus room ( kings room) nice room but for the price just a bit overpriced Hotel staff very correct, good service. Hotel in general as promised on pictures Got an upgrade to a executive suite, this was much better, spacious. So no complains on hotel rooms Utilities: the skybar very nice views on Venice!

I have been dining elsewhere ( look at resto advice from tripadviser) where the food was perfect en price quality very good. So check out local bar/ resto 200 meters down the road.
