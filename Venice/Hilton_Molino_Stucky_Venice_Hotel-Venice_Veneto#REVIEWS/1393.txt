Located on Giudecca Island, with regular water-boat shuttles over to the main attractions in Venice itself. This hotel is well worth the money.  It is very quiet and the staff are first class.  If you turn right out the front of the hotel entrance and go over the bridge there are a number of restaurants and shops that you might otherwise easily miss.   The private water taxi to the airport, whilst a bit pricey at 120 euros, is well worth the extra.  Would not hesitate to stay again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
