The hotel is in a perfect location.  its away from the crowds.  For us it was perfect because we walked Venice the entire day and by the end of the day took the free hotel shuttle from St. Mark's square to the hotel.   its about 10-15 min ride.  The hotel is nicely decorated and the room was decent size for Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
