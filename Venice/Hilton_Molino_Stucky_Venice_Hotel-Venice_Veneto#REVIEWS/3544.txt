I up graded to the Executive level of room which cost €35 per day and was still charged €20 for internet connection.  NOT A GOOD VALUE. The hotel is nicely located in a quiet area ov Venice.

It was good to read that you liked the location on the Giudecca island, a nice and residential area away from the crowds. On the other hand I regret we did not entirely meet your expectations as we always endeavour to offer the highest level of service.  With regards to transport, I am pleased to confirm that our Concierge Team is always available to assist and help our guests also before arrival with any kind of suggestions and information also regarding the tourist activities and attractions available in Venice. Your comments will of course be forwarded to the relevant department responsibles for their attention.
