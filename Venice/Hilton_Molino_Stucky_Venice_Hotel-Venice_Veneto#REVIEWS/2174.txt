Wonderful hotel, staff were good, breakfast was amazing - so much choice I could have eaten here for days. Rooftop pool was gorgeous and the views were great too. Complimentary ferry each day to and from the main island, makes it nice to get on the canal everyday for free, eliminated having to pay over the odds for a gondola. Simply cannot recommend this place enough. Rooms were a good/average size, wall as slightly thin but we spent most of the time sight seeing or on the rooftop.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 18, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
