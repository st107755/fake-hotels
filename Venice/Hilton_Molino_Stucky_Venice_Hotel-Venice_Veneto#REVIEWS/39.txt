Really enjoyed the stay here. The water taxi right outside the hotel is regular and very convenient for a minimal amount, which took us to the main part of Venice. The staff were very accommodating and catered to our every need. If we were not happy about anything they offered free access to the executive lounge and the Turkish bath/sauna as good gestures to keep us happy. It was my birthday and anniversary and they left flower petals on the bed and a cake saying happy birthday and 2 bottles of Bellini in the room when we arrived.  Only down side is that the walls are thin and if you get any loud people next door, you can hear them talking. Apart from that I will definitely come back hereRead moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 27, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you for your positive review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
