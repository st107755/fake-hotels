We stayed here for three nights in Feb. Great hotel and good service. It's nice to be a little away from the main San Marco area. The shuttle taxi to the main areas is v handy and they only charge 6 euros for unlimited use.  Breakfast could be a tad better but had enough for what you need. Spa is not bad but a little expensive on treatments  Definitely recommend the roof bar. Nice views if the weather is good.  Rooms are big for a standard and clean.   Hotel holds a lot of corporate events so can appear to be a little overrun with events which is a little annoying however overall I think one of the better hotels for sure in Venice  Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 14, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments.
