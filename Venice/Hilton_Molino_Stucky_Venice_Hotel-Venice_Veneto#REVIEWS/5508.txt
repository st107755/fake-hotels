Stayed for 2 nights at the Hilton Molino Stucky and loved it. Big sprawling hotel built from the old flour mill on the island of Giudecca in Venice. Excellent modern bedroom and very welcoming staff. Fantastic Hilton breakfast couldn't be faulted. Enjoyed wonderful, if expensive, drinks at the Skyline bar with fantastic views over Venice. Free regular shuttle to Zatterre and St Marks vaporetta stops. We enjoyed being slightly away from the main Venice tourist attractions on this quieter and more local island.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare
