This hotel is our favourite destination when staying in Venice for weekend escapes as a couple, or as a family.  Everithing is done profesional, rooms are very clean, spacious, wonderfull, you can see wooden beams in the ceiling of the rooms/suites as hotel used to be mill in its old times. Very stylish, with some antiquites details but on the other hand, very modern.  Pool on the top of the roof offers you  lots of privacy if you're an early morning person and you like swimming with no company in the pool before breakfast. But it is worth to wake up so early  and get  spectacular view over the Venice bay.  There is a free shuttle boat from hotel to Piazza San Marco, the Basilica di San Marco, and the Doge's Palace - ask for a free time schedule when check in.
