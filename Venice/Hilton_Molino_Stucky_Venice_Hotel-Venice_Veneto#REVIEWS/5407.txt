Stayed at Hilton Stucky for 1 night only en route to cruise.  We took the Alilaguna water bus from airport straight to hotel steps, couldn't be better and one of the reasons why we booked and only E15 per person.  The hotel is on Giudecca Island, but they have a complimentary shuttle boat over to St Marks which runs frequently and it was good to return to hotel away from the hustle and bustle.  Decided to take a private transfer over to San Basilio (costs minimum E50 for a 3 minute ride) for the start of our cruise on Azamara (fantastic ship), but the alternative was to get hotel shuttle to St Marks and then water bus back to port, the private taxi took us straight to customs check in so no humping cases up and down steps over bridges, completely hastle free and worth the E50. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
