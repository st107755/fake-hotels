The Stuckey is a fantastic hotel. It is beautiful, the service is superb and the rooms are very comfortable. I'm just not a big fan of venice so I might be a bit unfair in my rating. My only real problem with the hotel is that we stayed on the seventh floor just under the pool/bar in the hotel. It is the ONLY place open in all of Venice after midnight so It turns into a night club. Their is a separate line on the east side of the hotel to get in. Non guests are escorted to the club and security ropes off their access to the hotel. It is a bit strange if you are a guest. And it is loud. Request to be very far away from that area of the hotel.
