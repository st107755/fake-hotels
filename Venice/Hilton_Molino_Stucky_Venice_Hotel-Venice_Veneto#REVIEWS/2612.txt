2nd time here and still great. Make sure you book a room with exec lounge as this includes a breakfast equivalent to the main breakfast free of charge  I think breakfast is about 15 E per head.  The shuttle bus is frequent and reliable to take you to st marks sq.  The roof top pool has the best views ever. We had a little problem and the manager sorted it immediately. Will definitely be back.

I am pleased you decided to stay with us again and that your experience at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was positive also this time. It was kind of you to mention the great views from our Skyline Rooftop Bar and Pool which have no comparison in Venice and it is important to know that you appreciated our shuttle boat service. Thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
