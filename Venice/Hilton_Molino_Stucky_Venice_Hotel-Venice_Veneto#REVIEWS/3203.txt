Though we are sorry for the inconveniences you are experiencing with the pre-authorization amounts charged to your credit card (which should be considered as temporary transactions and not sales), we are pleased to confirm that these are always automatically released on check-out. The procedure is an international common practice which is applied by major brands, as well as in all Hilton Hotels Worldwide.  Please do not hesitate in contacting us directly at VCEHI_GuestRelations@hilton.com should you need additional assistance. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
