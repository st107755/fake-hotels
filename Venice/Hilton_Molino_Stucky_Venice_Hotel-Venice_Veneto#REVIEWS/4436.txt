We stayed for two nights at this hotel. Our room was a great size, charming with the old wood beams for the high ceiling. I assume the chandelier was a Murano glass light fixture. The hotel had great amenities and easy transportation between the hotel and St. Mark's. The staff were very friendly and the roof top bar is the best view of Venice around. One recommendation...if you are coming in from the airport, spend the extra money for a private water taxi. I cannot stress how hot and awful the Blue Line Vaporetto was. It took nearly two hours and was a total sweat box.  The option listed on the hotel website is also long.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 9, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
