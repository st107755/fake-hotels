We had an excellent stay. The roof top pool has amazing views of the city. We had a large comfortable room with plenty of space for the three us in an executive level room. . The executive lounge had great food and beverage options all day long. The shuttle to St. Mark's square had convenient time options. It was also nice to be across a canal from the crowds, with some quieter more local option on the Hotels side of the canal. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on our hotel.
