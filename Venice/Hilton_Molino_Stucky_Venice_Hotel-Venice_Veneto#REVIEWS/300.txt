We absolutely loved our stay here in June 2019.  I was a bit skeptical getting out to Giudecca from the train station but it was simple, a #2 water taxi straight to the island and a short walk to the hotel.  The staff was gracious and we were in a water view king room, #116 in building B.  The corridors are a little weird to navigate but they are beautiful with the former steel beams from the factory in plain sight.  Our room was beautiful and the wood beams on the ceiling were gorgeous.  One thing I didn't like about the room was the shower situation, with it being inside the tub.  The setup could have been a bit better.  This room comes with the quality you would expect from a Hilton property.  We ate dinner on premise the first night, sitting out on the patio by the water. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 201914 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 22, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
