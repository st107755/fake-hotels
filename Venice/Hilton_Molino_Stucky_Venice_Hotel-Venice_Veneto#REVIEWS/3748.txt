This hotel is truly 5 star.  The accommodations would be considered spacious for a 5 star US hotel, let alone Europe. The executive lounge was a very nice perk for Hilton members, as well. The amenities and details for service were plentiful. We stayed for 2 nights and can not wait for an opportunity to return. Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
