Perfect location away from the crowds yet close to everything.   The property is beautiful and very well maintained.      We had a lovely room that overlooked the Grand Canal.   The hotel's free Water Taxi shuttle is a wonderful service.  Nothing but great things to say about this property.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
