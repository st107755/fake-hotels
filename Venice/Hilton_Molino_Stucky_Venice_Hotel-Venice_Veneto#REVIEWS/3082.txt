My husband and I loved this hotel and it's staff! The breakfast is beautiful, fit for a long lunch if one had the time. If you are lucky enough and kind enough to the staff at the front desk, you may get a room with the view to the Canal, which we enjoyed very much. The lobby bar is very enjoyable and relaxing.  Not only we have great memories of Venice, we have them of Giudecca as well.  We plan to return at the end of August and we are looking forward to what we hope to be an excellent stay once again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 20, 2015Dear Guest,   thank you for taking the time to write such a good review about our hotel.
