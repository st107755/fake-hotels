What a view! This ranks among the most fabulous hotels we've enjoyed.  The view over to Venice is breathtaking both day and night! The room itself was beautiful, luxurious bath (although the shower ergonimics were a bit odd- but nothing to complain about).  The hotel is in a converted flour mill- so the room also had beautiful beams and pipes making it so much more interesting than the normal 5 star room... With free water taxi service included to several points in Venice- so romantic and fun!Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 11, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for writing about us.
