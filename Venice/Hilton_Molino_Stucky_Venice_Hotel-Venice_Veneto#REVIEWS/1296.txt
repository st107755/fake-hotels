This is a great hotel with regard to setting, restaurants, bars and luxury feel. Rooms are okay but not overly luxurious. I did nit enjoy the single bed as much but the sleeping comfort was okay. Venue for a conference is splendid and logistics are good. Direct boat line to the airport and free shuttle to San Marco. A good place to stay. Downside: price.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 12, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
