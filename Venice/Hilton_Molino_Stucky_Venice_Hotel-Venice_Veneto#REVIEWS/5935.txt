I stayed here with my 4 year old son & my parents for 3 nights.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The water shuttle runs on time and is wonderful (and free!).  Next time we go, I will use the public water taxi (for $15 euros) rather than the private water taxi (at $100 euros) to and from the airport.  Keep in mind that if you are looking for inexpensive food, it's not going to happen here.  The food is ok - but the value of the US dollar is so poor, everything is expensive.  Also, $25 euro per day for internet access is ridiculous.  The hotel is beautifully renovated - restoring the old while moderniziing.  The marble bathrooms are very nice - ours had a deep tub + a shower & bidet.  The bed was very comfortable.  Ask for a room with a view of the canal - it's worth it!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 20071 SaveHelpfulShare
