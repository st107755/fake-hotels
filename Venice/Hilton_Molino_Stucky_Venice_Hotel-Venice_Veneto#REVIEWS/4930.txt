We loved this hotel. We used points so I can't comment on the "value." We booked a one bedroom suite. Being gold members we were upgraded to a corner room with a view. It was a stunning view! The room was perfect. A king bed in bedroom, full bath, and then a living/dining room, and half bath, totally separate. Great rooftop pool with view, great executive lounge. Loved the staff.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
