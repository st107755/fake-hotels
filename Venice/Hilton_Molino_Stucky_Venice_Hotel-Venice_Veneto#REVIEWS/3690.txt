Precious memories, our stay in Venice was outstanding, and this hotel certainly was a major part of the magic.  Spacious by any Venice standards, attentive staff, speedy check in and out, quality air conditioning and really comfortable beds, with all important tea coffee kettle, decent gym, and best of all a roof top pool, with absolutely incredible views.  Very minor negatives were overpriced room service and lack of free in room wi fi but pcs with printer available as well as lobby wifi. But overall still highly recommended, you will be very hard pushed to find better in venice.  No issues with shuttle boat, no one was turned away at any time. If you do miss it local vaporetto stop also has frequent departures. Do not hesitate to book this place!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
