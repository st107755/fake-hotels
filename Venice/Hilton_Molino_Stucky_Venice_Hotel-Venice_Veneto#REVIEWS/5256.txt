In general, Venice hotels have small rooms and most of them are quite shabby. This Hilton is an exception. The rooms, lobby, breakfast room are all very cosy and big. The breakfast is excellent. The drawback is the fact that you are depended on the shuttle or else the public transport. The shuttle is not frequent enough. If it fills up, you have to wait for the next one. Also the public transport takes a long time because it stops very often until you get to San Marco. So if you are ready to get stranded on the island and does not care about this, then this is definitely the hotel you should stay in.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 6, 2012Dear Guest, thank you very much for your positive feedback I am glad to hear that you appreciated the Hotel, your accommodation and services and you enjoyed your stay in our property.
