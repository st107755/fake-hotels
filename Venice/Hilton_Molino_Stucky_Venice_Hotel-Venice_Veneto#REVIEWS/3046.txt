This is a beautiful Hilton. We were upgraded to a corner room a living room that was very spacious and plenty of room for the three of us that stayed.  The only thing I would not recommend is the restaurant for dinner; we had much better food elsewhere.  However, the breakfast buffet is great and far above the Hilton standard.  You have to take a ferry back and forth to get to the hotel.  If you are prone to sea sickness, you might take something for it on rough days, but otherwise is fine b/c it is a short ride.  Be conscious of the ferry schedule as there are two breaks throughout the day and if you miss it, the next ferry doesn't come for an hour.  We really enjoyed our stay here.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your review on TripAdvisor.
