We have just returned from a 4 day break at this hotel. We booked for our 30th wedding anniversary so wanted it to be special and it certainly was that. The roof top bar and pool give amazing views across the water to the City and all it's historic sights. The hotel has it's own shuttle ferrys which run fron 8am to midnight and at 4.50 euros each unlimited use it was fantastic value.  We had great service at breakfsat from Francesca and Gloria but the highlight for us was our anniversary meal in the Amari restaurant. Our meal was fantastic (compliments to the chef) and the attentive service we received from Rana and the restaurant manager was exceptional. They made us feel very special and it was a night we won't forget. Thanks to Rana and his boss !!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your positive comments on this website.
