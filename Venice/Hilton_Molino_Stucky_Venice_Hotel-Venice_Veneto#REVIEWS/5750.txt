Just stayed at this hotel for two nights and the front desk folks, specifically the concierge (Carlo and his staff) were fantastic. After our luggage was delayed at the Venice airport, the Hilton staff was very helpful when it came to providing essential items.  Also, Carlo made an extra effort to keep me updated on any communucations he had with Venice airport regarding the status of the lost bags.   Great onsite dining options as well.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
