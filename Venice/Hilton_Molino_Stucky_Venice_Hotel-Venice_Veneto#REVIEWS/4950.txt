A beautiful hotel located on Guidecca Island in Venice.  A wonderful respite from the crowds of San Marco.  The hotel is luxurious with great air-conditioning, a necessity for our stay in August.   The concierge was especially helpful in making our trip wonderful while at the hotel and fulfilling a request sent by e-mail weeks before our stay.  Great breakfast with attentive and friendly staff.  We stayed at the Hilton Molina in 2008 and enjoyed the Executive Lounge on the 6th floor and were disappointed on this trip to find it moved to the lobby.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 5, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Trip Advisor and for sharing your opinion on the Molino Stucky Hilton.
