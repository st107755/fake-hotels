This hotel oozes class....from the first look of the exterior of the hotel when you are approaching it over the canal, to its lobby, impeccable staff.....you instinctively know that you are in for a good time.....effortless combination of comfort, class and professionalism makes this hotel a great place to stay in Venice. The shuttle service is particularly useful. If you get a chance, do visit Murano for amazing glass works and the concierge desk would be happy to organize a water taxi (free) for you.  For families with kids, do try the Nutella bar at the lobby level....we missed it though! Rooftop bar and pool are superb. In all, a great place to stay in Venice...far from the crowded areas with all luxury and within easy reach of places of attraction.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 20, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
