My second time at this hotel and I LOVE it! From the staff to the room, very impressed! I will admit things are a bit pricey, but this is my favorite hotel in Europe so far!! I am a Hilton Honors member and the wine/snacks in the Executive Lounge is very nice. I plan to stay here again whether I travel for business or pleasure. I love the roof top pool and the staff is very friendly. I recommend this hotel for sure!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
