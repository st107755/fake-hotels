We stayed at the Hilton Molino for 3 nights during our 14 night honeymoon in Italy.  We loved this hotel.  The staff was very friendly and met 5 star expectations.  The accomodations were comfortable and our bathroom always clean.  We would highly recommend heading down to the spa for relaxing in the sauna and Turkish bath-free.  As for getting to the sights, we found the free water shuttle to be easy to manage.  Less than a 5 minute boat ride to St. Marks Square.  We used points to stay at this hotel but would absolutely stay again.  Although it's not in the heart of Venice, we enjoyed slipping away to more quiet.
