The center of Venice is extremely crowded and touristy. This hotel is on a nearby island known as Giudecca, a short water bus (Vaporetto) ride away. It's perfect for someone who wants to be near the action, but at the same time seeks a quiet refuge as well.  Buy a pass for the Vaporetto and it will be easy to move around.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 1, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on TripAdvisor.
