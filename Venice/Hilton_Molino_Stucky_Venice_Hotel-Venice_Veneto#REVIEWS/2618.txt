We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice Hotel for 3 nights and were pleased with our stay. The hotel is very large but the staff was helpful, the shuttle to the main island was not too long a wait.  Actually, one time there was a large line waiting for the shuttle and the staff filled the waiting shuttle and then put the rest of us in a private water taxi since we had been waiting so long. Rooms are nice, breakfast was very expansive and good.  All in all we enjoyed our time in Venice and would book again here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 1, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review.
