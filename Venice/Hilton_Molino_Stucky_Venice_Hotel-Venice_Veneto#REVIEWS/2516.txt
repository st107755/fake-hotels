Nothing can prepare you for how amazing Venice is, and this hotel just adds to the magic. The rooms are lovely, the breakfasts are tasty and the roof top bar has amazing views and is the perfect way to start an evening! Another plus is the taxi boat, it's free for residents at the hotel and will save you a lot of money. They're really frequent and a fun way to travel!  We got engaged in Venice so the city will always be special to us! Can't recommend it any more!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 17, 2015Dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
