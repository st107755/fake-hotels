We stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights. The Hotel is within easy access of all the main attractions and the regular water boat shuttle to St Marks Square and nearby attractions is helpful.  The rooms are large, spacious and clean. Hotel in-house cuisine is good. The fact that the room AC was switched off in April, however, was a let down. We felt that the Hotel didn't overly flex to address customer requirements. A case of Management perhaps knowing the 'price' but not the 'value' of good customer relations management.  Given the significant costs of the Hotel and the quality associated with the Hilton brand, we had higher expectations both in service and customer experience. Overall, a comfortable stay but by no means exceptional!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2016Dear Guest, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
