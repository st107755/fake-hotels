This was our second time to stay in this beautiful hotel.  The amenities are nice and the staff is professional and kind.  If you are not familiar with Hilton, the amenities include shampoo, hair conditioner, shower cap, soap, etc.  Also, large absorbent towels.    The location is fantastic, with a one time per stay charge for water transport to main area of Venice (the charge is only 6E per person).   In addition, this hotel has a nice spa and gift shop.  Food at breakfast was very good.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 17, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
