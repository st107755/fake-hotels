The hotel is first class and is situated just 20 minutes from St Marks Square on Giudecca island. The hotel provides a private shuttle boat throughout the day up until midnight at very regular intervals. There are several good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel so you can visit the busy tourist spots via the ferry and then return to the hotel jetty for the evening if you prefer. The breakfast is a typical Hilton buffet and is of a good standard. One negative is about the rooftop pool which was not very clean so we did not use it,  just the bar which has superb views of Venice across the Grand canal.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 26, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
