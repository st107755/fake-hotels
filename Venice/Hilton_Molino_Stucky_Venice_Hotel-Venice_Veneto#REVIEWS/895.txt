We stayed for 2 nights to visit the city. Rooms and facilities are extremely pleasant. The staff is professional and helpful. They offer convenient (money and time wise) connections to Piazza San Marco and they even arranged for us private complimentary transportation to Murano (round trip, worth about €100). I suggest to upgrade the room to get access to the lounge and pay a visit to Bacaromi, pricey but must try. Breakfast buffet is amazing, food, location and staff. Being located on Giudecca island, the hotel is out of the core of the city which might take out a bit of romanticism but it was actually very nice to be out of the overcrowded zone.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your nice comments and feedback on the hotel’s facilities.
