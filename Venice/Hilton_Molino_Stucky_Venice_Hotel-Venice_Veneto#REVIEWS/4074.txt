Venice what can we say but no place like it!  Surrounded by water and beauty.  Wonderful sites, food and people.  We would never think to stay at a chain hotel like Hilton overseas but had points to use so went for it.  What a great choice.  Hilton Molino is wonderful. Beautiful rooms, great service rooftop pool overlooking the city is specular, also a bar with great drinks up there.  Not right in the busy section so quiet and they have a shuttle to take you across all day and night.  One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at, loved it!Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
