A great stay in a great hotel.  We got an excellent room with a magnificent view.  The exec lounge is nice, but the breakfast in Molino is outstanding - biggest breakfast buffet I've seen.  Hotel gets a five rating because of the room, facility, service, and breakfast. What's not so good is the water shuttle to and from Venice.  We have stayed here in the past and they had nice taxi like shuttle.  Now they have larger clunkers that do the job, but not very comfortably.  It's great to be out of the hustle bustle of St. Marco area.  Giudecca is a more relaxed area.  You just have to plan your coming and going based on boat schedule and put up with the rocky ride.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 19, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
