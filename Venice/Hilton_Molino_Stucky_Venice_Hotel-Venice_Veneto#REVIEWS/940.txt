We were transported to the hotel by a water taxi, which is the only way to get around in Venice. The exterior of the hotel looks like many of the buildings in Venice but the interior is updated and very nice.  Our room was great with a lovely and spacious bathroom and the beds were very comfortable. We ordered room service and had the most amazing pasta. They also offered a breakfast buffet in the morning that was very good. We only stayed one night here but I would definitely stay again. You can walk to some places from the hotel but you can also get to St. Marks square by water taxi in about 10 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 20, 2017Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
