My 18 year old daughter and I stayed one glorious night here with a tour group. Apparently our original hotel had no working air conditioning. We arrived in a water taxi. The rooms were spacious,very clean and beautiful! The desk help were very pleasant and helpful and all spoke English which helped.  The pool was clean and large. We spent some time in the lounge which overlooked Venice. It was decorated very classy and modern and my daughter had  her first daiquiri . The breakfast buffet was enormous and the best one I have ever been to. I would have loved to have spent more time there!Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
