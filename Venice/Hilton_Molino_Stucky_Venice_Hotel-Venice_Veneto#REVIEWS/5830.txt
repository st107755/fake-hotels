Found this hotel to be of very high quality. Stayed for 3 nights during the summer and loved every minute of it. Our room was very spacious and spotless. Had a beautiful bathroom, extremely comfortable bed and great view (would give a sea view room as a preference) and a very large t.v. The staff were very polite and helpful and we were made to feel very welcome. Had dinner in their Aromi restaurant, which was absolutely sublime, although a bit expensive. My only complaints would be that, the breakfast area isn't really big enough for the amount of guests, and can get very crowded and loud. And also, it would be nice if there pool was a bit bigger. But besides from those, I would most definately return again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2008HelpfulShare
