We loved our stay at the Hilton Stucky, its everything you'd expect from a first class hotel.  Nice to be away from the crowds in the evening but easy to get to all the sights via the free shuttle service.  There are a few local restaurants within walking distance, it was nice to get back to the hotel after sightseeing, freshen up and have a short stroll for something to eat.    We loved our first ever trip to Venice and would certainly stay at the Hilton again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 23, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
