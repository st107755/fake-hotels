This property was great! I wasn't sure what it would be like to stay here due to being across from the main part of Venice. It was actually quite close. The hotel had it's own shuttle boat service which was super inexpensive! It was very close to 2 different public boat stations. I saw reviews of having to cross 2 bridges to get there, but don't be intimidated by that. It wasn't far at all. I actually liked staying a little bit away from the crowds in Venice. I'd for sure stay here again! We travel a lot and Venice was definitely our favorite city of all time to visit. The Hilton was a great choice! A super classy hotel with a great staff and amenities! You will not be disappointed!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 18, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
