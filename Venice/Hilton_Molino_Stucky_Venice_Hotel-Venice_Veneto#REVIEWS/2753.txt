It's a Hilton but not up to Hilton standards in some aspects. Rooms are large for Europe, bathrooms are updated. Carpets in rooms are shabby and dirty. Bathrooms at first glance look clean but really aren't. I cleaned mildew from the tub with my finger in the shower so it shows that the housekeeping team is doing a poor job. Also, the cob webs on the windows in the tub area show the curtains aren't being regularly cleaned at all. The bed area is clean, bedding was good and bed though not like at other Hilton's was definitely an improvement over other beds we had while in Europe. Our key cards stopped working and when we went down to have them corrected there was no apology given. I get it happens but a sorry goes a long way. The breakfast is good. Lots of choice and you can tellâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 19, 2015Dear guest,   thank you for your kind review.   We are pleased you enjoyed your stay and particularly liked the breakfast and rooftop pool and Bar. We are sorry if you found the prices expensive, however they are considered quite normal, given that it is the rooftop bar of a 5-stars hotel in one of the world's most iconic cities. Also, our prices are on par with those of any other 5-stars hotel in Venice.   We are sorry if the cleanliness of your room was not up to your expectations and if you had to come down to have your key re-programmed. It happens when the key itself is kept next to a magnet or a mobile phone.   We thank you again for your feedback which will help us improve and hope you will choose us again for your stay in Venice.   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
