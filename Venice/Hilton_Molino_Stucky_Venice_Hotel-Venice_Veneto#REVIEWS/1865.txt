Fantastic stay at the Hilton last week.  Don't worry about being off the main island, they have a shuttle that will take you right to St. Marks Square running all day for 4.5 EUR per stay.  Can't say enough about the staff here: room was ready early, was upgraded to a deluxe room with a view without even asking, and everyone was extremely friendly and helpful with giving directions and making reservations.  The room was great, definitely the most comfortable bed during my entire stay in Italy.  Wifi and breakfast were included and were both great.  Can't say enough about the breakfast, they have one of the best spreads you'll ever see at hotel and the food was great.  Would definitely recommend staying here!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
