Stayed here over the New Year and I was most impressed with the hotel. It is an old flour mill which has been very tastefully refurbished to provide a large hotel. It is worth paying the extra to get a room with a view. We were in one looking across to Venice itself and was well worth the extra money. Very tastefully decorated. A water taxi is perhaps an extravagance to get from the airport but for speed it is well worth it . There is a vaporetta but it is rather slow but a lot cheaper.  There is a shuttle to the mainland from the hotel but it is also possible to get the local vaporetta from just along island and this is very frequent. Well worth getting a day (or more) ticket depending upon your length of stay. The New Year's Eve Aromi package was expensive but well worth it -â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 7, 2016Dear Guest, We are delighted that you had a good time over New Year at our property and we thank you very much for your positive review.
