This hotel is a converted warehouse, and it is lovely (and huge). One must take a water taxi over to Venice proper, or should I say the touristy side. The taxi is free and frequent, and I recommend staying here rather than in the heart of Venice which is crowded and noisy. Also, the hotel was air conditioned, something we very much appreciated. We didn't have a/c in any other hotel on our trip (apparently the Italians prefer fresh air and don't turn on any a/c until--who knows?) It was really hot and we were grateful to be able to cool off after long strolls on the other side. Finally breakfast was extensive but dining room was stuffy.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 16, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
