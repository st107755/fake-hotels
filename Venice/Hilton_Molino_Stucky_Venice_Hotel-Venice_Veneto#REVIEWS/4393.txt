A group of four of us visited Venice in May and decided to stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel.  I am so glad that we did.  It was a first class all the way from the spacious rooms, rooftop pool and Skyline bar with breathtaking views of Venice to the complimentary boat shuttle.  The hotel offers this service on a regular schedule throughout the day.  The check in process was flawless and all of the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast offered every morning had several options.  Although the Molino Stucky doesnâ€™t offer a shuttle service from the train station, it is quite easy taking either a water taxi or water bus to reach the hotel.  The only drawback is that the hotel doesn't offer free Wi-Fi.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 12, 2013Dear Sir/Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
