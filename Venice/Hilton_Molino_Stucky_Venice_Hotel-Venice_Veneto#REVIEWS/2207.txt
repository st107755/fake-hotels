Excellent on all levels.  Brilliant location with easy access to centre of Venice without the hassle of being in the centre.  Very quiet hotel.  We had a beautiful room with a view.  Breakfast was wonderful and there was lots of choice.  There was a hotel boat to St Marks Square but we used the Vaporetta most of the time on a 3 day ticket which was very good value.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 4, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review and comments on Tripadvisor.
