We stayed in this hotel for two nights in April. The hotel lived upto it's standards, with spacious rooms, excellent location( distant from the main city centre, yet well connected), excellent breakfast spread and ever so helpful staff. Our stay was made extra special, as we were upgraded to a lagoon view room - all thanks to Tito at the reception, who was very kind and accommodated our request :) I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody who would want to be pampered for that every paid penny. This stay has further cemented our trust in the brand HILTON!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 21, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
