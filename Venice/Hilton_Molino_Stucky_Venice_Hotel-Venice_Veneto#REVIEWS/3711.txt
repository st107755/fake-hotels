Lovely location ( close to St Marc Square yet away from the maddening crowd ), great property with nice rooms, good food and restaurants and the usual high standards of Hilton hospitality.  Awesomeness Quotient.....  a) The sky lounge and Rooftop Swimming Pool. Has some awesome views of Venice b) Baccaromi Restaurants - Great Food with awesome views  of the Canal c) Views from the rooms are really nice d) Venice usually has small boutique hotels, The Hilton Molino Stucky is a landmark in itself on the Guddecca island  Not-so-Awesome Quotient  a) The swimming pool was not clean   Overall a great property and the best in Venice. Would i stay here again. Oh yes - always !Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
