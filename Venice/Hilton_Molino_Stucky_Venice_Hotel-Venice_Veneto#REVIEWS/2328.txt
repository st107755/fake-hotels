This was a wonderful experience for me both for business and for stay. The location of the hotel is outstanding and the boat services from the hotel to the airport was the most attractive part. You can just board the boat in front of the hotel and get down in the airport. View from the roof top of the hotel is an excellent experience.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 15, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
