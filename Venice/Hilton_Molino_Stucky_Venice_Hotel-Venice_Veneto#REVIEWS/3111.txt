I stayed two nights with my family and we had a great stay. Staff professional, good service and beautiful rooms with view. The hotel offers a boat shuttle for only 2.50 Euro pp for the whole stay and it is very convenient if you pay 20 Euro for 24hrs with pubblic transportation, and it takes you to S. Marco's square. I will be definitely coming back.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 9, 2015Dear Guest,  We appreciate the time you took to post comments about your stay with your family at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
