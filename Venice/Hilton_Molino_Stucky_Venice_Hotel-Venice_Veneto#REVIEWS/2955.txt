The hotel is in a great position away from the crowds with the Alilaguna water bus stop at front of hotel. We travelled from  the cruise terminal direct to the hotel which saved lugging suitcases thru  the streets, when we were departing a hour trip to the airport on the last service from the hotel at 17.35. The rooms were good, the bed comfortable but pillows too soft. The Aromi restaurant was excellent, breakfast was good. Value for money was good compared to other hotels in Venice.The only complaint was the price of the wi-fi internet when most hotels are free.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 20, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky.
