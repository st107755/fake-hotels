This hotel is beautifully appointed. It's right on the water and there is a free shuttle to the other side of the canal. My mother and I stayed here for three nights and there were no issues. It would be nice if the hotel offered free Wifi in the rooms, but it's only free in the public areas. The buffet breakfast was magnificent and the spa facilities looked nice, although I did not have time to use them. I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 24, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky with your mother and we appreciate your kind comments on the famous Hiltonâ€™s breakfast and on the efficiency of our shuttle service.
