Although a nice location the room was in a poor state of repair: broken side to mirror, torn wallpaper and hole in bedside cabinet. We also found the complimentary boat a bit of scrum as it was on the same quay as the Lido/mainland boat which arrived just before the Hilton one.  For the money we'd advise booking on the main island of Venice itself and treating yourself to a proper Venetian hotel with a bit of class (for the same price). Then you can wander round at night when Venice is at its best (the daytime crowds can be overwhelming) and not worry about getting the boat back.  They also don't tell you before you arrive on the website or email confirmation that the pool is closed until May.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
