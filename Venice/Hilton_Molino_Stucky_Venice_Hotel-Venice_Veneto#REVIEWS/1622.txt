Arrived in Venice, booked a private boat to get to the Hilton located in Giudecca. We booked here because we were visiting in the middle of high-season and Giudecca with its quiet, artsy neighbourhood sounded perfect. Upon arrival, we were quickly checked in and were amazed with the great service. Spent the afternoon on the rooftop swimming pool and deck with AMAZING views of the Venetian skyline. We loved it so much, that we stayed until sunset and love every bit of it. Getting to the St. Mark's square is a breeze, the hotel has a free shuttle or you can get a water taxi about 200 metres away. There's a bunch of artists who sell venetian masks and I got one for my mother. Every bit here was wonderful! Delightful and spread breakfast and wonderfully quiet gym & spa. Loved it!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 15, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
