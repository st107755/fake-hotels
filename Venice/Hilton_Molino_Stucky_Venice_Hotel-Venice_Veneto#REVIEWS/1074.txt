We stayed here on a pre cruise stay for three nights.  We arrived by private water taxi. The hotel is situated near St. Marks Square and is a short ride away by water taxi.   Staff were all really helpful, especially the young lady who is the concierge. My suitcase had been delayed at Amsterdam airport and as soon as we new it had arrived at Venice airport she ensured that it was delivered the same night - now that's what I call service.  The rooms were lovely clean, comfortable and tidy with a lovely bathroom.  The food was lovely and gorgeous breakfasts.  The views of the cruise ships coming in and out was an added bonus.  Would I come back. Definitely.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
