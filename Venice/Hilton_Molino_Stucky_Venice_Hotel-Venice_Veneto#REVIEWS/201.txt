We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Gianluca at reception provided first class service and should be highly commended by the management. He was faultless in his efforts to support my request of an upgrade and handled the transition of our stay superbly.  Breakfast was superb with a range of foods to select from. Service and support and staff was also commendable.  The rooms were clean and our upgrade to the Tower room was heavenly. The the view from our room was breathtaking.  We also utilised the executive lounge facilities and these were also excellent.   Overall an excellent stay. We were also spoilt with the excellent weather.
