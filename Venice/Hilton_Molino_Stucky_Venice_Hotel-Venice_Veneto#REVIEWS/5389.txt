we stay two nights at the end of August 2011 with very good weather [important for this hotel,ifyou want to enjoy everything].For us it was our second time and we had the same great emotion.Never is enough the time for Venice and the hotel,because and the hotel is very pleasant to enjoy the circoulation of any kind of boat on your feet,in Giudeca channel.Of course the most of the rooms don,t have view,but is not so bad,because all have luxury furniture.Breakfast in medium level,for Hilton.Enjoy the two atractions; the roof top pool and the gratis boat of the hotel to p.S.Marco,every 20 min.Thanks to the smile and very kind staff.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
