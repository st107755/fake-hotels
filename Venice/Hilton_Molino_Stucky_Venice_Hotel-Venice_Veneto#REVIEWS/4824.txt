Really beautiful hotel on the quiet side of Venice away from Ruhr bulk of the tourists.  I had a room overlooking the canal and it was lovely.  You can take a free boat to a glass factory - be prepared for the exorbitant prices and hard sell, we were offered down to 70% off so it seems a bit of a rort.  The major complain was that housekeeping stole loose coins from the room!  Reception said they would look into it and return the money, but never did - poor.  Beware!Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the accommodation in our Hotel and the location in Giudecca. Please accept our most sincere apologies for the incident with the housekeeping staff which was certainly done in good faith thinking that the coins were left as a tipping. Our Front Office Agents had indeed prepared the amount for reimbursement but unfortunately the envelope was not delivered to you before departure. I am pleased to confirm as advised in the personal e-mail exchange with you of the last days that we are at your disposal for a refund to your credit card. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future. Best regards. Alessandro Cabella  General ManagerRead more
