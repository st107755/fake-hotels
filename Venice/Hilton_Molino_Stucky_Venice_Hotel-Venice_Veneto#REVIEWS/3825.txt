Very nice hotel and amazing views!  The complimentary water taxi was greatly appreciated.  Being a Hilton Gold status, we were pleasantly upgraded to a small suite.  The two room was nice with a very comfortable king bed.  The executive room has amazing views and yummy food and drinks.  It was really nice to relax and have a glass of wine after a wonderful day exploring Venice.  We did have a lot of problems logging onto the wifi and disappointed that the rooftop pool area was closed due to a private party.  The hotel staff were very pleasant, however the complimentary shuttle boats were not interactive and stern.  They wouldn't even acknowledge a thank you from the hotel guest.  However, we would stay here again in the near future.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2014Dear Sir, Madame,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
