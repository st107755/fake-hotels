Our trip started in Barcelona and ended in Venice, we selected this property to wrap up this trip.  This property was incredible, I do not recall a staff so attentive and they often anticipated our next move prior to our knowledge!  The physical property (former bakery) was well preserved and the design team utilized the structure to create a very unique property.  Our only dining opportunity was breakfast as we chose to dine the many fine Venice establishments, as recommmended by the concierge which were always spot on!  The finishing touch was the pool--though it was a little cool and we were more anxious to visit Venice...this top floor pool was quite striking...we will be back on our next trip to Venice!
