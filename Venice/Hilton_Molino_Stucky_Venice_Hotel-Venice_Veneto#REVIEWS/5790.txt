where to begin? start with the layout, the hotel is a warren, the four main structures being Arsenale, Bieenale, Canaregio, Donatello. Showing a total lack of imagination. ABCD - really. The fact that they all interconnect on different levels and have narrow warren type corridors doesn't help the feeling of claustrophobia either. A new hotel should have been better thought out. how come you need a map to find your damn room? and the signage is so poor that I once found someone wandering through the corridors with his suitcase who had been lost for 15 minutes.  OK, remember that this is a new hotel, so how come you can't get a mobile phone signal?  the damn place burned out twice during restoration and you would have thought that with a shell to work from it should have been easyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
