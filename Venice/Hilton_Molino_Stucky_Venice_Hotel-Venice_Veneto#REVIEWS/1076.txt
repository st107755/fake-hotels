A wonderful Hilton on the water with great views. The shuttle (water) bus allows for staying in a relaxed area while easily visiting the more touristy and busy areas in and around St Marks Square. Also very easy access from airport and train station. The water bus, which is inexpensive and seems as fast as the taxis, stops a short walk from the hotel - just turn right when you get off and walk the equivalent of two short blocks. As with most Hiltons, the staff were wonderful and very helpful. On-site dining options excellent and as others have noted, the rooftop bar is perfect. Can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 15, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
