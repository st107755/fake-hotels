I was nervous about booking a hotel room on Giudecca during COVID, in case it meant being isolated away from the action of Venice in the evenings.  Whilst the current hourly frequency of the hotel shuttle to Venice proper is not great, there is a public water bus stop just a few minutes' walk away and anyone staying at the Hilton would be well-advised to familiarise themselves with how the lines and fare structures work (pretty simple if you buy a daily pass).  As for the hotel, I don't quite get the several other reviews which comment that the Hilton could be anywhere in the world, once you're through the front door.  The industrial heritage of the building has in reality been carried over into the interior quite effectively, and the staff could not be more helpful also. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20202 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded 5 weeks agoDear Guest,  Thank you for your nice feedback on TripAdvisor!
