My wife and I were joined by the sister-in-law and her 9 year old daughter, and the four of us had a great stay in this hotel. It has a private water shuttle to take you to the main part of Venice (it is off on another island) which makes it rather special. The hotel is very new and very well kept up. The stay was generally friendly, and the rooms were American style (which, after several nights in bed-and-breakfasts and smaller hotels in central Italy, was a VERY welcome experience). The executive lounge was incredible, since you could sit watching the boats go by, sip on your glass of wine, eat some local cheese, and soak up the ambiance.  Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
