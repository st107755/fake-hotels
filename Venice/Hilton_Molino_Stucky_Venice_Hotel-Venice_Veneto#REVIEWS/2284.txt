This hotel is beautiful and an A++++ location.  You are out of the craziness of St. Mark's square but the hotel offers a quick 12 min shuttle boat ride over to the main area.  The rooms are beautiful, the staff was amazing and we felt probably the most special as a Hilton Gold member at this location versus any other Hilton property.  There is nothing I can complain about this property and would advise and recommend it for anyone - business, family, couples, etc.  It is beautiful in every way.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 4, 2016Dear Guest, What can we say, your review is such a great way to start our week here at Hilton Molino Stucky!
