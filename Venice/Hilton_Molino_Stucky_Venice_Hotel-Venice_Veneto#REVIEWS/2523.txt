My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our anniversary trip.  Stayed in an Executive suite with a view and it was worth it!  We found the staff to be accommodating and helpful. We opted for the limo and private water taxi when we arrived because we knew we would be tired from our overseas flight. We had no issues with the free water taxi to Venice/Zattere at all.  Food was good and the Skyline Rooftop bar was excellent with views and drinks!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
