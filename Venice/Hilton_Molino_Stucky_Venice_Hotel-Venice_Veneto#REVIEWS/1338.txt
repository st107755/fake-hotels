This hotel is just a short ride away from the Venezia St. Lucia train terminal. It was our first time visiting Venice and the Hilton was wonderful. The staff from the front desk to the Skyline Rooftop bar are delightful. The breakfast was great. The rooms have plenty of space and are very clean. The dedicated boat was awesome and worth the small fee. Highly recommend staying at this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 25, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
