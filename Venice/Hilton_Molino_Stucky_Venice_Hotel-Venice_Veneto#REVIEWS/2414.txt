This was my second time at the Hilton and again I must acknowledge that this is perhaps one of my favourite Hiltons. This one is build on Giudecca Island almost across the canal from St Marc's Square ( you ll have a frequent hotel transfer boat service there). The building is an old flour mill and it s interiors have been turned into tastefully and elegantly created beauty. Service is excellent throughout, Sky bar offers amazing views (we managed to catch a full moon over the San Marco), rooms are spacious and quiet, breakfast sumptuous. There is a gym and a roof top pool... The hotel feels unique and out of the way of crowds. I came here for the opening of the Venice Carnival. During winter months the city is quieter and atmospheric. This is really a magical weekend getawayâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 25, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on TripAdvisor.
