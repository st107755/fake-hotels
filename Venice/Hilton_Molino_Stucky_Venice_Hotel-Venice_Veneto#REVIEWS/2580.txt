Excellent hotel very helpful staff on reception great location to visit Venice, if this is your first visit this is a modern hotel with all the necessary amenities. It is not however a true representation of a Venetian property this is not a criticism but for those who are on a first time visit it reflects a more corporate image. Food was to a very good standard with very attentive service, it is a busy hotel with some guests exhibiting some very poor manners towards staff and other guests.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 19, 2015Dear Guest, thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
