My wife and I loved our stay at the Hilton. It was the epitome of class and comfort. The location being on the Guidecca made it a really neat experience being our first time visiting Venice and we would stay here again!

The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you and your wife again to experience other lovely moments in Venice.  Sincerely,   Ilio Rodoni  General ManagerRead more
