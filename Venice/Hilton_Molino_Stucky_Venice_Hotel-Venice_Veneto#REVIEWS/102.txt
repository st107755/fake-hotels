nVery comfortable hotel at the riverside on Giudecca Island. A great location for travelers that wish to relax after an intensive Visit to the beautiful City of Venice. The hotel offers a regular boat transfer to Piazza San Marco. The rooms at the hotel are comfortable and we were looking onto the River where you can see the huge Cruise Ships pass by. The personell is very friendly. Nice roof top bar and swimming pool.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2019Dear Sir, it is us who should thank you!
