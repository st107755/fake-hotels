I love Hilton Hotels in the US. This one sucks with a capital S! I was so excited to stay here--my third time in Venice. Awful service, not very accommodating to your concerns and very rude staff! I have always been upgraded due to my Hilton Honors status, but this location does not offer any accommodations nor kindness toward your loyalty to their brand!  The reviews here are way too over rated and dismissive of their grossly inadequate customer service.  Please note that Executive Lounge is always extremely crowded and you can never get a table! Food is subpar that is low quality and tasteless. This establishment would be considered a Homewood Suites level in the US. Gross.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 28, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website, we were sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at our hotel.
