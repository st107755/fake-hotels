Absolutely gorgeous hotel across the river from San Marcos Square. This place is an old converted flour mill which has been turned into a beautiful hotel for which there is no compare. Breakfast was phenomenal and the executive lounge, though small, was more than adequate. (Almost) free shuttle service across the river to San Marcos was worth every penny and there were many excellent restaurants on the island close to the Hilton which meant that you didn't have to go across the river to eat. Excellent staff all around and one of the best Hilton properties I have stayed at around the world.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your opinion on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
