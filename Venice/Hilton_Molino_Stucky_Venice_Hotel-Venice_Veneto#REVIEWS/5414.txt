We decided to go to Venice in the summer with our 1,5 baby and the Hilton at Giudecca Island proved to be the best choice by far. For us the decision to stay at such high star hotel  for not an easy call, but when we figured out how much added value we had included it proved to really pay off. For starts the shuttle is included to Zattere and San Marco, so you can forget about the vaporretos fairs/packages. As we wanted to visit Murano we found out that there was a complimentary service there also.  Having a swimming pool at the roof top was the cream on the top. The view was amazing from there!! So actually we could enjoy the warm and full Venice but also hide/refresh on the hot hours of the day.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
