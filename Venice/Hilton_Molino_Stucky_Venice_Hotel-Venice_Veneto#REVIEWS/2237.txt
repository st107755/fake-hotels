Very good hotel. We stayed in a room with a king sized bed and it was a refreshing change in that it was a proper king sized room as compared to the tiny rooms which pass off as 'king sized'. The hotel has an excellent location away from the bustle of Venice but still easily accessible . There are regular boats to St. Marco for a nominal one-off fee. We enjoyed eating in the restaurants particularly the Bacaromi where the cuisine was authentic Venetian and delicious. Francesco the head-waiter was gracious, efficient  and very attentive. Overall this hotel although not inexpensive is value for money and we would recommend it strongly.
