We loved this place. The hotel is a converted flour mill which gives it a very different, quite quirky feel. On day one we got totally lost looking for our room and had to return to reception to get directions.  Free shuttle boat across the water to Venice so don't worry about being away from the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
