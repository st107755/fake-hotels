For a European hotel - this one has larger rooms and larger bathrooms (shower is still small). A big lobby area and the wi-fi works great.  It is in fantastic proximity to St. Mark's Square (a 10 minute shuttle boat ride away).  Our room was on the 2nd floor and it felt damp and musty the entire time we were there. My parents has a room on the 3rd floor and had no problems.  The a/c was only so-so (which is common in Europe).  The breakfast is AMAZING.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 25, 2015Dear Madame, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share on TripAdvisor your evaluation concerning your recent stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and for letting us know how we are meeting your expectations.
