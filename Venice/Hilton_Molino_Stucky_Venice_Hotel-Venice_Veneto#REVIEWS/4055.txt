This hotel was a bit hard to get to from the waterbus, but they did have a free shuttle that ran frequently to take you to the other side. The only down side is that we were traveling during the holidays so there were several times that we had to take the waterbus back because the wait was too long. The staff was friendly, and the breakfast buffet was definitely worth it.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
