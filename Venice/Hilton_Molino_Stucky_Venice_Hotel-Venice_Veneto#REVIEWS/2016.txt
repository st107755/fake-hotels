Hotel is located on the island of Giudecca, a 15 minute ride across the lagoon from St Marks square. Staff was good and the Diamond benefits were very good, especially the lounge. Rooms are average size, but have great character. Get a view room if possible, watching the sun rise over  Venice is magical. Highly recommend the hotelRead moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 19, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive review about your stay with us.
