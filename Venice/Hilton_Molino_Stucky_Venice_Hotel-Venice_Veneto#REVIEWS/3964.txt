Just taking off from Venice airport, very good memories on my stay. Great view from the Hotel room over Venice. Joined a business meeting, great coffee breaks and evening event with tasty and well-presented food throughout with the meeting.  Great breakfast buffet. I did not mange to visit the Rooftop Bar, I heard that it should be great but we had a full program - I have to come back.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
