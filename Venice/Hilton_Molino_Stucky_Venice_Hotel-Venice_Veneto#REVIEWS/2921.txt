Ok, right across by free water taxi (ten minutes) and on its own little island with more too do.  Hotel has a hardworking executive lounge on the ground floor.  It's a little cramped but the staff do a great job.  One huge restaurant for breakfast and the buffet breakfast is great, a little or a lot of everything including fresh fruit that changes seasonally.  Three other restaurants on premises including one on the top floor with stunning rooms.  Ask for a canal view room if possible.  Next time we are in Venice we'll stay here again.  Should I say no higher recommendation than the First Lady, Michelle Obama was staying as we were arriving.  Oh and a nice roof top pool and nighttime disco barRead moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 30, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveller who will decide to stay with us.
