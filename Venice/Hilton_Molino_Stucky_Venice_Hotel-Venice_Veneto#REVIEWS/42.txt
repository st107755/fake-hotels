I stayed here with my family and everything was great from the check-in. Alessia was great and engaging as well as everyone else. Check in was smooth and the room was fantastic. We were in a suite for a family of four with two small kids. The dining table in the room was big enough to fit six and the room was spacious. The shuttle was very convenient and the breakfast was great. We couldn't have asked for a better start to our Italian vacation. Thanks to the staff for an amazing stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 20, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
