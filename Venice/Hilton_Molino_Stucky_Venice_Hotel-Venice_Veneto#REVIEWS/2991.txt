My family and I stayed at this hotel in late April for a short vacation. i can't begin to explain how wonderful this hotel is. First off the hotel staff are amazing and always ready to help no matter what time of the day it is. We found the hotel staff clean, very polite and veery helpful. The hotel itself is amazing. The rooms were spacious, clean and modern and very comfortable. The fact that the hotal is across for the Grand Canal makes it even more special. We never had a problem gettting a water taxi to and from the hotel. The hotel water taxi is freee and you should use it any time you can. We highly recommend this hotel. You can't go wrong.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
