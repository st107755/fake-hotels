Looking back at reviews I found that there were rooms with thin walls, so I requested not to have "these rooms"  A response came and was told "not to worry"  On arrival we got a room with adjoining door and couple with a baby next door, you could here them cough.  We went to reception and told them we were not happy and he immediately changed our room.  My wife and I were tired so decided to eat at the hotel restaurant ARomi, the food was actually good and had normal Venice prices.  The hotel is very large, it is like a maze to get to your room ( I found it annoying) others like it.  The shuttle service is great and on time and convinient.  I personally wouldn't stay there againRead moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 4, 2012Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky. We are very sorry for the lack of attention given to your reservation requirements: you should have not been assigned an interconnecting room, which we normally give only when requested to families and to groups and we hope that this incident has not totally spoiled your stay with us.  Guest feedback is a fundamental source to evaluate our efficiency and determine areas of improvement in service and we thank you for your contribution. We hope we may look forward to welcoming you with us again in the future. Sincerely, Mario Ferraro, General ManagerRead more
