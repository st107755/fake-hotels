The hotel is located on the Giudecca Island, just 15 mins by public boat (Line 2, EUR 7 ) from the railways station. This brand new hotel (renovated in 2007) boasts an old style bulding with an amazing top-floor terrance and pool and breathless view on Venice. The hotel has also a free boat shuttle (every 20 mins) to St Mark. Breakfast is serve in a very large room and it offers a wide range of food.   On the contrary, the bulding is so huge that you need a map (which the staff provide you) to walk around. The Gym and the Spa are in a block outside the main building and this is not so comfortable after gym if outside is -2C and humid. Rooms are basic, Hilton style, with moquette on the ground. Clean but nothing special.   All in all, all that glitters is not gold.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 6, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your comments on your stay at our property and for sharing your opinion on our services and facilities.
