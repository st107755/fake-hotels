We are pleased you enjoyed our rooms and our gym, and that you particularly appreciated our location on the island of Giudecca. This is a nice and quiet residential area, just a 12 minute boat ride from the crowded city centre and is specially appreciated by guests and visitors who like to enjoy a more relaxing side of Venice. It also hosts a number of good and excellent restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. On another note, although we do our best to deliver unforgettable service within the strict regulations in place, we are sorry to read your experience regarding some features of the hotel, and in particular our breakfast, was not up to your expectations.  We thank you for your comments, which are extremely important in order to improve our service. We look forward to the chance of welcoming you back meanwhile we remain at disposal. Kind regards, Nicole Boffelli Guest Relations Manager Read more
