The Hilton Molino Stucky was a fabulous place to stay while in Venice. Some may not like its "removed" location on Guidecca Island, but we didn't mind it at all for the luxury it afforded. They provide frequent water taxi service so getting to the main island was never an issue. Terrific breakfast and facilities. The rooms were spacious, clean, and the staff attentive. A little pricey, but as splurge, it is well worth it!  Would love to return!Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 10, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your positive  impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky  I am pleased that you enjoyed the location and the quietness in the Giudecca island.
