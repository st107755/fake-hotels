We stayed at this hotel when coming back from a Mediterranean cruise.  Easy to reach from the cruise port, first stop on the vaporetto who brought us to the hotel. Like I am a Diamond member at the Hilton they upgrade us to a room with a amazing view.  Our room was already available when we checked in at 11 am, what was great. The roof top pool gives you a fantastic view off Venice. Breakfast was outstanding ! The hotel shuttle’s water bus brings you in 10 min to the Piazza San Marco.  It’s really a perfect place to stay if you are planing to visit Venice !  We really enjoyed our stay and hoping to come back soon !!
