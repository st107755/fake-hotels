Away from the hustle and bustle of Venice this wonderful hotel in an old Mill on thebisland of Giudecca is a small treasure. Part of the Hilton family of hotels standards are high and breakfast one of the best you will ever have. Service is second to none. Rooms small and pricey and the executive lounge too overcrowded. The airport transfer is 130 Euro by taxi but a mere 15 Euro buys you a 1.5 hour boat trip and transfer with Alilaguna straight to front of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 5, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
