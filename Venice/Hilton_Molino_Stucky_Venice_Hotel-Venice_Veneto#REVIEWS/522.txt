This hotel is just fabulous!  The decor in the hotel is stunning, I love the huge windows from the former flour mill.  We stayed in an executive room with access to the executive lounge.  Our room had the most wonderful views of Venice, we also enjoyed the Aperol Spritz station in the executive lounge.  One of the best selling points of this hotel for me is the location, I absolutely loved Guidecca Island and we found it so easy to get around from there.  I liked the calmness of the location and the cute little restaurants with probably the best view of Venice! The rooftop pool is stunning and such a treat, so is the Sky Bar! The hotel is perfect for large conference groups, with a fantastic self contained meetings and events area. The staff are amazing and always happy to help.…Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 4, 2018Dear Guest, thank you for your kind review on TripAdvisor, we are really happy to know that you have enjoyed your stay with us and that you loved the location on the Giudecca island which is a mix of 17th century houses, beautiful Gothic palaces, modern buildings and old factories from the early 19th century which were restored by important architects. The area has a burgeoning reputation as a hub of artistic activity and a lovely place to visit is the waterfront or fondamenta, alongside the Giudecca Canal. It is lined with numerous cafés, art galleries and restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, and we are glad that you had the opportunity to discover this peaceful and original side of the Serenissima. Thank you for being our Guest and we hope to welcome you again to experience other lovely moments in Venice. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
