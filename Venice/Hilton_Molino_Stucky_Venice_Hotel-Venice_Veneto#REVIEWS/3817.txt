My friend and I unexpectedly stayed at the Hilton when we arrived on Giudecca Island only to find our previously booked accommodation at another place had suddenly been cancelled. We arrived at night, stressed out and with no reservation, hoping they would have any room available. The man at the desk attending us was so incredibly nice and helpful, I cannot rave enough about how amazing the level of service he gave us was. He was able to find us a room, and in fact upgraded us to a room overlooking the canal (amazing to see the big cruise ships sail pass).  The room was very comfortable with a great bathroom I could have a relaxing bath in - just what I needed after a stressful day.  Definitely have a drink at the rooftop bar when the sun starts setting as it's lovely to seeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
