The room was huge even by Hilton standards. Very nicely decorated and of course the bed was amazing. Loved the slippers and robes. We didn't get a very good view, but wasn't expecting to since we booked the standard view. It was hard to get to the airport from the hotel, but they did have a free shuttle to St Marks.Read moreDate of stay: November 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
