Stayed at the hilton on a four day break, hotel was extremely clean and staff were wonderful and very helpful. The rooms were spacious and the bed very comfortable  did not eat in the hotel as it seemed very pricey same with the bar prices e10 for glass of wine is a bit steep even for venice.The shuttle boat was reliable and ran every half hour, breakfast was the highlight of the day plenty of variety from fruit right through to cooked breakfast, I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting veniceRead moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
