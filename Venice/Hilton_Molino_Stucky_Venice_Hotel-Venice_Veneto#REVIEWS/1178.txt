Reserved for our honeymoon a king deluxe room"upgraded" with water view. The room was very small and this hotel did not seem very newly renovated. The bathroom had items in disrepair. They completely misplaced my status. My new wife felt I was being cheap by booking this Hilton. You must take boat shuttle everyday to Venice. Additionally the front desk tried to get me to pay another 120 euro per night for a better water view, since I had already booked that room I was disappointed I had to stand all the way next to the window to see water. Unhappy with Hilton right now!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2017Dear Sir, We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel.
