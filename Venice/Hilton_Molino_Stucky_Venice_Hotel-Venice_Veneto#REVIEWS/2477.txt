I've been a Hilton member for over 10 years. Never have I experienced such enthusiastic, helpful staff and service as we did at this hotel. It's free shuttle service to San Marcos, it's luxury and value are the best!  A special shout out to Danielle and Carlo who made our stay particularly special. Highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 9, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review on TripAdvisor.
