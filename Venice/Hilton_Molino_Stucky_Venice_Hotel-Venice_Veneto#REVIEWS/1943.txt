Hilton is a Hilton and you know what to expect but the location makes this a great place to stay when visiting Venice. It is away from the crowds, there is a regular shuttle boat service into the main parts, opposite the port of Venice it is well served by regular water busses and taking a walk around the surrounding area gives an interesting glimpse of 'normal' life. A sea facing room is a bonus. The swimming pool on the roof has amazing views. The water was very cold when we went but wonderfully refreshing and in the summer months would be great. The restaurants are expensive but the food and service in the Aromi was excellent and a must to try. I would like to go back.
