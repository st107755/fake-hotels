Nice hotel located on an island across from San Marco square.  Free shuttle.  Room was very comfortable.  Beautiful view from rooftop lounge and swimming pool.  Very expensive to eat in the restaurant.  If you are looking for an Italian experience, this is a very Americanized hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 3, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
