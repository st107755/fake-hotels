My husband and I visited Venice in June 2014 and went to the rooftop restaurant at the Hilton Molino Stucky Hotel for a meal to celebrate his birthday. We were seated on a high table with stools overlooking the whole Vista and had panoramic views across the grand canal towards St Mark's Square and the Doges Palace. We both had pasta dishes as a main course and the taste was exceptional. The service was impeccable and could not be faulted. Our guidebook (wallpaper guide to Venice) said that this restaurant had the best views in Venice and they were not lying! It is a must to visit if you are going to Venice anytime soon!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
