Much quieter location than St Marks Square but within a few minute water shuttle service. Upgraded room on check-in with a wonderful, uninterrupted view of the water and access to the executive lounge. Large room with good bathroom. Would not really bother with the executive lounge as limited food and beverage and not conducive to relaxing with a book etc. Extensive buffet breakfast with questionable service.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 28, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
