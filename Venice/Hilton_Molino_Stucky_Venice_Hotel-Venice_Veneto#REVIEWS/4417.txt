We stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights before a Silversea cruise.  Everything was perfect.  We were upgraded to a lovely corner room; the concierge bought us a drink in the bar upon arrival and provide an orientation of the property and surroundings.  The food was wonderful, the service was outstanding and the water shuttle operated very efficiently.  Venice is expensive and the Hilton was no exception.  We look forward to our next stay at the Molino Stucky.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Madame,  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
