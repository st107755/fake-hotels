We were so pleased we booked to stay here. As soon as we arrived we were impressed by it's size and how beautiful it is. The lobby is massive and has a gorgeous bar where we ate one evening and thoroughly enjoyed. We had a deluxe room which was big, clean and modern with a huge Venetian chandelier. The bathroom was marble with a big shower and a bath. Breakfast was excellent- there is a buffet with a huge selection and you can order waffles or pancakes at your table. We went to the sky bar one evening which is expensive but worth it. The shuttle boat was excellent and ran exactly to schedule. The only negative is that there was not free wifi in your room. The staff are all friendly and very professional.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 25, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your kind review on TripAdvisor.
