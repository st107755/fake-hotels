We were very pleased with our stay at this Hilton.  When in Europe, we always buy the breakfast with the hotel rate so that we aren't hungry so early.  And this breakfast did not disappoint.  They had every type of food you could imagine, fresh squeezed orange juice, amazing omelettes, and fresh fruits.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The staff was very nice.  We will stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for the positive review and for the information you wrote about our hotel which will be very helpful for every traveler who will decide to stay with us.
