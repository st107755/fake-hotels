The hotel is very well located.. Breakfast is very good and the room ... well the room was just Perfect. I had booked an executive king and was upgraded to the spacious, comfortable and bright suite. Service is good but the executive lounge which is not really a lounge but a sectioned off area of the public lobby. Serves no good food but appetizers and snacks. So not worth paying extra for an executive room if you main purporse would be to use the lounge. Apart from the frustrating lounge experience, the hotel is pretty good for its purpose and the riendly staff at reception will make you feel welcome!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 6, 2017Dear Guest, thank you very much for your review on TripAdvisor.
