We stayed 2 nights and loved it.  Our room overlooked the canal so we watched the boats come and go.  The views from the roof top pool area are stunning.  The hotel is across the canal from Venice, but they have a free shuttle boat or you can take the water bus that stops just down the canal from the hotel.  One of the big pluses for us was it allowed us to escape the crowds in Venice at the end of the day.  We can only comment about the breakfast and Executive Lounge area as we walked down the sidewalk and ate at the waters edge both nights.  Looking across the canal to Venice at night is beautiful. The breakfast was very good as were the snacks at the Executive Lounge. We would certainly stay here again if we make it back to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 18, 2012Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your positive review on Tripadvisor.
