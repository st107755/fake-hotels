We chose to stay at the Hilton to spoil ourselves, and that we did! The views from the roof top pool, the sky bar are fantastic. The hotel is on La Giudecca, an island which can is easily reached by boat. The shuttle boat which is provided by the hotel is great. The first stop is about a 5 minute trip and there are cosy restaurants, great for an evening meal. The second stop which takes about 15 minutes takes you to St. Marco's plazza and here is the place to be if you want to see the real Venice. The hotel has a great location and views, friendly and helpful staff. Great for a weekend break or those that are staying a week. The hotel offers activities for families as well as couples, great food and a great atmosphere. A must for those that want to experience Venice in style.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
