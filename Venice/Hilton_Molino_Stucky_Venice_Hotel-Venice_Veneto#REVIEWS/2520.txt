This is a nice international hotel but I had two issues, neither real deal breakers. Firstly location is a pain. You cannot just step out the door and be in Venice. Instead you have to wait for a boat on every outing. As a result you are constantly woodying are you going to ss the point going out or coming back. On a three day trip we spent an hour a day waiting to go out or come back. In the evening you are a littke stuck with not a lot to do.  Secondly when I travel I like the place I am staying to reflect the city or country I am visiting. You dont get that here, you could be anywhere in the world. I prefer the opulent Italian baroque styled hotels - much more romantic thats for.  Venice itself is a master piece and a myst visit for a long week end - its should be right upâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 23, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on Tripadvisor, we are sorry we did not live up to your expectations due to our location. It is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and our guests can still enjoy the vicinity and a great view over the city. May I also advise that the area hosts a number of good and renowned restaurants, some of them belonging to the old Venetian cooking tradition, which we will be glad to recommend at the next opportunity of a visit in Venice. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you one day again. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
