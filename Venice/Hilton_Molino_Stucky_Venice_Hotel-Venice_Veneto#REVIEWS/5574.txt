It was the best hotel I ever saw! Everything is just outstanding there. The service, the pool on the roof, the food, the beverages, everything gets maximum points. You also have a shuttle for Hilton guests, so you can just take your time to relax. Venice and the hotel itself are contributing to a romantic atmosphere - if you want a memory for the rest of your life, just go there. My vacation there was just perfect, and I think this is more than I can describe.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
