I made a reservation 50 days before the date of arrival thru Dnata travel & Expedia . We placed a request that we want canal view . But instead of this we get wall view , yes it's an ugly wall with a very small room .when I argue with the front desk upon the check in they said that the hotel is full and this is what's available . I said that I paid 325 euro per night to give me this type of room with wall view . They said you should blame Expedia ! Can you imagine . My advise is not to book thru Expedia and to reserve in the centre of Venice Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 16, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry that the room that was assigned to you was not up to your expectations and that a free upgrade was not possible due to high occupancy. Please be informed that our hotel has various and different levels of rooms, from standard to deluxe and executive rooms and suites with and without view. We always try to do our utmost to fulfill our Guest's expectations but upgrades are subject to availability and therefore not always possible. Although you express some disappointment, we hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
