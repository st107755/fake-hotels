My sister and I stayed here for a few days after I had completed a class in Italian in Venice.  It was absolutely divine.  We were there for Carnival and it was THE place to see some fantastic costumed revelers making their way across to the events.  Very upscale, they provide some private boats back and forth to the main sections of Venice, but we were content to take the Vaporetto which have landings very close to the hotel.  Fantastic brunch - just amazing - (though somewhat 'americanized' - )   Just gorgeous with wonderful, accommodating staff.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 11, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments.
