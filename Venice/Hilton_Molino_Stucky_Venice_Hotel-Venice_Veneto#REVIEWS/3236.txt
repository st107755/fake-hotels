Spent three nights in Venice with my wife and two daughters.  We had two adjoining rooms with a breath takingview of the canal.  This hotel is absolutely fantastic!  The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever experienced ( and I travel quite a bit for business).  I should mention that we did stay in January, when the rates are probably much lower than the summer, so the value/cost ratio was high.  I can see this hotel being very expensive during the high season.  That said, you will not be disappointed.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 26, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for your lovely comments about the hotel and I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice with your family.
