We were in Venice for just 1 day and chose to stay at Hilton.Situated very close to St.Marks square and there were complimentary taxi ride at regular intervals. There was little issue with the drawer which needed to get fixed - We were immediately moved to the new room and also were provided with complimentary Champagne bottle & choco strawberries.A special mention to the rooftop pub which had awesome view. Overall a memorable stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 18, 2014Dear Sir, dear Madame,  Thank you for your kind comments on TripAvisor.
