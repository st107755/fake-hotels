We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Molino. Though this hotel was a little far from the main attractions it makes up for it in service. The Hotel gives you a schedule and times when the water taxi will be arriving and where it will be making its stops. The hotel room was very clean the only thing was my room didn’t have much of a view but we weren’t in the room that much so it wasn’t too bad.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, Guest Services / Front Office at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 3, 2020Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Tripadvisor.
