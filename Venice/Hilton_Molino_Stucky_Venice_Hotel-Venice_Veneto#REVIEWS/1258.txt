My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious, clean and offered a great view of the cruise ships, yachts and other boats floating by. The view from the rooftop swimming pool area was stunning. After spending the day among the crowds in Venice, it was actually very pleasant to jump on the hotel's shuttle boat to return to the peace and quiet of the island. We would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 30, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
