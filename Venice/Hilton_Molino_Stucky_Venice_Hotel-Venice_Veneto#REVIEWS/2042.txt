Spent 3 days at this hotel, it is a renovated flour mill on the island of Guidecca a small island opposite St Marks square, but the hotel offers a shuttle water taxi. Room was superb with the comfiest bed I've ever slept in!! Great selection at breakfast with eggs to order..... Roof top pool and terrace is the icing on the cake, views are absolutely breathtaking!! For a hotel of this standard and its location we thought it was great value, definitely be back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 11, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments and for sharing your positive experience with other travellers.
