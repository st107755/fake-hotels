An extremely spectacular hotel. Great private shuttle between San Marco and the Giudecca. The rooms are well appointed and have everything you need (apart from an Iron. You have to queue to use an ironing room - hardly a five star experience). The pool and bars are rooftop and offer truly outstanding views over Venice.
