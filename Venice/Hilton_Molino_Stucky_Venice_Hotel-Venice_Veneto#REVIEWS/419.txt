One of the best luxurious hotel in Italy, Venice.   Our luggages were transported by a boat while we took another passenger boat from the jetty to the hotel. It took about 20mins.  After we checked in and gotten the keys, we tried to entered the room but the keys do not allow access to the room. We had to go back to the reception to get it fixed. Along the way to the reception, we somehow lost our way. Took a few more minutes to figure out the way.   When we arrived at the reception, we witnessed a commotion between a tour leader and a receptionist. It delayed our keys issue being fixed.   Hilton Molino Stucky is just located beside the dock.  The morning sunrise view is superb! It is a must to witness the sunrise as attached in my photos.  Room facilities and deco are very goodâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 8, 2019Dear Guest, thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
