This hotel is actually located across the grand canal from San Marco and they have a free shuttle boat every 20 minutes to San Marco.Much quieter and less touristy and not the rip-off prices like in San Marco. The hotel was clean and quiet with friendly and helpful staff.An excellent buffet breakfast which had something I had never seen before,honey in an actual honeycomb.Had dinner one night at one of the hotel restaurants and were treated great and the food was wonderful.Canâ€™t comment on the price since it was included in our tour.Only complaint was not enough outlet plugs-in for our electronic devices.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 12, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review about us.
