Where to start.... Paper thin walls between rooms to the point you can hear a coffee being stirred in the next room. Paper napkins in the restaurant. No face washers provided. No wine glasses in the executive room. No free wifi.   Rooms were of a good size however the bed linen had holes in it. Cleaning staff entered room with one quick knock-did not wait for a response from guest before opening door.  I was not expecting great things being part of the Hilton chain but this hotel even left me speechless.
