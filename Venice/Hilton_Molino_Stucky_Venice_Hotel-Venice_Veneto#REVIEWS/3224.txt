This hotel is beautiful and in a great location - definitely a 5*. Just a few minutes on a boat over to the main island of Venice. Hotel has a lovely roof top pool and cocktail bar, drinks and snacks are very expensive, however Venice is an expensive city. Our room was a great size with a good sized bathroom too.
