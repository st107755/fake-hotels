The Hilton Molino Stucky is a dream hotel. It's located in the Giudecca island. I spent three nights there and it was perfect for our honeymoon. The hotel offers a free boat service to Zattere and to Piazza San Marco, which is great. The room was classy and had the best towels I've ever had at a hotel. During the trip we stayed at three Hilton's and the Molino Stucky was the best by far. The hotel also has a rooftop pool at the 8th floor with excellent views of Venice. After walking all day around Venice, the pool was great to relax.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
