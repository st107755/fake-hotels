The hotel is hugeeee! it has to be as its a Hilton property, The rooms are so cozy that you would just want to lie in. There are so many things to look/roam around in the hotel itself. Obviously you are in Venice, so you require a boat to drop you off at the hotel. You can call for the hotel boat (transportation) to come pick you up from the airport. The food was great, the staff was excellent. Definitely deserve five stars.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
