This hotel is very large by Venetian standard's and does not cater for hilton H'Honers diamond members or gold members ,there is no special check in area's or separate concierge so you Que.up with every one else,the Que's can be big especially if a cruise ship arrives,  the lounge has been moved to the ground floor and is to small for the size off the hotel and is full of cruise ship passengers as it appears the hotel has done a deal with a shipping line so all the passengers get to use the lounge so the refreshments go very quickly and it is hard to get a seat,I would not recommend this hotel to Hilton H'honers diamond  members as it does not cater for you and the service you expect for loyalty is not there .it is great for cruise ship client's and Venice has many!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 10, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are sorry to hear that you feel this way, however we are most appreciative of your TripAdvisor review regarding your stay at our hotel. You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton.  We appreciate being advised of any breach in the usual service for which our hotel is noted.  Because of our very convenient and close location to both Venice Passenger Cruise Terminals, our hotel is indeed a favourite with “cruise makers”. However we welcome only a limited number of them and we are proud to be a favourite with all kinds of tourists and holiday makers in Venice.  We are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.   Best regards,  Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
