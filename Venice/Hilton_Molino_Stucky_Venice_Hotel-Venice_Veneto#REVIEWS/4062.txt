The room was excellent, with a view to the main Venice island.  Breakfast was also excellent with many choices to select.   One down side was the location was far away from the main Venice island. We have to follow strict ferry timing in order to catch the boat to and from the hotel.  Because of this, sometime I just skip the free ferry and take the water bus instead.  Another thing to comment was the front desk staff seems very unfriendly compare to most other tourist hotel that I have being to. Not sure why, but maybe because I was just behind a group of noisy tourists when checkin to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
