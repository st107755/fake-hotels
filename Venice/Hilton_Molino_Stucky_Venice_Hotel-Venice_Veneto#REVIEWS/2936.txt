Stylish place, built in and around an old factory/storage house; Very nice public rooms; fantastic Roof-top pool (8th floor) and on the  7th floor a bar to enjoy the sunsets with a cool drink in Hand.  Rooms are OK - nothing Special to say about.  Staff is friendly and helpful - but most of the time completely incapable.  We got wrong door-keys; bill at check-out was not correct; eventually all these mix-ups were due to the fact that michelle Obama stayed there at  the same.   Anyhow: i would go there again because the place is just gorgeous and  easily made up all the other shortcommings.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 25, 2015Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
