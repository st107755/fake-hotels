I was a little nervous about the decision to stay on Giudecca, but am so glad we did! The hotel itself was beautiful and the staff was great.. They upgraded us to an enormous room even though we were staying on points. Transportation between Giudecca and San Marco was super easy and fast with the free hotel water shuttle. It was just really great to be able to escape the madness at the end of the day and find the little treasures on Giudecca.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 11, 2013Dear Sir/Madame  We are happy to hear that your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was satisfactory.
