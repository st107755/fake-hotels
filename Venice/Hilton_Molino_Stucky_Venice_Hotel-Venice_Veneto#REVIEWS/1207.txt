Stayed in an executive room, traditional design yet clean/fresh. Expensive mini-bar but space at top to store own items which was useful. Our room very quiet despite being so near canal-excellent sleep quality. Good selection of toiletries. Hotel has an amazing roof top pool/terrace - felt like a millionaire using it. Also, roof top bar was amazing of an evening, we had a drink there every night after we'd been out - very romantic and amazing views. Hotel shuttle boat is quite regular (approx 20 mins) and easy to use; you get the bonus of accessing restaurants on this side of canal (which are far cheaper than main Venice area) and fantastic views over to Venice, whilst less busy. Would definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: May 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 21, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting all your nice comments on TripAdvisor and for highly reccommending our property to other travelers!
