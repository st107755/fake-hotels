Hilton's are rarely conversions of old buildings so this was an interesting choice for Venice. It's an imposing structure, formerly a flour mill that fell into disrepair and set directly on the canal. It's just a few minutes walk from the Palanca stop if you are coming from the station. I was upgraded to a suite on the top floor with a view of Venice due to Hilton status which was very welcome.   There are a number of buildings and I often found people wandering around on our floor looking for the pool which was accessed by a separate bank of lifts down the corridor from the lobby. Some reviewers have posted that it's confusing but after checking the map and signs you soon get the hang of it. The rooftop pool is fabulous - where else can you swim with views of Venice at dusk?â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
