Really great hotel.  The staff is amazingly helpful ... Ricardo, Carlos, Frederica, Animi, Ilaria ... just to name a few. The staff takes quite seriously the value of helping the guests with any needs. As for the location ... well, Giudecca is a little out of the way.  But, the hotel provides a regular shuttle to a few convenient locations. I would certainly return!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
