Stayed here for 2 nights. We loved the location. Nice and quiet and very easy to get around due to the hotels free shuttleboat service. The rooms are very spacious and beautiful. Roof top pool area is a must! Clean, fresh hotel. Friendly staff. Breakfast buff√®t over-the-top excellent. Only thing is..taken in consideration this is a luxury hotel, it`s still very expensive to eat & drink at the hotel.. apart from that - a perfect place to stay in Venice :)Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 24, 2014Dear Madame,  Thank you very much for posting your nice comments on TripAdvisor.
