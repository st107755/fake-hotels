Absolutely factastic Hotel. We spent 3 days there 3rd to 6th  August, The Breakfast and Executive Lounge snacks and drinks exceeded our expectations.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The complimentary shuttle bus to San Marco was also excellent.  I would definately stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
