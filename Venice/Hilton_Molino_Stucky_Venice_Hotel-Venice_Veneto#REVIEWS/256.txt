This is a really a lovely hotel.  Our rooms were stunning with beautiful views of Venice.  The staff from check in to check out was wonderful.  The morning breakfast is so good. The chocolate granola cereal is to die for!  The hotel water taxi runs regularly so no worries getting to where you need to go.  Loved the fact we were in Venice but secluded.  Really fine hotel and they took such good care of us.  It probably doesn't hurt that I'm Diamond with Hilton but my sense is they treat all the guest the same way!Read moreDate of stay: March 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 23, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your nice comments on this website.
