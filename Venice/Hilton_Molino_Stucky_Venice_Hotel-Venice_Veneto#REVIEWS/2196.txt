The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice (Giudecca) was wonderful.  Exceptional quality and service; the rooms were spacious and well-appointed.  The hotel's colorful history and furnishings make it an interesting destination in itself.  The staff was very accommodating and extremely helpful in arranging water taxi travel and in providing recommendations for local travel.  I must admit I am biased towards Hilton properties and this one did not disappoint -- I can always rest assured that there will be a high standard of quality.  The roof top lounge is spectacular -- views of the grand canal and the entire storied skyline of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 9, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
