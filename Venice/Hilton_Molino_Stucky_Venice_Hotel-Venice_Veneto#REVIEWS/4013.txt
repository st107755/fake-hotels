It was fantastic!! We started our honeymoon in Venice. Hotel staff gave us a comfortable and friendly feel. Hotel rooms are clean and comfortable. The bedding was very soft. They celebrate our honeymoon and gave us a room upgrade. To go to the hotel from the city you should use a boat, but the hotel runs shuttle boat to San Marco. Therefore, guests can easily go to the tourist.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
