This was our 4th time in Venice and we were always curious about staying at this beautiful historical building in Giudecca. We were greeted upon arrival by the hotel staff for our anniversary, also we were able to, very conveniently, check in early into our room with a view and with rose petals in bed!  The room was very nice, with traditional tasteful decor and enough space. Bathroom was also good. Our lateral view was wonderful, not very wide but from floor to ceiling and from bed we could see Venice skyline. What a treat for us! The hotel common areas are posh and the rooftop bar has an amazing view day or night.
