My son & I were so looking forward too our stay in this splendid hotel & the only reason I choose this particular hotel over other 5* hotels in Venice with pools was because of it's beautiful (much publicised) roof-top pool! To our huge disapointment (& without prior notice) the roof-top pool was closed for the whole week-end of our trip due to a celebration (Redentore) which is celebrated annually & was used for a Gourmet Night on the Saturday. Would have been nice to be aware of this before booking? The management offered dis-gruntled customers a complimentary cocktail/lunch as compensation - considering how much I had paid to stay there I thought it was not good enough. I can't fault how stunning the hotel is, but value for money - I would say no.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
