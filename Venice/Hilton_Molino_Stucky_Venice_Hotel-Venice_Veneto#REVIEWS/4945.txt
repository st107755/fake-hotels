Lovely hotel, fantastic service. It's really gratifying to get back from a day walking around Venice and jump into the pool overlooking the entire city. Great bar at the top to spend the evening chilling and taking in Venice illuminated across the water. Lovely breakfast too. Would recommend.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
