Stayed here for the first two days of honey moon. Overall a great place to stay. Rooftop pool and view over Venice was exceptional and probably the best in Venice. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Breakfast was great with huge amounts of choice. Taxi shuttle to Venice city was easy to catch and regular running late into the night. Also water taxi to the airport goes straight from the door. Only downside was that the room was a bit small. Still would highly recommend as a place in Venice away from the hustle and bustle.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 5, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your kind comments about our property.
