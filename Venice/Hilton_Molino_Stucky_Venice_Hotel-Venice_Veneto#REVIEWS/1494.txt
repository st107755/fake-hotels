Spent two nights and was very pleased. Hotel has great boat shuttle service to top Venice locations and provides a welcome respite from crowds.  Great views.  Pleasant executive lounge. Wonderful breakfast buffet in restaurant.  Housekeeping somewhat lacking.  Only European style bedding - duvets only with no sheets. Tough for when you are too hot with the duvet but chilly with nothing.  Also no wash clothes provided.  A long wait (45 minutes to an hour) if you requested small amount of ice.  Valets not available to help with luggage on or off of their own Hilton shuttle boats.  This is definitely a problem, but overall this hotel has a great location and a thoughtfully restored facility.  Definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: March 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 9, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
