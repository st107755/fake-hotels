the hotel is nice with shuttle service to St. Mark's square.  However, they have a Sky Bar and Saturyday night the loud music kept us awake until 2:30 a.m.  Also, the rolling carts outside on the sidewalks were annoying and kept us awake each night until 11:00 p.m.  It's a big hotel with lots of tourists.  I would choose another location for my next visit.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor and for taking the time to let us know how we are meeting your expectations.
