Stayed 5 nights in July with 2 adults and 4 children age 10-16 on 3rd leg of 3 week European journey.  Arrived by overnight train to Santa Lucia, then bought 1 week vaporetto passes and after a good bit of confusion boarded the packed vaporetto to Zaterre where we found the Hilton shuttle.  Marveled at the unbelievable beauty the entire way.  Wow--is this a great place!  As many have said, the Hilton is a very large hotel on an island, Giudecca, across the canal from Venice proper.  We stayed in rooms 338 and 339, which was a joined room and suite.  The room had no water view but was great size and absolutely perfect for us.  Big thanks to Hilton for the assignment.    The hotel has been well covered in tripadvisor.  What I think has been left out is how really great the islandâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 14, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments on TripAdvisor in regard to your stay with your family at the Molino Stucky Hilton Venice.
