You can be assured that we are most concerned our establishment did not offer you the usual standards expected by guests at Hilton. We appreciate being advised of any breach in the usual service for which our hotel is noted. May I take this opportunity to confirm that the Venice City tax was introduced by the City Council on hotel stays since August 24th 2011. The amount for a five star hotel is of 5 Euro (in high season) or 3.50 Euro (in low season) per person per night, applicable for a maximum of 5 nights. Tax reductions and exemptions as follows: children under 10 years old are exempted, children between 10 to 16 years are entitled to a 50% reduction on the amount. The tax is not due to the hotel but to the city and it is payable only upon check out. Your comments are being reviewed and we are looking forward to welcoming you again, not only at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice but also at any of our other Hilton hotels.  Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
