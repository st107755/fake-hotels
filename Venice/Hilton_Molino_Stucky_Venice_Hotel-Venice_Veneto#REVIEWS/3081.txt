We had a very enjoyable stay here. The hotel is very clean, in great condition and the staff were very friendly, our room was also very nice. I would highly recommend evening drinks from the skyline bar, fantastic views!  Do be warned though it is very expensive to eat and drink here! Check the minibar charges on check out! There were a number of incorrect additions, and when a can of sprit is charged at 7 euros it makes a difference if it's not correct! These were swiftly dealt with and removed  on check out with no fuss, so credit to the reception staff.  Overall a great stay and I would recommend to anyone with a good sized budget!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, Guest Relations Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Apr 20, 2015Dear Mr. Dan,   thank you for taking the time to review us on Tripadvisor.   We were very glad to read that your stay was enjoyable for you and that you were satisfied with the staff, service, room and views from Skyline bar!  Our minibar has electronic sensors underneath each item, so that whenever you pick up something, it will be automatically added to your bill. This system is in use in all Hilton hotels and most hotels of major chains. We are glad that upon check-out your bill was rectified and you were able to pay only for the drinks you consumed.   Thank you for recommending our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon.   Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
