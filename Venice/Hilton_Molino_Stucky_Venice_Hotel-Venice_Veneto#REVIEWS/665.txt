On May 29, we checked out after a wonderful 4 nights at this exquisite hotel.  After four hours of driving, my spouse suddenly remembered her jewelry box in the room safe.  We emailed the hotel and they immediately replied that it was found and was safe in their lost and found.  Unfortunately, Italian laws are complex and it took multiple attempts to finally generate the proper forms and get a UPS Express Shipment where I was both shipper and receiver.  But, it finally arrived and all is well.  Our thanks go out to the staff of the hotel and especially Ms. Peyras, the Director of Operations at this great hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 19, 2018Dear Sir, Thank you for choosing the Hilton Molino Stucky for your Venetian experience and for sharing your feedback on TripAdvisor.
