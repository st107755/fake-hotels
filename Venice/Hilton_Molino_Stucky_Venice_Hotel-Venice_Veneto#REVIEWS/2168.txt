Fair five stars hotel located in old mill on a southern islands of Giudecca. It's 15 minutes by water tram far from the San Marco square. Hotel trams are free and depart +/- every 20 minutes. So, in my opinion location is very good, quite far from crowded and noisy city center. Hotel itself is quite impeccable. It's stylish, well restored old building, nice furnished, good service, good breakfast. A little bit noisy from ships and a little bit expensive! :)))Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded May 20, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
