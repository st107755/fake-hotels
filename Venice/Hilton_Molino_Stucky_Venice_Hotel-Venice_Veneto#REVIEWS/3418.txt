On arrival at this hotel where we were greeted like treasured and returning guests for being Hilton honours members, though we had not been before, upgraded to a suite which was spacious and lovely though sadly (to my wife) had a poor outlook at the rear of the hotel ( my wife had visions of watching Gondolas), we were also given access to the executive lounge which gave us a free breakfast, soft drinks, tea and coffe all day and free wines and beers from 5 to 7 every evening and at Venice prices this was real perk!  We ate twice in the hotel resturants and bar and the food was excellent which was a pleasant surprise though not cheap.  A great hotel and lovely base with a free shuttle boat to St Marks going every 20 mins, I would definitely go again!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 14, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
