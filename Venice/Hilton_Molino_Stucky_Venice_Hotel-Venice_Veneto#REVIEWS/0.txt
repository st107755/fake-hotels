One of the better Hiltons in the world! Stayed two nights here. It's a beautiful hotel, with stunning views of Venice.  Very COVID-safe without being over the top - sensible and politely enforced.  You may or may not like the fact that it's across the water from the main island of Venice. This is good because it's quieter and less touristy, and there is a free shuttle boat across throughout the day and evening. But you won't be able to pop back to the hotel as easily.  Rooms are large, well appointed, and luxurious. Wifi is fast. Staff helpful.Read moreDate of stay: July 2020HelpfulShare
