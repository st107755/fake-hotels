This Hilton is lovely, albeit huge, and a breath of fresh air when it comes to service. The room (ours a superior with 2 beds) was very small, although nicely decorated, up-to-date and clean. The food at the lounge restaurant is really just average but high-priced, but the service was good. I recommend this hotel because of its friendly service, nice spa, modern decor, and a brand you can count on. Off season and shoulder season have very affordable rates.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 21, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
