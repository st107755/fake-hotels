i travelled as a family. Big place great staff, helpful and courteous. Mostly everything you need is available. great views of venice away from the maddening crowds. Sometimes a bit confusing as different blocks have been connected. breakfast was good though limited dining options at the restaurant. All in all a perfect place to stay for the Venetian experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
