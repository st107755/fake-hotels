This hotel was perfect for our pre-cruise stay. Less than 10 minutes from St. Marks Square by hotel water shuttle,and some great shopping, sightseeing, and eating.. Easy ride to Murano and Burano. Hotel is small and very comfortable, with  very friendly staff. Only ate buffet breakfast but it was very nice. Rooftop bar gave a great panarama of Venice. Would stay there again on our next Venice visit.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 14, 2011Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
