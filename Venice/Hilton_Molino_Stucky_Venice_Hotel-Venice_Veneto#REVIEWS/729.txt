This hotel is a first class hotel. Rooms were excellent. We had a suite that I received as a Lifetime Hilton Diamond member. I travel a lot and I donâ€™t remember the last time I had a room this nice. The amenities were nice, rooftop pool, executive lounge, shuttle to and from St. Marks square. The staff were very nice and very prompt.  Overall just a great place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 11, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you for your positive comment about the Hilton Molino Stucky.
