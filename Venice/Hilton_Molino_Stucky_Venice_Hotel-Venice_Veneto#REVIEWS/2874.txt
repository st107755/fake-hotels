An amazing transformation from a flour mill to a 5 star hotel. We had a room on the 5th floor with views of Venice, very nice. Breakfast and service was excellent.  Michelle Obama happened to stay there at the same time and security was very tight, it has taken the edge off as one could not move freely in the hotel, especially the higher floors. Apart from this the hotel was a nice place to stay away from the the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 14, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for writing a review about the Hilton Molino Stucky on TripAdvisor.
