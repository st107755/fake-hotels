This hotel requires a 5-10 mins ride on a free shuttle boat to reach Campo di San Marco. This gives you a chance to escape from the most touristy and busy parts of the city if your kids have had enough. Biggest plus is the rooftop pool w a fantastic view of Venice. Really amazing! Beware that during the week the boat is very busy and does not always have room for everyone so plan to be at the pier 15 mins before or you may not get on. Super breakfast, especially for Europe.
