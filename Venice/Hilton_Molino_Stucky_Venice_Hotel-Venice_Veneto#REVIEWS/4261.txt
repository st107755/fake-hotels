A wonderful hotel.  Easy access to San Marco with the hotel shuttle boat.  My room was beautiful but had no great view.  Had asked for a canal view if possible, but maybe those rooms were all taken.  Never mind, I still loved this hotel.  The most gorgeous thing about it was the Sky Bar - the bar on the roof!  They served the most beautiful Bellini's that I had had in Venice - accompanied with complimentary nibbles.  The staff are very polite and very professional, and the bar plays great music too.  It's on the expensive side, but really worth it.  It's a wonderful place to watch the sun go down over Venice.  Come here if you want a beautiful Bellini and friendly service - not Harry's Bar!!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
