I booked thru Priceline and got a really good rate for Venice so I don't have much to complain about. The Hotel is what was expected for Hilton and the rooms were decorated very nicely with Ventician chandelier with high beamed ceilings. The bathroom was all marbel with separate tub (extra long) and shower. The only complaint comes from the service staff - housekeeping barely "picked up" room and didn't replinish soap or coffee. They also left a broken glass in the dusty cabinet. I called to request the items they forgot around mid afternoon and at midnight they still had not brought them..so i called again. The bar service was horrible, the bartender seemed overworked and irriated. The pool area, while very pleasant, is lacking enough loungers.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
