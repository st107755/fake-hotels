Lovely hotel in Giudecca at a relatively good price. The room was quite pleasant, quiet and relatively spacious for Venice among other things; the bed was very comfortable, and the view of the Canale Della Giudecca from the room was wondrous to say the least.   The hotel in and of itself was impressive and unique, being a converted 19th century industrial complex. The rooftop area, namely the swimming pool and the lounge, was superb, and the location of the establishment was very convenient in that Giudecca, being a residential area, is mostly devoid of tourists whilst being still very well connected to the other islands of the city through either the hotel's shuttle or vaporetto.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments.
