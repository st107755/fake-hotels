We own a travel agency and travel alot to see hotels for our clients. We stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky for 1 night in September this year and from the moment we walked in everything went so smoothly. The front person was so helpful in checking us in early so we could go enjoy our day. We did see alot of Venice and I have to say that the Hilton is a great location, as you are away from the chaos of San Marco but just a quick water taxi away.  The rooms were so clean and very spacious...the beds were wonderful.  I would definitely stay here again when traveling to Venice. Thank you very much for your hospitality while we were there.
