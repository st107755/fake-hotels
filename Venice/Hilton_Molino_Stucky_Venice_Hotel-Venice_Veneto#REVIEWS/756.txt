Truly enjoyed this beautiful hotel. My husband and I upgraded to an executive suite. This room gave us a spectacular view of Venice.  The roof top bar was everything that was mentioned in other reviews. We had no trouble going over to San Marco square, suggest you do this later in the afternoon.  The bathroom was spacious and very clean. Great buffet breakfast.
