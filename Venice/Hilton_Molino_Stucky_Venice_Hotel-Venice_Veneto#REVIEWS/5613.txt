The hotel is located across the center of Venice, Piazza San Marco. You can easily go there by private baot, free of charge.  The hotel architecture (I guess it was a old noodle fabric) is very unique with tasty rooms, very well designed. Compared with other hotels in Venice the hotel is tall, you can oversee the Island of Venice pretty good. Don't miss the outdoor bar at the top floor for a "Spritz" while they serve free olives, nuts and others.  Romantic building illumination in the evening.  Heavily frequented from Americans during my stay, breakfast was OK, but nothing special.  Nice swimmingpool located at the rooftop.  Surrounding area outside the hotel area was partly under construchtion and a little bit messyRead moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
