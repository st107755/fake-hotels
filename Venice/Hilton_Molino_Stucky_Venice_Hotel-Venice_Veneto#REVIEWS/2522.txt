we were lucky enough to find this Hilton property in Venice- it's actually on a island across from the main island of Venice but the hotel has a convenient water shuttle that runs every 20 minutes or so- easy and free!  I found it nice to stay out of the bustle that is Venice- less noise, dirt, people.  The hotel was very elegant, staff very attentive and breakfast was good.  There are places to eat on the same island, not a lot but we had a great dinner at a local restaurant and the dinner in the hotel our first night was ok.  Lot's of marble, beautifully lit at night for wonderful photos- it was a special place and great retreat in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 13, 2015Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your excellent feedback.
