I stayed here for work recently and the hotel is quite a grand building, off the main island. Although has a boat running regularly to take you to the main tourist areas.  I was greeted warmly enough and went to my room.  As soon as I got to my room I could hear people talking from the room above.  This was a constant theme throughout my stay, even late at night after meetings all day hearing people speaking on the telephone or talking etc.  This is a property which also charges high rates for wifi, which isnt even that fast.  If you are going to charge then make sure you have a fast connection.  When you pay so much for the room you dont expect to pay a premium price for WiFi.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 15, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your comments concerning your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
