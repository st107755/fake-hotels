Nice hotel. Look this is Venice food and drink for some reason are extremely expensive but 6euro for water! Cocktails 15-20euro restaurants empty, bars with only a handful of people in them the prices speak for themselves, at nearly 300euro a night you would expect something in your room like water but nothing. The hotel is in a great spot and it does have a water taxi available to take you to st. Marks square, the stay was comfortable and we did enjoy the pool but for the price better hotels are available.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 30, 2018Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
