We also acknowledge and appreciate your constructive criticism as it will help us to improve the quality of the service offered to our Guests. I do regret that you did not find our shuttle service to be efficient and adequate to your needs as the feedback is in general very positive. I would like to take this opportunity to inform also other travelers that,besides our shuttle boat and private water taxis, the ACTV public transport (vaporetto lines 2/4.1/4.2) station is only a few minutes walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 12'. I am also sorry that you have found prices at our Bars and Restaurant to be expensive, though I would like to assure you that they are in line with the other 5-star hotels in Venice. We place great value on Guests’ opinion and we hope to have the opportunity to welcoming you with us again in the near future. Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
