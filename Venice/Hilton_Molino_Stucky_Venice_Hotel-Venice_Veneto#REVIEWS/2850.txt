This is as good as it gets in Venice.  Very few hotels have the amazing views, a rooftop swimming pool which was great to relax by in the evening and the ideal spot to get away from the hustle and bustle.

They also serve wine and beer from 5:00 - 7:00pm. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Won't bother with executive lounge for breakfast, we asked for eggs, which didn't show up, after 45 minutes we had to remind staff.  Best to go to main restaurant which has a wider choice.
