We stayed at the Molino Stucky in the beginning of June. The hotel was beautiful.  For the price ($250/ night)- you couldn't beat this place.  The room was very nice and the service was great. The hotel even brought up complimentary plums and bellinis to thank us for staying.  The pool and rooftop view was amazing. The only downside to the Molino is its location- but it was nice to be able to get away a bit from the mainisland in Venice. The hotel shuttle was nice and very prompt.  If you do stay at the Hilton and decide to take the vaporetto there- just make sure you get off at the right stop. Do not get off at the Sacca Fiscola stop. Get off at the Palanca stop Read moreDate of stay: June 20074 SavesHelpfulShare
