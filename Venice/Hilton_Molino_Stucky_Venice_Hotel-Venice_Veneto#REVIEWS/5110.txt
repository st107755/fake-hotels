Stayed here as a couple with both of our mothers. They stayed in the room next door. No soundproofing we could here everything they said and likewise. When we arrived we went to the bar to get something to eat. We ordered toasted sandwiches which took 45 min to prepare and were cold. Water for tea was very cold asked for really hot water which we got but then cups were taken away and had to ask again for new cups.  Service not good.  Don't order the crispy suckling pig in the restaurant as it was not crispy. Very fatty with very stodgy rice. We did pick but when asked if ok and we said not we just got a shrug. Didn't expect any refund but with the prices charged would have expected a free coffee. Good location and ferry to st marks square runs on time but they do need to sortâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
