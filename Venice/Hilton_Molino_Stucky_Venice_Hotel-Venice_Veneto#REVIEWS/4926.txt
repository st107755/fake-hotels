The room is beautiful and well-equipped; the breakfast buffet is excellent in both quality and quantity; the staff are all friendly; food at the executive lounge is plentiful; view across the canal is relaxing.  Having breakfast at the lawn area in cool morning breeze is lovely; enjoying an evening drink at the outdoor sitting area by the canal is atmospheric.  So what's not to like?  For me, only one thing - the location.  I simply find accessibility by shuttle boat only extremely inconvenient, as the schedule is not frequent and the boat quite full.  For this reason alone, I would not stay in the hotel again if I return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 5, 2012Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location in Giudecca was not entirely to your expectations; It is true that  we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and  still enjoy the vicinity in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a residential area. Beside our shuttle boat, which has frequent and regular rides, ACTV public transport station is only a few minutesâ€™ walk away and connects any part of Venice with departures every 10 minutes. We thank you for being our guest and we hope to have the chance to welcome you soon again. Sincerely. Alessandro Cabella General ManagerRead more
