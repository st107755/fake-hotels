If being in Venice wasn't spectacular enough, this hotel will blow your mind away, not only is it in a historic building, the service is impeccable and the views from the roof top bar and pool are incredible. Our room was small but full of details and a great view of the canal. Also, the Hilton Stucky offers free water shuttles to San Marco, Murano , which you should take full advantage off, also it is conveniently located close to the cruise terminal, if that is part of your journey.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 5, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
