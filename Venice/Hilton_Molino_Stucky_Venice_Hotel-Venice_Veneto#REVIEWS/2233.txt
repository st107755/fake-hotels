The fist thing you notice is the building which is beautiful and very striking as you arrive on water bus or taxi.  We were greeted by well trained staff and our room was lovely.  It's very well maintained, clean and the staff were great throughout.  The only negative point was breakfast. No orange juice, no pork sausages and not much cheese.  We were there three days and it was the same each day. Very strange. I'd also add that the scrambled eggs were bad.  But this is the only minor down point, otherwise it was lovely!

We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice and that you appreciated our team Members and hospitality. On the other hand I was saddened to read that you did not not enjoy your Breakfast experience as we keep receiving lovely feedback from our Guests. May I take this opportunity to inform you that we do offer fresh orange juice at our Molino breakfast restaurant, maybe colleagues were just replenishing the machine with new oranges right when you were looking for it and I am sorry you could not enjoy your breakfast experience completely. I have of course forwarded your comments to our Executive Chef for action and review in order to improve our service. We place great value on your opinion and we hope to welcome you with us again in the near future. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni  General Manager Read more
