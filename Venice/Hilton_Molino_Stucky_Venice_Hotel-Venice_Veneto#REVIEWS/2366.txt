This is an absolutely beautiful hotel. We got a water taxi from the train station.  The driver was very friendly and pointed out sites as we passed them.  When we arrived we were met by a wonderful bellman that took us & our luggage to a secure holding area. We did have to wait in line to checking but we spent the time looking at all the beauty I of the hotel. We were escorted to our regular room that was super clean & we had a really good view of the canal and buildings. On our last night we ate on the patio and watched cruise ships, a ferry boat and several other boats. It was a beautiful night. The Resturant is expensive but the food was great. We will definitely include this hotel on our next trip to Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 18, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
