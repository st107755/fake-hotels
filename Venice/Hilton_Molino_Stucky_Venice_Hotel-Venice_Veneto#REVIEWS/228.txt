We had a corner room it was very large with a king bed, very comfortable.  Large washroom very clean had everything we needed. The breakfast was very good with lots to chose from and fresh coffee. Had a beautiful view from the Skyline roof top of the city of Venice. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the free water taxi t go t St. Mark Square was very useful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 30, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for posting your review on TripAdvisor and for sharing your positive comments on the Hilton Molino Stucky.
