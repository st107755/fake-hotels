We stayed at this Hotel for 1 week. It was clean,the beds were comfortable, the staff were helpful, room service was quick, and there was a lot to chose from at breakfast. I am a gluten free  vegan and the foods were labeled for dietary requirements so it was easy to see what you were getting. The pool area was very nice, go to the back ( behind the pool) less loud music.  There is a courtesy water bus back and forth to St Marks square, get a time table printed.  I have said in my review that pets are allowed as we saw a few dogs in the Hotel. I would recommend this as a good Hotel as you can get away from the often very busy parts of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 7, 2016Dear Madame, Thank you for taking the time  to write this complimentary review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
