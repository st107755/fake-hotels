This Hotel is clearly a high quality place to stay, a 4 -5 star based on the American scale.  Built in a former flour mill, the rooms were large, unique and very comfortable. The restaurant breakfast buffet was among the best I have sampled.  The bath rooms are luxurious.  A free watertaxi comes every 20 minutes to take you to the Venice proper or to pick you up and take you back home.  The rooftop lounge offers impressive city views.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
