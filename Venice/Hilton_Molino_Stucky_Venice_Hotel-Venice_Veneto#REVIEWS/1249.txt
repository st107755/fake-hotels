Across the canal, beautiful remodeled flour mill!! Shuttle service by boat is punctual and frequent.  Very convenient.  Nice amenities in room. Except addition beds. Otherwise would recommend this hotel.Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
