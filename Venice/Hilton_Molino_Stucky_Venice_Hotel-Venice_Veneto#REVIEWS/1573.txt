This is a great hotel with a great location if and only if you like it quiet and remote from all the noise. At the same time, they offer a lot in this hotel: the gym, 3 restaurants, the pool, spa and the executive lounge. In addition you have the skyline where you can enjoy great music with drinks while enjoying the best view of Venice. The staff are very nice. It is a pretty big hotel but if you want to go to San Marco area you will have to take a taxi boat with hotel discount to get there, and I believe the last taxi boat shuttle is closed by 11:00 and you can always take a private taxi boat. The restaurants are just great but my favorite is bacaromi, just lovely and delicious even local goes there to eat.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jan 16, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you very much for the positive review on the Hilton Molino Stucky and its Staff.
