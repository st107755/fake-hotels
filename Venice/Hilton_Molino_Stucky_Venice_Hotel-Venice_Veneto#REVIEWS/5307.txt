We stayed here for 4 nights after a wonderful Oceania cruise in late May. Check-in was pleasant and fast, not sure if we were upgraded, (I am HHonors gold) but our room faced the water and we had executive lounge access and a free FABULOUS breakfast buffet.  The room and bathroom were spotless.  The free shuttle was very convenient and we loved the rooftop pool.  I agree the management should police the lounge chairs at the pool and remove towels and books saving loungers for absent 'owners'--this is really the only criticism.  As for the executive lounge just being a separate part of the lounge, this is much nicer than being a closed-in room.  We loved the quiet, private feeling while being a free 10 minute boat ride from everything.Read moreDate of stay: May 20111 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 14, 2011Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on Trip Advisor.
