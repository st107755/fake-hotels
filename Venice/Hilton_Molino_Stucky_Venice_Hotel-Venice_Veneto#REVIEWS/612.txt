We came upon the hotel because we wanted to get some quiet time. The room we got here, almost made us not to leave the hotel with the city in a glimpse from sunrise to sunset watching the show of all sizes of boats crossing by. We are very happy we got here, as the staff is very friendly and can make everything in this gorgeous restored old mill even better! The spa is a must if you want a complete relaxation package and also a nice treat up the roof terrace is a must!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 29, 2018Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on this website.
