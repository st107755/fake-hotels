I am not a Hilton regular and our stay was part of a holiday we booked. The building is magnificent but I think that we prefer the personal touch and Hilton certainly doesn't give that. We made tea / coffee using the facilities provided in our room on arrival. Housekeeping never managed to clean up the tray nor restock during our 2 day stopover. Breakfasts were poor with cold coffee,rubbery pancakes and even when we arrived 15 minutes after opening time the hot food seemed to have been prepared long before. One of the bedside lamps crackled  when we switched it on and the air conditioning vent was very dirty.  It's a shame that the promise of the building and location is spoilt by the uncaring approach to serviceRead moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to post review on this website.
