Lovely family room inside. View of wall outside. Breakfast we had to queue for. Nothing special . Waiters friendly but overworked. The view from the roof is spectacular. The pool on the roof is icy cold...not pleasant and isn't open very late. The shuttle doesn't run as frequently as the waterbuses which we found easier to use. Bit pricey hotel for what it is.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 27, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a review about us.
