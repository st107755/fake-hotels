It’s a beautiful property but unfortunately, their staff are not customer service oriented. We have LIFETIME DIAMOND VIP status and David at the check-in counter denied us 1-hour later check-out (instead of 12pm, we asked for 1pm). At 12:05pm they called the room to see if we were leaving. At 12:08pm someone knocked at the door to make sure we were leaving. I asked for just a few more minutes. At 12:15pm they were back knocking at the door. I did leave then. I left… and will NEVER come back. I unfortunately had very unpleasant experience with the restaurant staff and the bar staff as well. Their customer service is by far the worst one I encountered at any Hilton property.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2017Dear madame, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on this website. We were sorry to learn that you were disappointed with your recent stay at the hotel.  We always endeavour to offer the highest level of service and it would appear that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations. Your comments will of course be forwarded to the relevant management for their attention. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that check-out time is at noon and unfortunately the hotel is very busy in these days due to the Redentore Festival. For this reason we are not able to extend late check-outs which are offered, as you know, always upon availability. We do hope that despite your disappointment on this occasion, we have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the hotel at some point in the future to show you that we can do better. Best regards,  Ilio Rodoni General Manager Read more
