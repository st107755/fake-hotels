This Hotel is an ideal base for exploring Venice.A five minute boat ride by courtesy boat or public water bus gets you right into the heart of Venice .The Hotel itself is beautiful and the staff very helpful and attentive.The executive lounge while small provides good food and drink all day.Do wander out at night as there are small bars/ restaurants where you can really mix with the locals.This was our first visit to Venice and the Hilton Molino Stucky made it a memorable occasionRead moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 18, 2012Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for posting your positive review on TripAdvisor.
