Good location. On the opposite side from the main square which we liked as it was nice and quiet. There is a hotel shuttle that takes you across the water. It is â‚¬8 per person for your entire stay. The rooftop pool is incredible - the view makes it! I would say the hotel is expensive for food and drink. I know it is a 5* hotel but I still felt it was a little on the high side for what you got. Stagg were very friendly and all in all I would say it's a nice place to stay!Read moreReview collected in partnership with Hilton Hotels & ResortsDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jul 15, 2019Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind comments on this website.
