What was right.... warm welcome, prompt check-in (12 at night), clean everywhere, very nice spa facilities and rooftop pool. The letdowns....... the first room had a gap at the top of one of the walls to an adjoining room - could hear every word said at a whisper....privacy?! (We found out when we were woken early the following morning by children whispering and giggling) Booked a double deluxe, got a twin deluxe.....we've got children, but not with us! Breakfast generally v good - Sun was dire by any standards.  No tables avail, when table made up was then occupied by other guests before we could sit down. Ended up eating a greasy spoon style leftovers breakfast (1 hour before sitting ends) 100 yards from breafast bar (possibly a blessing!) in the open air(the nice bit)!!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
