Visited here for girlfriends birthday and was so thoroughly dissapointed in this hotel. The rooms are so drab and not cleaned properly. We found an old croissant in our mini bar fridge (which didn't work) that absolutely stunk. I paid to move to another room at a higher price (premium Molino room) save your money, it's far smaller and extremely dark. Not like on photos. Breakfast is very underwhelming and very basic and on top of all this, they charge you pay 13 euro a day for WiFi. Absolute rubbish and was expected alot lot more from a Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 21, 2019Dear Sir, Thank you for having taken the time to share with us your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
