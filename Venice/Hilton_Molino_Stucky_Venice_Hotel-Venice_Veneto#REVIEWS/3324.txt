This is all you would expect from a 5 * hotel. The staff are extremely friendly & efficient, the hotel is well maintained. It's a little difficult to navigate your way around the hotel but apart from that I have no criticism. There is a complementary shuttle boat to the main island & you will get a timetable that is helpful. The downside is that it does add time to your journey as the hotel is on an island where there isn't that much to see. But that in itself, that's part of the charm of Venice. I was here on business, but it's not a hotel that I would choose if I was on a recreational visit.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 20, 2014Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to let us have your positive impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice. We are sorry if the location on Giudecca did not entirely meet your expectations; it is true that we are not located right in the city centre, but we are only a few minutes away from the main Venice attractions and visitors can still enjoy the vicinity and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere in a typical Venetian residential area. Thank you for being our guest and we hope we can welcome you soon again here in Venice.  Sincerely,  Ilio Rodoni General ManagerRead more
