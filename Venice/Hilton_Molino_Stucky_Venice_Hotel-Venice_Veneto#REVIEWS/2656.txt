The hotel staff was very efficient and polite. We were worried that being away from Venice central would be inconvenient but it was not as the frequent Hilton shuttles and close by vaparetto stops were very convenient. An added plus was being away from the continuos crowds and hustle and bustle of central Venice. The cost of rooms is much more reasonable than Venice, proper. The only negative is that the executive lounge pales in comparison to other Hiltons (Vienna, Prague, Rome airport).
