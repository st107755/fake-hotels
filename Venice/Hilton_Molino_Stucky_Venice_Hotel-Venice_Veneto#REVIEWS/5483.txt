I visited Venice in February 2011 for Valentines day with my husband. Venice is incredible and very romantic. We both loved it and 3 nights was enough for us as we were able to do/see everything we wanted.  As for the Hilton Molino Stucky, the location is great because it's away from the centre of Venice although the regular shuttle boat was great and we were pleased to be so well connected. The service is brilliant and was always on time.  We stayed in a Deluxe suite which was very small compared to other rooms we have stayed in. The temperature was also very hot and uncomfortable in the room and we had trouble sleeping. This is my main criticism of the hotel.   We were not too impressed with the breakfast, I was expecting more variety as I have seen a lot better in non-Hiltonâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare
