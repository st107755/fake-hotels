My wife and I stayed here from Friday 3/10 to Sunday 3/12.  Its a grand, beautiful hotel with amazing service.  The food here from the breakfast to the executive lounge is top notch.  We are diamond members and were treated as such, with an upgrade to what is probably one of their top rooms (234, huge and overlooking Venice).  The shuttle runs frequently and promptly.  Drinks at the rooftop bar are quite expensive but well made.  We took the public boat to the airport on Sunday and really enjoyed the extended ride, the hour and 40 minutes goes by quick and we saved 108 Euros in the process versus a private taxi.  Just make sure to buy that ticket in advance from a machine (we didnt know so they let us pay cash on the boat).Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 17, 2017Dear Sir, Thank you for your positive comment about your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky.
