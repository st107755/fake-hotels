I loved this hotel. It is beautiful, quiet and has wonderful amenities. The rooftop pool is gorgeous with a panoramic view of Venice. I could have stayed in the hotel all day! The executive lounge was great, very pleasant staff and good food. I did not want to leave!! And the wi-fi worked in my room.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
