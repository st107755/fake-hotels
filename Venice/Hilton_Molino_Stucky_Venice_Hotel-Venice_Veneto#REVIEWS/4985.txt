Good location but let down by poor service and shoddy rooms. On check-in we had a broken cot for my baby, broken shower, broken sink and dirty bathroom.  really ruined our first afternoon as spent my time chasing them to be told they were busy. Was really not impressed that i couldn't put my baby down for a sleep or bath her.  no apology either.  skyline bar was ok but food in the lobby area was inedible.Read moreHelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Aug 6, 2012Dear Sir Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post a review of the Molino Stucky Hilton on tripadvisor..
