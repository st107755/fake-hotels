Hilton Molino is far from the center of Venice.  It is located on the Island that is not very pretty but from the island you have a very beautiful view.  Be prepare to trek back and fourth from the mainland if you decide to stay here.  We had already spend a few days at another hotel so we didn't really have to see anymore but if this is your first time and you're not on a budget then stay closer to to St. Marks sq.   The room we were given was a huge suite but it did not have any charm to it.  It felt more like a clean up motel then a Hilton.  Staffs that we came across were super friendly and very helpful. This is an ok hotel but definately not the hotel that will make your vacation.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 30, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
