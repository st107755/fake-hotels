Stayed here for a long weekend. Itâ€™s very large and very busy. Attention to detail is missing. The dirty sheets from the previous occupants were still lying in a heap in the room. The walls were mouldy. The Murano glass light fitting had a thick layer of dust covering it. Breakfast is good. The rooftop swimming pool is great and the views of Venice are stunning. I had expected more from a Hilton.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Oct 10, 2019Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.
