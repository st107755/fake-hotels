Very clean, welcoming hotel. Lobby and dining facilities furnished to a high standard. Rooms were slightly old fashioned but very comfortable. No free WiFi in any area of hotel which was disappointing given today's travel profile. Good shuttle to centre of city but given choice again I would stay more central. Breakfast very good but very expensive. Breakfast staff not very attentive. Stayed on 7th floor and music from rooftop bar was audible with windows closed. Recommend not drinking in this bar as prices are 4x dearer than in local bars. Nice hotel but no sense of Venice in it.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
