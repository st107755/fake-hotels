Our family vacation in Italy last city visited was Venice and the experience was definitely enhanced by our stay at the Hilton Molino Stucky. The location is perfect, with the shuttle service providing easy access to the main islands. The roof top swimming pool has a spectular view of the city, especially at sunset. The breakfast buffet is outstanding and overall the customer guest services staff is outstanding.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
