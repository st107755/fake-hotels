The staff is extremely helpful  Annimi (I hope I spelled that correctly) was the best- offering us an upgrade which very much enhanced our stay.  The kids loved the nutella machine and the beautiful breakfast buffet with many choices.  Taking the free Hilton shuttle worked out fine.  The direct Venice views from our room were breathtaking.  I took a picture that looks like a painting.  We loved waking up to that view and opening the windows to enjoy the lagoon before us.  This is the only place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Mar 19, 2015Dear Guest,  thank you very much for your excellent review on TripAdvisor.
