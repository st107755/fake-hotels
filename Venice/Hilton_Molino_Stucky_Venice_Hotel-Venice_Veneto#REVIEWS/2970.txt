Given this is such a huge hotel we were impressed by the boutique atmosphere. The riverboat service was much better then we had thought and well worth the pain given how incredible the pool and views are.   One thing however, the minibar is the most expensive we have experienced anywhere in the World. Â£8 for a bottle of water is simply criminal and I'm shocked Hilton would take advantage of people in this way (there is basically no other option). This shouldn't turn you off however, just remember to plan ahead!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Jun 16, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us and for posting your comment on TripAdvisor.
