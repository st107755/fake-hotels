We stayed here as part of an Adventures by Disney Tour and the hotel rooms were great, beautifully decorated and large by European standards.

We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay here, especially the rooms, breakfast, public areas and most importantly our service.   We are sorry that you had to wait for the shuttle and pay for a watertaxi. Please note that to reach our hotel there is also the ACTV public transportation, which is very reliable (2 lines, one service every few minutes to reach San Marco and many other locations) and cheap (Euro 7.50 per person per trip, or Euro 20 for a 24-hours ticket).   Regarding the pool, we assure you that we always keep it tidy (if it is wet, our attendant immediately swipes away the water) and we constantly monitor the quality of the water and it has been always safe to swim in; we are sorry if on that particular occasion it did not meet your expectations.  We hope you will decide to stay with us again in the future and we look forward to welcoming you back  Best regards  Riccardo Ranzato Guest Relations ManagerRead more
