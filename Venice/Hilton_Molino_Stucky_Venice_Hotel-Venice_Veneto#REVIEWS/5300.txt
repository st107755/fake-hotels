Scenic ride to the hotel from the train station via water taxi through the canals.  The Hilton Molino Stucky is a huge hotel, very modern, and beautiful.  Location is good, just across the water from the main attractions with an water shuttle running all hours to two stops, Zattere and St. Mark's Square.  We were staying on hotel points and were upgraded to a huge beautiful suite.  The executive lounge on the main floor had nice food, wine, beer, etc available throughout the day and night.  People were helpful and friendly and the spa was exceptional.  A great place to stay and a great area to visit and do all the "touristy" things.  I'll definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Dec 28, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting your positive comments on TripAdvisor.
