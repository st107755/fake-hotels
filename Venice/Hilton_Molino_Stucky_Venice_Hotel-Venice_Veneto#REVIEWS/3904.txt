We stayed in the Hilton Molino Stucky in September 2013.  Our room was nice and large.  The view was obstructed but the windows let in a lot of light.  The complementary breakfast and evening wine and snacks  for Honors members was very nice.  My only complaint was the sewage smell in our room as well as our friends room.  We noticed it throughout the stay so I suppose it is because of the age of the building.  Don't miss the roof top pool and the views.  It is amazing!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
