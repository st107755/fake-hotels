I was lucky enough to visit Venice and this hotel on business but also to be here for my 30th Birthday.  Being on the rooftop champagne bar at midnight on my birthday with my wife overlooking the city laughing and smiling will be a memory that will stay with me forever.  The staff at the hotel were amazing they were very accommodating ensuring we made our river transfers and got around the city safely.  If I ever go back to Venice or for people reading this review the Stucky Molino is breathtaking be sure to stay there!!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Feb 16, 2016Dear Sir, Thank you for your excellent review of the Hilton Molino Stucky.
