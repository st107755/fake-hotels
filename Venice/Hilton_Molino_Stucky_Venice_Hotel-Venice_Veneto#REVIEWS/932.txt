Recently stayed here for a work event and I have to say the hotel was lovely. Quality size rooms with luxury bathrooms.   Every aspect of this hotel was spot on from the lovely welcoming staff to the cleanliness and the little gift waiting for you in your rooms.   A little disappointed to see the swimming pool closed but understandable in the winter months. Although not on the main Venice Island the hotel has a great taxi boat service running all day.   Plenty of restaurants and bars a 5 min walk from the hotel if your looking for something a little different. I would also recommend the roof top bar during sunset hours for a stunning view over Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Nov 30, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having taken the time to share with us your positive comments concerning your stay at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
