This renovation of it's former use (factory) into a hotel makes it a unique place.  Also being situated across the river, with a lovely view of Venice gives it an air of exclusivity.  The outdoor pool is closed in winter, but I'm sure it's a lovely feature in the summer.   The spa area is nicely designed and we tried the self-treating mud session. Our skin felt so smooth!  There is a free shuttle service to the city, and it's also good to walk around the little island that the hotel is part of.  The rooms we found were a little small but had everything we needed. Quite vintage feeling.  Wasn't a fan of the food selection.  But this was given as a surprise anniversary treatment and was thoroughly enjoyed.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you very much for posting a positive review about us.
