Not only is this hotel difficult to get to if you don't know the transit system, but if you want selection in restaurants this is not for you. They charged my credit card for the incidentals, which has been difficult to get back because they will ignore you once you are no longer a guest. To make matters worse, we left an expensive electronic device in the room. We have contacted the hotel several times to just be straight up ignored. Still no contact from these people, please enjoy your stay in Venice and stay away from this place!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from MolinoStuckyHilton, General Manager at Hilton Molino Stucky Venice HotelResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Guest, First of all we would like to thank you for taking the time to let us have your impressions about your visit at the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice.
