We stayed at the Metropole for 3 nights July 18th - 21st July.  First impressions of the hotel is that it has a very Gothic feel to it which was refreshing.  The staff were all friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble for them.  The food was lovely and the breakfast catered for your every wish.  I would definately stay here again!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Aug 28, 2012Dear "Charliee80", I wish to personally thank you for your comment and for taking time to write it.
