Charming helpful people at reception Great old world atmosphere, refreshing to find a hotel which still uses conventional keys to room doors which have to be handed in every time we go out. The rooms are smaller but well appointed and excellently maintained. Each floor has a unique collection of items in the corridors, for instance one of the floor has an extensive collection of crucifixes This is a good hotel of high standardRead moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
