Arriving by boat - the hotel allows a very real Venetian experience and is central for all sightseeing.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, the staff warm and friendly and breakfast beautifully laid out. Could not fault it from arrival to departure. Very good value for money.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
