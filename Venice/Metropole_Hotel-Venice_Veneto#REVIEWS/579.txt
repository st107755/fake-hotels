This hotel is 3 bridges from St. Mark's Square. There is a lot of hustle and bustle outside, but the hotel is decorated in "old school" decor. The staff is very helpful, and most everyone speaks English. The rooms were very nice although the fridge in our mini bar didnt work, eveen after asking to have it checked. Thew buffet breakfast was outstanding with lots of fresh baked good, fruits, meats and cheeses. The chocolate muffins were to die for. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
