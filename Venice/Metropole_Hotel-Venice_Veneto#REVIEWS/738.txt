You enter into a very plush and rich environment.  We had a great time staying here.  The room quality was good with a nice comfortable bathroom.  The lobby, lounge all very nicely done up. Breakfast was nice and tasty.  Pricey but that's the way  hotels are in Venice.  Above all, the location was excellent, right on the main canal, on Riva Degli Shiavoni.  St. Marco square was hardly a few minutes walk and the water bus stand was right outside.  Excellent hotel, excellent view, excellent location, couldn't ask for more.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
