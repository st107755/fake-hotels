In a superb position!they have their own pontoon so you can be dropped at the door which is very exciting.the hotel is full of antiques of all sorts, one corridor just has crucifixes in display cabinets.its quite dark, but loads of candles everywhere.the staff are so helpful and charming.the room wasn't large for the price we paid and it didn't have a view unless you hung out of the window.....comfortable and spotless with toiletries that were replaced in the evening ! Breakfast had been quoted at 27€ when we booked but had gone up to 35€  And it is in the back of the hotel...so we walked along to the Londra Palace hotel with amazing views ..and prosecco included.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
