Room was pretty and bed was very comfortable, but our view was of a brick wall and some scaffolding from construction next door.  When employee escorted us to room, and I asked about the view, he responded that's what we paid for.  Actually thought we had reserved a small veranda, but  his posture basically ended my desire to converse with him further.  Never knew the truth, but either way, we might have upgraded if handled more personably and professionally.  Actually weren't in the room much anyway.
