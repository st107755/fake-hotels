Of all the hotels we stayed during our trip to Italy, we liked the Metropole the best.  It was so quiet and I loved the furnishings.  Inside it was almost castle-like with the draperies and furniture.   The breakfast buffet was very good too.  Lots and lots of choices.  Eggs, breads, meats, yogurt, cereals.  All fresh and good. Lots of places to sit in solitude and read, indoors and outdoors (large patio).   Housekeeping was thorough and efficient.   I would love to go back to Venice.  If I ever do, I'll certainly stay again at the Metropole.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
