We stayed here for four nights pre cruise.  It is very expensive but we thought worth the price.  Location,location,location.  It was right on the Grand Canal, near water buses that got you everywhere and walking distance from many sights.  The lobby and rooms are decorated in very heavy European style but the bathrooms were re done and modern!  A lovely full breakfast was included in the price and staff was very nice.  I liked the evenings..many restaurants to choose from and lots of people around!  We did think the air conditioner could have been better.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
