My wife and I had this hotel booked as a pre-night before a cruise. Your water taxi pulls you right up to it so no bridge/luggage drama was had. Got there at 10 am, check-in was 2 pm. They held our bags but room was ready at 12:00pm. Awesome. Our room, 209, was one of the few that had a balcony.  It overlooked the canal to the left, and the lagoon to the right. We though it was wonderful. The location, right on the lagoon was perfect as it was only a 10 minute walk to St. Marks, and was easy to find. When roaming the streets at night, I know as long as I was heading South I was okay. My favorite thing about this hotel though was the staff. They were outstanding to deal with. If I get back there, I won't hesitate to stay there.Read moreDate of stay: October 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
