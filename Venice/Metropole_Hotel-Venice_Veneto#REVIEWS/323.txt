Beautiful hotel.  Fantastic staff!  Great location.  Our room was on the 4th floor with a private covered terrace.  Beautiful!  Has ac that we could control!  Room service is very quick.  Maid service twice a day.  Love this place!  Cushions for the terrace chairs.  Breakfast was included with hot and cold selections.  Room was very quiet and bed comfy.  Bath had a awesome tub and a separate steam shower.  Staff hooked us up with private tour guides.  Fridge/mini bar in the room.  No coffee maker.  Loads of closet space and drawer space.
