Situated on a side canal, this richly decorated hotel is in the perfect location for all the main sights.  We stayed in room 207 which was lovely and had a small balcony overlooking the side canal.  The general decor is certainly unusual and probably not to everyoneâ€™s taste but is full of Venetian history. The breakfast was beautifully presented and the staff throughout the hotel could not have been more courteous or helpful. A perfect stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
