My wife and I stayed for 1 night in the Metropole at the end of a Tauck tour through the Adriatic.   The hotel's location is very good, just a few minutes walk from St. Mark's Square.  The hotel is older and the rooms are not modern.  Lots of antiques.   Biggest problem was the bath tub/shower.   Difficult to get in and out.   But housekeeping quickly supplied us with a rubber bath mat when we requested one.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  But we would have preferred a more modern room with a bit more room and a walk in shower.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
