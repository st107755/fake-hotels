This hotel is classic Venitian. Antiques in hallways, rich red wall paper, and this is finished fantastically. The staff very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfast was in a beautiful area where you could eat inside or outside. Breakfast items very varied and excellent. Location couldn't be better particularly during carnival!. Five minute walk to San Marco Square.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
