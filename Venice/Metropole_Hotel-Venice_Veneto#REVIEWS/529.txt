This is a lovely hotel.  My husband and I treated ourselves to a weekend in Venice for our anniversary and were really looked after here.  All the staff are professional ,friendly and helpful.  The hotel itself is really interesting and quirky - they have cabinets choc-a-bloc with interesting artefacts like antique corkscrews and fans.  Upmarket, but without the corporate feel.  Really well located on the Riva Schiavoni, a few minutes from the Doge's Palace and St Mark's square.  The hotel overlooks the lagoon.  There is a Michelin restaurant there - we did not try it as wanted to get out for a more local feel, but it looked very cosy.  Would recommend highly.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
