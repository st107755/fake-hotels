Clean, exemplary service, fantastic food both in the bar and resteraunt-michelin starred, superb caring staff, perfect location, its own water taxi entrance, quirky decor and very child friendly, I think that sums this hotel up.  We are going back to this hotel 4 times in the next 12 months, thats how good it is and Venice as well.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
