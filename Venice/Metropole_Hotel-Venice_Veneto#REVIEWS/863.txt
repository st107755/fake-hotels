The hotel is very well-located, three bridges from St Mark's Square.  Rooms are comfortable and quiet.  The buffette breakfast can be taken in their lovely garden and transport to the airport by water taxi is convenient, if very expensive at 110 euros.  The staff are helpful but our room was not ready till 2 p.m.Read moreReview collected in partnership with OctopusTravelDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
