From the moment we arrived by water taxi at the hotels private jetty, we had the most wonderful romantic short break in Venice.  The hotel is wonderfully quirky and comfortable.  The room was beautiful, clean and spacious.  The reception staff were attentive and helpful.  The hotel is perfectly situation a short stroll from St Marks Square and the many restaurants and cafes that Venice have to offer.  The hotel is quite expensive, especially the main restaurant.  A nightcap in the bar is a must.  If you are looking for a wonderful romantic hotel it is well worth money, and you won't be disappointed you chose to stay at the Metropole.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
