We stayed at the Metropole for four days and it was a great experience. The hotel can be reached directly by boat taxi from the airport and is centrally located. The service was outstanding and everyone in the hotel very friendly. We can only recommend the Metropole.Read moreDate of stay: August 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
