I visited this hotel in Jan 2016 for honeymoon.  Took the boat from Venice airport directly to the hotel ( there is 2 entrance for the hotel one is in the front by walking & the other one by the boat behind the hotel) Very nice hotel & romantic. An experience u will never forget. Breakfast is very nice in a romantic restaurant. Location is perfect just few minutes walking from San Marco Square. The view from our room was very nice you can see the corridors & buildings of Venice. Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
