Stayed in the Metropole Mid April for a romantic weekend. This hotel could not have been better suited. Wonderful atmosphere and decor, friendly and helpful staff and located just a few hundred yards from St Marks Square. Would recommend to anyone and would love to stay again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
