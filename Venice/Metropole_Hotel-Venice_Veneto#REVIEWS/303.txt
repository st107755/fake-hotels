We stayed on our honeymoon and had a room overlooking the lagoon. It was festival time with boats coming in onto the piers and people have meals aboard whilst settling down to see the fireworks. The hotel looked after us very well and the breakfast was excellent. It is very close to everything including St Marks Square. WE stayed for five days so we had plenty of time to see Venice. We booked through Kirker Holidays who know which hotels provide an excellent choiceRead moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
