What a wonderful place to stay, right in the heart of the city. Private  taxi to the glass businesses on Murano, close to the water ferries. A small hotel with about 75, rooms, in a building that is over 300, yrs. old.  Great food, staff, history displays on each floor from, Christ figures, to purses, and cork screws, etc. Excellent preparation of food, staff willing to go the extra mile.
