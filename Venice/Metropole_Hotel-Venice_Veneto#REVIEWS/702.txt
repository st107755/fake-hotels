Perfect location in Venice directly on the Grand Canal. Five minutes from St Mark's and the Duomo - couldn't be better. Great "escape" from the noise and crowds of Venice, with a refreshing garden behind the hotel. Rooms are generous and lavishly decorated. The front desk staff were welcoming and friendly, and helpful answering any questions. They arranged for our trip to a Murano gallery, which was a highpoint of our trip. The water taxi from the gallery picked us up at the "taxi stand" at the hotel's side door - quite a treat!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
