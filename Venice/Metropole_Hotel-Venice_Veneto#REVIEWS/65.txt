The Metropole is well located and the staff helpful but it is expensive for what is provided.  The decor is different and does have a museum quality collection of curiosa on display but this makes for a rather gloomy ambience.  The garden is very pleasant and is ideal for a bit of quiet.  Our room had a lagoon view and was comfortable and light, certainly did the job if on the small side.  The view was impressive except for the ongoing work on the lagoon wharfs and canal entrance.  This work had also closed the hotel water entrance, which meant a walk over 2 bridges for a taxi.  The hotel porter helped in this but it would have been nice to know in advance.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
