Third visit to this hotel. Still the place to stay in this wonderful city. The garden is a unique facility which is a real attraction as it is a cool, peaceful place to relax after the intensity of the city. Very well run with some exceptionally helpful staff. Room 231 is large, comfortable with a separate seating area. Windows onto the Calle at the side but quiet. Nothing too much trouble for this 5 star establishment. Fully recommended.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
