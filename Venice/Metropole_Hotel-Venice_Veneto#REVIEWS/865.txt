My husband and 2 kids  8 & 10 years old just stayed at this hotel. It was a 2 min walk to St. Mark's square. It was right on the water. The hotel arranged a  private water taxi for us to the airport. It really was a great location. It was 1 min from the vaparetto stop but we needed a private water taxi because we had too much luggage and couldn't go over the bridge with it. Rooms were very clean & spacious. Bathrooms were very clean & nice too. They had  a free water taxi to murano too. They included the breakfast buffet and it was very good. we were sad to leave but would definitely stay there again. It was a great experience!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
