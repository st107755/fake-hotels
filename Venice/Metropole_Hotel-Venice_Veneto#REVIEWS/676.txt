Don't let the price of this hotel scare you away! This was my favorite hotel I have ever stayed at! We stayed in a Junior suite with Lagoon view. We had a 2 year old with us and when we arrived their was a childs bed added in the room with a little gift for her waiting that included a scavenger hunt in their hotel. Their collection of antiques are beautiful, the breakfast was a feast! The beds were so comfortable and inviting after a long day of exploring! This hotel deserves all of its 5 stars!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 20121 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 16, 2013Dear "Luv2travel858", let me hearilty thank you for your wonderful comment!
