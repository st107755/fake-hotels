Glad I have choice this hotel which is very well located! Water taxi/bus to Aiport & Cruise terminal within 1-2 min walk - so convenient! Got upgraded to grand canel view! Very nicely appointed classic deco. room though a bit small. Good breakfast in a beautiful garden setting! Highly Recommended if you want convenient & a pretty nice hotel!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
