Amazing location, premium add on services if you need them, fantastic restaurant with great food and wine cellar, a bar that rivals any in Venice for product and service, quaint and unique decor, rooms very comfortable and the garden is green, secluded and outstanding for a glass of wine of an evening. First class.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
