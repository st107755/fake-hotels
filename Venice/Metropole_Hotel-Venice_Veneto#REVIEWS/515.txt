Went to Venice to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we were well looked after by the staff and were sent a complimentary bottle of champagne. The staff were all courteous and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The room was delightful and the whole stay was memorable we will certainly be going back.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
