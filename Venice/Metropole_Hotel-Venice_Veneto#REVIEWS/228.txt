Was here from Valentines day for two nights.  Stayed in a junior suite Room 331  I'm a sucker for modern stuff, this being an old style hotel. I wasn't really raising my hopes but have to admit I was pleasantly impressed. It was quite luxurious, Service was exceptional Check in was a matter of minutes and the breakfast was spot on. Rooms were cleaned and beddings turned twice a day which was above average and the ambience is just right.  Head concierge was on point to our demands. (There was work going on in an adjoining room and sorted this out immediately when my Ms needed to sleep mid morning) and one other minor issue but all done in the twinkle of an eye.  All in all a great stay and if I were ever to return to Venice, I would not look to stay anywhere else.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
