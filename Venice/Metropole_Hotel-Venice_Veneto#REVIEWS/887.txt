Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of February 2011 . We had been here in September 2008 but wanted to return for the famous Carnival. This is a superbly run hotel with pleasant, friendly staff who go out of their way to help. Great location for St Marks square and some really good restaurants ( Osteria Oliva Nera is the best of them ). In summer, breakfast in the garden at the rear is a unique experience for Venice. This city is one we keep revisiting and we will not be staying anywhere other than the Metropole.Read moreDate of stay: February 2011HelpfulShare
