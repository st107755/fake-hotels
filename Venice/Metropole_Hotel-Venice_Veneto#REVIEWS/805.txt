We have never before been to Venice and took a chance booking into the Hotel Metropole after reading Internet reviews. We have loved our three days here and are sad to be leaving tomorrow. The restaurant has a Michelin star, we discovered, and is very well situated. The staff are helpful and speak reasonable English. Breakfasts are excellent. St. Mark's square is just around the corner. We have enjoyed watching the madding crowd outside from the cool of the bar/casual restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from Valentina T, Direttore generale at Metropole HotelResponded Jul 23, 2012Dear “Caroline P”,  Thank you so much for your nice comment, it is so important for us to receive your suggestions… they are essential to improve our service as well as being a great satisfaction for all the passion we put everyday in our job. Thank you also for your mention about our Met Restaurant, which has a history of Michelin two -star ratings. Now the Met is proposing an original concept that is totally new to Venice: the Tra’Contemporary menu that combines both traditional and modern dishes.  I will definitely share your comment with my staff.  We do hope to welcome you again in the future, Venice is a really magic city, worthy of another visit! Thank you again for your kindness.  Warm regards.  Gloria Beggiato General Manager & Chief Administrator Hotel MetropoleRead more
