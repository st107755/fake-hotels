We stayed at the Metropole a long weekend! The location is so central it allows you to do and see so much. A complimentary luxury water taxi to    Murano was such a pleasant surprise for all of us.  The breakfast is more like a feast, so much to choose from, all fresh and presented in so beautifully. The rooms are spacious and perfectly decorated, you are surrounded by art so it feels like you're in an art gallery or museum....this was the highlight for me.   At the Metropole you can also find the Met, a one star Michelin restaurant not to miss. Just check with concierge for bookings.  We all loved our stay at the Metropole Venice and look forward to visiting again.  Thank you! AJRead moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
