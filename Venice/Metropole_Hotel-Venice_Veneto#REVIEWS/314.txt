Our first trip to Italy and we arrived at the Metropole June 1, 2016. We were very pleased with the beautiful accommodations but especially with the warmth and kindness of the entire staff. We were always greeted with smiles and felt like they all truly loved their job. This staff goes above and beyond to make you feel at comfortable.I honestly don't think I have experienced better service anywhere else. EVERYTHING was excellent! The location is great, not a far walk to all of the attractions. The rooms are quiet and the beds are comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
