My husband and I spent 7 or 8 nights at the Metropole over Christmas 2008.  We were absolutely delighted with our room, and the accomodation in the hotel. We found the staff consistently helpful when asked. There restaurant recommendations (from someplace very fancy for Christmas eve and Christmas day dinner....to a very simply neighborhood place to get some fresh fish) were right on the mark.  I have one complaint, and one complaint only... and that was during a period when Venice was expected much rain and flooding, when we needed an umbrella we had to purchase one from the hotel -- that was surprising to us from a hotel of this caliber.

Unfortunately during the days you were at the Metropole, we had finished the umbrellas, and were waiting for the new delivery which arrived quite late due to transportation problems. We normally provide our guests with umbrellas during rainy days.  At the same time we are working at our project to have Internet Wi Fi in all the rooms, which will be possible probably by next summer.  Thank you again for taking time to write to us. We really hope to welcome you again very soon.  Aurelio Bon Asst. ManagerRead more
