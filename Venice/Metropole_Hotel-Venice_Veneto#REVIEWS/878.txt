This hotel was a wonderful surprise. So full of character, so classy and gorgeous. We spent almost as much time exploring the hotel as we did exploring Venice! The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the location is ideal and the hotel itself was a delight.Read moreDate of stay: November 2010HelpfulShare
