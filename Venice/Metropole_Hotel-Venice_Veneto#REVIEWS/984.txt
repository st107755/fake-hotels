I stayed at Metropole Hotel for 4 days (19-22/5/06), and those were the most enjoyable 4 days I spent in any hotel I have ever visited. It is indeed a great Hotel in any aspect. Metropole has great rooms, both in size & luxury (for Venice that’s a rare combination). The provided services are of top level. The personnel always willing to help you and satisfy all of your needs.   Last but not least the restaurant “MET” one of the greatest restaurants I have ever been.  If anyone needs to get out of conventional Hotels, Metropole Hotel is definitely the place to stay when in Venice. Read moreDate of stay: May 2006HelpfulShare
