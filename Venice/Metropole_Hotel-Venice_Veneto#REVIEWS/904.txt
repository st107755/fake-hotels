This hotel is beautifully decorated and very stylish. Very expensive, but kind of worth it.  Private Taxi from the airport was 100 euros.  The room was large and airy, many antique items around the whole hotel.  I would advise that only one night is needed in venice and just quickly blast around the whole town.  When a coke and a beer can cost 15 euros you don't want to spend too ong in venice.  If you want to treat yourself though the metropole is one of the best horels in venice. It also has a 2 star michelin restaurantRead moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
