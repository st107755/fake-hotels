Located along the Riva degli Schiavoni, the hotel had superb views of the lagoon! It was also very convenient because the Piazza San Marco and the San Zaccaria vaporetto stop were just a few minutes walk away. The service was one of the best we've experienced on our trip and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We expected the breakfasts in Venice hotels to be generally mediocre but we were delighted at the Metropole's breakfast spread. It was one of the best hotels of our Italy trip and I highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2003HelpfulShare
