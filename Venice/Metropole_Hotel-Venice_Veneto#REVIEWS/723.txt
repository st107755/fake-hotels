Me and my husband we stayed in Metropole for 2 days in double room with lagoon view.Very nice interior, looks like museum.Excellent service.We had a free excursion to Murano island which we really enjoyed.Everything is great there apart the price.800euro for 2 days without any meal included and we paid like 70 euro each morning for a breakfast.We have stayed also in other hotels of Venice which were costing much much less but were cute enough.So if you u have a lot to spend, then it's fine, otherwise I wouldn't pay so much for it :))))Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
