Don't think we could have chosen a better hotel. Staff were excellent. Chaps in the bar were very friendly and chatty making us both feel at home. The room was attractive; though the 'view' over the canel proved to be more of a view of the wall on the opposite side. Probably chosing a view over the garden or lagood would have been a better option. But this did not detract from our enjoyment. The food was ecellent, though in the restaurant the choice was limited. We would certainly return to this hotelRead moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
