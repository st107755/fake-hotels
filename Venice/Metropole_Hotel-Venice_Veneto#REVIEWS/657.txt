The hotel is right on the lagoon and is a beautiful building with many eclectic collections of things in display cases.  Elegantly appointed rooms.  However, in early October the air conditioning was turned off for the season.  The only way to sleep was to open the windows, which would be fine except for the late night strollers along the lagoon and the early morning activity on the lagoon.  The staff helpful and welcoming and the breakfast was excellent.  Wi-fi worked fine, but the internet connection was intermittent and the hotel was unable to fix it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
