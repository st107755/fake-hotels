Arriving by water taxi at the hotel's private jetty was the perfect start to our stay in Venice. The hotel is elegantly decorated and full of interesting art and antiques. The bar and lounge areas are stylish and comfortable and the service very good. Add in the location - which is on the lagoon about 100 yards from St Mark's Square and you have the ideal place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
