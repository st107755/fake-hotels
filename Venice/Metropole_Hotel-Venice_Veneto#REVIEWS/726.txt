While the room itself looked a bit older, overall this was a great hotel.  The bathroom was more modern than the bedroom itself. The staff was helpful and the feel was authentic.  So fun to pull up via water taxi right to the hotel.  Great location as well!  Breakfast was nice with the outdoor option too. You don't see that often. Even though it was a 1 night, we enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Jun 14, 2013Dear "GMSReview", such a pity you stay with us just for one night!
