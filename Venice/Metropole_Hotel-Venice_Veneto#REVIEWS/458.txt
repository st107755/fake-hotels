We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights! We were extremely impressed by the service and by the hotel! The room was decorated very special and there is a extraordinary atmosphere in all the place!  The garden is very quiet and comfortable place which it is hardly to find in Venice. There is a private dock where you can have a private water taxi to every place. I Suggest that rather than using the public Vapporetto-it is overcrowded and not so pleasent to travel with!Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
