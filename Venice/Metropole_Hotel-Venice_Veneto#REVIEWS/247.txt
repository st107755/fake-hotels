The service was excellent. Everyone couldn't do enough for my wife and I who were on a short retirement celebratory holiday. Our room was huge  and extremely comfortable with an excellent bathroom. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Its on the  Grand Canal and only a 2 minute walk from St Marks Square and 30 paces from Vivaldis Church where my wife and saw a Vivaldi concert on the Saturday night. We really liked the whole relaxed atmosphere with the antique furniture and stunning decor throughout. The only slight disappointment we had was that we couldn't find facilities to make a hot drink in our room. We don't like using room service every time we want a drink.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
