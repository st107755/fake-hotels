stayed at the metropole in march 08... the location is superb easy walking distance st marks square rialto bridge etc .. the hotel itself is superb the decoration and attention to detail is excellent.. the staff are very polite helpfull and courteous.. you must try the tasting menu at the met restaurant although a little expensieve at Â£100 per person believe me it is well worth it the food and wine you get is top class, perfect for that special occasion..Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare
