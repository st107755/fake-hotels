My wife and I spent 4 nights in this wonderful hotel.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Bruno at the bar and Alvisa at the desk were exceptional.  The lobby and common area has great character, with lots of lovely antiques.  The breakfast room staff was terrific, very courteous and fun and responsive.  Our room was nicely decorated and comfortable.  We received excellent advice on sight seeing and reservations.  My wife contracted bronchitus, and immediately a doctor was summoned by Alvisa at the front desk, who accompanied the doctor to our room and acted as interpreter. You had the feeling every employee was ready to do anything necessary to make one happy.   We did not eat in the restaurant, which I understand is well regarded, but enjoyed the extensive breakfast buffetâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
