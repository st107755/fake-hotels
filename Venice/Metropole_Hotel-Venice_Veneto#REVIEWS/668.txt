Nice hotel. Stayed there for 1 night prior to a cruise. The room was very spacious and a great location.. The hotel is not inexpensive but be aware of their breakfast. Their breakfast is very expensive and not included. The 1 thing that we found annoying is that we had a 1pm check out and we got back to the hotel at 10 minutes after 1 and we were met by the manger who escorted us to our rooms where we found that they had packed our bags and they were in the hall outside our room. I have never had that happen anywhere else. I would not go back there again because of that.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Oct 4, 2013Dear “Nina K”,  I wish to thank you for the comment you wrote about your stay at our Metropole. I am terribly upset in reading what happened during your stay and to your luggage. I heartily wish to assure you that such a procedure should never ever happen at the Metropole.  That is why I will personally contact you to have your help to check the matter with more details, and I will certainly take drastic countermeasures and try to understand how such an inconvenience can have occurred.   Meanwhile please accept my most sincere apologies for this awfully puzzling inconvenience that occurred during your stay. Let me hope to have the chance to show you in the future how this is not at all our standard, and how sorry I am that we unintentionally gave you a wrong idea about our service.  Thank you again for taking the time to write your observations. Kindest regards.  Gloria Beggiato Metropole Hotel VeniceRead more
