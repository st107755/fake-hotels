This hotel was decorated sumptuously with dark coloured fabric both for walls and curtains in our room and in public ones. If in doubt this hotel hung dark material....everywhere! The food and staff and location were all excellent. The water taxi stop is a 7 minute walk from the airport . Then you have an exciting 25 minute ride to the door of the hotel for 110 euro. Unfortunately we were not allocated the junior suite with lagoon view that we had booked, as it was too small to fit the single bed for our daughter. The one we were allocated had 2 small windows looking out over a brick wall and roof tiles. Low ceiling, obscured windows and dark decor meant lights needed at all times and it was still "atmospheric" There are several display cases in the lobby housing collectionsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
