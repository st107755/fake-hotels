This is a beautiful hotel and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is a short walk from the Piazza San Marco. The oriental bar is lovely as is the garden bar. The buffet breakfast is superb. We stayed here for 2 nights and would have been happy to stay longer. Our rooms was lovely. We had a lovely deluxe double room with lagoon view and the view did not disappoint. This hotel has a great location on the canal and we took the water taxi from the airport which dropped us right at the hotel. A continental breakfast was provided each morning which we enjoyed in the beautiful garden area.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Aug 28, 2012Dear "Still_Just_Relaxin", thank you so much for taking the time to write your very nice comment,  which I am really very proud of.
