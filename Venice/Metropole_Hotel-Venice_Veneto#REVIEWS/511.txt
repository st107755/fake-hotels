I didn't stay at the hotel but went to the bar 3 times in 3 days.Bruno, Angelo and staff at the bar are proud fabulous mixologists. This is most likely the very best bar I have ever visited; not cheap but worth it. I had an excellent martini with vodka kept in the freezer and vermouth actually sprayed over the drink. Be sure to visit them.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
