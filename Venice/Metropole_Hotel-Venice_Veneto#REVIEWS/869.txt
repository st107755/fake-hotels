We stayed here for one night whilst on the way to Croatia.  We arrived by water taxi, which I must say is the way to arrive! We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff, who would not you carry a bag anywhere. We had 3 rooms booked, 2 of which were on the top floor, each with balconies and views to die for. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and is certainly a period style hotel, great showers and bathroom. After an afternoon of exploring we returned to complementary champagne, which we drank on the balcony and watched the world go by, perfect. We chose not to eat in the hotel, not for any reason, we just felt like exploring a little more. Breakfast was excellent and served in a beautiful patio environment. I hope to return here again very soon!Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
