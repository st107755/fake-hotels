Beautiful hotel! Tranquility when you step into it at the end of the day. Friendliest staff. My son had his 10th birthday while we stayed there. The Hotel baked him a beautiful birthday cake on our request. It felt like all the staff knew it was his birthday as he got birthday wishes from most of them all day long.  The family room was beautiful, richly decorated and very spacious with a beautiful view onto a side canel and partial view of the lagoon.  Excelent breakfast - hot and cold. This hotel will be our 1st choice stop from now on when we visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 25, 2013Dear "Werner D", thank you so much for you kind words!
