This hotel represents outstanding value in one of the most expensive cities in the world, the room the view and the service were all first class. After eating out several times in average restaurants that were expensive we decided to eat at the MET restaurant within the hotel, it was one of the best meals we have ever had and with the wine included was cheap by Michelin star standards. We could not fault the hotel and if we return to Venice we will look no further than the Metropole.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
