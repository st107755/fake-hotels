This hotel may have been great once, but cannot now justify its 5 star rating, other than by the prices its charges. For almost 400 euros, I had a smelly, internal room without a view and without breakfast. The breakfast at 35 euros is a lot to pay for a cup of coffee and a croissant. There is a Michelin star restaurant in a narrow chilly room with 7 tables. At 165 euros a head, this is to be avoided. On departure the receipt was flicked vaguely in my direction, indicative of the poor quality of service in this place.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare
