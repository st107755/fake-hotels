From the moment we arrived by water taxi it felt like walking into a dark cocoon of tranquility.  Very efficient concierge and both de luxe rooms had enormous TVs and were spotlessly clean.  Lovely clean towels and clean Egyptian cotton pillowcases every day of our 4 night stay.  Beds turned down each evening.  Excellent breakfast from 7 am but never saw more than 10 people eating it - the whole hotel seemed very quiet.  We didn't try dining in the restaurant, but it looked lovely if a little expensive!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
