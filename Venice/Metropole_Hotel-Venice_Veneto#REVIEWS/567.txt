We picked this hotel from the internet and one other recommendation. It was absolutely one of the best we have stayed in in Europe over the last 40 years. Very convenient. Pleasant courtyard for breakfast. Exquisite furnishings and antiques from family who owned it. Front desk and all concierge were 24/7, all spoke Engliish and answered any questions. When we left at 3:30 am and our vaporetto picked us up, the concierge had prepared hot  coffee and muffins for us himself. The rates were reasonable. When we had a problem with a shop not mailing our purchase we simply called the concierge we knew and he took care of it. they had information concerning all concerts, etc., going on and procured the tickets for us.  The rooms were elegant with marble everywhere, large closets, etc.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
