I stayed in this hotel during a business trip. The building and the rooms are beautiful and stylish. The service is excellent. The weather was very hot and moist and the air conditioning system had some problems one of the nights so it was almost impossible to sleep. Cold breakfast is included in the price, but if you want some cooked eggs they will charge you for that additionally. Unfortunately we could not visit the restaurant as it was busy and we had not booked in advance. WiFi was available only in the lounge and with some interruptions.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
