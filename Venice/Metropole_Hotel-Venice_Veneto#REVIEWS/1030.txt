We stayed at this lovely hotel in October, 2004. When we arrived early after our cruise the staff looked after our luggage until the 2pm check in. We had only paid for a side or back room but when we returned we were taken to a wonderful front/corner room with three windows overlooking the lagoon. What a view. The room was beautifully furnished in the Venetian style with a marble bathroom. The breakfast downstairs each morning was delicious and filled us up for a day of walking. We found the staff to be very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. We would return again to this delightful hotel with the added bonus of its great position.
