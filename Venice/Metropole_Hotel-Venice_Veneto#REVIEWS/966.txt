Arriving at the hotel at their private water entrance by water taxi is a wonderful way to arrive in Venice. The entire experience is great. Breakfast is average though but I certainly would not call it bad. Great artefact collection displayed in the common area, lovely lounge, a Michelin starred restaurant and classic rooms that complete the Venetian experience. The location is perfect! Close to San Marco and yet away from the crowds. Avoid the hotel's 'free' trip to Murano though. You are always better off on your own. No such thing as a free lunch.
