We stayed here for a couple of nights in the middle of a three month tour of Italy and some of Europe.  After the disappointments of a few much more expensive hotels this was a joy.  The room was excellent with a lovely view over one of the canals down into the Grand canal and the staff were superb - friendly and helpful.  We particularly enjoyed relaxing in the garden area and late at night in the bar.  The food is the restaurant worthy of its reputation and the service delivered by friendly staff.  The location is superb.  All in all we would thoroughly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2008HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Assistant Manager at Metropole HotelResponded Mar 7, 2009A nice little balcony with view overlooking the Rio della Pietà and the lagoon for lovers!
