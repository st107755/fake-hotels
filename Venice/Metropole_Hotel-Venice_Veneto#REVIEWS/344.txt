We have just returned from a 3 night break rooms 305 and 309.  Our stay was most enjoyable everything was first class breakfast, rooms and a good location. We took the offer of the complimentary boat trip to Murano. The boat trip was lovely but I would like to warn people there is more to Murano than the glass work shop and show room where you are taken. The sales talk was very pressurized as we were followed everywhere. We left from the alley way from the giftshop and had an enjoyable browse around the island and returned to venice on the vaporettaRead moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
