The hotel is perfectly situated just past Piazza San Marco although it is a very busy tourist route. The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with all the facilities you would expect - Minibar, TV, Hairdrier, safe and plenty of storage space. It had a large comfortable bed, which was turned down for us later that evening when we went out for dinner. Breakfast in the morning was a continental buffet style and very over priced for what was available - anything extra was supplied in the menu but you should expect to pay â‚¬5 for a bowl of cornflakes. Overall we had a great trip to Venice and staying in this hotel only added to the alure of the place although breakfast prices were a laugh.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, altro at Metropole HotelResponded Jul 30, 2012Dear "Paul C.", thank you so much for your helpful comment and for sharing your good opinion with the community of Tripadvisor. I am extremely glad you enjoyed your stay in Venice and you appreciated the room at the Metropole. We put great attention and care everyday as our quality, our service and even the smallest detail are abslutely fundamental for us to accomplish every Guest's wish. I am sorry you found the prices for the breakfast extras too much expensive, they are all fresh and genuine ingredients as well as home-made products we prepare every morning. Anyway I will take into consideration your comment and share it with my staff.  Thank you again for your precious help. I hope to welcome you again to the Metropole in the future.  Kindest regards.
