Great location near the town and rail station. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.   Value for money breakfasts and packed lunches. The establishment is  best described as old world and quirky. Lovely leather settees in the lounge areas and a small games room. Would have been great to have stayed when they have live music playing.   Most enjoyable four days.  The rooms were comfortable and clean.  Plenty of hot water for showers etc. Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
