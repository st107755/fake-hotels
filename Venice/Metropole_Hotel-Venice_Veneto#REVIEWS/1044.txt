Location was excellent. I stayed with my family in two different rooms in this hotel. One was a very beautiful room with renovated bathroom, but the other room was a old and not nice room with tiny unrenovated bathroom which was dissapoining. Also, it would been nice to have inter-connecting rooms since we were family. If you are going to stay this hotel, make sure you will have a nice room.Read moreHelpfulShare
