We stayed here this year at the carnivale. Staff were very friendly, service was good, breakfast was average! Our room was overlooking a courtyard which was fine and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was sheer bliss! (No bath though!bit disappointed!) We were at the end of a corridor and it was very quiet. The atmosphere in the bar was lovely with lighted candles all day and incense burning. Would definately go back even though they messed up our bill - overcharging us by 300 euros!! Read moreDate of stay: February 2006HelpfulShare
