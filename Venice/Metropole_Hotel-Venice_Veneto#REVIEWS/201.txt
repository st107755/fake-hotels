Arriving by water taxi was an experience, the interior is dark, candles everywhere, helpful staff, old style glamour. Twin rooms are cosy, colour themed with a great modern bathroom. A lovely garden, garden room and a breakfast you could long all morning over.  A great selection and the croissants melt in your mouth.  Will definitely be saving up the pennies to stay again.  A great location and highly enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
