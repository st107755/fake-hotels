Nice hotel, but slightly outdated. Great location in Venice, nice staff, good housekeeping. Attracts peculiar people. The hotel rooms were decorated nicely, it felt like we were in a different time!! Comfortable beds, and fabulous bathroom. It is good, but not the best in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Jan 11, 2013Dear "TravellerLaura11",  I wish to thank you for sharing your comment with the Tripadvisor community.

I hope to have you as guest some other time in the future. Thank you again.  Gloria Beggiato Metropole Hotel  VeniceRead more
