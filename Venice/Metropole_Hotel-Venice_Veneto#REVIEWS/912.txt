We couldn't resist popping into the Metropole for a Bellini on our wedding anniversary as we stayed here for our honeymoon five years ago. It lived up to our memories. Staff in the intimate, candlelit bar (which has an almost Morroccan style decor) were really welcoming even though we weren't guests and we felt very decadent lounging on the cushions and sipping our cocktails to the chill out tunes. A fabulously luxurious hotel with some very special memories. Thanks Metropole!Read moreDate of stay: May 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
