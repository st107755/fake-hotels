I have traveled a lot but this was an amazing experience., probably my best. We stayed in room 303 --- the feeling, the furniture, the decoration was that of an 18th century Palazzo. The bathroom however was 21st century quality and accomodation. The Personnel is really 5 star --- friendly, helpfull, anticipating, professional.  Breakfast second to none; served in the garden with a wide choice of everything you can want including caviar. A bar with a wide choice and a professional and friendly barman in summary if you have a special occasion to celebrate --- NO BETTER PLACE TO GORead moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
