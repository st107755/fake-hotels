This hotel was nothing but luxury. From the decoration to the very polite and helpful staff. It is in such a fantastic location within easy walking distance of St. Marks and the bridge of sighs. The restaurant was wonderful for our anniversary meal and the room was brilliant. Breakfast was great everything you could possible want was there. I cannot recommend The Metropole enough.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
