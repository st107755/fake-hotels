As soon as you enter the elevator you know you are in old Europe. Very small but charming. The room was elegant. Had a corner so we looked across at the train station and main canal and the other side was the smaller canals that run through the city. Water taxi always available. Morano glass factory was very interesting. Food in Venice is as good as it is throughout Italy. People are genuine the evening is romantic the 🍷 wine is excellent. Spend at least 2 weeks. Travel by train visiting other cities. Stresa close to Switzerland on the Lake was rustic and elegant. All in all you can tell I enjoyed 🇮🇹 Italy. Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
