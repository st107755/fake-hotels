I stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to a cruise out of Venice.  The room was lovely with all amenities I could have wanted.  Coffee service in the morning was elegant.  Yet, the decor of the hotel, while intriguing with collections of fans and other unusual items, was a bit weird.  Overall I really loved my room and the wonderful location of the hotel.  I felt the staff was prissy and condescending which I did not like.  Would I return?  Maybe, but maybe not.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
