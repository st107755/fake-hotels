It was a perfect stay, in a very central point of venice. The staff was very kind from heart, and very helpful. The bar was expensive but very charming. The breakfast buffet was very good. Nearby the markus place, also a vaporetto station in front of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
