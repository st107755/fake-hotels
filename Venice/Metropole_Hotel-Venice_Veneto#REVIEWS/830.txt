Don't expect a run of the mill hotel, this place has a certain style,that you begin to appreciate once your eyes become accustomed to the gloom!Fabrics and room scents abound, Quirky collections mixed with some beautiful antiques and chandeliers. The staff were very helpful, nothing appeared too much trouble.Breakfast had everything we required and great coffee. The dinner menu looked great but was expensive. Nit picking,the pillows were too hard and the shower/wet room could have been more powerful. Not suitable for children or if you want somewhere modern and minimalist. Brilliant location with it's own landing stage. We certainly will returnRead moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 23, 2012Dear “BracknellTwitto”,  Thank you for your experience at our Metropole Hotel, we are glad you spent a good time with us: the Metropole is a historical house with great collections of antiques and original pieces coming from all around the world and bought in renowned galleries!
