What a truly amazing hotel and experience. The staff were all so friendly and helpful really professional but keen to ensure our stay was of the highest quality.  The concierge Juliarno was unbelievable he helped us with visits to the islands and opera tickets.  Our room was clean and very comfortable.  Breakfast was not included and was very expensive at £30 per person and not that much for the money.  However the location was great the service fantastic we didn’t eat in the Michelin star  restaurant  but I am sure it was fabulous.  Highly recommend this hotel as the staff were lovely.
