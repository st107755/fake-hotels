stayed 4 nights in this most beautiful hotel. Everything about it is elegant and luxurious.  Bathroom, had the whitest and fluffiest towels replaced every day if required. The toiletries  were lovely and plentiful.  The staff were very helpful especially the lady on reception who was most informative. The location of the Metropole was perfect with fantastic views of the lagoon. I was very sad to leave and would definitely return to this hotel which has charm,character and most  Of all a heart.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
