We have stayed here 3 or 4 times and consider it "our" hotel in Venice.  It is always in Winter  as we much prefer Venice when it is quiet and free of heaving pavements.The Venetians are pleased for you to be there. The service is "old school "  Italian   ie. excellent and professional. Breakfasts excellent.  Rooms vary from traditional venetian  views of courtyard or lagoon  to modern   on the top floor with a perfect private terrace overlooking the rooftops and the lagoon  .  It is just far enough away from the Piazza San Marco  along the Schavioni to make it comfortable.   Lots of the good restaurants  behind.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Jun 11, 2012Dear Mr "ozziesyorkshire",  Let us thank you for your stay at our hotel, we are honoured you enjoyed your experience with us!
