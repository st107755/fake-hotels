The location of the Metropole is great for visiting all of venice. Right by a Vaperretto stop, and walking distance to the traditional tourist post San Marco square and also Arsenale and the more residential areas. The decor is traditional and interesting and really makes you feel like you're staying in a majestic Venetian house. The buffet breakfast was also amazing. The food was delicious and the options for different foods huge, and is a good refuel before hours of walking. The service was good, if a little unfriendly but very professional. The rooms were a good size and had lovely art work inside. I would highly recommended staying here if you visit venice :)Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
