We stayed here on a bed and breakfast basis and I’m so pleased we did this. This five star hotel has a one star Michelin restaurant which you have to book in advance. We never managed to book in advance so I can’t comment on the quality of the food in the restaurant although I can comment on the room and the breakfast. The room was very sumptuously furnished and comfortable. The room service was very good and I cannot think of more positive things to say about the service. The breakfast choice was wide and they even had soya milk! Staying on a bed and breakfast basis allowed us to eat out which turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  If you are planning to visit and stay in Venice I would encourage you to seriously consider this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
