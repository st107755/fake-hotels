We have just returned from Venice and stayed at the Metropole for 4 days and three nights (10/8 - 10/12). One of the reasons for selecting this hotel were the comments here in trip advisor. I would certainly recommend staying here. We paid 330 euro a night ( a tad on the expensive side) but the room (see photos)and service were all excellent. Breakfast was included and there was a good variety for the breakfast buffet. Room included a balcony deck. Staff personnel always willing and helpful. Very good location.
