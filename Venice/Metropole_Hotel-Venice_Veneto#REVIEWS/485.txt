My second stay at this beautiful hotel. All the charm of a bygone era with all the modern conveniences.  The quirky collections scattered around the hotel make the experience all the more interesting.  Situated within easy walking distance to San Marco the hotel is right on the main canal and close to the vaporetto stop. All the staff, especially at reception and at breakfast, are friendly, courteous and always helpful and my dealings with the booking staff were faultless. The breakfast room is delightful. The bar overlooks the street and is a fun place to meet for tea in the afternoon or drinks in the evening after a hard day roaming the streets and canals of this beautiful city. Travelling solo this is a wonderful place to stay and be well looked after.  Even in the rain thereâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
