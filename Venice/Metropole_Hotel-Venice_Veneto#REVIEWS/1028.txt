We only paid €150 a night for a double room in this fanatastic hotel.  The hotel was full of character and had loads of nooks and cranny's, fantastic continental breakfast, very friendly waiting staff.   Our room didn't have a view - looked out onto a marque in the garden! It was huge , very well furnished and comfortable -  massive bed , sheer luxury really.  We had coffees in the sitting room the first night - quite pricy at €10 for two (but probably average in Venice).  The location of the hotel is a big selling point as well - very handy for everywhere and especially for the Alligua(?) motor bus that takes you to and from the airport.  I would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreHelpfulShare
