Stayed here in may 2016 for our 6th year anniversary and it was amazing !!!  The hotel is just perfect,great location stunning decor really helpful friendly staff you name it they can’t do enough for you.  The breakfast court yard is out of this world proper Italian and really romantic.  The actually breakfast was superb with everything nice and fresh which means you keep going back for more.  The hotel bar is stunning, the waiters will whisk you up all kinds of cocktails once you tell them what you like.  They even have a free water taxi over to the murano glass factory where you can watch master glass blowers doing there thing which was amazing !!!   Can’t fault this place it’s a real gem of Venice so would highly recommend and 100% stay again  Thanks for the memories Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
