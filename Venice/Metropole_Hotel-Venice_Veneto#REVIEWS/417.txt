The hotel is nice and the service was excellent. It has an unfortunate position next to the water taxis (noisy, even at night) and the throngs of people around San Marco.  We stayed in a redone attic room that they called a Junior Water View Suite -- I think they oversold it quite a bit.  The ceiling was low, the carpet dated and the layout not really useful as a "suite". No real shower, just a stand in the bathtub, which for the money and the size of the bathroom, they could have and should have had both.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
