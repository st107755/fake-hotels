This experience was even better than expected.  Beautiful, antique decor yet nowhere close to dowdy, stuffy or frumpy. Linens were luxurious, cool and crisp. Bathrooms appointed with all modern conveniences. The breakfast buffet the best during my 2 week trip to France/italy. Great location, especially for first time visitors.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
