Only spent 1 night at the Metropole, but enjoyed every minute of it. The staff are courteous and professional and are willing to help you at any time. We stayed in a classic double room which had all the comforts of a 5 star hotel. Breakfast consisted of a continental style buffet set in a room looking out to the garden. The hotel is two bridges away from St marks or a two minute walk along the front overlooking the canal. The oriental bar is a great place to unwind after a day walking around Venice. Overall the Metropole is a quirky, but  typically old venetian hotel, which I would gladly stay in if returning to VeniceRead moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
