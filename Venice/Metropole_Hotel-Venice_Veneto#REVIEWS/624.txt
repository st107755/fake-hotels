Fabolous hotel with a very luxury feeling and art deco decor. Location is best possible and the hotel feels more private and  exclusive than other 5 star hotels in venice. The hotel features a great 2 star guide michelin restaurant that is a must. Beautiful lobby and entrance both to canal and street. Beautiful garden/courtyard.
