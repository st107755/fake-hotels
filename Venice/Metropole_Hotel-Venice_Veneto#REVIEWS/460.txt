this hotel gets an excellent mark for many reasons. the location is perfect, the decor is beautiful, the breakfast great- included in the room price and worth it, the best we had in europe- the staff very friendly and helpful, the room sizes were , by venice standards, huge. having stayed in venice multiple times some rooms you must crawl over your luggage to get to the bed, I've seen this in new york as well, but not here, lots of room to move around and with 3 people per room, very nice.although i am sure there are other similar hotels in venice, i can't imagine one with larger rooms. it will be hard for me to visit venice again and not stay there. small negative, the ac was not very cold, nice cold , not cold by us standards, but it was over 100 degrees each day we were thereâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
