We first visited here in 1977, and at about 2-3 year intervals since.    All the positive things written by previous reviewers remain true - good location, fine public rooms.    Yet we have perceived a gradual decline in attentiveness, with initial reception being pleasant rather than warm, the bar service professional rather than personal.   As everywhere else in Venice, the prices seem to rise each year out of proportion to the rest of Italy, and we are beginning to feel that there are other many other choices of merit in the same price bracket.     Do beware when booking a room with balcony - they range from real balcony to a simple step outside an attic room - the latter being poor value.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
