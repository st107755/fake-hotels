Stayed here over the weekend and was really unimpressed with the service. The hotel is in a great situation and the room ok but was shocked by the attitude of the reception staff who had obviously had a long season and were very unwelcoming.

A captive market means that a 4 star hotel such as the Metropole does not need to bother with customer service.we felt we were imposing in their busy lives. Having said that, the staff in the breakfast restaurant were pleasant and politeRead moreDate of stay: October 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
