We spent three days of our Golden Wedding trip at The Metropole . Situated facing the Lagoon and just a few minutes from St. Mark's Square it  is full of beautiful antiques .  It is privately owned and the owners have put on display an eclectic collection of items from card cases to corkscrews adding to the feeling of being guests in a private house rather than a hotel .The staff were very warm and friendly and our room was beautifully furnished and quiet overlooking the small internal garden . We had lunch on our first day and just breakfast on the other days but the food and service were  very good . It was with some reluctance that we moved on to our next destination .Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
