We adored our time in Venice and at the Metropole! The staff is so attentive and our suite spacious and lovely. Giuliano and his team at the concierge desk worked hard to help us organise a perfect few days in Venice. They recommended a fantastic tour guide, reserved immaculate boats for us to hire and booked us into perfect restaurants throughout our visit. What a fantastic service! Our taxi driver to the airport was questionable, but all else was absolutely 5 star! Highly recommend!  Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
