Recommended by a friend and never having been to Venice before we found the hotel centrally located and next to a vaporetto stop so easy to get to. The docor was really lovely and the staff could not have been more helpful. The room was a good size and clean with a view over the lagoon, we were 1st floor which made it a bit noisy, ask for a higher floor. Room service were really focused on the details. We would certainly recommend this hotel and should we return to Venice will stay here again.  Not cheap but Venice isn't.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
