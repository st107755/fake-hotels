Even though slightly over our planned budget, my partner and I decided to splash out on our unique trip to Venice and chose this hotel above all others.  We surely will never regret our choice.  Heated floors in our marble bathroom, incense and bath salts, fantastic and spacious double bedroom, complemented by friendly staff and wonderful breakfast.  We didnt have a room with a view as our room was over the garden, but it was still very nice. It was also quiet, relaxing and a real treat.  The location is superb, as it is just a small nice walk to Piazza San Marco, and the Vaporetto stop (San Zaccaria) is very close and frequent.  I already recommended this wonderful hotel to friends and family, and I'll do so to you readers as well.  Enjoy! Read moreDate of stay: March 2005HelpfulShare
