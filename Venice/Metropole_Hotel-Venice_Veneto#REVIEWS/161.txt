Beautiful hotel, the service was second to none, the rooms were amazing and clean, very atmospheric. Staff were very friendly and nothing was any trouble, very efficient service always with a smile and your name was always remembered.  Can recommend the cocktails in the oriental bar, some are very original and served expertly.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
