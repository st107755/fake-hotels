Lovely hotel, great location, and lovely staff, especially Igor!  It's a bit dated, but not expensive, so don't expect a chic shiny Russian gem, but it is perfectly comfortable, charmingly shabby and the bar do great cocktails.  The garden is lovely and breakfast yummy.  A great hotel for a short break in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
