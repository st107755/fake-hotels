A haven from the Venice bustle. Stayed 4 nights in this ideally located hotel. Breakfast was delicious and the staff most obliging and courteous. Beautiful fabrics and furniture and a wealth of antiques to make you feel enveloped. A problem with my bed was sorted within half a day an all was well. Thanks for a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
