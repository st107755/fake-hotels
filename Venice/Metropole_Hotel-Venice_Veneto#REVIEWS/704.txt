This is a great hotel for couples. It is like staying in a beautiful antique shop. The location is perfection, the staff were amazing and there is a beautiful bar/lounge that is quiet and serves delicious drinks.   You can take a water taxi but the ferry is so incredibly close that you shouldn't feel the need to spend significantly more for the water taxi. I would recommend the taxi though if you are travelling to the airport (rather than the train station). It's a LONG ferry ride to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
