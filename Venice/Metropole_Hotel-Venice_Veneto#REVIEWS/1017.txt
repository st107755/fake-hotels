Great location, minutes from the main ferry stops and from St Mark's Square. Great rooms (choose one with a lake view). Excellent restaurant which must be tried. Above all, an extremely friendly and helpful staff. Yes, I arrived one day earlier than resesrvation but they were able to give me into a great room. A great find in Venice.
