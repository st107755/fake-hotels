We were greeted with a much needed warm welcome at the Hotel Metropole after a crowded water bus ride from the train station.  I suggest taking a water taxi. Our rooms were gorgeous with nice patios overlooking Venice.  Everything was within a short walking distance from the Hotel and the ambiance from every angle was amazing.   There was a nice varietly for breakfast, and everything was fresh.  A great way to begin a day of sightseeing.  In the evening we retired to the beautiful candlelit patio in the back of the hotel.  Very relaxing.   It is such a quaint hotel and the rooms were very quiet.   Cheers to a great staff. Read moreDate of stay: June 2005HelpfulShare
