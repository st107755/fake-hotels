This place was great. The hotel is has a lot old school charm and beauty. It's in a fantastic location. Close to San Marco, city center, and the water bus. Our room was good comfy beds, nice bath, cute view over a canal out the window. The breakfast was nice, lots of options and good coffee. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They went out of there way to make our stay really pleasant. We felt taken care of throughout our visit. One suggestion I would make is the hotel has a dock and I thought it would be fun to arrive by boat to the hotel and that was absolutely brilliant. The hotel is a little spendy, but it's beautiful, the staff is fantastic and it's absolutely worth it. Thanks guys for a really wonderful stay!!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
