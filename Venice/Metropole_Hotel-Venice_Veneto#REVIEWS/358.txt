My wife and I flew into to Venice, and took a water taxi directly to the Metropole. The staff were very helpful from check in to check out. The Hotel is a gem and you couldn't ask for a better location. Our two night stay was the beginning of our European Holiday and were very impressed with the service. The cost was on par with other 5 star hotels in Venice but the service at the Metropole sets them apart. We will definitely be back to visit the MetropoleRead moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
