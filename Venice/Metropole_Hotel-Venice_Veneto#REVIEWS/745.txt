This is a delightful hotel just along the waterfront from St Marks, filled with an eclectic selection of fans, bookends, corkscrews and other collectibles. The service was impeccable - none of the smug superiority of some top end hotels, just courteous, considerate and perfectly professional. Nothing was too much trouble, nobody minded that we lingered over breakfast or wanted drinks from the bar late into the night. We had an excellent off season deal booked directly from the hotel website that included breakfast, which is normally not included. Do treat yourself, it really is worth it!Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 2, 2013Dear "Harry Y", I am so glad to read your nice comment, thank you so much for your kindness. One of the main points of the Metropole - for which I constantly apply myself - is to have a friendly staff. I think it is fundamental to meet kind and helpful people in a hotel, that is what makes the difference in a holiday, and this is something I always look for when I travel.  So thank you for underlining this aspect, and of course, my team will be informed of your compliments! Let's hope to meet one day again in Venice.  Regards.  Gloria Beggiato Hotel Metropole VeniceRead more
