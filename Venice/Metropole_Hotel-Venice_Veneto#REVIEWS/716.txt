Superb rooms, very spacious and comfortable. The complete hotel is made out of a house but beautifully designed. Very close to St. Mark sq. Also has a Michelin 4 star restaurant. The food is awesome. Was just not too impressed with the breakfast spread. The concierge service is very helpful and immediate. The best hotel I have stayed in so far. #wishboxindiaRead moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
