We stayed at the Metropole for 3 nights B&B , we caught the water bus and took the blue line €15 each , took over an hour n half to get to hotel, but on are return we took the water taxi arranged by the hotel which cost €120 but worth it as only 25 minutes!  The hotel was like a museum over 400 years old , it was beautiful couldn't fault it , the staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was amazing 👌🏼 The hotel was a 5 minute walk to St Marks square,  1 minute walk to the Bridge of Sigh   The only fault of the hotel was the bed & pillows they were very hard 🙁 probably good for some people but not for me !
