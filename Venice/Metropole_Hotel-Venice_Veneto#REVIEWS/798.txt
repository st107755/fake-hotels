just read the other reviews and have to say we didn't get the welcome pack or map or recommendations for restaurants. I had booked direct with the hotel for a deluxe double lagoon view with a shower not bath. on arrival we were shown to our room eventually and it was lovely with it's own terrace with a lagoon view. in the bathroom however was a bath with a shower attachment.

I am glad you enjoyed several aspects of our service and I am really sorry if you did not find immediately the room according to your request. Upgrading your room is the minimum we could do to compensate. Our Restaurant as you experienced has now a new concept, the Tra'Contemporary cuisine, which is completely diferent form the path we have been following for the last years. It is highly appreciated from our Guests and from Venetians. After a long tradition of gastronomic awards, we wanted to start a new challenge, and, although we are perfectly aware that taste is absolutely individual, we are the first at all to propose this new cuisine, in Venice and in the world.  Our products are genuine and strictly Italian - that is we mainly wanted to promote, italian food! - and the possibility to try a dish either in the traditional or in the contemporary version can be funny for those who try it for the first time. Your comment anyway will be certainly useful to improve our restaurant service. Thank you again for your precious help, I will share it with my staff. Kind regards.
