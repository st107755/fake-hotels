Location, hospitality, luxury, value. We stayed three nights and enjoyed every minute. The rooms are well appointed. The fresh strawberries were a nice welcoming touch. The location is excellent. The breakfast buffet should not be missed. The front desk staff was extremely helpful in recommending great restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
