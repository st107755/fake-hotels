An amazing place to stay, quirky and luxurious. We arrived by water taxi at the private landing stage, the hotel was cool and welcoming, we loved it. The location is brilliant, it was a five minute walk to St. Mark's Square and the Bridge of Sighs is on the way. All of the Staff were friendly and helpful.  We were greeted by name during our stay. Our room was quite large, beautifully furnished, plus the bathroom was a good size both were tastefully decorated. It was an experience to just wander around the Hotel with its collections gathered over the years (we had a collection of fans on our floor).Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
