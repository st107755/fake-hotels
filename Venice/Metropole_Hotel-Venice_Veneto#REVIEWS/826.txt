My husband and I spent the first week-end of our vacation in this hotel--and it was fabulous.  The location was wonderful, the service was friendly, the breakfast was great--but the best part was just the history of the place.  The building has such a rich history, and the little collections all over--from fans to corkscrews and calling card cases--were unique and wonderful.  We were amazed that anyone could find something to complain about at this hotel.  Yes--the bathroom was somewhat small--but it was modern, marble and even had heated floors!  The hallways were lined with a varied collection of antique headboards--which just added to the unique character of this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
