No or very limited AC.  We had to change rooms upon arrival.  No Air Conditioning in the room. After 3 visits from the technicians to fix the equipment we werre offered a new room. This one's AC was working slightly to refresh, but no cold.  It's July.....  Our kids room had limited AC as well.   The equipment in the 3 rooms  is old, with no or damaged working thermostat.  Also, 35 Euro per person for breakfast, which is "not included" in a 600 Euro room.  Good location in front of the water. Not good value for money.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
