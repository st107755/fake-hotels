Excellent hotel, staff  very friendly but not overly so.  Remembered our names which is nice.  Had beautiful large room overlooking Lagoon - well worth it.  Big fluffy towels.   Only downside was no complimentary tea/coffee tray in the room and no complimentary bottled water.  I think everyone expects this these days - no matter what country.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
