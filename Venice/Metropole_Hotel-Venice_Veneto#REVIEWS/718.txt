If i probably didn't find out how much my boyfriend paid for a night at Metropole, I would have given it a 5. Anyway, I specifically liked the service in the lounge and restaurant. The staff are simply welcoming and delightful! The room we had was nice too. However, i found the pressure of the water in the shower not too strong.   Don't forget to wander around the different floors. Check the different collections. It is really fascinating. Oh! And take some shots in the staircase. Lighting is perfect! :)  If you don't mind the price, i would highly recommend this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
