This hotel was the first stop for my husband and I on our honeymoon and they made it a great beginning.  The staff takes your bags to and from your room, the breakfast in the  morning is nice and the decorations are unique.  Our room was good with a nice window you can open to the canal.  The hotel was quiet and the bar is nice.  The drinks are pricey but you do get a nice tray of food that comes with it that includes cheese, salami, chips, bread sticks and olives.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
