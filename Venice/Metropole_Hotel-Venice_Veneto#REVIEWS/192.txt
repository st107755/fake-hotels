I came here in February for my 21st birthday, it was a surprise from my girlfriend and what a surprise! Such friendly staff that will help you with anything, unbiased recommendations, the best things to visit if you have a short stay. The bar was fantastic, such a wide variety of cocktails on offer, I did try to get through quite a few of them but the moscow mule definitely was my drink and Bruno the barman the drinks impeccably!  The uniquenessof this hotel lies within the corridors of each floor, but I won't spoil the surprise ;D If I came back to venice I would definitely stay here!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
