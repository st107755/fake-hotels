This hotel is different and unique. It may not be everyone's style, but I really liked it. It has a bohemian flair. The sitting area downstairs is comfortable and a nice spill over area for jet lagged travelers. The bar is trendy and a bit expensive, but again comfortable, wit great service. The room we had was excellent- large, with a decent bathroom, window over a small canal.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 23, 2012Dear “Beachcomer2”,  Thank you for sharing your experience and for choosing our Metropole Hotel: you are more than welcome anytime you need a break and comfortable warm relax!
