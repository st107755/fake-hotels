This hotel was stunning. It's in a great location, especially if you are taking the boat service to and from the airport (which is a great way to arrive). Its on the main promenade with great views and a short walk to the main square. The staff were lovely, the rooms were decorated beautifully. I proposed to my girlfriend here and could imagine a more magical or romantic place to have picked!! Will definitely return!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
