This was a wonderful romantic hotel, which was was full of antiques and old style opulence-definitely not for those who want a modern minimalistic light hotel.It was close to St Mark's Square and the water taxi stops ,so a great location.The breakfast was tasty and very well presented,and the staff attentive and helpful in every way.My only niggle woud be that there were no tea/coffee making facilities or WiFi in the rooms which would have been nice at the end of a busy days sight seeing, but in no ways detracted from our stay.We would definitiely stay there againRead moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
