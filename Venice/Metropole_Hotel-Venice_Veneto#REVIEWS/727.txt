We stayed four nights at the Metropole in May. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. We had a suite with terrace that had a spectacular view of the Giudecca Canal. Rooms were comfortable and well serviced. We also enjoyed the lovely garden. The most enjoyable amenity was the bar. Strongly atmospheric, we could see ourselves cosily holed up there in bad weather. The bar staff was utterly superb. Real professionals, and also warm, intelligent and extremely helpful. Our daughter had her first bellini made with a fresh peach - she loved it. We highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
