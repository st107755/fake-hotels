Every time we stay here we are never disappointed. It’s old world charm is spectacular. Service is excellent, location very good. Rooms are lovely and beds very comfortable. It has a great bar where you can relax after walking along the canals for a glass or two 🍷🍷 Thoroughly recommend this hotel. You feel like you are definitely in Europe Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
