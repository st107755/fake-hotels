We stayed at the Metropole three years ago and loved it! This time in Venice we have booked an apartment for a more local feel. However we returned to the bar of the Metropole for dinner and were not disappointed. The staff remembered us from last timed that it was my husband's birthday then. They were attentive and friendly. The food was excellent - my steak was perfectly cooked and the wines were delicious. Not cheap but well worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
