my husband and I have just returned from a three night stay at the beautiful metropole venice. Overall we were delighted with the hotel, perfect location right on the lagoon front. Felt like stepping into another world when you enter the front foyer as it is so peaceful and quiet compaired with the hustle and bustle outside the front entrance. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. My husband had emailed ahead to enquire about a room with a view as this was my 40th birthday trip but unfortunately this didn't happen. Our room was on the small side with two single beds pushed together! Hindsight I think we should have requested a different room but it was clean and for only three nights it was fine. Lovely to have turn down at night. Beautiful cocktails in the oriental bar.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
