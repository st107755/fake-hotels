What a grand lady the metropole is!   Nestled on the grand canal just ten mins stroll away from the chaos of st mark's square, step inside this wonderful, tranquil hotel to glimpse a slice of Traditional Venice and take you back to a time gone past. All rooms are decorated in the traditional baroque style so expect lots of luxurious fabrics, furniture coverings and Venetian period furniture - a real feast for the eyes.   The beautifully decorated Moroccan themed garden is a wonderful place to have a nightcap.   Great value for money and a superb location.

I am really glad you appreciated the oriental and Venetian allure inside the Metropole, and the preciousness of its settings. It is a very ancient palace wher history still talks through the magic of its atmospfere and for the connection with music (Antonio Vivaldi taught music in these venues.). Thank you again for the time you dedicated to describing our Hotel.  With kindest regards.  Gloria Beggiato Metropole Hotel OwnerRead more
