A lovely hotel with welcoming and friendly helpful staff beautifull clean well decorated rooms. We had a 2 bedroom suite or apartment rates are not inexpensive, though venice specializes like other big tourist cites in high prices even for the ordinary, a  coke at $6 is considered average and it's easy to pay more! The only down side I found at this hotel was the slow or non existent service if you wanted a drink in the hotels lounge you have to ask all the staff at least twice and should allow 2 hours if you want a cup of coffee or teaRead moreHelpfulShare
