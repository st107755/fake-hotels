A+++ service in a perfect location. What a find!  We stayed here for 2 days and loved every minute of our stay.  Great linens and comfortable beds. Nice sized room with great bathroom amenities.   Perfect service.  An impressive breakfast buffet with anything you might want for breakfast and plenty of healthy options (dine in the outdoor garden!).  There is a private launch and you can sit right on the canal and the bartender will bring you wine.  The hotel has a funky Italy meets Morocco kind of vibe.  And, free WIFI that ALWAYS worked (pet peeve when hotels charge for wifi).  Would stay again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
