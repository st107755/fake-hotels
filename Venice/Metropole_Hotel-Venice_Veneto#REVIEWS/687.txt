Stayed two evenings at this hotel and I have to say they do a lovely job accomodating their guests.  When we checked in I did not like my room arrangements and Max went out of his way to show me 2 other rooms that were available.  I ended up upgrading for $50 a night and got a larger room with a spectacular extremely large balcony overlooking the Grand canal.  Location of this hotel is great and the hotel is kept very clean.  The only down side is that the halls in the hotel are not properly air conditioned and hot.  We also ate at the restaurant on site The Met which was delicious.  Very conveniently located a 5 minute walk to Marco square.  Breakfast was served in a buffet style and very good.  Lots of items to choose from.  Overall I would stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
