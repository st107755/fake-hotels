We stayed at The Metropole for 3 nights, August 18 to the 21st. We were a large group so we stayed in 3 rooms. My room was 211, a family room that was more than spacious. The staff at the hotel is beyond helpful and very friendly. We have stayed in a number of other hotels in Venice but they never seem really special. This hotel and it's delightful collections of unusual objects is a true gem and the staff raises the bar for anyone in the hotel industry.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Aug 28, 2012Dear "qwf", I must say your comment is a real satisfaction to us.  You mention a comparison between the Metropole and other hotels: we have in fact constantly to consider the increasing opening of new great hotels in Venice, therefore you can imagine our offer must always improve as well as our service. Sure, we have our precious antiques collections which you cannot find somewhere else, they are an "unicum" of the Metropole in that they belong to my family and are the result of a great passion for antiques and the wish to share it with our Guests.  Yet for all the other aspects, there is a great competitivity which becomes a stimulus for us to keep up and go over the high standards. Thank you again for you time and for sharing with the Community of Tripadvisor your nice comment.  Sincerely Yours.  Gloria Beggiato General Manager & Chief Administrator Metropole HotelRead more
