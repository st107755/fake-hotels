Stayed here to attend carnevale events in February.   The staff were friendly and attentive throughout and the hotel is well situated and accessible.  The restaurant is excellent by any standards and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here - including the excellent "Shakespeare night".   Would not hesitate to recommend and will stay again when visiting Venice. Thank you Metropole...!Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
