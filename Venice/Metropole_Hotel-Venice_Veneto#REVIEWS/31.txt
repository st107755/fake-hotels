Stopped by this hotel for a refresher while sightseeing in Venice. Close proximity to San Marco Piazza. Ordered drinks at the bar and decided on hot chocolate, there is a great selection of warm drinks. The service was friendly but price was very upmarket. Nice place to call into for a relaxing drink. Amazing decor.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare
