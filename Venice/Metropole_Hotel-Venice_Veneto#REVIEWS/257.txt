This hotel location is absolutely stunning. Overlooking the lagoon and so close to the water bus stop and few steps from St. Mark Square. The interiors are a fantastic opulent trip in the old baroque Venice. We had series of good late evenings drinking surrounded by old mirrors , red velvet luxury furniture and walls decorated with old tapestry gold embroidered. The staff is friendly and kind. Deserved treat if you visit Venice for a  short city break.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from HotelMetropoleVenice, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear "daisy742014", I wish to thank you for writing such a nice comment about your stay at the Metropole.
