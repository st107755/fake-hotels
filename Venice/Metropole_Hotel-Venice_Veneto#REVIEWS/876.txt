Traveled to Venice with my 11 YO daughter.  Hotel was fantastic, great location!  Our room was quite elegant, very comfortable and had everything we needed.  Breakfast was great -- good food, wonderful setting and very relaxing (my preteen slept quite late so I lingered over the paper & coffee for awhile).  But by far the most impressive was the staff -- incredibly helpful, charming & fun.  We will definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
