I really like this hotel .It is on the Grand canal and just down from the Danieli. The decor is shall we say most interesting. Deep reds on the walls with endless wooden bed heads lining the corridors as decoration.  The staff were very helpful, always polite and went out of their way to accommodate us ,especially  on New Years Eve, We had drinks, listened to the band play, dance and then went out to see the magnificent fireworks display  right outside our hotel. We stared at the sky, ooed and awed along with everyone else and then went back inside for a night cap.  Our room was at the back and quiet as requested. A large room with an enormous bed and all the usual facilities one would expect.  Breakfast was good and offered a variety of choices to satisfy most cultural tastes. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
