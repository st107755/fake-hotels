Great hotel with great service. I loved my room also. My ONLY complaint was that i scheduled to have a water taxi the night before to pick me up at 9:45am, unfortunately the taxi did not arrive until 10:10 and I missed my train. Although, this may not have been the hotel's fault, the hotel got my destination wrong when I was checking out which may have been part of the problem. Nevertheless, great service, beautiful hotel, and great room. I loved being right next to the canal.
