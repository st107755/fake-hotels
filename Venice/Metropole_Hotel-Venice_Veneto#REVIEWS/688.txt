The perfect hotel for getting around Venice.  Close walking distance to St Marks Square.  Lovely garden environment for the delicious buffet included in your stay.  Beautiful rooms...clean and the staff very helpful.  We would definitely stay there again. Anna DoerrRead moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
