Perfect location, in the heart of it all! Room was spotless, looked recently updated. Bed and bedding was crisp, clean, and welcoming after a long day of sightseeing.  Service was friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is not included in this pricey hotel stay, that would be an additional 30 euros per day for a breakfast buffet, or 12 euros per day for  the Italian breakfast of coffee/tea, juice and 2 small pastries. It was convenient to have the Italian breakfast so we could start our day. Friends ordered a cappuccino with breakfast on our first morning and were given a refill. The following day we were gently scolded and told no refills on cappuccino, only coffee, seemed silly for the price paid. But all in all a nice stop to end our trip!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
