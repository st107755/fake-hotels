The hotel is a comfortable hotel, but it is its service what makes it special. The personell did their job without any enthusiasm. The room was clean, the linens soft, soap and Shampoos nice. We ordered a taxi to the airport the day before our departure and the day we left there was heavy fog over Venice. They did not find it pertinent to inform us that we had a boat transfer only to the Piazzale Roma and then had to continue by taxi to the airport. Small details that make such a difference. For this price there are a lot of agreeable hotels in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
