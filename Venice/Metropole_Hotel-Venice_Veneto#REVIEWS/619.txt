Stayed at the Metropole in late April and was very happy with this property. It is beautifully furnished with antique furniture all throughout the hotel and the ambiance is amazing. The location is great as well, less than a 10 minute walk to St. Marks Square, Doge's Palace and St. Marks Basilica. Staff was very friendly and I would only use this hotel upon returning to Venezia. Highly Recommended!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
