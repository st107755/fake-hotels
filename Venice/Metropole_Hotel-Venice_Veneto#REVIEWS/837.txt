The hotel has a perfect central location and is charming inside,full of quirky antiques and red materials.I have to say however that this is by no means a 5 star hotel as promised, I booked a superior delux room with a lagoon view, for a special occasion and was so dissapointed, the room was tiny and overlooking the sea taxi ticket office on the lagoon,which had a flag pole outside one of the windows.I asked for another room but was told I would have to pay even more money for a suite, which after viewing, was certainly not worth it.Overall it just is not special enough and does not at all deserve its star rating, after checking out, you even have to pay a 30 euro tax to help them pay towards the up keep of the museums and galleries,not good, you really felt like a number and…Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 17, 2012Dear “Ley123”,  Thank you for your recent stay with us. We are deeply sorry to learn about your experience that was not positive.  Let us inform you that our hotel is a historical building and the owners of the hotel, since ’60, are history lovers and art collectors: more than 2000 art details are all around the hotel, most of which are heritage of the former building and originally bought, with great investments, in worldwide art galleries.  We do apologize if, in occasion of your stay, we could not offer a variety of rooms for you to choose as a better alternative of the one you reserved, but the hotel was heavily booked and no other choices were available.  Starting from 2011, like many other Italian art cities, also in Venice hotels are obliged to apply the local city tax, due to guests directly to the city in accordance with the Venice Municipal Council resolution no. 23 of 23/06/2011. Hotel’s role is only as tax collector on behalf of the government.  We do hope we will have the pleasure to welcoming you back again as our special Repeat Guest and personally guide you through the magic history of our charming house-museum.
