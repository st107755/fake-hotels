Stayed here July 2015, the location is perfect but for the price the rooms are OK, I payed for a Delux double but we just had 2 single beds pushed together! Also dont stay in a room near the hotel front, yes you get great views but the LOUD music from the bar does not stop until 1-2am. Staff are friendly but the breakfast isn't worth â‚¬30 each. Venice is fantastic but if I was going again I'd probably go for a different hotel. I did have a fantastic holiday and would re-commend Venice to anyone, no smell, no mozi's and not expensive.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
