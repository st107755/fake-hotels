The location is great, the internal decoration and furniture is top notch, the breakfast buffet is extraordinary and the service is attentive and good. It is not perfect and there is a but, and for us it was the room. Our room was a bit old, not very well equipped, quit small and even a bit smelly. I would expect a better room for 370 EUR per night (this was the price because we booked room and paid 6 months in advance. Otherwise, the price is much higher)... Just as an example, there was no kettle in the room. When we asked for one the receptionist said that they can send it in a minute but it would cost us 5 EUR â€¦ Come on, 370 EUR per night for a room and additional 5 EUR to have a kettle in the room?!?Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
