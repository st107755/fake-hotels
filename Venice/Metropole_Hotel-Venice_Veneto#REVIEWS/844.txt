We had room 151 and 149, both had 3 star quality only. Breakfast was good and plenty, but nothing special. We had dinner once, which was ok. The staff is friedly, attentive and unintrusive. The best part of the hotel and not to miss are the cosy common room and the bar. The hotel is very close to the vaporetto stop Zaccaria. Would we go there again? Sure, for a drink.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare
