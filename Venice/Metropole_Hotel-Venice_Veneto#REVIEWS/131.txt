Metropole's magical atmosphere will definitely delight! I commend the owner -Ms. Gloria- for paying incredible attention to every detail hotel wide, from the fascinating decor to her choice of gracious and knowledgeable personnel staff. As soon as you step inside the lobby you know you're in for a treat. Superb location- phenomenal breakfast buffet (included) - Oriental Bar was lovely for cocktails - fabulous outdoor garden space (a quiet retreat). Guest rooms are all different and beautifully appointed.  Having a private balcony made it all the more special! Staff made sure we felt "at home" and seamlessly handled airport and cruise port water taxi reservations to assist us with a stress free stay. Thank you Qiara and Alessandro and Giuliano and Luisa and Gloria and everyoneâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
