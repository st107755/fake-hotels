Everything was charming and top-notch throughout our three day stay. Staff were exceptional in multiple languages, with an ability to recall your room number and particular preferences without you having to ask for anything.   The hotel, built in the 14th century, is beautifully decorated with unique antiques and has quite a history - Freud, Thomas Mann and Marcel Proust stayed here. Vivaldi taught music here. They recently opened a spa that you can block for couples. Drinks at the Oriental bar were perfect.   If you like the challenge of negotiating public transport like we do, the hotel is conveniently located right at the vaporetto stop San Zaccara, although it has its own dock so for a fee they will pick you up from the people mover stop or Tronchetto and you can arrive in style. From the hotel, St. Mark's Square is only a few minutes walk.   Definitely the hotel we will return to on our next trip to Venice. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2020Trip type: Traveled as a coupleHelpfulShare
