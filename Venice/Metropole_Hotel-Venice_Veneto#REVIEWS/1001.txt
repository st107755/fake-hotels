This hotel was splendid.  Like Venice, it is an interesting blend of cultural influences.  The rooms are decorated with antiques and striped walls in rich hues with Venetian chandeliers.  The bar is small, 5 or 6 tables, with an Easten/African feel about it.  There is a large lounge for tea or drinks.  The location is fabulous, right on the Lagoon, and a short distance from several vaporetti stops.  The staff was ok.  Once out the door, you can get lost in the maze of Venice.  St. Marks is a 5 minute walk away.  They have a Michelin * restaurant on premises but we did not eat there.  It was like a passage in time to stay here. Read moreHelpfulShare
