We booked 2 nights there while in Venice for my boyfriend's birthday.  It was worth every Euro we paid for it even though the exchange rate is not in our favor.  The decor is amazing and you can spend hours looking through the collections throughout the hotel.  Our room was amazing.  We had a lagoon view which was magical as well as a beautiful tiled tub which was a wonderful place to relax after a day of sight seeing.    We had drinks in the bar both nights and the staff there was fantastic.    The location is ideal as it is just off of St. Mark's Square.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare
