Brilliant hotel!  This was my first visit to Venice and it was everything I wanted it to be and more.  Of course the fact that we arrived on a gorgeous sunny day had a lot to do with first impression.  However two days of fog could not dampen our spirits.  The hotel is ideally situated 2 minutes (or three bridges) away from St Marks Square.  We were warmly welcomed.  A spacious room with the best view.  The hotel's interior resembles that of a museum.  Quirky and interesting.  Breakfast was a very good spread with exceptional coffee!   Getting lost was a right of passage, and thanks to the concierge directions probably far less than we would have by ourselves.   Thank you for a wonderful first visit.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
