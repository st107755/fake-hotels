Our first contact with the hotel was with Sara in reservations. She could not have been more helpful, and has excellent English. Check-in was super quick as was check- out. The decor is quite dark, husband did not like it but it is typical opulent old world Venetian and interesting to browse around. Br akfast was good but it helps if you like scrambled eggs. They were excellent but there is quite an extra charge if you want fried or poached. Coffee was really good and plenty on offer from the very nice breakfast staff. Our room was on the side canal which was fine, a great view of the  lagoon if you leaned out the window. The location is perfect, about five minutes walk from the Doges Palace, fabulous view over the lagoon.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
