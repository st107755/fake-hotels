We have now stayed at the Metropole twice and could not be more happy about our experience . The rooms and suites are beautiful,quiet and romantic. The staff are all charming and helpful. Just a short walk to St. Marks  and a vaporetto stop right out front. Cannot wait till we return, hopefully for Carnival!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
