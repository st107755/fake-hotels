The hotel reminds me of a smaller version of the Danieli. It is very baroque, decorated in classic Venetian style and right in from of the Main Canal. Make sure you take the vaporetto to San Zacharia and not to Piazza San Marco, otherwise you'll have an uncomfortable walk up and down about 4 bridges. the room was comfortable and well decorated. The breakfast was in a terrace that was lovely. the only con was the hard pillows.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Jun 11, 2012Dear Mr "msalazardc",  Greetings from Venice and thank you for your experience with us!
