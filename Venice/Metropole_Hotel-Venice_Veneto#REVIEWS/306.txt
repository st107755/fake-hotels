From the moment we entered the hotel by water taxi at the side canal entrance, to the moment we left three days later, we felt we had stepped back in time to a period where guests were appreciated and made to feel at home, far from the crowds on the waterfront.  A beautifully decorated, timeless, historical hotel with beautiful dining areas. Our room made us feel we were actually staying nearby in the Dogges Palace.  The management generously had upgraded us to a suite for our 25th wedding anniversary.  The staff made great suggestions for self-guided walking tours far from the cruise ship tourists crowding the main square, and for restaurants and areas frequented by locals.   We would recommend this hotel to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
