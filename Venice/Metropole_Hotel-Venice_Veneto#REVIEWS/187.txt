We picked the Metropole for its location near the water taxi and St. Mark's square. The room was stuffy as the air conditioning either did not work or was absent all together. Very noisy due to a child crying on and on in the middle of the night, no sound proofing here. Did like the wonderful breakfast in the courtyard the next morning ( Euro 30 each). We were offered a private boat transfer and car to the airport for Euro 210 and were able to find it elsewhere for Euro 110.00, not sure why. Did not meet our expectations for the price we paid.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
