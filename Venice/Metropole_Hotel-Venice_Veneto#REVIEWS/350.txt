Luck is always good, We selected Hotel Metropole by doing some research and booked two rooms for our stay prior to boarding a cruise from Venice. Upon arrival, by water taxi from the train station, the staff could not be more accommodating. The Hotel is beautiful and the rooms were large,clean and decorated magnificently.  The location was great and a quick walk to the Square and all surrounding areas. Upon leaving we happened to meet the owner who was personally supervising the installation of new area rugs. He could not be more pleasant and welcoming to his Hotel.  When I visit Venice again, this Hotel is definitely our choice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
