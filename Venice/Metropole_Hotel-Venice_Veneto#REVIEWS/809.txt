We stayed one night at the Hotel Metropole at the conclusion of our two week Mediterranean cruise on the recommendation of our travel agent.  The only problem was that we wish she would have encouraged us to stay longer!  The hotel is beautiful and full of antiques, unusual collections, and artwork.  Our flight out the next morning was early so unfortunately we were not able to experience the breakfast.  Our room was just a standard room but it was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice with quality toiletries.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  There are many restaurants in the immediate area and San Marco Square is only a short walk away.  We highly recommend this property and when we return to Venice, we will definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
