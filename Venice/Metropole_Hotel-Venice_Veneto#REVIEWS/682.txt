If you could imagine yourself in a first class antique store offering an array of collectibles from furniture to do-dads, you can imagine your stay at the Metropole. It is a delightful hotel, with a friendly staff and with comfortable and well equipped rooms. You are surrounded by collectibles wherever you look, sit down, or sleep. Its fun, its different and its cozy. Located closer to the lagoon than the Grand canal. It nonetheless is convenient. The restaurant is first rate and the service is top notch.

You said "it is fun, different and cozy". That is mainly what we do want to express to our Guests through our care and attention, but also through our love for art and antiques, and through a delicate and original cuisine. So, I highly appreciate you felt theses three elements and decided to share them with the Tripadvisor community. Thank you so much. Let me hope that the Metropole will be again your home in Venice in your next travel. Warm regards.  Gloria Beggiato Metropole Hotel Venice  Gloria Beggiato Metropole Hotel VeniceRead more
