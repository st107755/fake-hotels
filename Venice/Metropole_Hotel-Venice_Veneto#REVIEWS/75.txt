Had dinner in the restaurant of the Metropole hotel. This 1 star restaurant is as the style of the hotel very romantic and everything you expert in a romantic Venisian  hotel. We did not want a whole menu but just a starter & main because we had a long day of travelling behind us. I had 2 vegetarian dishes, a watermelon carpaccio and a millefeuille off    courgette & ricotta. I only wanted 1 glas of wine to acompany My  Food. I think €40 Euro for A ribbon of courgette with riccota & lemon zest is over rated so is €25 for a glas of wine. Maybe the whole menu is a better choice.
