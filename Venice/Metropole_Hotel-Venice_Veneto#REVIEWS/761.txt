We stayed 3 night arriving on Xmas day. The private pier is perfect when you get to Venice from the aiport using taxi boat.The warm welcome by the reception staff speaking english french is to be noticed.This hotel make me think of an old mention in the countryside.

Yes, I must say Christmas is probably my favourite period of the year, for what it represents and for the warmth I feel and wish to share.  It all means a great work to decorate the Metropole with the most charming and cosy features. It is not easy, I really do not want to take for granted such an important characteristic such as Christmas decorations, therefore I look everywhere to find the most appropriate object and the most amazing matching.  The hotel thus has a completely different atmosphere, as you noticed.  Of course in all this effort I have great help from my staff. Everyone of us gives his best in special periods like Christmas, and I am really very glad that our Guests appreciate. I hope you'll have the chance to come to the Metropole in other special occasions (don't miss our Carnival!). I would be more than glad to meet you personally.  Thank you again and kind regards.
