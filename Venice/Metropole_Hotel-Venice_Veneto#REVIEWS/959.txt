After spending a great deal of time researching on hotels facing the Basin of San Marco, finally picked the Hotel Metropole due to its uniqueness. Through various emails with Alessandro and Vio, finally picked a special Deluxe room with Lagoon view, room 403. Many thanks to Alessandro for the tip, cheers!   Upon checking in, we were shown the other unique Deluxe rooms, room 401 and 409. Room 401, like room 403, has a square shaped terrace facing the Lagoon and the San Giorgio Island but its views were somewhat blocked as it is located right behind room 403. On the other hand, room 409 has the best unblocked view of the Lagoon to the front as well as the whole Riva degli Schiavoni to its right and to its left (the Salute Church and all!).
