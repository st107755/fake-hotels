We were really prepared to love the Metropole. We had reserved 2 rooms, had requested them to be connecting as we were traveling with our 17 yr old grand daughter. We got non-connecting rooms and non-adjacent on the first floor with no view. The rooms were shabby. the wall paper in my g-daughter's room was torn in places. The night noise was more than annoying. For some reason from my gdaughter's  room you could hear bathroom noises from other rooms . In our room, the bathroom floor was filthy and when I had used a bath towel, noticed too late that a blood stain had not fully been removed when the towel had been washed. Even a 2 star hotel knows when to discard used old towels.Read moreDate of stay: March 20091 SaveHelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Asst.  Manager at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 13, 2009Dear Sir,  your comment  - for which we heartily thank you - have very much stroke us.  It is absolutely important to be advised when our service does not satisfy our Customers.  We tried to understand what went wrong in your reservation concerning the two adjoining rooms, but it seems that there are no written references about your request. If you asked it by phone, therefore the only thing we could say is that a mistake in the room division must have occurred. We are normally very attentive to the need of anyone who ask specific request. Although not in accordance to your need, luckily the two rooms were close.  Hearing that the bathroom was not clean is for us a great disappointment: we will immediately and entirely check it. As regards the towel, of course they are not reused, but rather a wrong washing must have affected it.  We are terribly sorry that your stay at the Metropole was spoilt, and really hope you may give us a second choice to show you how careful we are about rooms, cleanness and requests in general.  Best regards Aurelio Bon - Asst. ManagerRead more
