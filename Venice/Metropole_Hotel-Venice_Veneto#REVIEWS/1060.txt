I was there May 1-3 2002. Excellent location close to Plaza San Marco, very clean, elegant operation. The whole hotel is an antique showplace, the lobby, the dining room, and the hallways. Staff treats you as you would be expect to be treated. Enjoyed the everything about the visit except the breakfast. It is adequate for the items you pick up at the buffet and the coffee service is alright, but don't expect to get the advertised orange juice. They just never bring it to you. One other item disturbed me, the breakfast waitress took pains to publicly correct a female member of our party on the proper use of the formal and familar forms of vorrei. I wanted to say something about her rudeness but I was asked not to as it was our last morning there.   All in all I recomend highly. Read moreHelpfulShare
