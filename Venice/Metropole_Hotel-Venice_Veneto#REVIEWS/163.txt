The Metropole Hotel is cute & quirky. It is old fashioned with a touch of eccentricity. There are cabinets full of antiques, such as Jesus on the Cross, book ends, calling card cases and ladies handbags to name a few. The room was beautiful and old fashioned with a beautiful view of the Grand Canal. The staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble. Giuliano Brogliato was especially helpful with our queries and requests. The Oriental Bar was a nice place to have a drink in a more fancy setting. The hotel is 100 meters from St Mark's Square. We loved our stay here and would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
