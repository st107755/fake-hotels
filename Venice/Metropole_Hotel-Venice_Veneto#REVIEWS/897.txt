My wife and me spent just one night there (we were spending pur holidays in Tuscany). The best is the situation, very close of San Marcos Square. We had dinner in its MET restaurant (2 ** Michelin Guide), it worth the effort, I recommend to ask for Surprise Menu, we started at 20:00 and finished at 0:00, about 15 wonderful plates and two bottles of wine.  The room was big enough, no noise, even was a lagoon view, the only bad point was the breakfast, it  was fine, but if you ask for an orange juice, they charge you 8 more â‚¬ (?), I would prefer to pay 8 more euros in the bill and have my orange juice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Assistant General Manager at Metropole HotelResponded Aug 30, 2010First of all we desire to thank you for the nice words, we are very proud to satisfy our guests' expectations and we will take in due consideration you suggestions about the fresh squeezed orange juice.
