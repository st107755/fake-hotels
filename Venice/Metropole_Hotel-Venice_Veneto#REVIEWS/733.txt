This is a four-star hotel, no ifs, no buts. It is clean, stylish, conveniently positioned and the service is charming and helpful. It is packed to the gunnels with antiques of various shapes and sizes but, as someone who is actually in this trade, I am always sceptical as to the actual beauty of mountains of low quality items, whatever their age. That said, our suite was very nice, the shell-shaped bath with its Youth Hostel shower attachment excluded, and we were very well looked after. The owner deserves a special commendation for his exceptional English and easy manner whilst his staff were charming and helpful. Recommended.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
