We stayed in the Metropole for two nights. I cannot express enough how incredibly friendly and helpful the staff were. I would highly recommend the Met restaurant they have in the hotel and also the imperial bar. The hotel organised a private boat cruise which was breath taking and a must if you want to see all of the water sites in an hour! (Sunset is the best time) We had a classic room and it met every expectation and more. I wish i could personally thank all of the staff I had the pleasure of meeting.
