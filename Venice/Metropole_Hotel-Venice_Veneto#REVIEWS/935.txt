We stayed at the Metropole 25 years ago on our honeymoon - promising to return for our 25th wedding anniversary.  We are so glad made this decision.  We tried to book our original room, but the hotel could not work out which it was, but when they heard why, they upgraded us to a room with a lagoon view and balcony - as well serving us "champagne" and silver almonds on arrival.   The hotel is outstandingly decorated, we felt it was like walking into a romantic by-gone age, so right for our honeymoon and 25 years later for our wedding anniversary.  The hotel is quite pricey - as we are both now retired (early, I quickly add) we, unfortunately, agreed that we could not afford to eat in the MET restaurant, but the menu looked delicious and the aroma from the kitchen was wonderful. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2009HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Asst.
