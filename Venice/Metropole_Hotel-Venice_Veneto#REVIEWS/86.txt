Hello ,  My experience was not good  in this hotel :  1- rooms : small without room even they don’t provide water as gift ! (only minibar and expensive ) , no coffee  machine (breakfast extra 35€)  No Iron and just to pass 1 T-shirt is 11€ 2- restaurant : very expensive and not so good  Only the bar is correct and they are little bit correct  3- service : you need to check all bills they try to charge you penalty for a booking that you don’t do if you ask them price they consider that you has booked and they charge you penalty  I will not recommande this hotel because reception in the check out was not professional and we loss 15 minutes to check bills and tack our what they added as penalty for a booking that we didn’t make, Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
