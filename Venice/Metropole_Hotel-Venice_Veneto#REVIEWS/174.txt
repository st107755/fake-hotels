Wanted something central and with charm. Excellent location and room was lovely with a balcony view. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Hotel organises a trip to Murano where they make glass. Trip across to the Island is free. Room was good although they should provide complementary water for the first night and they had no kettle in the room. We didn't have breakfast as it was far too expensive at â‚¬35 per person. We hopped along to a neighbouring hotel and had a great breakfast (husband needed gluten free) and that was far cheaper. Shop around as menus are displayed. I would recommend the hotel but before I forget wifi is not great in the room although if your lucky you get some for a bit in the lounge area downstairs.
