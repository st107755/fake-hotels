What a great place to stay! We stayed at the Metropole during Carnevale at the start of February this year and loved it.  The staff were all so welcoming; special thanks to Bruno in the Oriental bar who made our stay particularly special - although Venice became slightly blurry after his vodka martinis and range of red wines!  Rooms were beautifully decorated. We stayed in 219, overlooking the lagoon. It was a little more expensive than the side rooms, but definitely worth the extra money. Excellently furnished in true Venetian style. Comfortable beds. Nice view from the toilet :)  Breakfast was good - plenty of choice and good quality.  Would definitely recommend and will certainly return to Metropole.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
