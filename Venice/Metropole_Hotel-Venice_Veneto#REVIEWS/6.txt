We stayed for Valentines weekend and although very busy in Venice in general we had a lovely time. The hotel is located in a great place, close to lots of restaurants and St Marks square. The staff were so helpful particularly reception staff who provided a map and suggestions for where to go and eat etc whilst here.   We stayed in a double room, it was very spacious and the bathroom was stunning! Slight issue with the air con/heating which didn’t seem to work so the room ended up so warm but nothing opening a window couldn’t fix however imagine this might be a problem in summer. The tv also wouldn’t work at all but again not an issue as who comes to Venice to watch tv but a slight niggle.  Overall stunning hotel & a lovely stay! Would definitely return - thank you.
