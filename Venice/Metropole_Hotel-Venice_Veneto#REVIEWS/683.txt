Excellent hotel on the main waterway just down from Piazza San Marco.  Beautiful boutique hotel furnished with antiques.  Vaporetta outside the front door and water taxis come to the hotel dock.  Breakfast is way over priced but there are other options steps away.  I highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 10, 2013Dear "Fred P", thank you for commenting your positive stay at the Metropole and for mentioning our breakfast. We have just launched a new proposal for those who prefer to have a quick breakfast: you can a have it at our Oriental Bar facing the lagoon: hot beverage, fruite juice and croissant at a cheaper price. Everything you need to start the day without giving up to good taste!  I hope you will have the chance to come back to Venice and  personally try it.  Thank you!
