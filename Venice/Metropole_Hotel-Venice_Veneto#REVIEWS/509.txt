This hotel has to be seen to be believed.  It is full to the brim with antiques.  Tastefully done and very beautiful.  The staff are very courteous and professional.   Our room was covered in red velvet, totally Venetian, but very clean.   The Metropole Hotel is right on the Grand Canal.  However if you have never been to Venice before, make sure you do your research before you go as it was very confusing to navigate our way from the train station to the Hotel if you are going independently.   Would definately stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare
