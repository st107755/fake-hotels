This is about a 5 minute walk from Piazza San Marco, right on the canal.  Great location.  Our room had windows with shutters that allowed us to look out on the canal.  There's a wonderful onsite bar, expertly run by Bruno and top staff Angelo.  You can have a lovely dinner in the bar or there's a separate restaurant that's more upscale.  Daily full breakfast buffet is served in a beautiful courtyard.  Desk staff were all very helpful.  As another reviewer suggested, arrange for private water taxi from the airport...worth every Euro.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 11, 2013Dear "Rwoehst", thank you so much for your nice comment, I will be happy to forward it to Bruno and Angelo.
