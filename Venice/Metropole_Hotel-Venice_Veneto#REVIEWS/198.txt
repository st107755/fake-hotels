Wonderful hotel and the staff are fantastic. This is  my 2 nd stay and it was even better than the first The room was beautiful and breakfast was excellent  My only minor criticism was the meal in the Michelin restaurant was not as good as my last visit. The choice wasn't there and it lacked that certain something, though again the service and wine choice was exceptional.  Make sure you have plenty of money!!!!!!!!!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
