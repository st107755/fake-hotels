I stayed 2 nights in the hotel. It has excellent location. Staff was exceptional, very helpful.  I left my jewellery box in the room and only remembered about it when arrived to another city. I called them and they shipped me my box immediately. Very impressed by the service and honesty. Very grateful.  The breakfast was excellent and has beautiful settings.   The bathroom was bit outdated. But it was very clean.  Very delightful stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
