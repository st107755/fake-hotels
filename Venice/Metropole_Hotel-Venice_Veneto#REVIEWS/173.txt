Exploring this hotel is a must. They have a collection on show of....... corkscrews!!! Every room is magnificent. Try the cocktail in the bar. The nibbles are amazing. The room we stayed in was fantastic. We arrived by water taxi into  this hotel. Didn't want to leave.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
