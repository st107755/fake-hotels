The hotel is situated near St Mark Sq and it is very convenient with a waterbus station infront of the hotel. I had requested for a transfer from the airport to the hotel and vice versa, the arrangement from the point my girlfriend and I alighted the plane till we reach the hotel was smooth and the drivers were friendly and helpful.   The hotel rooms was very classic and have a historical sense with the various display. The room was clean, neat and replenish their bathroom toiletries daily to make sure we are in good shape. They breakfast was good and their service staff are good be in the waiter that serve us breakfast or the front desk. They helped us to answer our queries when we are in doubt of the directions.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
