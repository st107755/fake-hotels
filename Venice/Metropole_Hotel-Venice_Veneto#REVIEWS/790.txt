The Metropole is a first class, luxurious Venice experience. Service is outstanding with great attention to detail. We stayed 2 nights in a junior suite and enjoyed the size of the room and bathroom and the lovely extra touches - the turn down service, lovely bathroom amenities, welcome letter and surprise bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary, complementary transport to Murano and the gorgeous breakfast. The hotel is perfectly located on the grand canal with water taxi access in the small canal on the side of the hotel. We would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 14, 2012Dear "Cola125", it is thanks to comments like yours that we find always new enthusiasm in our job! Thank you so much for your kindness. Beyond a high-quality service that we want to maintain every day in every aspect of the Hotel, we think that even the smallest attention towards a guest can be relevant for the overall perception and to enhance even a short stay. Moreover, we are extremely lucky because we also benefit from a most favourable position and spectacular views of the lagoon, so we have the chance to offer to our guests the magic of this city, where I really hope to welcome you again in the future.  Thank you again.  Gloria Beggiato General Manager & Chief Administrator Metropole HotelRead more
