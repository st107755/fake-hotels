You wrote a very nice thing, that entering the Metropole was like living in old Venice: well, this is something I really appreciate, in that the allure of the past is an element so difficlut to find in places. Our hotel is rich of history, in fact it used to be a female orphanage where Antonio Vivaldi thaught music during the late 18th century..  So staying here is like living again those fascianting years when Venice was at its top splendour. Thank you so much for focusing on such an important and characterizing aspect of our Hotel.  Best regards.  Gloria Beggiato Metropole Hotel  VeniceRead more
