We loved this hotel!  It is in a great spot on the Grand Canal.  It defines old world charm with rooms and hallways decorated in beautiful fabrics and antiques.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom modern and spacious, and it had good wifi.  The front desk staff were terrific and breakfast in the garden was a treat every morning.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
