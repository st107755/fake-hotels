Each room is different, have some view of canal. The service staff is amazing, all speak English and try their best to help. The breakfast bar is fantastic, has everything you would want, did not even try bacon and eggs. Too many other foods to choose... Oriental bar is a bit expensive, but great service and drinks. This hotel is located on Grand Canal, 5 min walk to San Marco. It exceeded our expectations.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
