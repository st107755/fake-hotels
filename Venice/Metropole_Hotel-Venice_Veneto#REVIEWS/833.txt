I have  just spent 3 nights at The Metropole for my 50th Birthday and it was amazing. We were treated so well from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The hotel is a gem full of character and our room was lovely. Breakfast was included and could not be faulted. The location is perfect for any part of venice you may wish to visit. I can not think of a better place to have spent my birthday. Thank you to all the staff - can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 23, 2012Dear “donnahalifax”,  We are thrilled to understand you had a memorable experience with us: we have shared your comments with all our Team and be assured that we will work harder and harder to even exceed your expectations and surprise you in occasion of your next stay!
