A lovely, historic hotel in a great location with spacious rooms. Service was very thoughtful & the breakfast buffet was delicious. The hotel's restaurant has a Michelin star and, while pricey, it's well worth it if you're up for a splurge (the pasta with prawns, potato puree & basil pesto with a seafood emulsion was a particular favorite). Strongly recommend the garden annex room, which is unique and especially private - it feels like having your own guest house in central Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
