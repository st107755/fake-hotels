This is the second time in this hotel: Christmas time, magical time in this magical city needs a magical place to stay. This is the one. For everything: location, decor, scents, lights, colors, kindness....... Every floor is different because of the accumulation of objets making this hotel unique. The Oriental bar is a delightful place for tea, drink or dinner. I didnâ€™t try the 1star Michelin restaurant , but I understand it is a great one. So next Xmas, go for this dreamy place....maybe we will meet.Read moreDate of stay: December 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
