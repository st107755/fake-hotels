Just returned from 3 days at the Metropole. We celebrated my husband's 50th birthday and it couldn't have been a better choice of hotel. Our room overlooked the side canal and through the open window we could hear the gentle sound of gondolas passing. Excellent bathroom, small but very well finished with power shower and had everything you could need including a very powerful hair dryer! Do have the Italian breakfast at 15 euros. It is good value compared to local coffee shops. Great bar too! Book the hour boat trip with the hotel's water taxi and you will feel like James Bond. Definitely worth it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
