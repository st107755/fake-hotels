It all depends on what you are looking for and we found the perfect spot for a 3 day retreat in Venice in July 2013. My wife and I stayed from Friday to Monday late July to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. I notified the hotel upfront via eMail (if you can, do so , too - it is a busy summer - do so as early as possible) and they reacted very very nicely.  First of all: the hotel has 4 floors. The higher up you get, the better for the noise. All hotels in the center are noisy, because tourists are crawling Venice like ants a sugar cake.  Metropole got us in 403, one of the 3 rooms with a terrace and the room with the best terrace I have stayed in (yes, I had a few 5* top spots around the world). The terrace is quite private, only your direct neighbour can take a look.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
