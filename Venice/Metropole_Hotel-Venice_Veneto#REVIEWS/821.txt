You are thrust into a historic , old world atmosphere right off the Riva in Venice.   All antiques and red velvet everywhere give you the feeling as if you are a grand lady in an elegant old world place. Rooms are ultra clean with great service with very attentive staff. Vivaldi was said to have come to this place as a music teacher when the hotel was a girl's school.  The owners have paid attention to detauls and it shows.   Comfortable and exceptional experience.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Jun 11, 2012Dear Mrs "paulapureheart21",  Thank you for sharing your experience at our Metropole with all the community, we are honored you were our valued guest.
