We stayed at the Metropole for two nights with our 14 and 11 year old daughters.  The Metropole offers a family room that easily sleeps four which was perfect for us.  The downside was a view of the building next door.  Prior to arrival I arranged a private water taxi to the hotel from the airport through the concierge. Very quick response and he offered alternatives.  Definitely recommend the water taxi directly to the hotel!  Staff were all friendly and made good restaurant recommendations.  The bar and sitting room are very cool.  Service in the bar was very friendly, but a bit slow.  Great place to unwind after a long day.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
