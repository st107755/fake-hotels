This is Venice so any hotel on the grand canal has some noise, however we were surprised at the lack of noise and our room had three windows overlooking the canal!  We were in the Damasco Suite and it was truly worth the money. The furnishings throughout the hotel are lovely and the atmosphere was a relaxing gift after the frenzy of Venice. Bruno the bartender is truly amazing!  The BEST martini we have ever hadâ€¦thank you Bruno. We found the staff engaging, the food exceptional and the hotel a respite of delight. Would stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
