What a nice boutique hotel. From outside, it looks inconspicuous. However everything changes once you step into the lobby. The decoration is very grand and cosy. Not to mention the special key chain! The interior of every room is different and lavish. Very short walk from jetty after getting off the ferry. 10 minutes walk to St Marco square. You will be delighted!Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
