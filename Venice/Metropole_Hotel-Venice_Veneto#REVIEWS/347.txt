Just heading home after 4 nights in Venice.  The hotel is perfectly located for water buses and Marc square.  We stayed in the terrace room and it was a nice added extra to be able to sit on the roof terrace and watch the ships go past on the grand canal at the end of a day and be away from all the crowds.  The decor in the hotel is a bit different from the standard hotels which is all part of its charm.  The staff where fantastic and couldn't do enough to help us both prior to our visit and during it.  I would highly recommend the hotel if you want to stay close to the main attractions but far enough to offer a quite get away.  We didn't eat in the main restaurant but we did have a great evening in bar where again the staff couldn't do enough for us to make our eveningâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
