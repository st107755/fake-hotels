Very convenient location.  Water taxi from train station directly to the side door of the Hotel.  Perfect if you have been traveling and lugging luggage for a few weeks.  Decent hotel.  Concierge, Enzo, very helpful. They do set you up to take a "Free" taxi to Murano, the glass blowing place. After the tour of the factory, you go to their showroom where they give you the hard sell.  Cost me over $400.   My wife got sold on some vases.  Other than that, the place was pretty clean and the buffet breakfast was excellent.  Probably won't find much better. Read moreHelpfulShare
