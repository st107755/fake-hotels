Manager at Metropole HotelResponded May 6, 2009Dear Sir, Dear Madam, we heartily thank you for  the nice description of your stay at the Metropole, it is very detailed and says really nice things about many aspects of our service and interiors. Nonetheless we are sorry if you found our breakfast room quite dark. From the first of May we have opened again our Citrus Garden. You can have breakfast there, surrounded by luxuriant plants, smart tables with white cushions ... it is a real pity you cannot see it now.

My warmest regards.  Aurelio Bon Assistant ManagerRead more
