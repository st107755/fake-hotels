Bruno is the barman at the Metropole.  Want a cocktail, just ask Bruno.  He makes really great cocktails.  Want the name of a great local restaurant, just ask Bruno.  Really nice space, too.  The plaque on the wall outside says that Vivaldi composed the "Four Seasons" here.  We stayed in the hotel two nights and loved it. Our room overlooked the canal, but was very quiet.  Great central location close to St. Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
