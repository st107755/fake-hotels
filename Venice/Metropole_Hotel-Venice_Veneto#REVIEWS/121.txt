Stayed here for New Year's and we were not at all disappointed.  Got picked up by a private boat (fee) from Venice Santa Lucia Station.  Had a beautiful romantic ride along the canal to the main hotel entrance. Great beginning. Location was great as it was literally two bridge climbs away from San Marco's square.  All attractions were nearby and within walking distance too.  The staff were very kind and helpful with all our requirements.  The rooms were spacious and had all luxury amenities as well. Great overall experience to end our Italy trip. Definitely a recommendation to all couples as well as familiesRead moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare
