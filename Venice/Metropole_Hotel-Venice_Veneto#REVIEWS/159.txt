This hotel has a certain old world charm and elegance. Do not miss the interesting art on every floor. The managers Alessandro and Alvise were fabulous and attentive as was Angelica and the other personnel in this wonderful hotel.  The concierge, Giuliano, gave us great places to go and how to plan our days.  The breakfast was fabulous and the garden area was very pretty. The rooms were very nice and the location is close to everything.  I would stay there again the next time I go to Venice.  Thanks again to everyone there.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
