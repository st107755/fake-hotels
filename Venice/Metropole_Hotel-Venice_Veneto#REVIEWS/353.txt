Stayed here for six nights after a transatlantic cruise. Hotel and staff were 5 star. Our room faced the busy main canal, but was surprisingly quiet at night. Housekeeping was twice daily, and never intrusive. Breakfast was the perfect start to the day. Location was a 5 minute walk to St Marks's square.   I have only good things to say about the Metropole, and would stay there again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
