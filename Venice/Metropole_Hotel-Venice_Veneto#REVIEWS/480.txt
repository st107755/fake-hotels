Got here at 12:30 on Monday 6 July. Room was ready, perfect view of the lagoon. AC worked great. Bed was very comfy. Cherries in our room everyday. What a wonderful Hotel. The decor was beautiful. You will not be disappointed. Oh one more thing the tub was very relaxing after a long tour of the city.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
