We stayed in Rome, Florence, and Venice in hotels of the samer rating an the Metropole was BY FAR the best of the bunch.  We weren't enamoured with Venice as a whole, but the hotel was great and the staff was incredible.  I was overwhelmed by tourists all over Venice, but the staff at Metropole was the friendliest in Italy and they made us totally comfortable.  The room was great and the food and drink excellent.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
