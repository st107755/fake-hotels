We stayed at the hotel during Venice's Art festival and the peak of the season! The concierge was amazing! He made arrangements for our private water taxi transfer from the airport directly to the hotel. And arranged for us to have the same water taxi all 3 days of our private tours. The hotel is definitely different and gives you a feel of what it was like at the height of Venice as a trading port! The food at the Met, hotel bar and outside restaurant was delicious! Our room was large and they even had a dog bed and bowls for our 4 leg child!Not to mention it's in the perfect location, close to everything but still quite! We will definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 10, 2013Dear "Honeytravelstoo", I am very happy to read that the Metropole was the right location for your stay in Venice. Thank you for taking the time to write all the details you found in line with your expectations, especially our attention for four-leg children as you call them! We love animals and we try to do amything we can to let them feel at home. It is always a holiday for them as well, isn't it? Thank you again for your time.  Regards.
