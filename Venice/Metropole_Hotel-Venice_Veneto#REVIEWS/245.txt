My husband and I booked the Metropole Hotel for 5 days for our honeymoon..and what a fantastic hotel to celebrate the first days of married life. The hotel is spotless and the staff are extremely helpful!  The room was always cleaned and when leaving to explore the city on our return the bed was turned down and towels refreshed, the hotel really is luxurious. The decor on some reviews has been looked down upon but we happened to think it added an element of individuality and character.  The views from our room was spectacular looking right onto the lagoon and the hotel itself is just a 5 minute walk from St. Marks Square. This hotel is a fantastic place to stay whilst visiting Venice!  Anastasia & James Joseph Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
