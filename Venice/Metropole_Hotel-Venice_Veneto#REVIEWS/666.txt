Location splendid at the edge of the canal and a five min walk from San Marco. The decoration is definitely Venetian but way too heavy, to say the least, for my taste. Service, is acceptable to poor and catastrophic when we tried to have dinner at the lounge - I have to say that the manager offered his profuse apologies and did not charge for the meal. Breakfast charged extra is again acceptable and not what one would expect from such price tag. Overall, I would say very poor value for money.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
