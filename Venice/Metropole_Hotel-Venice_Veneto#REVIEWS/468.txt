One and only trip to Venice so wanted a wow hotel for one night. The room was outstanding by far the best we've ever stayed but it's spoilt by being ripped off. We arrived at 4pm after traveling 8hrs from Florence by car to be greeted by a nice bowl of cherries in our room and nothing else. We was charged for a bottle of water we where charged for a cup of tea yes there is nothing in the room you have to call room service I don't approve of that even in the top London hotels you get a kettle. I needed an iron but was told it's against health and safety so a lovely lady arrived took the shirts and charged me £50 to iron so one night no breakfast no dinner was a £1.000 do I regret the stay NO but they need to look at what other world class hotels are doing for half the moneyRead moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
