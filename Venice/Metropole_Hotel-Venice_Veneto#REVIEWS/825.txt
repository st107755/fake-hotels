Walk out the front door and you are on the Grand Canal, 8min. walk  (10 min. when crowded) to St. Mark Sq.  Ideal location to visit the area, especially when you are there for only a short time. Lots of restaurants/cafes, unique shops, souvenirs shops etc.  Staff was very friendly and helpful even on late night arrival. Keeping in mind these are old architectural buildings, one can NOT  expect wide halls, modern large elevators and corridors.  Decor may not be to everyone's liking with its heavy drapery, dark colours etc.  But it still has modern conveniences in the room to make it very comfortable and not lacking for anything for the visit.  Fabulously clean and crisp sheets and towels. Don't miss the buffet breakfast.  Limited choices but fresh, fresh, pastries, deli, cheesesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded May 19, 2012Dear Mr "Iyn",  Thank you for your preference towards our Metropole: we are glad you enjoyed a great stay in Venice and with us!
