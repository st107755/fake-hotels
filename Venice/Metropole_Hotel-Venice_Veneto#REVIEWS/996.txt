Hotel Metropole is exceptional in every way, making it difficult to leave on our daily excursions into Venice.  It offers luxury at its best  – fabulous décor, fascinating museum-quality art collections, soft piano music, relaxed tea times and fine dining.  It is certainly a splurge to stay here and well worth it.  At the very least, stop in for afternoon tea or make a reservation for dinner at the elegant Met Restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: January 2006HelpfulShare
