Stayed here for two nights in April and it really was lovely. Hotel was full of antiques and really felt luxurious. Staff were friendly and happy to help. And the room was so comfortable. Rooms were cleaned and prepared daily. Really had a wonderful time staying here. The hotel is closely situated near St Marks square, and really is a great location over looking the lagoon. Was the perfect hotel in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
