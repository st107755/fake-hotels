First of all I must say a big thank you to all of the previous review writers your words inspired me to book this hotel and have one of the most fantastic trips I have had. As for the Hotel - WOW - beautiful room (325), with a fantastic view over  the lagoon. I took my partner as a surprise and on the first night we arrived she refused to leave the tranquil beauty of the hotel surroundings. So we moved down stairs for an evening meal in the gardens. Again fantastic with service to match, there is no attention to detail the people around you miss. One of the most original meals I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Sensational from start to finish. They even went out of there way for my partner - most people don't know where to start with a Vegan - but they did very wellâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 20051 SaveHelpfulShare
