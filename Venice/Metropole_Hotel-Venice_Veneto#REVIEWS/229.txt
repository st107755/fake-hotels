I had the pleasure of staying ar the Metropole for the second time in November of 2016. The hotel is lovely and the location is superb. Our room was clean and nicely appointed with the furniture matching the beautiful Venice experience. The breakfast was plentiful and the service was outstanding. The staff was there to help us in every way, and was so kind and accommodating, especially helpful with our 4:00 water taxi pickup. I would definitely stay here again!!!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
