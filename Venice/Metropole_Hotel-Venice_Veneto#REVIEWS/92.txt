We has a wonderful stay at the Metropole. The hotel is very 'venitian' in its decor. You feel transported to a different era. Bedrooms as roomy and comfortable with plenty of natural light. Bathrooms completely modern, with marmol and bidet. Plenty of closet space.  The Oriental bar is a delight when you are coming in tired and hot from walking around.  Breakfast out in the terrace is so beautiful, full of flowering plants and a lovely fountain. The buffet was excellent with a variety of juices and fresh fruits, pastries, cheeses and charcuterie, different breads plus eggs, sausage or bacon and smoked salmon. Coffee and tea made to order.  The best though was the staff at the front and concierge desk. So attentive, so eager to help and please. They arranged for a trip to Muranoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
