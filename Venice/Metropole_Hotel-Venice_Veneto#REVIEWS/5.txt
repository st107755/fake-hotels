This was our first trip to Venice and will not be our last. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the staff who were all so lovely across the whole duration of our stay. We were also offered an upgrade which we really appreciated. We now had a canal view which just made the whole experience so special. The hotel is beautifully decorated and spotless. It also took us less that 5 minutes to walk to St. Mark's square. The concierge were always striving to help and offered us a variety of excursions which they could book. Overall, this hotel made our stay in Venice extra special and we already plan to returnRead moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare
