The staff here were superb! Location is good on the grand canal not far from the bridge of sighs and St. Mark's square. If you want Lagoon view ask for a high room to avoid the crowd noises below.  Garden buffet breakfAst was superb and wait staff excellent. Hotel has its own water taxi stand so you do not have to lug around luggage and is also across from the public water transportation. Restaurant was ok but there are plenty of other interesting options nearby. Rooms could use updating and bed was extremely firm but bathroom was modern and spacious enough.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
