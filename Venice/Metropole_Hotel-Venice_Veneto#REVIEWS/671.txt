OK, it's Venice.  If you are not ready to splurge, and will get an ulcer over $150 gondola rides or $25 beers, go somewhere else.  But if you want the magic of Venice, and don't mind a splurge, this hotel is a great option.  Great location on Grand Canal and a short walk to Piazza San Marco.  Building dates to the 1300s and is filled with collections of interesting antiques.  Rooms are modernized and comfortable.  You will need a water taxi to arrive or leave for the airport, unless you don't mind hauling your luggage up and down several bridges.  We skipped out on the ridiculously priced meals and always ate elsewhere.  Hotel will give you a free water taxi to Murano or Burano but expect to be taken to an expensive glass factory for a tour.

It is a palace rich of history, and this is an added value to the service we offer. Yes, unfortunately Venice is a quite expensive city, yet it can offer at the same time the chance to stay in a place where important guests stayed in the past or where Antonio Vivaldi used to teach music to young girls (specifically in the venues of our Bar, which was the ancient chapel). So thank you so much for sharing this knowledge and for writing your comment. I hope to see you again in the future at the Metropole for another journey through history!  Warm regards.
