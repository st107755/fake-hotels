Our room was surprisingly spacious for a European hotel - actually, by any standards!  The hotel had such a old world feel yet was current and had all the modern accessories you might need.  The main areas were decorated in lush fabrics & were all so inviting.  The garden area was perfect for a delicious lunch with bubbles.  St. Mark's was close by yet far enough away to be removed from all the chaos.  The staff was attentive & took wonderful care of us.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
