Beautiful hotel and nice room, perfect location and good service. Few hiccups (i) smell (due to humidity) in the room but it is sometimes an issue in Venice, (ii) wifi connection was quite bad for few days but it was snowing so the bad weather could be the culprit, (iii) no English movie channels (we donâ€™t watch much TV but it might put some people off).  We had a great week overall and loved the whole atmosphere in the hotel. DO NOT take the trip to Murano. This is not from the hotel but from a factory there. They will ship you right back as soon as they realize you have no intention to cough up 10,000 EUR for a vase.... So no chance to visit Murano. This is very deceiving unless you just feel to enjoy a little cruise and still want to visit a glass factory.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
