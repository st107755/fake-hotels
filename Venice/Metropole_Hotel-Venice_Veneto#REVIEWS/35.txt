My wife and I stayed at the Metropole on a recent trip to Venice and it was fantastic. It is very well located, being just on the waterfront and a 5 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. The interior is best described as gothic, with low level lighting and lots of dark reds and blacks. I’d question whether it is truly a 5 star hotel, but make no mistake this is a luxurious boutique hotel with great staff and a character all of its own. The Oriental bar is good if not fantastic, but the real highlight was dinner at the hotel’s own restaurant - the Met, which was sublime.   If you’d like something a bit different when visiting Venice then this is highly recommended. Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
