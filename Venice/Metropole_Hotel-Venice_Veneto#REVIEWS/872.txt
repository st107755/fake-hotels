We found this hotel thru booking with EasyJet and it was fantastic!  Nothing was too much trouble.  The location was perfect (only two bridges away from St Mark’s Square) and the views across the water were fantastic. Being so close to the front and St Mark’s Square it probably wasn’t the quietest hotel we’ve ever stayed in but, we weren’t exactly hoping for a quiet country type retreat, but wanted to hear the fun of Venice.  Having said that, it wasn’t crazy and we slept very well.  The building was fantastic and I can highly recommend this hotel.  It was EXCELLENT!Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
