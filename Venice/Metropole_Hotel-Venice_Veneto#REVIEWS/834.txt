This hotel was just okay- not bad but not great.  The room was covered in red fabric from floor to ceiling and on all the furniture.  We only stayed one night and were very glad for that.  The staff was nice and catered well to our two toddlers but the decor  in the room was a bit old and tired.  Also, the air con didn't work and when you opened the one small window with no view of the alley below all you heard was people through the night.  The bathroom was okay but the bathtub did not drain (we had to use the bottle opener to prop it open to drain).  The location is very convenient so that adds a couple positive points being steps away from most sites.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Apr 17, 2012Dear Mr “Brwcrw”,  Thank you for choosing our Metropole in occasion of your recent stay in Venice.
