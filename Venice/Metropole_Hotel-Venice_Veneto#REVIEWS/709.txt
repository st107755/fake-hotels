On the plus side, this hotel has one of the best locations in Venice. 3 mins to St Mark, next to the canal. Outside and inside - a lot of character, everything is done in Venetian style  We had a standard room which was really quite small and pricey  - but I think this is the case with most Venetian hotels the room faced onto the side canal - not an amazing view, but quite charming nonetheless Service was very good, they helped us a lot with booking restaurants etc.  overall, very nice hotel, but it did not blow my mindRead moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
