Great place to stay if it is your first trip to Venice. Located right on the promenade and steps away from the Palazzo Ducale and San Marco Basilica. Room was pretty spacious and bathroom had a great soaking tub for after flight battery recharge! The hotel Bar has great selection and comfortable atmosphere. We enjoyed the inner garden every night for night caps and tranquility after a long day exploring this magical city. The hotel decor is truly Venetian and very interesting. Many little places to hide away and relax.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
