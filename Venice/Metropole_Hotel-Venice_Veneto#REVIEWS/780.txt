This was the highlight of my europe trip. The staff, the facilities the locaion all perfect.  The dining room at the rear of the hotel in the garden was gorgeous as was the luxurious bar in the front of the hotel.  The cocktails were made perfectly by delightful staff.  In fact all the staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived until we left three days later.........I could have stayed a month.  Just book it and go you won't regret it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
