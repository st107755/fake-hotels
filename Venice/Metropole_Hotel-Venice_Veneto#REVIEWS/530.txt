Not a review - more a request for assistance. We are looking forward to our stay at the Metropole early February 2015 and wondered in any of you who have stayed at the hotel could recommend "non-touristy" restaurants for lunch and dinner.  We are only there for 2 nights and its our first visit to Venice.  Any help would be greatly appreciated :-)Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
