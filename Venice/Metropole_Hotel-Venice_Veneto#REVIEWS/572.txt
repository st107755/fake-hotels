My wife and I stayed at the Metropole to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary - its a lovely oasis after the hustle and bustle of Venice and our room was very comfortable and clean. We were brought a bottle of Prosecco shortly after we arrived along with a nice note from the manager. The bed was firm but very comfortable and we were impressed that towels and bedding were changed every day. The decor is very interesting and it really is very much like being in someones private house. The breakfast was excellent and the service was superb and whilst its not cheap we were very pleased we had decided to stay there - its also in a great location for getting around the city - all in all a good choice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
