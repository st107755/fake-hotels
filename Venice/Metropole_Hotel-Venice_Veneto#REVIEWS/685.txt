We stayed here 3 nights in July,2013.  When we were checking in we overheard the concierge talking on the phone concerning a rooftop suite.  We inquired in a joking friendly way & were upgraded to this amazing suite with access to a rooftop deck with fantastic panoramic views of the Grand Canal.  (And we discovered when we were checking out, at no extra cost !).  All staff were very courteous & friendly.  Nothing was lacking in the complimentary breakfast buffet. And this hotel was easily within walking distance of San Marco Square & other points of interest.  We definitely had no complaints with this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 10, 2013Dear "Suzanne E", on the part of my Reception team I wish to thank you for appreciating their courtesy and attention.
