Old fashioned hotel centrally located near st marks and looking out over the lagoon. Helpful friendly staff, excellent buffet breakfast included but slightly disappointing rooms. Drinks in the bar expensive. Receptionists were excellent particularly with recommendations and reconfirming reservations etcRead moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
