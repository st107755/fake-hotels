We recently spent 4 nights at this hotel.  It is like walking back into a different time.  The staff were all well presented and courteous, service was excellent.  Our room looked old fashioned however the furnishings were all quality and the bed was very comfortable.  It was also lovely to return in the evening and the room and bathroom had been refreshed.  We only had breakfast in the hotel but that could be taken indoors or in the garden.  The buffet was of a high standard and the coffee with hot milk was excellent and plentiful. Room service was also very efficient.  This is definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in and would certainly return if going to Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
