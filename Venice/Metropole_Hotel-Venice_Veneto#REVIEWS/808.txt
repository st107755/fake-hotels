The elegant surroundings and museum quality decor make this conveniently located hotel a great place to stay in Venice.  Two blocks from San Marco square on the lagoon, and with a private canal entrance for water taxis, they offer comfortable and well appointed rooms along with excellent service. Physically, the Metropole might best be describe as a "boutique hotel" by U.S. standards.   Be sure to take a few moments and enjoy the various interior design elements and eclectic collections not only in the lobby but in the staircase and on each floor and hallway. The hotel garden and breakfast area is a delightful retreat from the city and tourist street noise.    The hotel food is expensive, even by Venician standards, but the food is also excellent and well presented.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
