I just returned from Venice and stayed at the beautiful Metropole Hotel. Loved the bilingual attendants at the front desk. We were also admitted to our room early, which was a real plus.  Being American there is always a problem traveling to Europe and their outlets. However at the Metropole I had no problem plugging in my curling iron and not plowing the sockets. I could also plug in my cell phone charger. That is huge. It is a lovely boutique hotel that is centrally located so that you can walk everywhere. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Venice for a few days to see all the beautiful landmarks the city has to offer.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
