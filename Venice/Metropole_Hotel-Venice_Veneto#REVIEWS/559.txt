This hotel is very Venetian, and has a huge amount of character.  The public spaces are lovely and very peaceful and relaxing, especially the citrus garden, which is the perfect place to relax with a drink, after some hectic sightseeing.  The location is great, opposite the Grand canal, but a few steps down from St marks Square, so it is not crowded outside the hotel entrance.  The various water buses,etc, are very close by.  The hotel has a very individual style, and not for those who want a bland modern, could be anywhere in the world hotel.  This is for people who appreciate the history of Venice, and the opportunity to stay in a hotel with so much history and character.  We loved it, and found the various collections interesting, especially the fans.  The rooms are smallerâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
