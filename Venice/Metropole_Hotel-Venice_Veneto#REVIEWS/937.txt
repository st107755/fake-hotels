We recently spent four nights in this extremely well run and centrally located hotel. Room 401 has to the one to get as it has a rooftop balcony with views over the lagoon although in March it was a bit chilly to sit out.   The hotel is full of antiques which I found a bit overbearing but the facilities were first class and the breakfast buffet could keep you going all day.  We went on a package which included a water taxi from Marco Polo Airport to the door of the hotel and back, I'm pleased this was included as a familiar sight in Venice is tourists pulling suitcases on wheels trying to follow a little map to their hotel!Read moreDate of stay: March 20091 SaveHelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Asst.
