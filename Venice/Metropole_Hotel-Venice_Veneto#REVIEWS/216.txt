My husband and I stayed for 3 nights , firstly the location must simply be on of the best! Step straight out unto the Grand Canal , we had a front facing room which gave us spectacular views , just fab!! We had breakfast each morning included in the price & for continental there was most certainly something for everyone . Bacon & eggs , to fresh fruits and yogurt , beautifully laid out. As with any 5 star the staff were extremely attentive they knew our room number within being there one day so we didn't have to ask collecting our key , its the small touches. Room was fab, location fab , staff fab could find no fault at all. Perfect would def stay againRead moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare
