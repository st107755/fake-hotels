Stayed at the Metropole, Venice in September 2019.   This was our fist time in Italy, so my husband and I had lots of questions.  The hotel staff was amazing answering questions and arranging a walking tour for the day we arrived.   The room was very clean and a comfortable bed.   Location had easy access to everything we wanted to see.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
