We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and upgraded to a deluxe room at the front of the hotel which had windows opening at the front directly onto the main Canal area and also the side on to a smaller canal. We arrived by private boat transfer which was a wonderful experience and you're greeted by the concierge who very quickly arranged for our luggage to be transferred straight to the room.   The breakfast was very pleasant, all of the staff were extremely helpful including the concierge who arranged a free private boat trip to the island of Murano.   I would highly recommend this hotel, the only tip I would give people going to Venice is to make sure they carry lots of tissues because there are lots of seagulls and pigeons on the inevitable will happen!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
