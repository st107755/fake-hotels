The Metropole has a fantastic location just a few steps from St. Marks square and right on the waterfront. It has older style but somehow still manages to feel contemporary and up to date.

We do compensate the small dimensions of the room with the precious decorations and period furniture in each room and in the common areas, as you saw. Next time you come to Venice I wil be more than glad to check for a larger room and welcome you personally.  My kindest regards.
