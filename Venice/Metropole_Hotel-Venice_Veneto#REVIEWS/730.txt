We have just returned after 5 nights at this lovely hotel.  It isn't cheap, but then neither is Venice, however it is elegant and very convenient aswell as being clean, friendly and stylish.  The array of whiskies are well worth trying and you can be sure of gentle, respectful service from the bar staff who really look after you and ensure your comfort.  The restaurant serves beautiful food (but at a price).  Try for one of the rooms in the older part of the hotel for additional elegance and size.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
