I think that this is my favorite hotel of all time.  Every request was granted, almost like magic.  Private boat tour?  Done.  Handicapped transportation?  A wheelchair ramp appeared immediately, and remained for the duration of our visit. We booked a standard room, and it had a view of the canal. The hotel itself is like a museum, with fascinating collections up winding staircases. I wish I could have seen every room.  We booked on their website, and the fabulous breakfast buffet was included. We finished every night with drinks in their bar or their cozy lounge, talking with the bartenders.  Can't wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
