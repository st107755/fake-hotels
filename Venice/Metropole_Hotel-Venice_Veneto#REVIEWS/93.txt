This hotel is old school. Antiques in hallways, antique looking furniture, red velvet wall paper and bed covers. All done in a good way. The staff was the  best we experienced on our two week vacation. From the bellman, waiters, waitresses, concierge...everyone! Breakfast was in a beautiful area where you could eat inside or outside. Breakfast items very varied and excellent. Location couldn't be better. Five minute walk to San Marco Square. Vaparetto stops right in front. Plenty of restaurants nearby. They even supplied us with a speed boat for our trip to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
