This hotel is just 5 minutes away from San Marco square. So far the positive things. Breakfast is pretty expensive (30€ !) but don't be tempted to take the cheaper version for 10€ : one coffee,a glass of juice and one (just one !) very tiny roll. A real rip-off. Beware if they send you on a free boat trip to Murano. This is a tourist trap and they will try to sell you very expensive glass works (up to 12,000€ and more !!!). Is this still allowed anno 2013 ?Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
