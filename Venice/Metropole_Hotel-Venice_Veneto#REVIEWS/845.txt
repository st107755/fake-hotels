My husband & 2 kids stayed there in August 2011. It was an excellent location walking 5 mi nutes to St. Mark's Square. Staff was very kind. Rooms were large & clean, plenty of room for all 4 of us. Bathroom was clean & spacious. Breakfast was delicious. We only had 1 night there after we came off of our 12 night cruise but wished that we had more and would definitely come again. The front desk arranged a private water taxi & a driver for our bags once we got there for us to go to the airport the next day which was very helpful. Loved everything about it & it exceeded my expectations.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
