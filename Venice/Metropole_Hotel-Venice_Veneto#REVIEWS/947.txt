I would suggest everyone to stay here. Far away from the crowd of St.Marks Sq. but at the same time 2 blocks away from it (better to say 2 bridges away from it). Great room (I got  a Junior suite with a view on the lagoon and a wonderful terrace).  Great service, quick and helpful. I am a travel agent and I would definitely advise to stay here. Rooms are big for the Italian standard.   The Hotel has the only 1 star Michelin restaurant in the city of Venice. Tip, it also has a private pier for the motorlaunches to dock.   The style can also not meet everyone's taste. kinda Museum lobby.   Definitely thumbs up.Read moreDate of stay: February 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
