Stayed for 2 nights in February. Excellent hotel - service fantastic, very relaxing atmosphere and everything you need in room. Location 5 minutes from St Markâ€™s was great and lots of excellent restaurants and bars within short walk. Only thing, is they donâ€™t have irons in the rooms and do not supply them but offer an ironing service instead! Breakfast was excellent lots of choice and even hot option if you wanted it. Would definitely stay here again ðŸ˜ƒRead moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
