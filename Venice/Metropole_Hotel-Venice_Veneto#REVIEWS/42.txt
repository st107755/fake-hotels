What a beautiful slice of Venetian perfection!! The rooms are plush and comfortable and feel Venetian. Our room was beautiful, all the public rooms were exquisite, the garden area was sublime.  To top it off, at every turn we found the service at The Metropole Hotel made us feel important and special.  Our breakfast each morning was an amazing spread and the staff remembered each morning what we preferred for our morning beverage.  It's just nice to have those details remembered!Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
