The metropole is very well located. Itâ€™s 5 mins from st marks square and there are lots of places to eat close by. So I have good and bad things to say. While some of the people who work there are very friendly and nice like Alessandro who was at the bar and all the people at the breakfast buffet.There are also a few that are very rude. The rooms are a bit dark and dingy. Unfortunately you always remember the bad stuff before the good. So if I ever do go to Venice I may try another hotel. Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
