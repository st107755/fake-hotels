AMAZING!!! Best hotel and staff I've ever met in ANY hotel ANYWHERE! They are all polite, friendly, and willing to help with any of your needs. Best part is the drinks in the bar are made with fresh fruit and the breakfast is of super high quality with eating on an outside terrace. Also, free taxi rides to and from Murano via a private taxi launch deck on the side of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
