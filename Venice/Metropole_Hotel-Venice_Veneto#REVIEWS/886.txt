We just returned from a delightful 4 days in Venice. My daughter and her husband and her 3 young children stayed at the Hotel Metropole.  It was delightful.  Great location, near San Marco convenient for catching pigeons, lovely friendly staff,  bus ferries stop directly in front of hotel....most of all a wonderful spacious 'family bedroom' with 2 king beds, a sofa and room to play on the floor.  I stayed in the 4 person 'family room' with the 3 kids.  Really recommend this hotel for families.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
