This hotel would be a 3/5 if it was in Rome or Florence but there are such slim pickings in Venice, that this place actually stands out. Service is great, rooms are not. Awful wallpaper, outdated carpets and eerie wall art line the halls and rooms of this place. The front desk crew is amazing, friendly and eager to help. The manager even sent us a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon stay!   Restaurant is fantastic, exceptional service with a really good breakfast. Gluten free bread served warm and fresh.   The restaurant is clean and classy and modern set in a little outdoor garden area. Huge contrast to the main hotel area that is dark has lots of velvet and low hanging curtains. The room key is attached to a very heavy decorative key chain and they ask you to turn it inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
