We celebrated our 15 year wedding anniversary at the Metropole and we were not disappointed. Expensive - yes, but worth every penny. Upgraded on arrival and bottle of prosecco in our room when we checked in. Incredibly unique room with a beautiful bathroom. Top notch! The garden area, the oriental bar were fantastic too. Highly recommend this hotel to be well looked after. If we ever return, we will be returning to the Metropole! Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
