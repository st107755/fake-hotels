I am glad you enjoyed our Junior Suite with the terrace, it is one of the most required room exactely for the view you have from the "altana". I suggest you to come back in summer, in the occasion of the Redentore celebration (third Saturday of July). From that same room you will enjoy a spectacular view of the night fireworks - for which Venice is renowned all over the world - in the comfort of your room. Believe me, the experience is unfogettable. I will share your coment with all my staff, meanwhile thank you so much for your time.  Kindest regards.
