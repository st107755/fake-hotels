Our family of four spent 2 nights here recently.  We arrived by water taxi and right away fell in love the Venice and the hotel.  It is in a great location.  Our family room was large and palatial.  The staff treated us like royalty.  We had happy hour at the hotel and it was very chic.  The staff gave great recommendations for restaurants.  The food in Venice was amazing and cheap!  The cruise ship crowds were overwhelming during the day.  We escaped to back canals and the Zattein areas from 10-4.  We took the free water taxi from the hotel to the Merino glass island.  It was interesting, but be prepared for a sales person to try to sell you a large glass item.  We would return and stay here.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
