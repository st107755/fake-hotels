Tripadvisor featured a poor review of the staff at this hotel and we were a it nervous about taking an elderly friend there. What we found could not have been more different from the 'rude staff' reported by a previous visitor. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly - always ready to provide information or help, and smiling and charming. They went out of their way to make sure that everyone in our party was looked after. Maybe the previous reviewer found the hotel on a bad day? We'll definitely be going back!Read moreHelpfulShare
