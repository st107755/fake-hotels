We constantly keep under observation each detail of our hotel with its preciousness given by the history at its back, enhanced by really lot of details in line with the refinement of its venues, such as our antiques collections but also the period furniture in all the rooms.   With this in mind, it is essential for us to offer to our Guest the right balance between a high quality service and the coherence and linearity with this kind of ambience.  Yet your comment is sincere and helpful, and it will be extremely useful for me to double check our rooms and to improve their style and comfort.  Let me hope to have you again at the Metropole at your next stay in June, I would be glad to show you how much we care about our Guests and their holiday. Kindest regards.
