What a wonderful stay we had well positioned only 3 bridges away from St Marks Square.  The hotel is hundreds of years old but beautifully presented with richly decorated rooms that were large and very comfortable.  The foyer is to die for with  traditional mosaic flooring and marble columns off of the private jetty for guests arrival and departures. The breakfast offerings were delightful and I have written a separate review on the Met Restaurant worthy of a visit.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
