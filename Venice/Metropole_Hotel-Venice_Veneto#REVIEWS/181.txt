Great Hotel & staff very helpful, beautiful setting on the Canal if a little busy, therefore in walking and vaporetto distance to everything. we travelled to Venice to see the Damien Hirst exhibition at two venues and were not disappointed great stuff. Venice has already been written to death about and I don't have any more to add to that other than take out a second mortgage!! back to the Hotel - we had a special anniversary meal in the wonderful restaurant and they went that extra mile for us and made it a wonderful experience, we had the tasting menu and I cannot praise it high enough. would we go back...... in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
