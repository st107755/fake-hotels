We arrived by speedboat and we were very impressed with Venice and the hotel. Its full of character, a very old building with a fascinating history, apparently Vivaldi stayed here and gave music lessons! Our room was red, the walls were red, the carpets were red and the four poster bed was adorned with red bedding but weirdly instead of feeling like a womb it was charming, maybe it was because it was so old and quirky. Very different from the usual 5 star hotels but I am glad we chose it. The location is excellent, on the Grand Canal and very near the Biennale and Arsenale which was why we were there. The Met restaurant is lovely and deserves its michelin star. We would definitely go back again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
