We loved this quaint hotel in the heart of Venice. Just a few minutes walk to St Marks Square and the Doges Palace right on the canal. The hotel has its own jetty and was really convenient as we had arrived in a water taxi from a cruise ship. The very obliging staff were there to meet us and we were into our room in a flash, even though we arrived early. The hotel is traditional and quirky as it is decorated with fantastic antiques.  We took the free water taxi to the island of Murano where we purchased the world famous blown glass items.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from MetropoleVeniceItaly, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 12, 2016Dear "Joana1969", thank you so much for taking the time to write your nice comment.  I am really glad you enjoyed your stay at the Metropole and that you appreciated our antiques on display. You know, the antiques collections are what make me most proud because they were started by my parents and they are the result of long and accurate research. We couldn't keep them for ourselves, we felt we had to share them with our Guests. And this is how our Gallery was born! If you come again to the Metropole it will be my pleasure to personally show you our pieces and tell you the amazing stories behind. Thank you again. Warmest regards.
