Metropole was a great homebase for Venice - only 5 minutes or less off of  St Marks Square and right on the main strip - but not too noisy - and great service - concierge was excellent - funky decor but comfy and a cool restaurant - again a bit avante garde and a little pricey. Our only complaint was a loud neighbor in the room next door - but the second night was no problem.Read moreDate of stay: September 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
