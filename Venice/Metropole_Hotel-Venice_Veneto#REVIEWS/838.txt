The Metropole Hotel is perfectly situated within yards of the lagoon, the vaporetto stations and easy walking distance from the famous square of San Marco,   The Staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful and made you feel as if you had been going there for years and deserving of special attention.  All the bustle of Venice is outside the front door, but the minute that you step inside, all is calm and cool.    The restaurant has two Michelin Stars and check out the absolutely charming courtyard garden where meals can be served in summer.  Arrive by water taxi from the airport, wind your way along narrow canals and step into another world!.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from ChiaraVis, Direttore vendite at Metropole HotelResponded Mar 30, 2012Dear Mrs Alison,  Thank you for your recent stay with us: we are happy to understand you enjoyed your time in Venice and at our charming Metropole!
