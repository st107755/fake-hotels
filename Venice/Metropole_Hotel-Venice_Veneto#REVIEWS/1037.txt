We loved this friendly and well turned out hotel.   Booked it on the basis of the reviews found on this site and found it to be even better than expected - we had a Junior suite for a good price and the hotel restaurant was the best place that we dined in over our three night stay - both outside and in - better even than the Gritti Palace food.  Wouldn't worry too much about having a room with a view as the rooms are smaller and windows at side don't give a panoramic view - for same price it's much better to swap for a suite which is what we ended up doing.  A great way to spend a romantic weekend - we'll be back for sure!!! Read moreHelpfulShare
