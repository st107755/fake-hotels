Stayed here for my birthday. When we booked we asked for a nice quiet room. Arrived to be told they had upgraded us to a suite. Amazing, so opulent.Only set back no in room coffee tea etc although they will supply if you request. This is a wonderful hotel with very professional staff who work hard to make sure your stay is excellent. We cannot wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
