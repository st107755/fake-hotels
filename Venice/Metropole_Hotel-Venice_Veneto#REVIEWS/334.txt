Our visit was only a short one, only a single night before heading south to Bologna. But what a fabulous impression the Metropole and its staff made from the moment we arrived until we checked out the following morning. Our room was luxuriosuly furnished and appointed, and the bathroom was huge by European standards. The hotel's Oriental Bar is a tranquil sanctuary from the hoards of tourists Venice hosts, and the staff here are just a attentive as those at reception. Breakfast in the courtyard is relaxed and serene - and yet again serviced by lovely staff. The Metropole impressed on so many levels in such a short period of time - it was a beautiful experience.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
