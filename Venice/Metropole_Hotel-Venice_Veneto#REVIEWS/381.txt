My girlfriend and I arrived via private water taxi from the airport straight to the canal entrance of the hotel. As soon as we stepped off the boat, we were taken back by the luxurious Venetian look and feel to the hotel which was decorated with the most incredible collection of antiques.  After checking in at the desk we were escorted to our room by the receptionist and the hotel porter kindly brought our luggage to us. Our room was simply amazing. The decor was elegant and traditional, room was filled with amenities, very comfortable bed with soft pillows and we were luckily enough allocated a room overlooking the canal.  The walls however were very thin, as a result of this we could hear people speaking in both rooms neighbouring us on each side which interrupted our sleep.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
