You can love this hotel or hate it.  Nice "old fashioned" European hotel near St. Marks... if that is where you want to be.  We prefer to avoid the crowds.  The Metropole Hotel offers many types of accommodations that come with a steep price.  Our stay was pleasant, starting off the morning with a nice buffet breakfast in the garden.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
