I booked my stay many weeks early on expedia, and by the time I got their prices had skyrocketed. As a result, I expected to be put in a cubbyhole of a room.  (I had booked Classic Double for single use.)  Instead, I was given a huge room with king bed, foyer area, and beautiful furnishings.  That came along with two personalized notes from the guest room manager welcoming me.  The air conditioning worked perfectly, which was needed!  And contrary to some earlier posts, wifi is available -- free -- in rooms and I had no trouble at all connecting.  The staff is superb.  Both completely professional and yet very friendly.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
