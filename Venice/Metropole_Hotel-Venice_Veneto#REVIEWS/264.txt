We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights -- September 2016.  This hotel is beautifully decorated, brings you back in time.  The room was spacious and great.  The breakfast in the garden was lovely and the service at breakfast was great.    One point to mention, the customer service and the hotel staff are truly there to make your stay memorable.  They gave great recommendations and when they feel that you are not happy -- they work extremely hard to find ways to make your experience memorable.  The entire staff was incredibly friendly and helpful -- and Massimo and Giuliano at the Concierge desk were tremendous.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.  Would absolutely come back!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
