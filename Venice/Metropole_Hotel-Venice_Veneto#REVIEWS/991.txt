After reading trip advisor and all of the reviews, we chose the Metropole and were thoroughly satisfied with the accommodations. We stayed in room 249, a small suite, very peaceful, overlooking a canal. The furnishings were lovely and comfortable; the bathroom was spacious, modern and clean; the closet was a walk-in, with plenty room for luggage. The staff went out of their way to be helpful, and were always pleasant. The complimentary breakfasts were terrific.   Our only disappointment was with the dinner menu in the hotel's restaurant. What was dubbed a "creative kitchen," to us seemed pretentious and unappetizing. Read moreDate of stay: March 2006HelpfulShare
