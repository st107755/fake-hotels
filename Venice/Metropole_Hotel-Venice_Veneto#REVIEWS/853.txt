We travel to venice once or twice a year for 10 years partly because of the Metropole hotel. It has a glorious view and is located very close to the historic center yet not so much crowded. The hotel an impressive collection of antiques. It has also very elegant and charming decorium with unique furniture and antique pieces. The staff is very kind and you feel the elegant luxury at every step in the hotel. You'll love it.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
