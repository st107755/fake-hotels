I won a trip at my old place at work and chose this hotel as I had a large budget, I wasn't that impressed.  The venue was lovely, but the staff could have been friendlier, they seemed a little snooty and as though they looked down on you and expected you to have lots of money. The facilities were lovely though, breakfast was amazing a gorgeous buffet that you could eat in a beautiful courtyard. A great location.  The room was a good standard.  Quite dark, but a huge bed and lovely en suite.  I wouldn't personally do there again, but for people that like that kind of hotel I'm sure they would be very happy with it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
