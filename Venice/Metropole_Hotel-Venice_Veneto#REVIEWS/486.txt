Location is perfect - even too perfect. Room were very small and there is nothing fancy inside the room. Decoration of hotel ecpesially in corridors and lobby is very old and dusty - like outside our room there was a glasscabinet full of crusifixes. Not very nice.  Worst thing was service which you hardly noticed - because there wheren't any. Every time I went thru lobby I practically had to wake the receptionist.  Breakfast thou was very nice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
