This place was absolutely gorgeous. I could not fault any detail. The service was impeccable in every area. We booked a deluxe room and we were upgraded to a suite. Not all rooms have great views so you would have to request that in advance. The property was stunning, eclectic, and intimate - from the room to the lounge to the garden. It's a few doors down from the Danieli, which we visited, but having visited both now the Metropole is absolutely my top choice for a more lush, intimate, eclectic vibe without millions of tourists coming into the lobby to check it out. The bar, where Vivaldi allegedly wrote the Four Seasons, is very cool and the bartender makes a wicked cocktail!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
