We stayed at the Metropole Hotel to celebrate a big birthday, the whole experience was truly outstanding from check in to departure. I can't praise the staff enough, they were all so attentive, helpful and pleasant in every way. We ate in the Michelin star restaurant, the food was exquisite and the service was wonderful. The Hotel is in a great location for everything you want to see in Venice .Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
