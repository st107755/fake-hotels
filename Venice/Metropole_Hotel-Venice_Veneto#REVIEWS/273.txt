Stayed 5 nights in May 2016. Our Suite was large and hotel location is excellent (no arguing there) but the rooms are old with heavy drape curtains and carpeting which made our stay a nightmare having to rely continually on allergy (antihistamine) medication with maximum dosage. Also the rooms are not clean and bathroom tub had soap scum all over. Other than that the hotel has a historic charm and the food at the bar is very good. Overall, if you have allergy then avoid by all means and look for a modern hotel in Venice which is hard to find.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from Valentina T, Proprietario at Metropole HotelResponded Sep 16, 2016Dear "Mufa69", I wish to thank you for taking the time to write your comment on Tripadvisor, and I am really sorry to read your stay at our Hotel did not completely satisfied your expectancies.  Cleanliness for me is vital, I am always extremely attentive and severe about the way a lounge, a room, a single bathroom is cleaned and perfecty in order. Therefore I am really mortified and surprised to find that in this case this aspect has not received the right attention. Believe me, this is absolutely not our standard, ad I will make and important double-check to find what has gone in the wrong way. I do hope to have  you again at the Metropole in order to show you that our Hotel is a place that doesn't leave room to disappointment. Thank you again for your time.  Kind regards.
