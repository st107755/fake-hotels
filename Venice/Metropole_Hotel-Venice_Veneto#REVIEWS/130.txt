We booked the Metropole to celebrate a special birthday and despite the torrential downpour which accompanied our arrival (and rather spoilt the transfer via the Grand Canal), from the moment we alighted at the private dock, this hotel was a delight. A lovely room, helpful and attentive staff - particularly so in the bar, and beautifully decorated. If there is a better hotel in Venice that must be really something as the atmosphere here was intimate and very special. The hotel is ideally placed for exploring Venice either on foot or by water taxi from the side door. Overall, not cheap but worth it. Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
