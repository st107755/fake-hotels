This was my second stay at the Metropole and it was even better the second time.  The staff are attentive and charming.  We were welcomed by Aurelio Bon who immediately made us feel comfortable and wasted no time in getting us to our room and a welcome fruit plate and chocolates - just the thing to revive weary travelers.  Being at the Metropole is like being in a museum with its many collections of unique objects on display throughout the hotel.  I recommend the hotel's Oriental bar for great atmosphere and basic food throughout the day.  Want to feel like you left your day to day world...check into the Metropole for a fantasy you won't forget.  Thank you Metropole for yet another enchanting stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
