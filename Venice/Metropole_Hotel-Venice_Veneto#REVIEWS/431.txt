We stayed here in August, the location of the hotel is second to none. It is close to all the busy areas full of restaurants but just far enough out it is nice and quiet. We really enjoyed our time here, the rooms are beautifully decorated, large and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. My only complaint would be that the room wasn't ready at the allocated check in time and we had to busy ourselves for a few hours before we could get in and get changed after our flight etc. Also the lovely Michelin star restaurant couldn't cater for my dietary requirements (coeliac and no meat) which is a shame as it looked lovely.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
