We selected this hotel based upon Tripadvisor feedback and I have to say that it wasn't what we expected.  I should mention first that I have not stayed at other Venice hotels and in this area of Venice it must be difficult to find hotels that don't have to deal with very old buildings. I have stayed at hotels in Europe and South America.  The location is great off the Grand Canal with a side canal also since it's on the corner and a private hotel boat dock.  The location is very convenient to St. Mark's Square.  The history of the building is interesting with the various collections.  We liked the historic feeling of the hotel.  The breakfast was very good for an included breakfast.  If you are checking out early they will leave a side table with some orange juice and coffeeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
