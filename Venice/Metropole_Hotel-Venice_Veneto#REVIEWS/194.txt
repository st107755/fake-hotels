Located super far away from Venice central. Bad wifi. Rooms very dated. Breakfast is shockingly bad. Yes cheap but this is not a hostel but hostel standard.    Mum and I went and stayed 2 nights. Not really much else to say other than disappointed.   On a good note staff were friendly. Read moreDate of stay: May 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
