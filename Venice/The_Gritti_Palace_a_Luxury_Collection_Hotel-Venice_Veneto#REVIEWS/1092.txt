I'm not sure if hotels get much better than this. Located on the Grand Canal it's the perfect location to get around Venice. The service is superb but discrete and never overly fussy. The concierge service is outstanding: friendly, helpful and attentive. The hotel has been beautifully restored and the decoration amazing. Our room was really beautiful and made us feel very special.  The public rooms are all very beautiful and the bar and restaurant wonderful. We used the Private Transfer service from and to the Airport, fairly expensive but you arrive and depart in great style. We would love to return and have no reservations in highly recommending it.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
