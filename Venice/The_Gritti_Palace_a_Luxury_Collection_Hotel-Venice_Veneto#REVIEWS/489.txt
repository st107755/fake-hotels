I got blown away by the service and stay at this hotel. All the travel and status came to good use as we got a nice upgrade to a great suite. A suite at this hotel is palatial and you will get a majestic feeling by the end of the day. I would highly recommend room number 210. It has a great view. Thank you Gabrielle for taking care of us when we arrived late night.  We got up to a nice sunny day and the breakfast right on the water was memorable. We only got out of the hotel for a Venice view by 1 p.m in the afternoon. This is one SPG hotel that you would want to keep coming back to again and again. A BIG thank you from everyone in family.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 14, 2017Dear Guest,  As valued SPG members, we are pleased that you appreciated our bespoke services and the warm welcome received by Gabriele, who thanks you for your special mention.
