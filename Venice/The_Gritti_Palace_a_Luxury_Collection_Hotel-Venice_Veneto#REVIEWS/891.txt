we spent one night in the Serenissima suite.  It was as expected, sumptuous and spectacularly decorated and very quiet.  also great service from all the staffs.  we were offered a standard room to shower and rest while waiting for the suite to be clean.  the standard room was also richly decorated and spacious.  breakfast on the deck looking out to the canal was very special.  would love to stay here if in the area again and with money to splurge.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
