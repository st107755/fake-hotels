This is a lovely hotel, and very charming.  The staff are warm and friendly, while also being professional and efficient.  This hotel is recently renovated, and no expense was spared.  There are wonderful art and history books in the lobby.  The terrace restaurant has an amazing view, and quick service.  There is a hallway on the lobby level that features photos of the many celebrities who have stayed there, some with personal notes.  The rooms are so pretty, and the baths are luxurious.  We chose a mid-priced room and still had a view of the grand canal.  There is a traghetto stop and gondola service right beside the hotel.  La Fenice and St. Marc's (and the luxury shopping area) are a very short walk away.  La Salute and the Peggy Guggenheim are directly across the canalâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
