We stayed at the Gritti Palace for our honeymoon at the beginning of November 2013. The hotel itself is one of the most beautiful places in the world. We looked at numerous other hotels in Venice and are so glad that we decided to stay at the Gritti. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we felt felt at home and nothing was too much trouble for the concierge. We cannot wait to return to the Gritti in the very near future.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
