Hotel itself is very nice. Location is excellent. Problem is the food. Prices are exorbitant and the quality sub par. My dinner cost over 300 euros. Soup was so BLAND it was tasteless. Main course was a pasta, nice but definitely not worth €50. Deserts though good ranged from €20 ~ €40. Overall a HUGE disappointment for their restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Oct 2, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having privileged The Gritti when you selected our magical city as destination and for having shared your impressions with us all.
