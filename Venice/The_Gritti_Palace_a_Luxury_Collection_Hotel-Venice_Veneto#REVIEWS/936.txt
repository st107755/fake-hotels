It is not often you stay at a place as good as this. Some high end places can be stuffy and pretentious, not this hotel. It justifies its prime position with great rooms, fantastic staff and a deck with one of the best views in the world. We had two rooms for three nights. Both rooms were different, both superb. There was wine in our room on arrival,  and mineral water delivered to the room during the day. If you are only staying for a night I would definitely book the breakfast, but it is hard to justify for the length of time we were staying. We did order room service breakfast for one when one of the squad was not feeling well, and there was just about enough for four. Wifi is free (nice for a luxury hotel). Water taxi is the best way to travel to and from the airport.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
