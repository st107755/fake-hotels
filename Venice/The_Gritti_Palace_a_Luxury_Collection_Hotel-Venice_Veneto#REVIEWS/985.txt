The rooms are amazing - ours was the 4th level category (~1500/night).  The property is reasonably well located for visiting sights.  The patio is fantastic as was the breakfast.  I thought 50 eu for breakfast was a lot, but I think it was actually worth it.  The room was very quiet, possibly due to the padded walls, large, and comfortable.  My main complaint is that the concierge sent us to a lousy place for dinner.  It really felt like this place catered to people with 7 figure incomes and he was not about to waste any time on a (comparative) pauper like me.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
