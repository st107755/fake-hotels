The Gritti Palace is a charming hotel, which delighted us more than a title. A beautiful room decorated with taste, do not spare their time to make this place a paradise on earth and kitchen not to be missed. The place is wonderful, but what remains of our stay it is especially those thousand and one attention and these meetings. The rooms are sumptuous and elegant. Fantastic interior decors and I was watching them the whole night. I was able to watch the magnificent Punta Della. The bathrooms were neat and cleanly maintained. What else you can get more than this?Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
