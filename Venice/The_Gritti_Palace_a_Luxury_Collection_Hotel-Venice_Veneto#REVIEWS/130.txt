Stayed for 3 nights in the La Fenice suite at the Gritti.  The hotel staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful, showing us around the property and explaining the history of the hotel upon check in.  They were even nice enough to have a chilled bottle of champagne, strawberries, and fresh roses waiting for us in the room when we arrived.  The suite was magnificent, beautifully decorated in period furnishings but with all the modern amenities you would expect of an expensive hotel.   My wife particularly appreciated the radiant floors and oversized soaking tub in the bathroom.  We could have just stayed in the room for the entire trip and been happy!Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
