We stayed for the weekend as a family and it will be a stay that we will never forget . The welcoming when we arrived by water taxi was perfect and staff were so helpful and polite. We were shown to our room which was exquisite with beautiful decor , beautiful linen and the most comfortable bed. Breakfast was delicious and our family dinner was something I will always remember.
