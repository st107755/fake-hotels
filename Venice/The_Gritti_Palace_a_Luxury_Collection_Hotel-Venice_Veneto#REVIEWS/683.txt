We stayed at the Gritti Palace w a group of strangers who assembled to drive from Venice to Montecarlo in 38 super cars. Ferrari's. Lamborghini's and Porsche's.   The Gritti Palace service is buying fabulous. Everything was great start to finish. Food. Drink. Tour. Concierge. Everyone was very helpful. The room was beautiful and architecturally beautiful.   Venice is a magical and romantic visit. I can't say enough good things about the people and the city. Magic. Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
