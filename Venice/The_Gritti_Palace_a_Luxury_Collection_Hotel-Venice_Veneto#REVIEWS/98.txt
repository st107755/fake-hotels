I am a titanium elite member of Marriott's Bonvoy. Booked 3 nights at The Gritti Palace in early June 2019 and in this both instances, I was denied of my privilege:   1) Suite nights - tried to use my suite nights but wasn't granted.   2) I went to my friend's room and realised that they had Aqua de Parma toiletteries throughout their stay whereas my room, it was a different set of shower gel, shampoo, body lotion and hair conditioner.   Why such double standards, I wonder?

Given your status, you are surely aware that a Suite Night Award is a one-night confirmable upgrade to a standard suite, or select premium room, depending on the hotelâ€™s availability of those rooms.  The upgrade availability is automatically checked starting five days prior to arrival to one day prior to arrival.   During current month we are running on a very high occupancy, consequently, your Suite Night Award was denied and the award returned to your Account.  With regards to the bath amenities, we are sorry to inform you that this issue is beyond our control.   In fact, we have recently run out of stock of Acqua di Parma products due to the lack of delivery from the manifacturer (for their internal understandable reasons) and had to replace them temporarily with different ones.  Please be assured that we will reinstate Acqua di Parma in all accommodations as soon as it will be possible.   We trust we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back and become your favorite hotel in Venice.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
