Location location , a beautiful traditional luxury hotel. .. A beautiful luxury hotel with exceptional staff.  The terrace overlooks the Grand Canal with the location hard to beat.   It is a 15-20 Walk to the Rialto Bridge and is far enough away to avoid the crowds.  A few minutes walk and you will be at the Luxury shopping district in the main square.  I will definitely return.   Don't forget to try the Bellini on the terrace.  Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
