The Gritti Palace is superb.  Service is generally great (though the concierge was occasionally a bit gruff, and unhelpful), location perfect - just far enough away from St. Mark's to reduce the crowds, and rooms utterly sumptuous.  We had drinks at the outdoor lounge each evening, which was very special as it overlooks the Grand Canal but never ate in the hotel otherwise.  Acqua Di Parma toiletries are a special treat.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
