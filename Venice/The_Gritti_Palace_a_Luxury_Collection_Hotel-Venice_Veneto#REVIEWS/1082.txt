You are right: The Gritti Palace indeed represents one of the most prestigious addresses in Venice and it still retains all of the qualities of the “old world” being meanwhile up-to-date. Its location is undoubtedly privileged, as you mentioned: directly on the Grand Canal, at walking distance to all major attractions and yet in a quiet and exclusive area.  We are glad that the positive impression you had reported from the contacts with us prior to your arrival was reinforced and enhanced by the interaction you had with the staff during your stay. Every team member is proud of your comments, especially Giovanni!   We look forward to taking care of you once again and to offer you other amazing and memorable moments.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
