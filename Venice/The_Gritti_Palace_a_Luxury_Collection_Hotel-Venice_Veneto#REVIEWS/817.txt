The hotel is a small boutique hotel with amazing service.  From check in to check out everything was perfect. We chose to stay there for our New Years celebration, and they party was on.  Our room on the small canal was beautiful, immaculate with every convience needed.  Using Aqua di Parma as their amenities was an additional treat.  Room service, concierge everything excelled here at the Gritti Palace. Newly restored with beautiful furnishings and marble floors.  It is a very homey feeling when you walk in the doors as well.  I highly recommend this hotel when traveling to Venice !!Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
