We agree with all the glowing reviews and particularly appreciated the wonderful attentive staff. We also loved our luxurious over-the-top room.

Ours at the Gritti could not have been more comfortable. We also enjoyed our breakfasts but did not dine in the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
