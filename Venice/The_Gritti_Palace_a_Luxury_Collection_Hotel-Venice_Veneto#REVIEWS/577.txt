Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in Sept. A truly amazing place. Have to say that its possibly the most beautiful place we have ever stayed in. Booked 2 night through Starwood awards and got upgraded to the Sestiere suite. Felt like checking into a true palace. From the moment your water taxi stops in front of the hotel to checking out and getting onto the water taxi for trip out of Venice the staff and this hotel will make you feel truly spacial.  We stayed with our two daughters (10 and 5) and they still talk about Venice and our hotel :).  Its one of those places that is worth staying in for that special experience.  Truly Amazing and very special in every aspect.
