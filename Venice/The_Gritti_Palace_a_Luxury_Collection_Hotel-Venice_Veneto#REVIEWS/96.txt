Beautiful property in perfect location. However...for the price of the room the following should not have happened: 1- peanuts at the bar overlooking the canal; 2- a woman forcing herself into our room in the late afternoon to swap a magazine when told that she should come back (my wife quickly donned her PJs); 3- being told that tables at the outdoor bar were reserved when the concierge said bar tables can’t be reserved; 4- hanging on the phone waiting for someone at reception to pick up after 20 rings; 5- being the only one who didn’t get snacks at the bar despite asking multiple times.  Maybe the Marriott ownership has adversely impacted service and quality as our prior visits have been flawless.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
