We stayed at the Danieli for four days but chose to eat here at the Gritti Palace (part of the same hotel group) on our second evening. Dining at the Danieli was 25% more expensive and the food was not as good as here at the Gritti Palace and no noisy children running around. The dining room is sumptious with silk lining to the room, great lighting and with quality pictures and fittings. However, it was the attitude of the staff that we loved most. They were very welcoming and gave us a great table that looked out across the canal. We shared a chateaubriand (my wife and I) and it was cooked to perfection. If I was coming to Venice again I would stay at the Gritti Palace.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
