This stunning hotel, best position in Venice in my opinion, is just the biggest treat..It really is like a rich jewel..a real feeling of Venice in its glory days. I think its a hotel that is particularly wonderful   in Spring , Autumn and Winter..as the inside is so gorgeous.It needs it to be cold outside and misty and romantic .Though Im sure its equally fabulous in summer with its wonderful terrace onto the Grand Canal, and its sundeck and swimming pool upstairs...Its so glamorous inside and its been beautifully decorated and renovated.The staff,the flowers!!  (STUNNING) the attention to detail everywhere, the starched tablecloths and napkins, and the food everything is superb.It also has an intimacy and cosiness  which I love.Also the other guests are wonderful to lookâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
