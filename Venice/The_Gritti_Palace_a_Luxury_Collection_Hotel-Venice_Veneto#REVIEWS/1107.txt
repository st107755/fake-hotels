Solo business traveler and stayed for 2 nights.  As a member with status, upgraded to San Marco suite.  The room was spacious and lovely.  Service impeccable.  Only regret is that I didn't have the chance to try their spa and Club de Doge.  Next time.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Nov 26, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for letting us know that you enjoyed an “impeccable service” in occasion of your business travel.

We look forward to your continued patronage in years to come.  Best Regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
