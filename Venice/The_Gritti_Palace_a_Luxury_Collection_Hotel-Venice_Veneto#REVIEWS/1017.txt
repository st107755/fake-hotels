My family and I stayed here a couple years ago and truly enjoyed it. We had two connecting rooms, one for me and my hubby, and the other for my two kids, who were both under the age of 10 at the time. Overall, the hotel was beautiful! The staff that worked there all spoke English, which was great! The restaurant outside was pretty much on a dock and had GREAT food! The rooms were so clean, and a boat picked us up to take us wherever we wanted! I hope one day we can go back to the Gritti Palace, and look forward to that day! :)Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
