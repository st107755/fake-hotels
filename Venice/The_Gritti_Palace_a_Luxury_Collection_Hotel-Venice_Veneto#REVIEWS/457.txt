We did our Honeymoon trip to the Gritti Palace - it was amazing! The history of the hotel, the quality of the service, the kindness of the staff everything was perfect!!!! The Riva Bar is fantatsic - a hot spot in Venice. The whole stay at the Gritti and in Venice was indescribable - more than words can say!
