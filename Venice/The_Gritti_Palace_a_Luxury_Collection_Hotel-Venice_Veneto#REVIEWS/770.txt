I usually don't write reviews, but I thought this time I should as I was impressed from the moment I stepped in. The suite we had was one of the best suite I ever stayed, level of details and finish are amazing, marble bathroom is stunning. The Concierges are top class and gave very good advice and top restaurants. Spa is top notch. Will definitely recommend it!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 1, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much indeed for having made an exception and having written such a lovely review about our Gritti Palace!
