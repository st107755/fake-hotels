We had an amazing stay in Venice thanks to Gritti Palace and its staff. Location is great - everything is within walking distance - and concierge is always here to help booking amazing restaurants. Rooms are spacious and very well decorated.  We will definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
