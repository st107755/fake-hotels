Amazing location.  Right on the river and you take the river boat taxi from the train station straight to the hotel.  Get a room with a balcony and you can enjoy the views and unbelievable city.  The Concierge is Top Notch and recommended the best restaurants in town.  Truly an incredible experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
