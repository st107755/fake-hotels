Had a wonderful stay in this stunning hotel. Loved being on the Grand Canal is a room and in a hotel that were both hard to leave. Meals were wonderful and memorable especially breakfast and lunch on the canal. Staff were excellent. If not staying there then have a drink at the bar or a lunch on the canal. Loved it all.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
