From the moment we entered we felt like royalty. Romina upgraded us to a stunning suite without even asking. She was gracious and professional as was Carlotta. Ivan was an incredible concierge with the best sense of humor and someone who could discuss any topic. He helped us with our Murano day trip and offered countless recommendations. Breakfast on the Canal a must. Rooms pristinely renovated. Superlative in Every Way. We didn't want to leave.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
