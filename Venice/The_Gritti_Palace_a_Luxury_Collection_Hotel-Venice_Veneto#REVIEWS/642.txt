A truly lovely hotel. Courteous, helpful and professional staff. Great service, cannot be faulted.  The hotel is in a great location, convenient to St Marks.Square and most major attractions, Our room, one of their more basic , was beautifully furnished, comfortable and peaceful. The terrace to the Grand Canal front is a lovely place for breakfast, drinks and dinner (tempting to just sit there all day) . The buffet breakfast offered wide choice with eggs to order. Tthe restaurant far far better than anywhere else we ate in Venice and nothing can compare with arriving by water taxi at their landing stage. A real sense of arrival.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
