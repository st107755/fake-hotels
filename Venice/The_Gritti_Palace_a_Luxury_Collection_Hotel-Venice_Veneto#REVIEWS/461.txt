We came here for drinks by the grand canal, which is in a very cool river side terrace and drinks were good along with nibbles etc, this is the place that people go to be seen and show off as well appreciate the vibe, view, status etc (I can't comment for the hotel side) but I thought the service could have been better (considering its 5* and prices etc) we had to get their attention and then wait for a table (or to be shown to one outside) but I did notice most people just went out and sat down, overall we really liked it and will go back again, its basically a show off place and a location for those with money, yacht club type, but we loved it!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
