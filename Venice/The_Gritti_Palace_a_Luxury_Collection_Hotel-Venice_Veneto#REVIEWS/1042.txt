The hotel is fabulous - must agree with all the reviewers about the sumptuous rooms, perfect location, dining and service.   Gritti Palace in March is the best value of any luxury hotel we've ever visited.  Prices are a fraction of what they would be in the summer, and being from Florida where it is currently 90 degrees F, we actually prefer the chilly weather.    We are only gold-level Starwood members (the mid-level tier), but we were treated wonderfully and offered an upgrade upon check-in.  We are also a young couple that looks more at home backpacking or in a hostel than a luxury hotel, so we appreciated the warm reception from the staff.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
