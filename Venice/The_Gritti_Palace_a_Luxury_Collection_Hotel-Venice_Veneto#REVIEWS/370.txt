The hotel is centrally located on the Grand Canal and has its on frontage which is important as there is no noise of the vaporettos's coming and going in front of this property. The service is impeccable, the staff very friendly and helpful. We booked a Venetian non-smoking room which was fine except for the badly painted pictures hanging in it and the stale odour. The bathroom is luxurious, well appointed and very well stocked.I chose this hotel because of the tastefully executed old world decor and the service which I experienced from the concierge in the past.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
