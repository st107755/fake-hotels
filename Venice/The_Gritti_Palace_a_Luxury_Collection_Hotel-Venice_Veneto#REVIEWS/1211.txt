The newly restored Gritti Palace deserves its reputation as one of the top hotels in Venice. It has an enviable setting on the Grand Canal and breakfast or nightcaps on the decking are a joy, watching the boats pass by. Our room was simply beautiful. High ceilings, huge marble bathroom, Venetian splendour. The staff were friendly and helpful and I only wish I had followed the Concierge's advice sooner (after a disastrous meal of my own choosing - see Harry's Bar review)! The perfect location for exploring all of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
