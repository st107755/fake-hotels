We had a great experience staying here. Four nights with our 18month old. The team and service here from checkin , servers at lounge and restaurant, doormen, concierge team everyone was top notch!   We had massages at spa and it was a great experience as well as the hotel helped us to arrange a babysitter.   I did the half day cooking class with Franco it is an absolute highly recommend!   We loved our room! Large for European standards and huge beautiful all marble bathroom!!   We would love to return ASAP!!Read moreDate of stay: January 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
