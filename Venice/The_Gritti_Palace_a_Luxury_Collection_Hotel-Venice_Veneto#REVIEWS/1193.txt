I am very fussy (ask my poor husband) The Gritti Palace is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The service from the very beginning of our stay was impeccable.  Complementary prosecco in our room upon arrival. birthday cake arranged for Hubby at dinner. The rooms (and the whole of the hotel) are Beautifully furnished and are spotlessly clean.  With plenty of Aqua Di Parma toiletries. The buffet breakfast was delicious with a wide choice.  Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal will be one of My favourite memories of venice watching the gondolas and the boats passing by and the views are stunning.  You could not ask for a better location, on the Grand Canal, near St Marks Square. One very small negative, the drinks are Silly expensive, but you can find cheaperâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
