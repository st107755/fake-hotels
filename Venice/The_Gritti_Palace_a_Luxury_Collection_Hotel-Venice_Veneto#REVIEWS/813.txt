Let me start by saying the hotel is beautiful.... However, the staff needs to realize that not all black people are criminals and deserve to be treated with Respect! I will never stay at this hotel again because of the racism here. It is sad because the hotel is extremely nice and upscale. However, the staff needs a lesson in cultural differences and racial tolerance.Read moreDate of stay: January 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jan 26, 2016Dear Guest,  We do always welcome guest comments when these are made honestly.   After having verified the check-in process during your visit your statement can only be ascribed to a personal feeling. The Gritti Palace is an international hotel with a long and prestigious heritage of hospitality.  Our experienced staff is accustomed to a clientele of all nationalities, ethnic groups, religions and beliefs, and our Gritti family, which enlarges during the season, also counts colleagues of diverse nationalities and ethnic groups, religions and beliefs. Many of them return year after year, which is proof they do feel welcome.  Ethical business practices are the founding of our Company, and each member of our team is blessed with an innate “politically correct” attitude. We are just as vigilant in protecting our company, ensuring that only eligible guests are entitled to benefit from preferred rates, and reporting attempts of fraud.  We trust the above will help in clarifying the matter for you and eliminate any concerns you may have.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
