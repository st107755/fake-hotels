My husband had told me we were off to London for our 16th wedding anniversary.  Instead he whisked me off to Venice and we stayed at the Gritti Palace for 3 nights. This place is just outstanding, do not hesitate to visit! The rooms were stunning, the staff so helpful, breakfasts amazing and the latte the best in Venice!! Views over the Grand Canal were beautiful, we would sit and watch the world go by...breathtaking! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹âœ¨Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
