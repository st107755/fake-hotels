We arrived by water taxi at the dock entrance, in typical Venetian style, very cool  The lobby was newly renovated in keeping with its historical appearance, so it appeared to be well maintained but classically old.  This is not a minimalist lobby w chrome and glass.  I like this atmosphere especially in a city like Venice. Service from check in to concierge excellent.  Location great for walking, gondola and water taxi.  Restaurant is on the canal overlooking other palaces and great buildings.  It provides a formal yet relaxed atmosphere while overlooking the frequently bustling traffic on the canal.  Breakfast buffet was a delight although service was good only when someone could be hailed. Our room was beautiful with silk wall coverings and a combination of modern amenitiesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
