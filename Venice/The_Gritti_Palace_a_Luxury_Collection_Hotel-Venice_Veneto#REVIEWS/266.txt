Visited in May for two nights for a birthday. It is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. Our room was decorated beautifully with an incredibly comfy bed.  From start to finish the service was excellent. We were checked in by a lovely lady who told us the history of the hotel and was so helpful providing a guided tour around the hotel and then onto our room.  The food at dinner was so delicious ! I highly recommend the souffl√©. The cocktails were also very good.   Cannot wait to return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
