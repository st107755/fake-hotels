The location, on the Grand Canal and a five-minute walk from St. Mark's Square, is great.  The room was large, ornately decorated and very clean.  The bathroom was again large, all-marble with separate bathtub and shower.  The staff (including reception) treated us like VIPs the entire time.  The concierge, Umberto, was most helpful in planning our trip and arranging a guide.  The breakfasts on the terrace overlooking the canal were a wonderful way to start the day. We were able to take a water taxi directly from the Cruise Terminal directly to the hotel's private dock and later from the dock to the airport.  There is a traghetto adjacent to the hotel and the Giglio vaporetto stop is around the corner.  If we are lucky enough to return to Venice, we would not consider stayingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
