As Everyone agrres superb location with fabulous views over the Grand Canal. We were greeted by a very welcoming lady who extended a much-appreciated room upgrade to a Giglio room with a picturesque view  of the Grand Canal . Lovely decor and size, complimentary bottle of Prosecco and fruit and roses. Common areas are amazing with great attention to details. Good breakfast except for the hot dishes on the first day which were not up to standards (pancakes// eggs benedict) service was acceptable yet a bit hectic and not precise enough. Some staff members were not particularly warm especially in the bar (head barman) / gentleman at check-out was very nice though'. Overall we had a pleasant stay: a beautiful renovation , luxurious surroundings and quiet location .Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 8, 2015Dear Guest,  Whilst we are delighted that you agree with the majority of our Guests considering our Palazzo and its location “superb”, we are really sorry to read that some services were not completely up to your expectations.
