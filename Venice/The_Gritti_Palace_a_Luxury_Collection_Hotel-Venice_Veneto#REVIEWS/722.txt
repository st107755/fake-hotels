Enjoyed a beautiful, perfect evening at the Gritti. The location is a marvel. The rooms are spacious, unique and exquisite. The food is exceptional.  But what really sets it apart is the service.  Warm, inviting, attentive and joyous - I'm convinced they are the best on the planet.  It isn't cheap, but it is worth every penny.  They make magic. Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
