Recently stayed in this hotel. We had 4 rooms in total as part of a family trip. Service was excellent throughout our stay. Rooms were very nicely styled and very clean. Always greeted by staff throughout the hotel. Downstairs lobby lounge area is nice and we enjoyed a few bottles of wine there one afternoon that we received complimentary in our rooms and the staff were kind enough to bring us glasses and nibbles for us. Breakfast at the restaurant was very nice, and the outdoor seating is great being right on the grand canal. Being fussy with hotels and can say have confidence booking this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
