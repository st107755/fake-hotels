We stayed at this hotel after disembarking from a 21-day Mediterranean cruise.  It was an incredible experience.  This hotel is small but ideally located and stunningly beautiful.  While I generally prefer lighter brighter rooms, the ornate carved wood and intricate tapestries in rich luxurious tones made the dark room feel cozy, decadent, and very romantic.  The staff was also extremely friendly, which is rare in a country where Americans are often looked upon with scorn.  This is probably the only time in my life I truly felt like royalty.  The location is ideal, situated directly on the water and just a short walk to the breathtaking Piazza di San Marco.  If you want to experience the real Venice, be sure to stay at the Gritti Palace.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
