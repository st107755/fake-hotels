This hotel is right on the Grand Canal and it is a small boutique hotel in a great location. Our view from our room was magnificent. The hotel staff were so helpful and friendly. We got to know them since we saw the same faces every day. Some other hotels we stayed in in Venice we never saw the staff twice. Hotel restaurant is so beautiful and the food was great. We walked everywhere and this hotel had the best location. Gondola right to the other side of the Grand Canal is right next to the hotel. And St Mark's Square is right around the corner but far enough away to be out of the way of crowds. This out of the 3 hotels we stayed in in Venice was by far my favorite.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
