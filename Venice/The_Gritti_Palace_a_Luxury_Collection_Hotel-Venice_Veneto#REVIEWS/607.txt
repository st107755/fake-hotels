Stayed at the Gritti Palace for 4 nights in September. Beautiful hotel and an excellent location for the sights. It's situated right onto the Grand Canal and having breakfast on the outside terrace over looking the Canal and the Church was wonderful. All the staff we encountered were great and nothing was too much trouble.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
