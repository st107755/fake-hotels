Stayed for two nights with my wife. An incredible hotel in Venice, with very few cons to mention. One of the best SPG properties I've visited globally.   Pros: -Location: Ideal; Access to the grand canal, walking distance to Piazza San Marco, and pretty much everything else in the city -Breakfast: A top notch spread, but the real pleasure is the deck over the water; could spend all day sipping coffee and watching the singing gondola pilots pass by. -SPG recognition: Upgraded to the John Ruskin suite without using a suite upgrade award.  -Room: The size, decor, and direct canal views were over-the-top. Luxurious and sizeable bathroom with acqu di parma ammenities.  Non-pros: -Won't call them cons but service was a bit more curt than anticipated.  Definitely a bucket list propertyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
