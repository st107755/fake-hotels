I was at the Gritti Palace Hotel in early February for my sister's birthday. We booked 3 rooms, and we came back at home externally satisfied with the experience. I was aware of its very high level, however, I wasn't expecting anything like it. The cleanliness and service were nothing short of excellent, the view from the bedroom was breathtaking, the manager was extremely helpful and welcoming just like all the staff. Food is undoubtedly a strength of the hotel. I could not recommend a better place to spend a wonderful holiday full of comfort, relaxation and beauty. The staff of the Gritti Palace Hotel conveys an incessant passion for their work to their guests.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare
