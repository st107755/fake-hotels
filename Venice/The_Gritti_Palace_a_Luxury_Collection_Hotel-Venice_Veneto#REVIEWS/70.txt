I stay in hotels a lot. The Gritti Palace was amazing. Old school, historic, on the water, and easy to walk to attractions. Our room didn't have a view but it was terrific, great decorations, large bath, and a suite too. The service at the restaurant was also great. I could sit at the restaurant (it's on the water) all day long to enjoy the view, people, water, and beauty of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
