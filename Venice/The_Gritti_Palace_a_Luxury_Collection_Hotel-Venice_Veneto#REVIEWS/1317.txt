Wonderful holiday at the elegant Gritti Palace!  Spent the afternoon in the lounge with the most interesting expats living in Paris.  Lots of bourbon, southern folklore and laughs with these  gentlemen.  The Gritti Palace provided the best sleeping beds of our two week tour of Northern Italy.  We enjoyed our stay at The Danieli on a previous trip with friends but we can't wait to return to the Gritti Palace!!!!!Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Nov 6, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you for having shared your experience with the TripAdvisor community.
