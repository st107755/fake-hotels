My partner booked the Gritti  palace for an anniversary weekend in Venice and it was perfect. Recently redecorated, the interior is stunning, in keeping with its history.

It is a pleasure to learn we were able to make your visit memorable.  Due to the strict fire safety regulations in force in the city, we are regretfully unable to offer tea or coffee making facilities, though in-room dining is available for every need.  As you will have discovered during your stay, we do have our own private dock on the Grand Canal.  We have checked why you were not dropped off at The Gritti Palace directly upon your arrival and it would seem that there was a mix-up with the hotel name with your taxi driver.  We do look forward to welcoming you back to The Gritti Palace in the near future and are at your disposal for every assistance.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
