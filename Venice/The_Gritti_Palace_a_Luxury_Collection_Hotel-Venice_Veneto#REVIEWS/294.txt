Absolutely wonderful location with the hotel terrace directly overlooking the Grand Canal.  The restaurant and bar team is outstanding with every order perfectly served by a gracious and very competent team.  Accordingly, the best place for me in Venice is the Gritti terrace for a wonderful meal and relaxing moments spent watching the activities on the Grand Canal and looking over to the beautiful Venetian buildings across the water.  Our room was gorgeous; beautifully furnished.  Absolutely outstanding - one of the best experiences in a five-star hotel in a long time.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
