My husband and I signed up for a cooking class to celebrate my husband's birthday.  It was one of the best presents I've ever given him!  My husband cooks--I don't (lucky me!)--and we both had a wonderful experience with our teacher, Franco, and one other couple.  We made an appetizer of dried cod (called Baccala), risotto with scampi (a must-have in Venice when they're in season), poached sea bass, and a grand mariner souffl√©.  It was so much fun, and so delicious.  Franco was warm, knowledgable, highly skilled and authentically Italian!  If you go to Venice, stay at the Gritti. And if you stay at the Gritti, take the cooking class.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Oct 29, 2014Dear Guest,   Thank you so much for your nice review! We are so pleased to read that our cooking class was one of the best presents you gave to your husband and that you had a wonderful experience!  We are very proud of our Epicurean School that has been an essential part of The Gritti Palace hotel since 1975.  Since its reopening after the restoration, it has reconfirmed itself as an ideal location in which to learn, taste, and celebrate the traditional flavours of the lagoon.  Executive Chef Daniele Turco, and in his absence Sous Chef Franco Sanna - who is grateful to you for your  praise, share the best Venetian recipes with the participants and introduce them to prime seasonal produce, accompanying them on an authentic and unique culinary adventure.   Thank you for recommending our Epicurean School!  We look forward to have the possibility to offer you another indigenous culinary journey!  Best regards,  Paolo  Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
