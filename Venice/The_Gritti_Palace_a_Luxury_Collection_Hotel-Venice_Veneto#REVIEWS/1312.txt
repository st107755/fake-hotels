We stayed at the Gritti Palace pre-cruise to the new Royal Princess.  I did not want to leave!!  The wonderful location, the sumptuous rooms, the accommodating and gracious staff, the divine Club del Doge restaurant.....everything was perfect  and we used SPG points for part of our stay.    Arrival:  Nothing can quite compare to a private water taxi navigating the way through rush hour traffic and then pulling up to that waiting pier at the Gritti with smiling staff ready to assist you.  What a welcome.  What a hotel.  Rooms:  We had reserved connecting rooms with our teenage children.  Divine.....linens, appointments, complimentary fruit assortment (large and wonderfully presented) with accompanying cheese and bottle of wine (this is so welcome after a looooong day of travel!),â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
