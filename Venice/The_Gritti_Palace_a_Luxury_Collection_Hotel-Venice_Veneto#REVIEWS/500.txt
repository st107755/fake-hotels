We took the vaporetto from the train station to the Giglio stop which left us at The Gritti Palace. This was easy even with our carry on size luggage. The historic hotel is directly on the Grand Canal with a gondola station and a traghetto outside. Enjoying drinks and snacks at the bar overlooking the Grand Canal was memorable. We enjoyed the Breakfast Buffet daily. We were able to walk everywhere in Venice exploring each neighborhood without the crowds of San Marco and Rialto Bridge. This will be our choice of hotel on our next trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 5, 2017Dear Guest,   We are so glad you selected The Gritti Palace among the many luxury hotels in Venice and were happy with your choice!
