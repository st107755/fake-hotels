The Gritti Palace is a magnificent hotel.  The old Doge's palace in Venice has been very tastefully restored and is exceptionally comfortable, even luxurious.  Standing beside the Grand Canal, the Gritti Palace is in a terrific location.  We found the staff really charming and the hotel facilities were absolutely top notch.  The breakfast is also superb.  My wife and I were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and stayed four nights in the hotel.  We were in a lovely room and it is difficult to imagine staying anywhere more delightful.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 29, 2016Dear client,  Thank you very much for your feedback.
