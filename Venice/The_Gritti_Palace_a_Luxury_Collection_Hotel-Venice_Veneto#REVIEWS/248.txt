My wife and I stayed at the Gritti Palace during our honeymoon and it was the definition of luxury. The hotel is absolutely stunning - the artwork, the amenities, the rooms, the patio, and the location are all phenomenal. We stayed on SPG points, which seemed to be fairly common amongst the guests we talked to. The hotel may be cost prohibitive for many people if booked regularly. Most of the staff were friendly and extremely helpful, with a few exceptions for staff members who initially assumed we were not guests, given our age.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
