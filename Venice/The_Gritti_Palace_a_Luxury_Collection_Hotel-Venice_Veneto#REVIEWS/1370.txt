We chose to stay at the Gritti Palace on a last minute trip to Venice and could not have imagined a better experience.  Service, from check in, to room service to concierge, was excellent. All of the fine details from a fruit plate in our room upon arrival to the Bernardaud china used for food service to the Aqua di Parma bath products provided in the luxuriously appointed bathroom made our stay incredible.   We were upgraded to a higher level room which was very spacious and we can't praise enough the renovation the hotel has recently undergone as all the decor, textiles and furnishings are impeccable.  We can't wait to come back for a repeat stay!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jun 6, 2013Dear Guest,  I wish to thank you very much for the preference shown towards our Gritti and I am glad to learn that your experience with us exceeded your expectations.
