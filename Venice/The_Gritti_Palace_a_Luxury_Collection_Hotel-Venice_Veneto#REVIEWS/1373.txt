We stayed in Venice for two nights before a trip to Sicily. The Gritti Palace had a complete renovation and reopened in January. It's just magnificent, with ornate details in the lobby and the rooms, though the sizes of the latter were not expandable because of the need to follow the restoration restrictions. The location is fabulous, accessible to everything. Breakfasts were excellent, with a buffet table and a la carte ordering, and dinner was also sublime. Service is impeccable - highly recommemded!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
