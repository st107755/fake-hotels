We stayed three nights at this hotel in May 2014, before a cruise starting in Venezia. Hotel location is the best, right on the canal, but just far enough to St. Mark's Square to be quiet, still a very easy walk. Reception personnel was very welcoming, and the concierges were very helpful. The room (being Gold Starwood members, we were upgraded to a suite) was large, beautifully furnished and decorated and extremely clean. Breakfast on the beautiful terrace by the Canal was worth the high asking price, because of its quality, the comfort of the terrace and the view on the Grand Canal. Up to now, my favorite hotels had been The Chesterfield Mayfair in London, Hotel Icon in Hong Kong and Les Suites Orient in Shanghai, but the Gritti surpassed them.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
