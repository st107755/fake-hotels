took my daughter to venice for the first time, so wanted a nice hotel with good facilities in close range to all the sights. Were greeted on arrival and taken to our suite which was beautiful. The breakfasts and food and drinks at the bar were very good and people were very attentive. Would definitely stay here again maybe the Hemmingway suite!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 17, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much. We are most pleased that our house matched all of your requirements and that the service provided was equally up to your expectations.   We feel honored that you would return to The Gritti Palace and chose our significant Presidential Hemingway Suite for your next stay.  In the Presidential Suite that bears his name, Ernest Hemingway, who considered The Gritti Palace his home in Venice during the late 1940's and early 1950's, composed many passages of his novel "Across the River and Into the Trees."  With its corner setting on the piano nobile of the palazzo and the largest of the hotel's suites, The Hemingway celebrates these special years of the author's life, and invites guests to share this exclusive experience.   We look forward to welcoming you back soon!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
