Wow. What a stay! Getting down the the nitty gritty An amazing hotel From coming in at the private water taxi, to check in (and a great upgrade to a jr suite as a Starwood gold) we had a great stay. The rooms were quite spacious and comfortable  The concierge always helpful with suggestions. We also loved you could leave the room key each day with concierge, and they new you immediately,  when you returnedRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
