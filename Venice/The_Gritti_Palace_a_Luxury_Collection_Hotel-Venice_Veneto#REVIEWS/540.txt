If you want to have the top in town you have to stay at the Gritti. Very close to San Marco square, located on Gran Canal it has been completely renewed almost four years ago. Outstanding rooms with very kind and efficient staff. Don't miss an aperitif on the Gran Canal terrace. Not a budget hotel of course, but it worth every single euro you will spend.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Dec 28, 2016Dear Guest,  We are very pleased that you fully enjoyed your stay at The Gritti Palace and you appreciated not only the refined, luxurious atmosphere of our antique Palace, but also the high level of service provided by the entire team.
