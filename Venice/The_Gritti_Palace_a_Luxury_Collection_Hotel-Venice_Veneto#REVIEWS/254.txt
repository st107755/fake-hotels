This is an absolutely fabulous hotel. It is expensive but the service, quality of restaurant and people watching is unmatched.   I had a few issues with my room. The Cordless phone did not work and the USB port did not work. I reported the issue but the solution was to remove the phone.   The hotel was sold out so I did not get an upgrade but the quality of the bedding and bed was superb.   I absolutely would stay here again just for the atmosphere. Again, the quality of the breakfast and selection, as well as the professional wait staff was well worth it. Unlike its sister, the Danieli, I was not charged a cover to be seated.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
