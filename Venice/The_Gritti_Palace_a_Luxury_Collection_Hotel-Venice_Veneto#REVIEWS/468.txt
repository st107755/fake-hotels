We stayed for three nights at the Gritti Palace in May, a time when Venice is busy but not overcrowded. The hotel is delightful, our room was superlative, beautiful decor, large comfortable bed, excellent bathroom and a view of the Grand Canal. It is difficult to describe eating on the terrace Restaraunt, either for breakfast or dinner; the view, the sense of being in the middle of this bustling yet historic city and the marvellous food and service all combine to make this a place to remember.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded May 19, 2017Dear Guests,  Thank you for expressing your satisfaction with your comfortable and fine accommodation, the hotel’s décor and its location.
