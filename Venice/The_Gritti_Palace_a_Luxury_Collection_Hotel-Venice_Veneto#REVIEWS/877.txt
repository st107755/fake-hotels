We visited this hotel during our day in Venice, we had a nice cocktail at the Riva lounge, from there you have a beautiful view to the Gran Canal where all the boats and gondola's pass you by.The hotel it self is taking you into the indigenous Venician style, Marvellous!   Do not forget to visit this hotel while you in Venice, it will give you such a nice experience when you just drink a drink at the terrace as I did.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
