The Gritti Palace is fantastic - from the service, location right on the canal, and amazing accommodations.  We were upgraded to a suite which was perfect.  It was ornately decorated with the best amenities.  The outdoor breakfast and bar were great and the service was outstanding.  Best hotel of our 2 week trip in Italy by far!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
