Just returned from two very special nights at the Gritti Place in Venice.   With only 82 two rooms, the hotel is so intimate.   The location on the Grand Canal just a few minutes from St Marks Square is perfect.   The renovations are both elegant and state of the art...large rooms, bathrooms...great views, luxury linens, premium Aqua di Parma toiletries, terrific restaurant, wonderful lobby bar on the Grand Canal, terrific room service, amazing staff...just can't say enough good things.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
