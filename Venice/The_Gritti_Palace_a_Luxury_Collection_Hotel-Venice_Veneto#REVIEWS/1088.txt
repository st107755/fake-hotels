From the moment you arrive, you realise you're somewhere wonderfull, for a start the location on the Grand Canal is superb! You are close to everything you want to see.  The rooms and service are incredible (but certainly not cheap) and the food and location dinning on the terrace right in the Grand Canal for dinner is second to none.   If you're truly looking for a romantic experience, then this is the place of your dreams.  Try to book a room with a canal view if you can.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jan 30, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback, it is indeed valuable to us, and for suggesting other travelers seeking for a romantic experience to stay with us!
