This place is like adding truffles to your pasta. Decadent but worth it.  Everything is pricey in Venice, so you might as well splurge a bit. The rooms were recently remodeled in a Venetian fashion, which is highly ornate and pleasing for a few nights.   As soon as you unpack head to the Riva Lounge and enjoy a cocktail while watching the world go by on the Grand Canal.    The only mistake we made was taking the public water taxi to the hotel from the airport, which was just a long trip with lots of stops before arriving.   If you're staying here you really must arrive via private water tai.  What an entrance.  What a hotel.  Love it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
