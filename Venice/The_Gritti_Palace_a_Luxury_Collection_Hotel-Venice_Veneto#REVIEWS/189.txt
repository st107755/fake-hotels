A shout out to the concierge team who were so actively engaged with us during the stay and even after check out.   They proactively made sure everything was taken care off whenever you interacted with them.   The hotel itself is wonderful and beautiful. It is highly luxurious yet the staff are warm and friend.   Breakfast with a view SM d Salute was such a treat! I do wish the buffet spread could have a bit more variety but I also understand itâ€™s Venice and hence logistics are more tricky.   Would love to have a Canals Grande view next time!Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
