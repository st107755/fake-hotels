Arriving by boat, this hotel is magical, it takes a day just to absorb all the history in the rooms let alone the rest of the hotel.  Its well positioned in a quiet area on one side and the Grand canal on the other.  The rooms are well provisioned and the suite we had was very well stocked, and we were given a wonderful bottle of champagne.  We stayed for the New Years celebrations which were breathtaking.  The bar serves excellent cocktails and the restaurant served some incredible meals.  Service overall was very good.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 13, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having taken the time to review The Gritti Palace and for having expressed your appreciation of both the refined and historic ambiance as well as of the services.  We cannot but agree with you… New Years’ Eve renders Venice even more out of the ordinary... with the sparkle of the lights reflecting on the water or blurred by the light fog, it’s like walking around in a fairy tale..  There is no correct or wrong period for a visit to Venice. Our unique city shows different aspects of its beauty in every season.  We hope to have the privilege to welcome you soon back to The Gritti Palace.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General Manager Read more
