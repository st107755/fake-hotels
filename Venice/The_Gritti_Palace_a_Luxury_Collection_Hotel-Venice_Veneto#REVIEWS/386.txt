This is a quite wonderful hotel. The location, decor and history provide the 'baseline' but what elevates this hotel to greatness are the wonderful employees.

It is hard to imagine how a hotel anywhere could provide a better level of service than this.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
