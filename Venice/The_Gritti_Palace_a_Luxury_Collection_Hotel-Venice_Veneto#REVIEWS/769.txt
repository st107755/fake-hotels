This was our first stop on a tour of Italy over the Easter school break and what a place to start. It must be one of the most beautiful setting in the whole of Venice and very hard to top. Our rooms were extremely comfortable and we have never slept in a better bed. We had lunch on the terrace which has one of the best views in Venice. We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone but if it's fully booked when you intend to visit Venice, try to book s table for lunch. You feel like a film star when eating here.
