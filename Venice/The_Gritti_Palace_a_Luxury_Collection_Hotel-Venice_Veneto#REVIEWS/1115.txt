This is a very classic hotel. Just like everything in Venice is older and smaller. The rooms are small but very comfortable. Bed and sheets are very comfortable as well the all room amenities.  Concierges and all the staff are helpful and friendly.  Food quality is great from room service to their main restaurant.  Met with front the manager Mr. Ivan who is a true hotelier professional. If you staying on the lower levels you probably will hear the gondoliers signing day and night.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
