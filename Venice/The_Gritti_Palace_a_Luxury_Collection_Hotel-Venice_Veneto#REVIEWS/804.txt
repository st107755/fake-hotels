I share your discontent for the level of service provided which did not reflect our usual standards and I do regret of the consequent discomfort that you experienced.  I sincerely hope to have the privilege and opportunity to welcome you again to our Gritti in order to change the impression you have reported into a better one. Please do not hesitate to contact the Executive Office directly for any arrangement regarding your future travels to our city.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
