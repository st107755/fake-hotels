Could not fault this hotel in terms of decadence, opulence, sophistication and location.  Breakfast in the sun, overlooking the Grand Canal is probably the best in the area. Staff very professional.  Accommodation, food and drink good, but lavishly expensive, although you know this when you book.  I felt atmosphere was lacking in this hotel, the bed & pillows not comfy and for those reason alone I would not return to this hotel.  At least we can tick off we stayed at the Gritti Palace!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 10, 2015Dear Guest,  We are grateful for your positive comments about the hotel décor and location, and for your appreciation of the staff’s professionalism.  We also greatly respect your additional judgment concerning the lack of atmosphere and the quality of the bedding, however to better understand your point we would appreciate your direct communication to us of your feelings related to the ambience.  As far as the bed & pillows are concerned, yours is the second unfavorable comment we receive in two years of operation after the renovation! All of our guestrooms are equipped with the new Luxury Collection Beds, which normally find our Guests’ approval. In fact, we often receive requests of information on where to buy them!  We hope that you may reconsider your decision and give us an opportunity to improve your impression of us.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
