My husband and I stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The room we stayed in was very large with beautiful Venetian decor.  I think the real highlight of this hotel is its location and beautiful patio right on the Grand Canal...it was certainly the best place to have drinks that we came across in Venice.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
