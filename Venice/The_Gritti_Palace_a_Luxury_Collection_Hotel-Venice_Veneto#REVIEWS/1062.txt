Stayed here for two nights with my wife and young baby for our first wedding anniversary . Classy hotel with impeccable but unobtrusive service . Stayed in a Gigilo prestige room , all the usual amenities you'd expect with a 5 star hotel with a stunning marble bathroom, large comfy bed only spoilt by our young daughter not sleeping ! Probably not a family hotel for older children but we were made to feel more than welcome . Concierge were excellent , helping to arrange water taxis and recommendation for dinner and things to do . Dining room and bar of a very high standard , only ate the delicious buffet in the hotel but all presented and served perfectly . If you were being ultra picky it might not be the most varied buffet you have ever seen but this is a smallish city hotelâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
