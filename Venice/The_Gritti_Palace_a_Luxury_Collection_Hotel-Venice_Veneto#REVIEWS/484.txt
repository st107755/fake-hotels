Without any doubt this is the best overall hotel ever stayed at. From the warm yet professional initial greeting to helpfulness of the concierge team everything was perfect. Breakfast was a real pleasure, again everything spot on and would thoroughly recommend at least a drink  at The Riva bar located outside on the Grand Canal in early evening! We'll definitely be returning and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
