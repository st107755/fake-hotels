If you are going to Venice and looking for a wonderful hotel, this is it. The hotel is beautiful, the service is over the top, and lastly its on the Grand Canel. The bar area and restaurant is not only great but the people watching, meeting folks from all over the world is just great.  Love the Gritti!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
