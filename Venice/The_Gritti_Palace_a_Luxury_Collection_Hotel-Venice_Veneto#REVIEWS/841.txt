We spent three days at the Gritti Palace in late October. It was an amazing experience. Great rooms,great service, great location!!!! The ambiance was unequaled.

I would recommend this hotel without reservation.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Nov 28, 2015Dear Guest,  We very much value your comments and are delighted that you described The Gritti Palace as fantastic and your experience amazing!
