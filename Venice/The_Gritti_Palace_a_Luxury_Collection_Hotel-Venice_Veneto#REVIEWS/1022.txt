We stayed four nights after a cruise in April. We are SPG Gold level members so we had been given the lowest type room ,upon check in we were upgraded to a fabulous room with mirrored walls. painted wood and a beautiful marble bathroom. There was no view but we spent little time in the room. We had purchased the breakfast buffet for each morning and while nit is expensive while in Venice enjoy the view from the fabulous terrace while drinking coffee is priceless.The hotel staff were all wonderful and I don 't belief "no" is in their vocabulary. We look forward to returning to The Gritti Palace in the near future.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
