This hotel, as others have described, is simply amazing.  Although we spent only one night,  we were treated special from the moment we arrived to departure.   The exterior pictures do not do this property justice.  The interior of our room and the hotel were appointed with marble floors/counters and the interior design was beautiful.   The concierge arranged for us to have a customized boat tour of the Grand Canal and surrounding area before we departed....absolutely first class! We also had dinner at the Club doge, inside the hotel, which was also impressive.  The hotel is also a very short 5-8 min walk to the square also.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
