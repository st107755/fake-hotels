We had a wonderful stay at the Gritti Palace. The location is unreal.  We had a couples massage while we were there at their spa, that was truly great.  We both left and said it was the best massage we've had.  We didn't have a room facing the water, but we felt like royalty just the same.  My only issue with the place was the food and beverage cost.  $24 Euro for a cocktail and $12 for coffee seems outrageous, even at a 5 star hotel in Venice, and especially with a cover charge for sitting down.  We enjoyed our stay but out of principal stayed off the deck most days.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
