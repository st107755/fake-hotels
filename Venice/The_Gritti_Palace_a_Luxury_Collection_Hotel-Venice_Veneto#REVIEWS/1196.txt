Among the most expensive drinks I have ever bought - Euros 27 for a Beer and a White Wine !!  I know the Locations counts, but ......  With this place it is everything. On the Canal (any closer and one would be in it), facing almost due South, opposite Santa Maria del Salute, with the glowing ball of sun gently lowering off to one's right - it was a fabulous evening.  Guess this just proves I am either a cheapskate or was swimming way out of my depth.  Glad however that we went and experienced it. I just tremble at the idea of how expensive the Hotel would be to stay in or eat in their Restaurant. As we did neither, maybe I am being a bit unfair, but then I was clobbered for the two drinks.  The setting, as I said, is glorious though.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
