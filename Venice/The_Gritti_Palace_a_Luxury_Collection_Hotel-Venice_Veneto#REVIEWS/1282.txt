The rooms and the bathrooms are simply fabulous...classy, with antique furniture, fantastically comfortable beds ... I wouldn't change anything ... Actually I wouldn't mind living there :) and the rooms on the canal are simply magical as one has the impression to be really part if the Venice magic ... breakfast is also great...and the reface on the canal is fantastic...only one thing which is not solo great....dining...which definitely could be better.. Obviously prices are crazy...But ... Considering the unique sensations... I have no regrets ...I#d do it again :-)Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
