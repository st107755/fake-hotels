The Gritti overlooks the Grand Canel and is very well situated for all that Venice has to offer. Our room was darkly decorated in typical  Venetian style,lots of brocade,Murano glass chandeliers and olive green silk curtains. The room was large with two windows which overlooked quite run down buildings but with a good view of the Grand canal....if you hung out of the window! Beautiful marble bathroom with every thing you would need. Lovely Aqua de Parma products added glamour to the whole. Fab breakfast served by attentive friendly staff. I have stayed in several really good hotels in Venice....this was the best.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
