We stayed at the Gritti Palace on Bonvoy points for one night after cruising the Adriatic. The lobby is beautiful and our room was gorgeous, with a spectacular marble bathroom. If you are looking for minimalism, this hotel might not be your best bet, but if Old World glamour is your style, you cannot top the Gritti.The view from the bar and restaurant on the terrace  is second to none, and we enjoyed drinks and breakfast watching the boats go by on the Grand Canal. Service in the hotel, restaurant and bars was excellent; the concierge even walked us to the correct street after we got lost twice looking for a restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: September 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
