We've visited The Gritti Palace now a few times.  Never to stay.  Maybe one day 'if our ship comes in' ! We usually have drinks in the bar. We have always found the service, the ambience and the staff to be exemplary. Very professional and friendly as you would expect of an hotel of this quality.  This time we had lunch.   My husband enjoyed his meal immensely.   I didn't choose well.  My only criticism was the seafood in the seafood linguine.  Muscles and clams only with the muscles being very small and disappointing.  If these were the only muscles available perhaps they should have been excluded from the dish and substituted with an alternative? Nevertheless.  A wonderful overall experience and we certainly will return during our next visit to venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 27, 2015Dear Guests,  We are most grateful for your loyalty towards our F&B venues, for your appreciation of the professional yet friendly staff and for your fair comments related to your recent experience at our Club del Doge Restaurant, partially enjoyable and partially disappointing.
