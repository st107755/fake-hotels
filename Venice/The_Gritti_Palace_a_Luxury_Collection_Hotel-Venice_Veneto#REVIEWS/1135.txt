We stayed at The Gritti Palace for 3 nights. This is a wonderful hotel with excellent service. Breakfast is lovely by the canal and there is a superb choice. We had dinner on Saturday night which again was truly amazing. The hotel has a perfect position for exploring and we found the concierge to be extremely helpful. Our room was lovely and the welcome bottle of wine and chocolates was a nice touch. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will return for a second stay.
