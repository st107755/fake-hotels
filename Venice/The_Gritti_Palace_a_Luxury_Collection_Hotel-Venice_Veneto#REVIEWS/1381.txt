Exquisite things and experiences in life are rare, and to be savoured.  Oh, how we love the Gritti!  Its one of those old-school hotels where the staff are dressed in immaculate white jackets, the interiors are beautiful, the food wonderful, the view over the canal....there is nothing I can add to this except to say that it is a pleasure to stay at the Gritti if you can. But beware the concierge!  he's on the take: he recommended an awful, touristy place (I lived in Italy for 5 years, I know Italian food) so please don't ask him!  There are so many guides online, do your homework and do have cocktails, lunch or dinner at the Gritti on the canal at least once...wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
