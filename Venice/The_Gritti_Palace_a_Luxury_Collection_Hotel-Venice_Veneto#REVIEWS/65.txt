What can I say other than this hotel is the nicest in Venice.  The location is mere minutes from St. Mark’s Square and the Doges Palace. Water views of the Grand Canal from both the main dining room and the intimate waterfront bar. The concierge and staff could not be more helpful and were always available to offer advice on sightseeing, restaurants and shops. Once you stay here, you’ll understand why the hotel receives so many five-star ratings.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
