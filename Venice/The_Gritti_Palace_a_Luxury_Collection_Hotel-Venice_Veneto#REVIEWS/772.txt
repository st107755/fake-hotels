We highly recommend the cooking lesson at The Gritti Palace, which we participated in during our stay at Christmas time. Chef Franco is an expert at his craft and a fun person to be with.  Going to the Rialto Market with him to choose the ingredients for our meal and stopping at the two baccaros to try a variety of cicchetti and drink Prosecco was one of the highlights of our trip.  The hotel's kitchen, designed for private meals and the cooking classes, is beautiful. Franco demonstrated how to make a delicious seafood meal and we assisted with the prep work. A great day and very memorable experience.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare
