Italy is amazing but Venice is like another world... On the pictures everything is really amazing but when you get there you cannot turn off the smell from the canal. This was the worst problem I had while there.  Our Hotel was on a great location, staff was really nice and helpful...  They recently renovated and they did a stunning job. The best thin in this hotel is the Venetian style where ever you look. This is great place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jun 6, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you for your review and for choosing the Gritti Palace for your recent Venetian sojourn. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed both hotel location as well as the services delivered.   Venice is really “another world” and of course, it has its positive and negative sides. The perception of the smell from the canals can be higher or lower, even imperceptible, being it of course a natural phenomenon.  Looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back soon, we remain with  Best Regards,  Paolo LorenzoniRead more
