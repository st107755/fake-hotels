I stayed here with my boyfriend for 4 nights and really enjoyed it. The room was really lovely and the staff was always friendly. The only thing that went a bit wrong was our first breakfast. We went inside to the buffet and when we wanted to take our seats again, there were other people sitting there. We also had to wait a very long time for water that never came. The breakfast in the room was great! I cannot think of another negative point, except maybe the prices for soft drinks that are really high.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
