If the Gritti Palace was in another place, I would be writing that it is old fashioned and must be renovated, but for Venice, it is pure perfection.  The whole building is very charismatic, and its charm is unbeatable. The lobby and the rooms are fit for a king, and the service does not disappoint.  The highlight of the property - for me - is the stunning terrace on the ground floor looking on to the main canal. From there you can see the whole of Venice summed up in 3 or 4 buildings, and this is what makes it truly special.  There have been a lot of new hotels being built, but none of them match the charm and perfection of the Gritti.   I would recommend this hotel to families, couples, or just anyone who wants to gain the most from their trip to Venice!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
