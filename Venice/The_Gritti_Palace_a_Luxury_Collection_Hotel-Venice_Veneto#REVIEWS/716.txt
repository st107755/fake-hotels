We had a wonderful stay at the Gritti Palace.  It was everything it claims to be, and we were not disappointed.  They greet you at the water taxi station with a porter to take your bags, and you walk into the most beautiful lobby to check in.  Our room was large and beautiful (I want to take the bathroom HOME!).  We loved our stay in Venice and this hotel was a big part of our wonderful stay.  Worth every penny - especially when you're sitting on the patio, sipping on a glass of wine, and enjoying the view of the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
