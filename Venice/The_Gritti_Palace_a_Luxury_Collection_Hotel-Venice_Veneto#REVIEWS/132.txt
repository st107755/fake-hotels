A beautiful property in a fantastic location. We were concerned to be overwhelmed by the mass of tourists traveling in early July, but were pleasantly surprised to walk out of our hotel room to little or no crowds.  The outdoor cafe has an amazing view and the room decor was beautiful. An added bonus was waking up to the music from the passing gondolas. Wonderful hotel staff. A surely memorable stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
