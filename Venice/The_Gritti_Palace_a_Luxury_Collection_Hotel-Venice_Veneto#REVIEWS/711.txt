Having stayed at a number of hotels in Venice prior to this most recent stay at the Gritti Palace, all I can say is "superb".  From the greeting at the door, to check-in, to the room - there was great attention to detail and a very warm welcome, as I am a member of their loyalty programme.  We were upgraded to a suite, which coincidentally, had a baby grand piano.  The room was exceptional, with a great selection  of items in the bar, quality skincare/shower items in the bathroom and a super king sized luxurious bed.  The breakfast area has to have one of the best views in the world, with gondolas, motorboats and vaporettos floating past.  I will definitely stay again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
