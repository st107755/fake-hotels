One of the best hotels in the world. Beautiful furniture and a real 5 star service ! Outstanding breakfast and restaurant. Dinner at the terrace is a must. Beautiful views into the lagune. Best time to visit is November till dezember as the city is deserted and you can enjoy Venice through and through.  Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare
