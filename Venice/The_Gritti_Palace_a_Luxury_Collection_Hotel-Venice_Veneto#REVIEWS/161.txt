Stayed in the Gritti during our time in Venice. We got an upgrade to the Dalmatian Suite, which is in the quiet back of the hotel. While not directly in view of the canal, it still turned out to be an exciting stay. Lot's of antiques and art in the rooms, which are kept in the original style with modern amenities. While Venice is small overall, the Gritti is central to most sights, such as Rialto, Marcus square, etc... There is even a Vaporetto station just around the corner. This hotel certainly lives up to its excellent reputation!Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
