We arrived two days after the worst flooding the hotel has experienced in 50 years and you would never know how bad it was.  This hotel is without doubt the most luxurious, fabulous and magnificent place I have ever stayed. The Wow factor is difficult to fully articulate to be honest.  The building itself is stunning with thee most amazing decor in reception and throughout. The views from the dining room are incredible also.  The room itself was like nothing Iâ€™ve ever seen with attention to detail second to none. I particularly loved the bathroom and its lavish marble interior.  Final compliment must go to the staff who are exceptional in every way.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.Read moreDate of stay: November 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
