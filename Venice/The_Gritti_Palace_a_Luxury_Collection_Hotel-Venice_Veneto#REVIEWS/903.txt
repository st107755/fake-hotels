A magnificent hotel beyond compare. As it was a trip arranged by my husband for my birthday we were upgraded to the most wonderful room directly overlooking the grand canal and the glorious Santa Maria della Salute. We had complimentary vases of roses, chocolates and champagne in the room and it would have been so easy just to spend the next three days not leaving the room!  The service was impeccable, dining at the hotel in the evening was wonderful and having lunch and drinks on the terrace, overlooking the Grand Canal just amazing.  Even though our visit was in February we had cloudless blue skies for our three days and the glorious Venezia showed at its very best.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
