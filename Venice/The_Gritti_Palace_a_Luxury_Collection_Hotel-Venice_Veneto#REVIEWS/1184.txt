This was the first stop on a two week family vacation with a 16 & 18 year old. We travelled from Washington DC to celebrate 4 birthday, a high school graduation and a 20th wedding anniversary! I knew that the prices were going to be over the top, but the hotel is a floating museum. You are situated on the Grand Canal with endless views. The rooms are impeccable, small by American standards, but American standards are unrealistic. No detail was left behind. The service and location could not have been better, and with two teenagers, they were able to go out in the evening and navigate the local area without any hesitation on my part or theirs. This was a most memorable hotel experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
