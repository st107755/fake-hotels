This was the most gorgeous hotel we stayed in on our trip! The staff are wonderful! They took care of everything we could have possibly needed. The hotel is impeccable! The rooms are beautifully decorated. The location is amazing. The food at the hotel in the restaurant is to die for. We dined there on multiple occasions, even though we normally prefer to get out and try new places. You have to get the risotto! On top of the excellent food, the restaurant also has gorgeous views since it is located directly on the Grand Canal. We are definitely going back to Venice and staying at this hotel. I could not have been happier. There is not a single thing I could complain about, and I could keep gushing for paragraphs!
