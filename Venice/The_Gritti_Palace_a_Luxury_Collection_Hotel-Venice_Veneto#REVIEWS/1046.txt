This hotel is perfect. That simple. The location is superb and right on the Grand Canal. There's a reason why it's the most prestigious in Venezia (or #2 to Cipriani?). It's a grande dame in every way and totally worth of that title. The rooms are gorgeous with all the accompaniments you'd expect in a super luxe hotel.

And the bar is of course a treat for an after dinner aperitif which you'll need given the superb food which abounds. Get a water taxi to and from for your trip; it is expensive but given that it'll take you 2 hours or more each way, I think it's worth it and an awesome experience.…Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your appreciated feedback and for having defined our Gritti “a Grande Dame”. The Gritti Palace, from its opening in 1948, continues to be one of the most prestigious hotels in Venice, with the competing advantage of its strategic position: its central location, at a walking distance from the points of major interest and in the main shopping area with prestigious Italian brands.  It is great that you acknowledged the “home feeling” which pervades our Gritti and its hushed luxury! Our F&B team is particularly grateful to you for having highlighted the quality of their food and for having recommended their services.  We look forward to welcoming you back, for other extensive explorations!   Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
