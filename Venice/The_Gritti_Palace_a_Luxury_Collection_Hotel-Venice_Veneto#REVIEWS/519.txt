I travel often, both for work and pleasure. Seldom do I find the desire to write a review for a property; Gritti Palace is the exception. It is perhaps the finest hotel I have ever stayed in. Well appointed in every way, excellent service with an incredible staff.   Upon arrival, it felt as though they were anticipating you getting there. There is great recognition for SPG platinum, as my suite night request was granted. What a suite it was, it was grand with a separate living area and balcony. Toiletries are provided by Aqua di Parma. We also received a complimentary bottle of wine with a box of chocolates. Every detail is accounted for, and we departed not wanting to leave. Cannot wait to return! Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
