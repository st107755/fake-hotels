The price of hotel is overpriced, but it is just like other hotels in Venice. One must come to this hotel by a water taxi, if you would like to experience Venice. Great location, professional staff. My favorite person is the bartender, R. I loved talking to him. He knows how and when to talk with guests. He made a special drink (hot lemon) in order to prevent hangover. Hemmingways room is worth staying.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
