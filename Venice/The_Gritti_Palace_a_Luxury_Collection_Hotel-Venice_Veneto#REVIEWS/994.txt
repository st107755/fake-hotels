We found this to be one of the most beautiful hotel we visited. It was not only about a magical location, Venice, but this former residence of a Venetian Doge exudes history from the building to the furniture. Elegance at its best.

We found the concierge to be very helpful and discrete.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
