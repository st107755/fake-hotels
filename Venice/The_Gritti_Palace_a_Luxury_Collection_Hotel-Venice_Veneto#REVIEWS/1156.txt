We stayed here one night as a birthday celebration having previously stayed 3 nights at the Bauer Palace. Having had a nightmare at Bauer Palace - the Gritti Palace was a welcomed relief.  This hotel was renovated about 2 years back and is classy while giving you a sense of old world charm. Rooms are decorated based on a luxurious modern hotel and are clean.  The location of the hotel is also convenient. Close to shops like Gucci and Ferragamo and about 10 minutes walk to St Marco.  I would certainly recommend this hotel for a nice beautiful holiday in Venice. My biggest regret was not staying here during my 4 nights in Venice and foolishly stayed at the Bauer Palace before this hotel.  Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
