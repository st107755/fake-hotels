We stayed for 6 nights.   From the time we arrived to the time we left we received first class service from the staff.  Our suite had a bottle of champagne, fresh roses and delicious chocolates with a welcome letter  Breakfast on the terrace each morning was lovely. A combination of buffet and a la carter with views across the Grande Canal was a special start to the day.  The suite was beautiful and the daily housekeeping and turn down service added to the luxury of our stay.  A nicely stocked mini bar with tasty snacks and complimentary bottle water each day  The bathroom had lovely Aqua Di Parma goodies topped up throughout the week  We dined in the restaurant twice during the week and found the dishes extremely tasty - fully recommend ! Great wine lists and wonderful dessertsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
