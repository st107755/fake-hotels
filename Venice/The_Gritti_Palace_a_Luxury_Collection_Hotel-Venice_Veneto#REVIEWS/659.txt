This is one of THE places to stay in Venice (along with the Cipriani).  Overall, you probably will not be disappointed.  Pros:  Decor, luxury, location. You just can't beat being right on the Grand Canal.  Cons:  Service.  If I were paying that much money, I certainly would not want to treated so disdainfully.  The service staff overall does not speak English very well (or are they just faking those very thick accents?) and look "annoyed" any time you approach them.   I make an exception for the restaurant wait staff who seem to understand customer service.  The breakfast is fabulous and dining "canalside" really is a memorable experience.  Personally, I'd find a friendlier place and just splurge and take a meal here.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Aug 5, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting your comments on TripAdvisor.   Whilst we are pleased that you consider our Gritti the place to stay in Venice and very much appreciated our palace, its d√©cor and its location, we regret that you evaluated the staff not as expected and not mastering your mother language.   We are sorry that you left Venice disappointed with the services provided, although with the exception of the restaurant waiting staff, and it is our hope that you will honor us with a return stay to let you experience the usual welcoming and caring attitude of the entire team.
