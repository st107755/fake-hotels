This hotel has a lot of history and is an amazing hotel.  It’s centrally located with quick access to the canal, St. Marks Square and other points of interest. It’s very well appointed and great staff to take care of all your needs.  Breakfast on the canal has an amazing view....we loved every moment of our stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
