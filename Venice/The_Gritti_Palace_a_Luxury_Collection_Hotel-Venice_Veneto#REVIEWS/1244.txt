While the hotel is a short walk from the action of St Marks square it is in no way a negative to the elegance and charm of this gem.  In fact it was nice not being in the middle of everything and being able to retreat to a little slice of heaven.  The hotel has recently undergone a renovation and it feels like it did when it first opened except with all the modern conveniences.  It is truly a jewel box of a hotel with wonderful service and a delicious restaurant.  While not cheap by any standard it does deliver on what a luxury property should be.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 30, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for having acknowledged the intimate and romantic atmosphere that reigns supreme in this aristocratic mansion built in 1475 as a private home, located in the heart of the city, few steps away from all major attractions, making it the ideal base for exploring the treasures and marvels of Venice.
