Everything about this hotel is exceptional, from the first steps you will feel so special, the reception warm welcome and the recognizing make you feel at home , and as a platinum SPG member you will not be let down , we received our upgrade to a very nice suite . Words are not enough to describe the levels of luxury in the rooms , about the hotel location, it's only a short walk around the corner and you will be in a network of small streets full of goodies and hi end shopping plus a lot of Murano glass shops . I strongly recommend this hotel ,,  ahh one more thing , you will not find a hotel with better view than the great Gritti Palace hotel . Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
