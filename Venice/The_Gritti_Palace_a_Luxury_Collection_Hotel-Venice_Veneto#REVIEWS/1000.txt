i stayed at the gritti palace as part of my honeymoon in april 2015. it was a beautiful hotel with great customer service. the hotel is pricey-but the rooms are spectacular. i was upgraded to a large suite that had two washrooms and three balaconies. the room even had a door bell. the hotel was helpful in arranging sight-seeing and made us feel like welcomed guests that mattered.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen our Gritti Palace for your romantic journey.
