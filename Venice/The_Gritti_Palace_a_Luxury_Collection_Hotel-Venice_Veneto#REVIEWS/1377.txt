We visited the bar of this recently refurbished hotel for a late night drink and it was a fabulous experience. While we paid more than in an average bar, this is far from an average hotel. We took our drinks on the terrace besides the Grand Canal and the views were stunning.  Even if you cannot afford to stay at the Griiti Palace and most people won't be able to please go there for a drink as a special treat for yourself. You'll carry the memory for a long time.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded May 17, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your courteous comment, which I am delighted to read.
