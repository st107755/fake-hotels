Probably the most beautiful classic hotel i ever seen.Rich in History as well.stuffs are friendly and quite handy.Service is excellent.Breakfast restaurant has beautiful  and warm cozy atmosphere.Location is great.it is only takes 3 min walk from Piazza San Marco.Which is the best area i guess.I really enjoyed staying with The Gritti Palace.🙏Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
