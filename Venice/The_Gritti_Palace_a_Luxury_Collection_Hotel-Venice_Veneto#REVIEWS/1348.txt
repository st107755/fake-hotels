From the moment we docked at the Gritti Palace until we departed, the Gritti Palace delivered the experience I was expecting and more. I have not seen the property prior to it's $60M renovation, but it is absolutely stunning in every detail of the decor. The room we had was so beautiful and luxurious, I felt like a little princess. Though the room did not have a view, it was very comfortable and the best sleep we had 7 days into our European vacation. The staff was wonderful and very attentive, from the check in experience, to the wait staff at Bar Longhi, to the housekeeping staff who found us after we checked out to bring me my shoes I forgot in the room.
