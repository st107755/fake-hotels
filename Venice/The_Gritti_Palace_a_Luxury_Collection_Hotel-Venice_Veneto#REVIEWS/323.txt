My 11 year old daughter and I just stayed at the Gritti for 3 nights.  I’m a platinum SPG member and this is by far the best SPG hotel I’ve ever stayed in.  In fact, in addition to the Palazzo Sasso in Ravello and the Broadmoor in Colorado, it’s one of my favorite hotels ever.  The rooms are perfect (they accommodated a beautiful upgrade for us which was sooo appreciated), as is the service and the location.  I can’t imagine staying anywhere else in Venice.  Thank you Mr. Lorenzoni and all of the wonderful Gritti staff!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
