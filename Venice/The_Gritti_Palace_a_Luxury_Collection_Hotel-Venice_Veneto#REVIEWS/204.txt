If on one hand, I am pleased to read that your contacts with our Concierge team prior to your arrival were satisfactory, on the other hand, I very much regret to learn that your personal interaction with our Concierge Umberto left you with some bitter in your mouth. I must very honestly say that in 10 years of management of The Gritti Palace I do not recall having had any complaint towards Umberto, who is usually recognized and praised for his efficiency and professional attitude being one of the most experienced persons in the team.   He is concerned as well for your feedback and feels sorry not only for the occurrence (that he is not able to recall) but also for having somehow marred your stay with us.    We would be very appreciative if you would be so kind as to contact the Executive Office to better understand the mentioned circumstances. We would love to show you that your experience has been an exception to a rule of dedicated and prompt assistance to each one of our Guests and hope to welcome you back very soon for a flawless and highly enjoyable stay.  Yours sincerely,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
