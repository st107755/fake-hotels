Beautiful Venice hotel, spent 5 nights here in April. Traditional decor, spacious rooms and bathrooms. The suite we stayed in had double sinks which was great to have 2 people getting ready at the same time in the morning. The ensuite bath is separate from the bedroom area by 3 steps leading into the bathroom. The property has a beautiful outdoor terrace at their restaurant to watch the Gondoliers manuveur along the canal. Expect spectacular service, great food quality and a romantic ambience.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
