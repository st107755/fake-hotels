I could not get into the hotel Danieli where I had had a great stay years before. This hotel is the most beautiful place I have ever seen. It could be 2017, 1957 or 1907. It is along a canal and has a very elegant restaurant along the canal. Top notch Concierge. Got us a last minute reservation for dinner a stones throw from the hotel where we were given a great table. They also had us picked up from the train station and a guide waiting to show us the major sights. They were very excited to have upgraded our room. What a room- marble floors oriental rugs antique beautiful furniture , rizzoli books on the coffee table of the living room with fresh flowers. Floor to ceiling silk draperies and a solid marble bathroom with huge soaking tub and a shower for you and your friends.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
