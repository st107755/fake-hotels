We visited Venice as a family group, three couples and one child, and The Gritti Palace was a splendid base from which to explore the city. It sits on the Grand Canal and enjoys a terrace deck on the water's edge where one can take coffee, dine or just relax and watch the action on the bustling canal.

You are indeed correct stating that we were subject to flooding on the ground floor due to the high water phenomenon, which, although lasting few hours a day, caused a huge inconvenience to our guests and to our daily operation.   Through the restoration The Gritti was improved and upgraded, protecting the ancient structure dating back to 1475 from the threat of the Aqua Alta floods, and restored to its former glory by retaining all that made it great such as its heritage as a private palazzo and locus for art and culture.  We hope there will be another occasion for you to visit our unique property.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
