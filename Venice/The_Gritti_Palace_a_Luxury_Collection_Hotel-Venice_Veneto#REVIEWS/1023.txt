We stayed here for 3 nights in late April 2015 as part of a British Airways holiday. We were put in a fantastic suite the like of which I have never seen before. Beautiful marble, paintings, furniture, etc. The service was wonderful - in fact everything about the hotel was wonderful. Very nice staff. We would go back at the drop of a hat if we could get the same deal again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jun 1, 2015Dear Guest,  We are so pleased that you were positively impressed with the suite we managed to assign you as well as with the staff’s attitude.
