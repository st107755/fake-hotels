We were not staying at the Gritti Palace hotel but came for dinner in the restaurant. The experience was so amazing that we came back two more times during our week in Venice. On all three occasions, the dining experience we had was quite simply the best in all of Venice. The quality and range of menu dishes was exceptional, none more so than the Chateaubriand which was theatrically carved at the table right in front of us. The service was exceptional - we were remembered by name, together with dietary needs and preferences, and nothing was too much trouble. A birthday cake was even presented to mark a special occasion (and without the staff being asked for one!). The setting on the terrace right by the Grand Canal is pure magic.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Sep 30, 2014Dear Guest,  It was truly a pleasure having you as our Guest at our Club del Doge restaurant during your recent visit to Venice and thank you for returning so often during your week in Venice!
