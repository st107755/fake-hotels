We had an excellent experience at this waterside pub/bar.  The service was phenomenal and attentive, rates were high but reasonable given the locale.  Gondola station right next door and taxi dock in front provided for lots of people and event watching.  This is a must stop in for a drink kind of place.  Donâ€™t miss it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
