My spouse and I spent one night at this hotel while we were in Italy for 10 nights.  It was an amazing place!  WOW WOW WOW.  Did I say WOW?  This hotel is by far the nicest Starwood Luxury Property that I have personally stayed at.  Amazing service, amazing food, amazing rooms - the outdoor bar seating that is directly on the Grand Canal....by far the best place to sit and enjoy a glass of wine.  Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
