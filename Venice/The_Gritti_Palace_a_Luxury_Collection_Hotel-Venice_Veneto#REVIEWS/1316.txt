Gritti Palace is a beautiful, intimate hotel with top notch service and the best of everything. The rooms were large, luxurious and comfortable. The hotel's location is perfect for walking to all the sights and best restaurants.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and I could not have asked for a better experience when staying in Venice. Well worth the price!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
