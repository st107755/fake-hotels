We stayed here to wind down an SPG-trip through Italy having come from the St. Regises in Rome and Florence – what a way to end the trip. The Gritti is absolutely gorgeous. The service was very warm and helpful. The room was magnificent. And the location was terrific, close to a vaporetto stand as well as walking distance to most major sights in Venice (although it’s such a small city I’d imagine most hotels are close to the main sights!).    The only minor complaint was that the bar decor and service were a little subpar compared to all the other spectacular service and grandeur.    Despite that, we were very sad when we had to leave this place!Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 27, 2015Dear Guest,  We are enchanted by your enthusiastic comments for which we thank you very much.  The central location of our Palace on the Grand Canal makes it the best place to reside, being all major attractions at a walking distance. Moreover, the private dock and the very close public water bus stop, allow any furthermost Venetian site of interest to be reached either by private water taxi or by public water bus.  We are also pleased that you perceived the warmth of our personalized service and the readiness of our staff, unfortunately and regretfully, with the exception of our bar. We look forward to take extra care of you on your next trip to Venice and to us.  Yours sincerely,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
