Really close to 5 Stars!  The suite was a bit cramped and the food was terrific, but not much different from virtually all restaurants in Venice. A Grand Slam on the view and proximity to the sights so itâ€™s really 4.5-4.75 Stars in my book.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
