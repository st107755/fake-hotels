We were fortunate enough to stay in one of the suites for a couple of nights. Everything about this hotel is incredible. The rooms, service, food, ambience, decoration. Pure luxury and opulence. Nicest place I've ever stayed in a wonderful city. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
