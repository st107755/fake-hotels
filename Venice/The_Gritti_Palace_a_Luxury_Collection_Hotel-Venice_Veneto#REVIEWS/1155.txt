Visited Venice, Florence and Rome. We had the best time in Venice largely due to our stay at the Gritii Palace. Having a meal or a drink on the terrace .... it just doesn't get any better.  We stayed at other very nice hotels throughout our visit in Italy including the St Regis in Florence ( which was also nice)... but the Gritti Palace was the clear winner.  If you can afford to splurge, you wont be disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
