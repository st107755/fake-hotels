My family and I stayed for one night at this hotel, we had two executive rooms and they were amazing, our rooms were connected by a hallway with a door from the outside, it had a feel of a small apartment with an exception of a kitchen.  everything was beautifully detailed..  when we arrived they were very welcoming, the concierge services was really good..   The only thing that bothered me was that its a little bit complicated to get to the hotel, we had a car so we parked it and then moved all the luggage to take a water taxi that was far from the parking,  it would be nice if the hotel would arrange this prior to our visit or informed us.. so keep this in mind and ask for assistance before.   overall, location, food, service and furniture is amazing.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 30, 2014Dear Guest,   We wish to thank you for having chosen our Gritti Palace for your recent visit and for having posted your impressions.
