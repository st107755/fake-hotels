The cocktail bar waiters will give you just a scanning menu without asking whether you have a device with which to scan.  Cocktails are not special although the decor is as pretty as it ever was. There is a feeling of cost saving.  Even their hot chocolate was this and lukewarm where it used to be thick, and creamy and piping hot.   Pity.Read moreDate of stay: October 20202 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Paolo Lorenzoni, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded 4 weeks agoDear Guest,  Thank you very much for your loyalty and for taking time to give us your feedback based on your last experience at our bar that clearly did not reflect the usual high standard you were accustomed to.  I apologize if a member of our team offered you a subpar service, which, I assure you, is not related to any cost saving.   After having removed all menus printed on paper as a measure to inhibit the possible spread of Covid19, we replaced them with the international widely used QR code, contained in an item that can be, and in fact is, sanitized after every touch.   Cocktail list, as well as any food and beverage items are the same high quality as ever.  We trust that we will soon have the pleasure of welcoming you back so that our Barmen will have the opportunity to show that their capabilities did not diminish!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
