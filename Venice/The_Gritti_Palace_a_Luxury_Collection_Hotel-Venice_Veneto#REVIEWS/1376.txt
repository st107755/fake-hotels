Stayed here in April. I was blown away by my stay and would return to this location .  This hotel is amazing from the ornate lobbies to the tasteful decor of guest rooms and helpful staff.  The location is excellent and the lounge and restaurant on deck over looking grand canal are great. If you want to be immersed in complete luxury this is the perfect hotel.   The lasting Impression was cordial staff who did anything and everything they could to help.   The exterior of hotel is rather ordinary but the interior is anything but ( In a good way)  The terrace is a Great place to enjoy afternoon drink after busy day in Venice .  It is a palace in every sense of the word  and  has a wonderful atmosphere.   Would also be A perfect romantic getaway if that is what you looking for.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded May 17, 2013Dear Guest,  I wish to thank you for the time taken to post your most kind review, which I read with great delight, learning that you enjoyed your stay at the renewed Gritti being most impressed both by the restoration and the service delivered by our associates.
