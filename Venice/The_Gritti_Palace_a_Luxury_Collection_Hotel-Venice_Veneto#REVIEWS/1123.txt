Best hotel stay ever and my wife agrees. From the moment we arrived at the hotel and met Ivan the assistant manager  we were made to feel very special. Our room was perfect in every way. Brunch on the Grand canal was sumptuous and not to be missed. The location is central and perfect. Thank you Gritti Palace for the hotel stay of a lifetime.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
