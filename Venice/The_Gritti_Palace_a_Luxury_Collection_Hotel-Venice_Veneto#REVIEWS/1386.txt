The restoration of the Gritti is amazing. The marble bathrooms are stunning and spacious. Upgraded electronics in the room, and super fast wifi (free for SPG platinum) are terrific. Service in the bar and restaurant are at very high standards. New spa and fitness center are beautiful. The property is fully renewed while maintaining all of the luxury and charm of the antiques and furnishings from the 1700-1800s and many older artifacts on display. Outstanding concierge staff and location can't be beat.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 21, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing with us your memories of your recent visit at The Gritti Palace, which I have transmitted with pleasure to all our staff.
