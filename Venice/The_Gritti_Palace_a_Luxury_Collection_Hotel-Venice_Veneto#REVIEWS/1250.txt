Arriving by water taxi was the start of a great trip. Lunch on the spectacular terrace overlooking the grand canal. Service was excellent and I knew I had made the right choice of hotel. Elegant rooms well equipped. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast is just the best with a super selection followed by wonderful eggs benedict, and all the time the view amazes.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
