We stayed as a couple for two nights in March in a venitian 700 room. This is a great hotel, world class, faultless service, lovely bars and restaurants, lovely location and steeped in history and intrigue. We loved the pictures on the wall of celebrities that have stayed. Our only slight disappointment, although a lovely room was a lack of a view, we were told it was the second largest suite, but only had two small windows overlooking the rooftops (418 4th floor) with steps leading up to them, at a stretch you could see a bit of the grand canal. Overall though a touch of class and well deserved as a luxury hotel of the world.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
