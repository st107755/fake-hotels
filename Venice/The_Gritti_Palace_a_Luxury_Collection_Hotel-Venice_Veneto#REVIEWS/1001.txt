Stayed here last October for the architecture biennial. This is a very beautiful hotel with the most amazing terrace which we used for all meals. The private water taxi organised by the hotel in my opinion is a must! This was my first visit to Venice and to arrive to the sights of Venice in daylight and leave to the lights in the evening by boat is a memory that will stay with me.  This is a very expensive hotel but worth every penny!Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
