Spent a single night here and I must say that it is just an amazing hotel.  Even my teenage daughter was impressed and nothing impresses her.  The hotel has great staff, great views and luxury that is just out of this world.  Even though the hotel is amazingly luxurious, it also felt very comfortable and relaxed.  San Marco is just a short walk from the hotel and there are great restaurants everywhere.  Venice exceeded our expectations and I can't image a better place to stay than The Gritti Palace.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded May 21, 2013Dear Guest, Thank you for the very nice review which makes honor to the Palace and all the Staff working in to deliver a unique emotional experience.
