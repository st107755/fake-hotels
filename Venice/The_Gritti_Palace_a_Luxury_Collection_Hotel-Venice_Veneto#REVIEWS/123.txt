We stopped here for a lazy lunch in the sun on the terrace.  The staff were superb and really friendly.  The waiter was very knowledgable about the wine and recommended a superb bottle of Barolo.  The view across the canal was wonderful, with lots going on and we left feeling in a great mood.  I would highly recommend this place if you want to relax in Venice for a few hours in a picturesque spot and are willing to spend some money on excellent wine.  I can see why it is a famous hotel.
