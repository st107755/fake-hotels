As with all the luxury collection hotels, it really is luxury all the way, from the suite, all the way through reception, restaurant, bar, and terrace. All the staff that I spoke to were very knowledgeable, courteous and very helpful. The food at breakfast and dinner was superb. If had to say anything untoward about this hotel it would be that the bar and restaurant are very expensive, not a little expensive but approximately 3 times more that other restaurants of similar quality, but without the views of The Grand Canal.   All that said, a wonderful experience made better by the staff.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
