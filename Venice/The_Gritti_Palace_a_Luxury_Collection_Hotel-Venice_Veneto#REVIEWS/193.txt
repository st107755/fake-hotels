My wife and I had lunch here at 2pm in Sept 28th 2018 and it was fantastic .  The setting is on the waterside and it was so different and beautiful.  Yes the menu is expensive but worth the experience when in Venice .   The Corperto is ‚Ç¨9 each but that‚Äôs worth the spend for the experience.   I ordered the cheese burger üçî and it was amazing and my wife ordered a pasta dish .  We both had a few glasses of wine each and the service was very good.  Definitely worth dropping into if nearby in Venice for the experience alone.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
