We loved our stay at the Gritti Palace. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and sits right on the water. The best part is having a drink or eating breakfast outside. The front desk staff is not the friendliest, but that seems to be a trend in Venice. The wait staff was incredibly nice. The hotel itself was spectacular as was the room.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
