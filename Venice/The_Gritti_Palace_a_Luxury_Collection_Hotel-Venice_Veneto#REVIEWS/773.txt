This was the first time that we had visited another hotel chain outside of the Four Seasons! And thank goodness we did. This hotel was absolutely incredible from minute one to the last we could not have faulted anything. We arrived and were welcomed by the most welcoming concierge who after we had sat down at once told us what they were going to give us on top of our reservation. We were astonished at the level of customer service throughout each and every staff member pre-empting every one of our needs.  Would thoroughly recommend this place it is worth every penny!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
