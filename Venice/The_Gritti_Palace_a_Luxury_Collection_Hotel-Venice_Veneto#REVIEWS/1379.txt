What a wonderful hotel.  The staff was helpful and friendly, and upgraded us to a suite overlooking the canal, offered us a free in-room breakfast, and assisted us with buying train tickets and all of our questions.  The decor was gorgeous and the view from our room even more stunning.  It was in a fantastic location as well, nearby to all major tourist attractions.  Thank you, Gritti Palace!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
