My husband and I stayed here as a last minute stop in Venice on our way home from Slovenia. Such a gorgeous hotel!! Service was amazing and the room stunning. They arranged a water taxi to the airport from their front dock for us. We felt very well taken care of. We will definitely come back! Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare
