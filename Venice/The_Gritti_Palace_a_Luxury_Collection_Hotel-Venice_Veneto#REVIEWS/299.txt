As a party of 6 ranging in age from 85 -5 each & everyone of us felt taken care of by staff who offered just the right balance of excellent service but without intruding. The food was delicious as were the cocktails. The view from the terrace is stunning & we left feeling relaxed & happy, albeit having spent quite a bit on lunch. However, you get what you pay for & this place is worth every penny. Thank you to all staff who worked PM on Monday 1 May :)Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
