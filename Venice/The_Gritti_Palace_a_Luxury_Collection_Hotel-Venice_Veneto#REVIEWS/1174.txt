I spent three nights here in February, a perfect time to visit Venice.  The Gritti Palace completed the magic that is Venice.  One of my favorite memories is having lunch outside on the Grand Canal.  The delicious risotto and a bottle of wine while watching the traffic on the canal  was delightful.  The service is impeccable, from check-in to departure.  We had an extremely early departure for the airport.  We were awakened promptly with a lovely room service breakfast.  The staff was out in excellent form to see us to our water taxi.  Rooms are lovely.  A delightful experience.  I hope to return.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
