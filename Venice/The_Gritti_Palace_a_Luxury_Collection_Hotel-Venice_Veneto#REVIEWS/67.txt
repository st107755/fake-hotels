This must be our 6th or 7th stay at the hotel over the years, and I can honestly say that we have never, ever had any bad experiences, which some people appear to unfortunately have had.

It is wonderful to just sit on the outdoor terrace and watch the world pass by.  The hotel is also in a very good & quiet location, with only an easy 10 minute walk to St. Mark's Sq.
