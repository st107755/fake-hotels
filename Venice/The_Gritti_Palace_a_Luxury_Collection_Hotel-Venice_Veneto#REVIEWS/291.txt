My husband, daughter and I stayed at this beautiful hotel for two nights last month.   Honestly, I didn't have high hopes because I'd heard that Venice hotels were on the shabby-chic side, and we much prefer a modern style. But we were pleasantly surprised by our stay.  Rooms are clean and very well appointed.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.  Location is great.  The only negative is room service...which is terrible and confused and I suggest you avoid it.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, or to recommend it to others!Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
