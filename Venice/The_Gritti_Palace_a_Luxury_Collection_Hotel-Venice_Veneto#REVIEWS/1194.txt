I took the vapareto  (15 Euro)  from the airport and the stop was just minutes for the hotel.  Our room was at the back of the hotel, so no view, we looked out onto an other building (we had cashed in points, so I am guessing that you do not get as good a room as paying guest). We did not spend a lot of time in the room, so I guess really no big deal.   Our room was beautiful, the wall coverings, large cupboard, and the bed linens and murano glass lamps. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows.  The bathroom was marble with nice shower/rain shower, and separate tub.  The staff were very friendly and pleasant.  All in all we really liked the location of the hotel, a short walk to San Marco, and all the touristy areas. It was nice to sit on the patio and enjoy a drink inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
