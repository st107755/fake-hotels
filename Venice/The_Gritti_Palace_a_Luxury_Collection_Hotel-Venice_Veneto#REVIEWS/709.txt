I stayed in this hotel whilst researching others - having looked around the other top hotels in Venice I can say with confidence this is the best. Super position with great views of the grand canal from the room, bar, breakfast & lunch (didn't eat there at night) Super, classically Venitian rooms, opulently decorated with wonderful bathroom & toiletries! Great service & consierge. The only other hotel I thought close was the Danielli. A certain recommendation from me. And go during the Masquerade Ball season - fabulous !Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
