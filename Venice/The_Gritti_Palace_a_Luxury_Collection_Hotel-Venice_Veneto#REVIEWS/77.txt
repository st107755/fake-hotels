We stayed at the Gritti Palace in July of 2019.  What a great experience.  The staff, the room, the terrace overlooking the main canal were all perfect.  They arranged all of our transportation via Riva boats and have an ATM on property (which is a difficult thing to find in Venice).  They even arranged a walking tour of the city for us, and a once in a lifetime dinner/fireworks show during the Redeemer's Feast.  There are many nice hotels in Venice, but the location, accommodations, and staff make this one the best.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
