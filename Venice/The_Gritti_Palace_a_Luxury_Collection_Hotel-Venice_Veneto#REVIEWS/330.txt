We spent three days there.  The history of the place can be felt throughout the hotel. The concierge was top notch. This is not cheap as we paid upward of $600 per night. But it was well worth it.  The breakfast is just amazing with its diversity.  Again it is not cheap at $50.  We had the best hot, thick chocolate ever at the bar.  This is pure elegance.
