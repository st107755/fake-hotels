This hotel is located right in the heart of Venice, right on the Grand Canal. Its a short walk to St Marks, Doge's Palace and Rialto bridge and Peggy Gugenheim museum. What an old-world, magical place. Years of history have been well maintained and updated to the very best of todays technology and services. If you can stay here, do so, you will be rewarded with a truly magical, historical and timeless experience. Giovanni was especially helpful at check in. An added bonus was the recommendation to dine at Beccafica in Campo Santo Stefano. Absolutely delicious and frequented by locals-not tourists-always a good sign. I wouldn't have them do my laundry-its VERY expensive.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
