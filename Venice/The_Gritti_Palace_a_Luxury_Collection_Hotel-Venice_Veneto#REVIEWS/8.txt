I have been fortunate enough to stay at both the Cipriani and the Gritti Palace and in my opinion if you are after high end luxury while visiting Venice stay at the Gritti Palace.  It is more convenient and you can enjoy your breakfast, early evening cocktails and late night drinks on its fabulous terrace overlooking the Grand Canal.  The hotel is elegant and refined, the rooms are sumptuous and comfortable, the staff attentive and helpful.  It's just lovely!Read moreDate of stay: September 2020HelpfulShare
