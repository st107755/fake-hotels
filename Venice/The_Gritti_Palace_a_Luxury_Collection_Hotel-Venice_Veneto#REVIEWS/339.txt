We are just back from a 4 night stay at the Gritti Palace. I have to say that if it were possible to give more than 5 stars then I would do. It was the most amazing hotel with superb staff. From the minute we arrived in our water taxi we were greeted by name, looked after, upgraded and generally treated so well. Our rooms were on floor 2A and extremely nice. The hotel just feels authentic and yet luxurious. We had drinks in the bar where again everything was wonderful. Our teenage children were well looked after also. The hotel is in a fabulous location and basically my only problem with it is whether it has spoiled us for other places! Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
