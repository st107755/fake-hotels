While I didn't stay at the hotel, my wife an I did have a drink on deck behind the hotel and enjoyed simply the best view of the Basilica di Santa Maria Della Salute.  Breathtaking.  If you are in Venice, you must stop by at night and see this site. A truly memorable experience.Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
