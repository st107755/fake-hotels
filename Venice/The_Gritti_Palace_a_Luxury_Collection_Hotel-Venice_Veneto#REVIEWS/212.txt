Our family had the great fortune to stay at the Gritti Palace last week and our visit surpassed all of our expectations.  From our room to the excursions planned through the hotel everything was perfect. Our room was spacious and beautifully appointed.  Ivan and his team of Gabrielle and Michele made sure we had the most wonderful guides and that each experience was tailored to our interests.  There is no better place to watch Venice go by than on the terrace of the Gritti Palace enjoying a fantastic glass of wine.  Thank you to everyone at the Gritti Palace .Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
