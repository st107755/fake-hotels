One of the best Hotels we have ever stayed at, Luxury rooms, over the top on service, Helpful on all our needs.  A boat took us from airport to the hotel the staff was waiting for us to arrive and we were early.  The hotel suggested we go to Murano Glass and they had a nice boat pick us up, and again another nice boat to take us to the train station.  (Forget the gondola rides) The hotel has a boat to take you on a day trip.  Breakfast so so delicious.   We had two rooms one for our teen children on for us.  Both rooms were gorgeous.  Would stay here again, this was a hotel that was helped picked by SPG agent and we used points- I'm so glad we trusted the SPG agent on helping pick a room.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
