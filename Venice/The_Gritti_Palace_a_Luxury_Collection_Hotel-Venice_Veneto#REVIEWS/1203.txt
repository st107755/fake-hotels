This intimate, sumptuous hotel is perfect. Unlike many hotels with a priceless view, the food is divine. The pasta spinosini may have been the best pasta I ever tasted in my entire life, and I am of Italian descent. Staff is helpful and friendly, not the least bit haughty. The concierge set me up with an artist for a morning tour at very short notice. The only possible negative was our shower floor: a solid sheet of slippery marble. Gorgeous but dangerous spot in a stunning bathroom.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
