We stayed in this beautiful old hotel during Venice Biennale.  We figured we would be given a terrible room because we were staying during such a busy time and were using Starwood points but we were given an amazing suite that was beautifully decorated.  The service was amazing.   The bed was very comfortable.  They have a beautiful outdoor eating area.  This is a very special place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 8, 2014Dear Guest,  Your kind review of The Gritti Palace is very much appreciated.
