Imagine the the year is 1750 and you are a lord or lady attending the Carnival in Venezia, that is what it feels like when you enter the Griti Palace, the nicest hotel in Venice. The remodel they did is remarkable - how can something so new and beautiful feel so period? Our room was spacious with a huge marble bathroom and wonderful shower (and separate tub). The bed, linens, towels, etc. are all top notch. What looked to be quite fancy wallpaper turned out to be cloth on the walls, and of course a Venetian glass chandelier awaits. Service was superb, and unpretentious. Breakfast on the restaurant veranda overlooking the Grand Canal was amazing (pricey of course). The location is great, it takes 5-7 minute walk to get to St. Mark's Square and 10-15 minute walk to the Rialtoâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
