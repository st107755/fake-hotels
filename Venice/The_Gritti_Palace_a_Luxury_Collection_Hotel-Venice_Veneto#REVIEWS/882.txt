A wonderfully luxurious hotel in a perfect location.  An easy walk to restaurants and shops while feeling very private.  Eat breakfast on the terrace or enjoy an evening cocktail. The rooms are decorated in typical Venetian style offering a sense of old Venice. Overall a lovely hotelRead moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
