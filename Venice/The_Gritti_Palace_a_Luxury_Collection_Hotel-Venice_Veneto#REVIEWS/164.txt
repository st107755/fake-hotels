I have just returned from Venice having stayed at the Gritti Palace last week. A wonderful opportunity to catch up with a school friend. From the moment we stepped off the water taxi onto the private pier, it felt like coming home. This palazzo is spectacular in many ways; the history, location, architecture, works of art, service, cocktails and perfect pancakes with caramelised pecans at breakfast! But for me, it's the people that work at Gritti Palace that makes it exceptional. So thank you Ivan and your colleagues for a truly memorable stay. We look forward to seeing you next year.Read moreDate of stay: December 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
