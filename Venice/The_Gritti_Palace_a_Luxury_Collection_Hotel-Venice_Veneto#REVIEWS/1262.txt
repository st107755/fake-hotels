Arranged through the hotel to have a personal service meet us at the airport after a three legged overnight commute to get here. Nice way to ease arrival at the hotel. Very personalized service with Sylvia registering us and then giving us a guided tour of our suite. Can't say enough nice things about the accommodations. Liked the remote control skylight in the bedroom. Bathroom was over the top with marble everywhere. Enjoyed cicchetti and a drink on the deck facing the Grand Canal. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
