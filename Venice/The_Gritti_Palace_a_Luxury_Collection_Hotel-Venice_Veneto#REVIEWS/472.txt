This is first class all the way.  Room, sheets, pillow and towels are fantastic.  Location is perfect, and the deck on the Grand canal is the best view in Venice.  We are Starwood Platinum, so we had breakfast included.  Sitting in the sun on the terrace was great, but I am glad I didn't pay 50Euros for the privilege.  Drinks at night were also expensive, but were fantastic and well worth it. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
