I can't imagine a better hotel experience in Venice. The Gritti's location is central but quite, the staff is exceptionally well trained, the rooms and common areas have been beautifully renovated and, not to be ignored, the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever experienced. We have visited Venice several times but this was our first stay at the Gritti. We will certainly be staying here every time we visit in the future.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 20, 2017Dear Guest,  As an affectionate visitor of our unique city, we wish to thank you for your rewarding review highlighting the favourable elements that make The Gritti Palace your preferred Venetian hotel!
