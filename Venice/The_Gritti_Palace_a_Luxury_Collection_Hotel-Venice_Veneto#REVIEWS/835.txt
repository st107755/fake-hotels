From the initial welcome right through to checkout everything at the Gritti was faultless. We were offered an upgrade to a suite but decided to stick with our canal view room as that was our main reason for choosing the hotel and the view is indeed superb. The location is central but fairly quiet and within two minutes from the vaporetto, although a private water taxi to the hotel's private dock is not to be missed. Can't wait to stay again!Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Dec 29, 2015Dear Guest,  How delighted we are to read that everything during your sojourn at The Gritti Palace was faultless!   It is our pleasure to take good care of our Guests from the moment they walk in to the one they leave as well as to extend an eventual upgrade according to reservations’ conditions and availability permitting.  Thank you for having highlighted location of our hotel, “likely the best one in Venice”: indeed central and at the same time quiet.  We can't wait to open the doors of the Gritti on your next visit!
