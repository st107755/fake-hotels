My beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal would have been enough to make me love The Gritti Palace. The breakfasts, dinner and drinks on the terrace let you enjoy the present, while imagining the conversations of the writers and artists who came before you. The excellent staff and concierge will make all things possible. And the location could not be better. With all the cruise ships, it is better not to be too close to St Marks.  The Gritti Palace is an easy walk to anywhere and very close to a vaporetto stop.  Ne plus ultra.

We are overjoyed to read that you fell in love with the Gritti and that your fantasy allowed you to enjoy listening to conversations among writers and artists, our hotel having been for decades the “Venetian residence” of such distinguished international travelers!  We hope there will be an opportunity for you to visit The Gritti Palace again and perhaps enjoy a “live” celebrity sighting.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
