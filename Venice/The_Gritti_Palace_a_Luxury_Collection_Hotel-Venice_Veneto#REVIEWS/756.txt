I'm not sure what this is rated or how it's reviewed, but I can say that this little spot on the water is fit for kings and queens. From the tables made of such beautifully crafted wood to the chairs that scream luxury in the most elegant way, the view is almost secondary. Service is 5 star. Cocktails are out of this world. I think this little spot on the water began my love affair with this charming city. Come here and breathe, let this gorgeous spot shape your day and your stay in this special city. Don't miss it. Thank you to Gritti Palace for existing and keeping such high standards and making each person who enters feel like they are George and Amal Clooney.
