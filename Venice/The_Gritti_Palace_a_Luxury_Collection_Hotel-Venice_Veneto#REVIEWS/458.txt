Definitely a great place to enjoy Venice!  Very close to St Mark's square and all the conveniences the square offers.  The rooms are luxurious and the service is impeccable.  Located on the Grand Canal, breakfast is a beautiful experience to watch the waterways as the city comes to life.  Perfect place to stay!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
