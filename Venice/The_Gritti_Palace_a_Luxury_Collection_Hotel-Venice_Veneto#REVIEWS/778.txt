This is a top class beautiful hotel, in a perfect location.  My husband and I stayed for two nights to celebrate a special birthday.  The room and hotel was immaculate.  We booked a grand canal view room and the views were lovely. Every one of the hotel staff we encountered were excellent; friendly and professional.  The food was very good - we had breakfast and a meal in the Club del Doge Restaurant on one of the evenings. The bar and lounge area is relaxing and full of beautiful antiques. We organised a private transfer from the airport via the Concierge, which was timed perfectly.  The hotel went out of their way to make my Birthday special, which was much appreciated.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel 100% and hope to have the opportunity to stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Apr 1, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having chosen our Gritti Palace for your special birthday celebration: we are most delighted having rendered it a memorable one through the care and attention of the entire team, along with the first class services of our hotel.
