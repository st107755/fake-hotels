This location is a class act, and a long history of consistent superior guest service being provided.   Location is close to most of the key attractions. As we moved around the city, I really did not find any hotel location that would have been a more centralized place to lodge.  Room was very clean, and with nice warm d√©cor. We stayed two nights, and were well pleased with the fact that once inside our Suite, that even though there was lots of activities going on outside, we could not hear any of it from our Suite.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
