The hotel is an old palace, so as you can imagine each room is different, and decorated magnificently. We are SPG people, so some of the accommodations(wifi....was gratis) Having breakfast and/or cocktails outside on the grand canal is a must!!! Amazing way to start the day of touring in Venice....and of course ending the day with cocktails, as the sun goes down leaves me speechless....almost...what a magical city...only enhanced by such a beautiful hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
