We stayed here in June 2015. The room was wonderful and in fact was better than what was booked. Big room great big comfortable bed, fabulous bathroom and a bit of view of the Grand Canal, who would want more. But there was more the staff were so attentive and made you feel totally at ease in such a nice hotel. A huge thanks Guliano in the Concierge area, he was fantastic and likewise a huge vote of thanks to Angelo in the restaurant who made my night at dinner so special. Thanks guys. Also thanks to Maria, Andrea and Luca. Apologies to those personnel I didn't name but this hotel is pretty special. What a great location.  Even though our room was next to an elevator we didn't hear a single noise. Great stay and sorry it is over. Well done to all.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 3, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your praises!
