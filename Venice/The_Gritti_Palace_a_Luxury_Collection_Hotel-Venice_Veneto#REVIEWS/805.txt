We have been to Venice four times now and this was by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The decor was wonderful. The staff all polite and very accommodating Our room faced the canal - it was a good size , exquisitely furnished with a lovely bathroom. The breakfast buffet was superb - food was delicious and service was very good. The spa was to die for, just what we needed after a hectic day sightseeing.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 19, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having selected our Gritti Palace on the occasion of your fourth visit to our magical city.
