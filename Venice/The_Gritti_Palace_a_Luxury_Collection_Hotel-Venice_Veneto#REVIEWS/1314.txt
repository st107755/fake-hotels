Passing the Gritti one evening we decided to call in at the bar - it is really quite splendid and well worth a visit. Although our party included some casually dressed members (i.e. not Gritti-style people at all and sadly I was one of them) we were received courteously and seated without delay. A waiter took our order for cocktails: there were seven of us and he did not write anything down...........then he delivered them all to exactly the right people!  Professionalsm at its best. The drinks were 18 euros each and were well prepared and I could wish we had been able to stay longer.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
