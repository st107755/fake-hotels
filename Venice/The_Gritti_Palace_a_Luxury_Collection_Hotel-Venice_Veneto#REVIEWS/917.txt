The Gritti Palace is a gem. It is located right on the Grand Canal, 5 minutes walk from Piazza di San Marco. We spent 3 nights there and we would recommend it to anyone who wants great service and location right in the center of the city. I would like to mention that as we are members of Starwood Hotels, we got a free upgrade to one of the suites and it was amazing! Make sure you try their spa services as it is the perfect way to relax after a day's walk around Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
