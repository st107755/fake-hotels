The Gritti is stunningly beautiful and the staff very gracious and accommodating. We were upgraded as Starwood Preferred members, our room was exquisite and included a complementary bottle of wine and chocolates to welcome us.  Perfect location and the place to celebrate life's big moments.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
