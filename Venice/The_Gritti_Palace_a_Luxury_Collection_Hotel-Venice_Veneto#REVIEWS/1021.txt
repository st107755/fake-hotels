We spent a night in this hotel during the carnival. It is in a fantastic locaton on the water's edge with beautiful views. The views from (the delicious) breakfast were incredible.  The rooms were super cosy, but rather opulent and not really to my taste. Lots of gold fittings and velvet wallpaper...but I am sure some people will find the furnishing beautiful! I loved the blackout blinds.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
