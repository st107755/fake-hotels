This is a great hotel.  We stayed here for 2 night nights with our two kids.  This may be the best hotel renovation of an old building I have ever seen.  They managed to keep the character and feeling of the elegant old building, but with the fit and finish of new high-end construction.  This is really difficult to do I think, and the result is truly outstanding.  Our rooms were quite large by European standards.  The location is also excellent (a quick walk to San Marco), right next to a Vaporetto stop and on a nice little square.  Staff were very pleasant and professional.  Restaurant is very good and overlooks the Grand Canal.  The hotel feels very grown up (only a few other kids about) but the staff welcomed our children very warmly.
