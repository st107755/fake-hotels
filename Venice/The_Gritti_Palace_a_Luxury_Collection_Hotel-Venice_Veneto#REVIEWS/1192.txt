We do not usually venture into the rarefied atmosphere of luxury hotels, but a good online deal got us to the Gritti Palace for my daughter's 18th birthday.   It was as splendid as we expected -- antique furniture, handpainted walls, elevator walls of inlaid wood. The location was truly spectacular. We watched the Redentore fireworks explode behind the silhouette of the Salute from the roof terrace. The breakfasts were sumptuous beyond belief, and the canal-side terrace perfect for Venice-watching.   But what made the experience truly special was the professionalism, the warmth, the diligence of the staff. All seemed to love their work, to be devoted to caring for us. We never once felt intimidated or out of place.   All in all, I have never had a better stay in a hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
