My partner and I stayed at the gritti palace as a surprise for my 21st birthday. We had the most perfect stay. Arriving to the hotels entrance on the canal in a water taxi was an experience in itself. We were greeted by truly amazing staff who couldn't have done more to help us throughout our whole stay. Our room was stunning!! Acqua di Parma toiletries in the room were a lovely extra. Location is perfect, a short walk from st marks square and Rialto, on the canal and designer shops around the corner. We had dinner in the hotels restaurant, I am not a lover of fine dining but they did everything they could to accommodate my fussy eating habits. Food was delicious and service was out of this world. Plenty of choice for breakfast in the mornings. We enjoyed sitting on the terraceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
