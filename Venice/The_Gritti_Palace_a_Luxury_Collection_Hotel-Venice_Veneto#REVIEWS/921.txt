From the moment you step into this hotel you know it is truly special it like an Oasis from the hustle and bustle of Venice. All the staff a very friendly and attentive and not stuck up like some other Hotels of this  calibre. The rooms a first class our room was large well appointed and the bathroom was amazing apparently there was a full renovation a couple of years ago and you can definitely tell. Sleep quality was fantastic bed very comfortably and very quiet. An excellent stay and would like to stay again if ever in VeniceRead moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
