This hotel is great for so many reasons. The rooms are very beautiful and unique. I stayed here with family so I was able to see a few of the other rooms. The decor was legitimate and unique as well as immaculate. Some rooms have a shower and a bathtub but ours only had a bathtub with one of those small European glass partitions--but it was still nice and they had great soaps/shampoo, etc. The service was super friendly and concierge was very helpful. One of the most amazing experiences here is having breakfast right on the Grand Canal. The breakfast spread was really, really good and the ambience was great. I cannot say enough great things about this place. It will be a stay that I will always remember.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
