This hotel is truly gorgeous and the services offered are excellent.  Decorated to feel like the Doge palaces of days gone by, the decor is excessive and over the top--and perfect for Venice.  The place truly emanates with a sense of time and place, it always lets you know that you are in Venice.  The balcony overlooking the Grand Canal is perfect and very romantic, especially at night.  The restaurant was great and Bar Longhi was elegant and fun with a live musician.  Finally, the service they offer for airport transfer was tremendous--private boat, cab waiting, porter who leads you to check-in and skips the line.  Stay here if you have the occasion, it's worth it!Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 27, 2015Dear Guest,  We are happy to hear that you felt like being in a private palace “of days gone by” where you could always perceive being in Venice, thanks to the decorations and original artworks featured.  This is indeed one of the unique characteristics of our hotel: the feel of home, of a private residence!  Thank you for having mentioned the comfort and pleasure of availing oneself of a private transfer with hostess assistance: it makes indeed the difference, allowing oneself to be relaxed and helped from the very first to the very last moment in Venice!  We look forward to welcoming you back!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
