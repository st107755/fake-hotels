The Gritti Palace is in a very good location and only a short walk to St Marks square. From the moment we walked in it felt special. The decor is amazing and it feels like you are in something special with a taste of past splendour. Our bedroom was luxuriously decorated and the bed very comfortable the bathroom was also very well thought out and a good size. The staff were very attentive and helpful and helped to make it a memorable experience. The dinning room was intimate with a great atmosphere and the service and food excellent. The bar was a very relaxing place to be, again wonderful decor.  We  would certainly return.Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare
