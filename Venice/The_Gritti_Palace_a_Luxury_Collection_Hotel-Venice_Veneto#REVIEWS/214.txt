The hotel is incredible. This is one of the beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. We get big room. Spacious, beautifully decorated, a sense of luxury, history and romance.  Breakfast was tasty. You can find special food for people with gluten and lactose intolerance. The staff was very nice.  The location was also perfect.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
