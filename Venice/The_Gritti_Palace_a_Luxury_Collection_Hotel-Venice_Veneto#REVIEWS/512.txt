We spent our honeymoon at the Gritti palace , as it was our honeymoon we were upgraded to a suite which was huge , if we put our head out of the window and looked left we could see the grand Canal which we thought was a little strange considering how very expensive the room was. The hotel is beautiful and very central , we thought the dinning room was too formal and no atmosphere so we dined at the roof top restaurant at the Danielli . Having breakfast overlooking the grand canal was great , but the breakfast was extra and very expensive . If money is no object then its great place to stay .Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
