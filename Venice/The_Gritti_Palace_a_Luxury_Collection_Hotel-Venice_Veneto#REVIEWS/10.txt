When you go to have lunch at a luxury hotel And you ask for a Caesar salad you are trying to get something simple but really well done. In fact is a simple dish that it’s supposed to be more o less the same all around the world and if someone tries to innovate you except the best. Well I hadn’t. Boiled small pieces of chicken (leftovers?) instead of “grilled chicken breast” promoted at the menu, tomato (?), no dress at all and pieces of cheese (?) instead of Parmesan. Really disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: August 2020HelpfulShare Response from Paolo Lorenzoni, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Aug 31, 2020Dear Guest,   Thank you for visiting the Gritti during your stay in Venice and for your feedback.
