This is a very nice property on Grand Canal. Very ancient building, but beautiful from inside. Bathrooms are very modern and Beds very comfortable. No complaints in any area. Staff befitting to a superb luxury collections hotel. Laura and Robetta were outstanding at Reception and Marcelo and Evan were perfect and accurate at Concierge. Delightful breakfast area with very nice view. Location extremely central.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
