Naturally, they are all equipped with any modern facility and the majority of them with the comfort of separate shower and bathtube.

We look forward to welcoming you back, particularly our F&B team, who is eager to provide you with a memorable experience!  Yours sincerely,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
