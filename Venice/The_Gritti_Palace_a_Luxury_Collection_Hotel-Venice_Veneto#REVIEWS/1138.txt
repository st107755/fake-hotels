My husband and I were only here for two nights, but this is an amazing place. The hotel is well decorated and the rooms are fantastic. From the check in to the check out, the experience is 5 stars. We did send a message in advance of our arrival and we're treated to champagne and strawberries in our room. This was our anniversary and we had been coming from Paris so my expectations were very high. The breakfast here is wonderful and the staff is very attentive. Make sure you have a cocktail at night after the sun goes down, it is simply beautiful. Finally, one work of advice, make sure you do a shared private water taxi, it is well worth it and a great way to start your experience!Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
