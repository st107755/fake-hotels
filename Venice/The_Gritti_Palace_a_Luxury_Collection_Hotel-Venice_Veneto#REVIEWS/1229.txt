The Gritti Palace is hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in... and that saying a lot. I planned to propose in Venice and Gritti's concierge made it so easy yet so memorable. They set up everything from the Gondola that i proposed on to a photographer to be on the route to get the perfect pictures of the moment! I absolutely love the Gritti palace and cannot thank the hotel enough for everything they did to make that day so very special. And to add on to it everyone that worked they knew about it so that nobody ruined the surprise before! They would sneak up to me when she wasn't around to ensure everything was just right! Service and Luxury at its finest! Oh and the rooms are beautiful too. All antique furniture yet up to date at the same time.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
