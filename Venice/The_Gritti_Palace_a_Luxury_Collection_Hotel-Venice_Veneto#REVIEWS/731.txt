My husband and I had a nice dinner at the Gritti Palace.  The service was incredible, and the staff was friendly.  We had a great table with lovely views across the canal. The food was good but amazingly expensive.  The bottled water was about $10.00 per bottle and we paid about $30.00 for a bowl of soup.  While the food was not extraordinary, it was very good and the ambiance was worth the high price for a meal. The hotel is beautiful and the furnishings and artwork are wonderful.  The hallway near the restrooms is fun because there are many signed photos of celebrities who have stayed there.  I would not recommend the chocolate mousse, as much as I love chocolate.. it was pleasing to look at but just average flavor and probably not worth the cost.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
