The Gritti Palace is like a museum. It is a trip back to the 16th century with its art and wonderful decor. It is among the nicest and most gorgeous hotels in which I have stayed in the last 40 years. The staff was patient, eminently competent, and helpful. The hotel is well located with its own Vaporetto stop, and the wonderful breakfasts are included in the room charge. I had to put a second mortgage on my house to afford the exceeding high hotel charge, but staying at the Gritti is a memory one will never forget.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
