Great base for getting to know Venice. The location is convenient for walking, water bus or water taxi,  plus being on the grand canal, it's got great views. The staff was excellent, from reception to concierge, from housekeeping to wait staff. The room was comfortable, warm and welcoming. The 19th century style is beautifully realized, if not my personal favorite. Nice to be in a true 5-star hotel - super comfy bed, towel warmers, floor to ceiling marble bathroom, walk in closet with valet, good wifi, nice range of amenities. Quality everything. It will be a pleasure to return someday.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
