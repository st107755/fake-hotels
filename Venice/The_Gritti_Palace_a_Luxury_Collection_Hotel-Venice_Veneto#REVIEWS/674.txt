From the private water taxi arrival to the seamless check in. Our room did not have a canal view but was spacious and beautifully appointed. Excellent care provided by the very attentive staff. We enjoyed having cocktails on the terrace bar and were spoiled by Jeff and Andrea every night. Exquisitely renovated in its interior. We enjoyed working with the concierge team to help plan our days in Venice. The hotel is not inexpensive but certainly a wonderfully worthy splurge if you're looking for a special place to stay in beautiful Venezia. Cheers!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
