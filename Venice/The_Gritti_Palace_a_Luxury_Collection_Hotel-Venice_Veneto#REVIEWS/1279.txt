This hotel, after a stay at the Daneli, is totally different. 82 rooms vs 220, thus more intimate. The room is sumptuous yet elegant, with the best bed we have ever slept in, and with a magnificent view of the Punta della dogana, after which it is named, and the Madonna del salute. Compared to the equivalent suite at the Daneli, the choice really is down to a matter of taste. This one has a much smaller bathroom and generally smaller living space and costs quite a bit more, but it feels like a proper palatial room, whereas that of the Daneli feels like a beautiful standard hotel room decorated to Venetian tastes. The view is also different - do you prefer the lagoon and San Giogio Maggiore or the Canal and the Salute?Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 28, 2014Dear Guest,  We truly appreciate you taking the time to detail your experience at the Gritti Palace as well as the Hotel Danieli, both Luxury Collection Hotels, and we wish to thank you for your loyalty to Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
