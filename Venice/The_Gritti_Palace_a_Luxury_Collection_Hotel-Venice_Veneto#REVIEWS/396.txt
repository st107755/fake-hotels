I have been wanting to visit this hotel for years, but sadly it is outside our price range unless we decide to opt for a shorter stay (we usually visit Venice for at least a week at a time). On this visit, we decided to go for lunch at the canal side restaurant on our last day and it didn't disappoint. The staff, the food, the ambience and the views were all amazing. Yes it's expensive, but well worth if for a special treat. I would definitely visit again next time we're in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
