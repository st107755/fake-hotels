First Class hotel directly on the Grand Canal. Breakfast is great - you sit overlooking the canal. Morning Delivery boats and Gondolas to watch. Room large and clean, heavily decorated with full marble bath. See Photos. This is a great choice when in Venice. Dinner are pricey but many close restaurants and enjoy the walk. Very Kind Staff.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
