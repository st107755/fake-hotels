What an absolutely stunning hotel, right in the heart of the city itself. Greeted with a warm welcome, easy and fast check in. Room was spacious and just incredible!  Spent just two nights, can't wait to return! Staff unbelievable and so helpful with advice on where to go or where to eat.  Just couldn't wish for anything more!Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
