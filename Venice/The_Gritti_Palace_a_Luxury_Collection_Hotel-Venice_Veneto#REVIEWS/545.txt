I can hardly find the right words to describe this unique hotel . It is simply the best that u could ever dream of in Venice . The elegance is overwhelming as well as the perfect kindness of their staff. It's expensive I know but if u could go there even for just one night you will keep that experience in your heart.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
