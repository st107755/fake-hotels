Actually we went before the refurbishment.  The priceless objets were there, antique rugs by the bed with covers to protect them, chandeliers, marble, furniture, paintings...

Homely it was not, but grander than the Negresco, Dorchester or Manoir, with pristine service and impressive cuisine.  I couldn't comment on the alternatives, but arriving in a private launch was good.  Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
