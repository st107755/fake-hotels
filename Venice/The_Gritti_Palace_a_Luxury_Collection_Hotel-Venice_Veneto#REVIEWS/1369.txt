A lovely renovation has restored the hotel to its former silk and gilt glory, with a new pumping system that will hopefully protect it for years to come.  We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms in high season (around 900 â‚¬ per night) and, while it was small, it was comfortable and wonderfully decorated. The gritti enjoys a great location, a staff that understands they work at a magical place and a great bar on the grand canal.  For a special weekend, it is definitely worth the price to experience a historic hotel that allows you to live in the spirit of the city, even for just a few nights.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
