This is a truly great hotel.  Beautifully and sympathetically restored, wonderful staff, splendid cocktails and an excellent restaurant. Located in a superb position on the Grand Canal providing peace and privacy in a very central location, without crowds of tourists milling about.  Cannot be more highly recommendedRead moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
