Nice enough hotel, rooms/decor are amazing and staff were lovely, rooms were of a French/rococo decor my favourite! We went here for my partners birthday but booked too long we should have only booked 2/3 nights instead of 4. The only  downfall was the crazy ridiculous prices for food and drink!Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear  Guest,  Thank you for your honest feedback.  We are pleased to read that you loved the rooms’ décor and all your interactions with the staff.   On the other hand, we regret to hear that you got bored of staying in Venice!   There is so much to see, both art/history as well as nature - the Venetian lagoon has so many hidden treasures! So sorry we were not able to inform you on all the possible things to see and do in this unique city, to discover which even longer stays would be appropriate!  Thank you again for your visit. We hope there will be another opportunity for you to explore our magical city!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
