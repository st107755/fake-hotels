From the moment you arrive you realize that this is a different hospitality experience.  From check in to the adorable tassel key chain for each room, every detail it taken care of.  The view from the terrace for breakfast is breathtaking and the service in the evenings at the Riva bar is outstanding!!!  The location of this property is perfect for walking to some of the major sites and there is a gondola pick up right out the front door.  While I cannot say enough wonderful things about this property do yourself a favor and skip visiting the restaurant just outside the hotel.  They decide when you are allowed to sit for a coffee or cocktail and when you are not.  They are also the only establishment that we came across that adds a service fee (without telling us I might add). â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
