We stayed three days at Gritti and did the cooking day with Franco. We do cooking experiences around the world and I think this was my favourite. Not only is Venice a unique and tasty backdrop, not only is the Gritti a bijou among boutique hotels, but Franco’s kitchen made you feel as if you belong to the life of the place. There a a huge qualitative difference when you are hands-on and having a purpose other than just gawking at marvels. Plus you are co-operating and breaking bread with other travelers. There’s something essential and satisfying about that. NB. Don’t book anywhere for dinner. You will not want it. Franco takes care to walk you the picturesque way to the market and then the shadiest way home. Wear your best walking shoes! Read moreDate of stay: June 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
