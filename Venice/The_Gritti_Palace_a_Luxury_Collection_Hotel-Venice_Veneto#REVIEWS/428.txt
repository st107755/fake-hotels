While it has an amazing location and the restaurant staff were wonderful, however I felt a bit like I was in the original City of Merchants and was being "up sold" upon arrival with signs stating things that could be purchased in the lobby and in our rooms (5 of us traveling).  I had 3 front desk people tell me about my arrangements for departure (as in here is this very helpful information, almost waiting for a tip).  The evening turn down was mediocre and I don't think we didn't bother after the first night (of three). Of the front desk staff, I think only a couple of the gentlemen we dealt with had a sincere to see to our needs.  (I wished I'd written down the name of the fellow that arranged our water taxi to the Lido Beach! He was the best!)Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
