The Gritti Palace is in a world of its own for absolute luxury. From the moment you arrive all the staff are attentive,friendly and professional. Our room overlooking the Grand Canal was large and beautifully decorated in the Italian palace style and with a huge modern marble ensuite bathroom .  The bar & restaurant overlooking the canal is a wonderful place to enjoy drinks, breakfast and evening meals. There is an extensive breakfast buffet and the hotelâ€™s cuisine is superb, the food is beautifully cooked and presented. For sightseeing in Venice the concierge is first class at suggesting sites and directing you to where you wish to go. The whole stay was absolutely faultless.
