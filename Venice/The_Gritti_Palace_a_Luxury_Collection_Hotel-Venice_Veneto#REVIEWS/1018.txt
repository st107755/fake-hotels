We must nevertheless underline that being ours an antique palace, its accommodations cannot be standardized and therefore they do not only differ in size, but also in the furniture: some rooms have hand painted walls, others have silk covered walls. All of our bathrooms have the finest Italian marble (with a variety of different colors and origin) not only on the flooring but also covering walls from floor to ceiling.   We are delighted that you experienced an excellent service with the exception of the breakfast that you considered “pretty standard”, aspect for which we are really sorry and we hope to be of better service on the occasion of your next stay.  We also wish to mention that taking good care of all of our esteemed Guests and making them feel most welcome, regardless their age, is our main commitment.  We hope you will honour us once again with your patronage in a near future.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
