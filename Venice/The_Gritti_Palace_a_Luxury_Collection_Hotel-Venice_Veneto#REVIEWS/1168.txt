Everything about our stay at the hotel was lovely- breakfast on the terrace is an incredible experience and the rooms are very tasteful and the location is very central for San Marco island. The only downfall to our stay was a very rude guest service personal saying our check out was at 10am. I have stayed at luxury hotels around the world and never encountered a 10am check out. We asked for a late check out ( even 11am would have been appreciated) but were not given any other options. Why on earth a hotel would need 5 hours to turn a room is beyond me but it left a sour taste to our experience here. 10am is very unreasonable in a 5 star hotel.

We are pleased to read that your stay with us was a lovely one and are, on the other hand,  sincerely sorry for the circumstance that you highlighted and for your consequent disappointment.  You are indeed right, 10 a.m. check out is unreasonable.   Please be informed that our check-out time is noon and, given the long time of employment of our Front Office Associates, we cannot think at anything else but a misundestanding.  We do regret of the unpleasant situation occurred and we would be pleased to discuss this further with you on a private correspondence in order to have a better understanding of this shortfall, truly an exception to the rule, and prevent this from happening once again in the future. Please feel free contact my assistant, Ms. Quagliotto at liana.quagliotto@starwoodhotels.com  We hope you will give us another opportunity to show you our best care and attention and look forward to welcoming you back to our Gritti Palace.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
