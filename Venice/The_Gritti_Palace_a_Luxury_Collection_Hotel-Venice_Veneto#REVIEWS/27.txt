This is the best hotel to stay in Venice. Service, ambiance, location, everything is top notch. I was particularly impressed with the cleanliness and maid service. I asked for replacement of water without being able to allow making the beds because my husband was sick. When I told the cleaning service my husband was sick, they sent a fruit platter. Very classy. Also, you dont have to worry about dragging your luggage in case of aqua alta. This hotel has a ramp that goes directly into the water where a taxi waits for you. Super convenient. The view in the terrace is insane.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare
