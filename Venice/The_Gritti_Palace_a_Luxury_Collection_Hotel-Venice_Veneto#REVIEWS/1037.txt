We have just returned from our Easter break at The Gritti Palace.A wonderful hotel and wonderful staff. On arrival you are made very welcome by their friendly and courteous staff.The decor and room we stayed in was amazing. We have stayed in many lovely hotels but this has got to be the best. We are looking forward to returning later this year. It is perfection! Thank you for a truly wonderful stayRead moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
