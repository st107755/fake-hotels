Everything about our stay and this hotel was absolutely perfect. Itâ€™s hard to believe a place as beautiful as this exists. The staff were readily available to help with anything you needed. The room was impeccable, with a view over a side canal leading into the Grand Canal. The breakfast buffet (luxury buffet) has an amazing selection, but the view from breakfast overlooking the Grand Vanal was unforgettable. This was by far the best hotel we stayed at in Italy, we cannot wait to return! Worth every penny, a unforgettable experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
