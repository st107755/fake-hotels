Whilst we stayed nearby we dined at the Gritti Palace for dinner. Dinner was superb with excellent service a great and reasonable wine list and delightful well cooked food. The position of the hotel is special on the grand canal with a super ambience. I had a wonderful baked cod dish that was so fresh accompanied with a perfect Greco di Tufo. Patricia had her favourite dessert in the form of a vanilla souffl√©. A wonderful experience completed a great 4 days in Venice. Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
