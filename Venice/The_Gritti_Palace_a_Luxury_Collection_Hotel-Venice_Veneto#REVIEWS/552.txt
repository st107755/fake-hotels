Gritti Palace is a beautiful hotel in a great location on the grand canal.  Service is impeccable. Hotel is a beautiful old building that has been restored and updated with all the modern comforts but maintains its historical perspective.   The restaurant outside on the grand canal has beautiful views and good food and service.  Hotel is less than a ten minute walk to St Marks square.  We are SPG gold members and were automatically upgraded.  Love the SPG hotels, always clean, good service and a great experience.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Dec 2, 2016Dear Guest,  We are grateful for your appreciation of the restoration’s outcome of our unique and timeless Venetian Nobile Palace, where its original atmosphere was very well retained, despite being it contemporarily equipped with up-to-date facilities for our guests’ comfort.
