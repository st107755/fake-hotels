The Gritti Palace is an outstanding hotel. It has a great location, a beautiful building and elegant rooms. What makes the Gritti truly exceptional is the staff.  The Gritti Palace staff were terrific under the most difficult circumstances. We arrived at the Gritti 2 days after the historic floods on November 12,2019.  The first floor of the hotel had been damaged in that flood.  The staff did an extraordinary job of getting the hotel back to full functioning and beautiful condition, while they continued to cope with the difficulties of ongoing periods of high water. In the midst of all their challenges, they provided us with wonderful personal attention and assistance that allowed us to avoid flooding and have a great stay.
