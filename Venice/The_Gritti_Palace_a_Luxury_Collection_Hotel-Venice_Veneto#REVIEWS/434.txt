Our recent 2 night stay was everything we imagined. The transfer we arranged through the hotel was seamless - our host met us at the baggage carousel and guided us all the way. The room was beautiful - very high ceilings with wonderful windows and a large comfy bed. The location is central to St Mark's and the quality fixtures mean it is quiet and peaceful, although so much is going on just outside the windows. Thank you to the management for our upgrade to a suite with view of the grand canal. It was thoroughly enjoyed. I loved the bathroom toiletries. Breakfast overlooking the activities of the canal was a highlight of our stay. The concierge and reception staff were lovely. I couldn't fault a single thing and will be back again one day.
