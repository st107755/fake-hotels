Stayed in a Venetian Room. Beautiful. Comfortable bed. Appreciated the warmth of the staff. Check in/out team and concierge are all lovely. We watched in horror as an obnoxious guest insisted on making the evening tough on the staff, they handled it with tremendous grace. Loved sitting on the water at the bar. A highlight of the stay. Great location.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
