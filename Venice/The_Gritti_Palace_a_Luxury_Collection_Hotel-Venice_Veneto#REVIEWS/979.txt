This was my 3rd visit and 1st since the Gritti's extensive refurbishment . I am delighted nothing has changed. The Gritti is the most understated hotel you could ever imagine. Service is impeccable and hiden, location is perfect and the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is ideal  for just sitting and imagining past histories of Venice. The overall experience is sumptuous. Not the cheapest experience you will ever have , but to indulge in luxury every now and then is a great treat. I couldn't recommend the Gritti high enough and look forward to being transported back intime some day soon .Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for your loyalty!
