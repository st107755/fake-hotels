This place really is phenomenal.  The staff, the rooms, the location, and the food are all amazing.  Just wish we could have stayed longer.  Definitely recommend staying here though.  Better location than the Denali hotel and more intimate feeling as well.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
