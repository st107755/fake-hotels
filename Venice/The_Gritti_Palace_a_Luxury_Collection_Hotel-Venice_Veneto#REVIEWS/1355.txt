“Just opened after a 15-month amazing restoration, the Gritti Palace is more grand than ever (it was in need a of re-do). All the rooms have been revamped as well as the hotel’s art and antique collection. A little yet lovely Acqua di Parma spa has also been added too. This place is so Venetian-glamorous, it feels like living in a 15th century palazzo – only with all the modern luxuries we’ve come to expect from the best. From the moment we checked-in the entire staff seemed to know our name – no matter who we passed they would greet us with a smile and ‘Good afternoon, Mr. & Mrs Wood’ The location is ideal, on the most stunning stretch of the Grand Canal, a five minute walk from St. Marks but far enough from the bustle that you never feel part of that touristy crowd.”Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 29, 2013Dear Mr. and Mrs. Wood,  As you know very well, Venice is a spectacularly unique city and, after all, a small town often crowded by tourists. Thank you for mentioning that The Gritti Palace’s location is ideal, directly on the most stunning stretch of the Grand Canal. In fact, although being The Gritti in the heart of the city and surrounded by the most important monuments and museums - literally just few steps away - it is away from the busiest “calli and campi” (streets and squares) allowing our Guests to fully enjoy an intimate visit of the city.  The added Blu Mediterraneo SPA by Acqua di Parma is a sophisticated sanctuary that represents the most exclusive essence of the Mediterranean, in tune with the pure and distinctive power of nature.  We are very pleased of your recognition of the staff’s attitude, being it outgoing and smiling. We look forward to your next visit to Venice for another exceptional experience.  Sincerely yours,   Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
