Astonishing hotel...the best place I have ever stayed in. The rooms are sumptuous and the location stunning. Itâ€™s a must visit for your trip to Venice.   The only niggle is bar staff wanted to hurry us up and then locked us out...well I guess it was 130am but the terrace was beautiful particularly when the put the heaters on!  Thank you for making our weekend special. Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
