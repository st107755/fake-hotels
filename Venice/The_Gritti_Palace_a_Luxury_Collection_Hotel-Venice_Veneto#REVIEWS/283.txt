Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary with friends in the restaurant on the grand canal at the Gritti.  Fantastic service and food for the whole evening. The sommelier paid attention to every detail to accommodate our individual tastes and couldn’t have been better. A very classy place to sit with beautiful surroundings and views. Very expensive but the best quality in every way. Couldn’t fault it and definitely recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
