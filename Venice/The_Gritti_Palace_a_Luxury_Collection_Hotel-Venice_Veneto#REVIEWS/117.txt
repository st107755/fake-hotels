Such a wonderful hotel! The staff is gracious and friendly and so very kind. The rooms are glorious and I don’t care if I’m using too many adjectives. This hotel is wonderful. Nicest linens ever. Chocolates and wine in the room. Restaurant is very reasonable and delicious. Best, is the lovely terrace on the canal. So charming for an afternoon of people watching. Luxury as it should be!Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
