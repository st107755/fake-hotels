This hotel is truly a palace. Sometimes you have to remind yourself you are not in a museum. The staff is fantastic and everyone stands ready to assist.  The rooms are great, roomy, comfortable and very well furnished. The bathrooms are quite large (especially for Europpe) and have radiant heated floors! The beds and linens are top notch and housekeeping is excellent.  The bar/breakfast area overlooking the Grand Canal is nothing short of magical. Nothing beats sipping an afternoon cocktail while watching the hustle and bustle of the boats in the canal.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
