The hotel is simply amazing.  My partner and I stayed here this past Christmas and the stay was magical - the hotel/room and especially the staff.  From the moment that we arrived till we left - everyone was gracious and extremely helpful.  I want to single out the staff of the bar - they were the epitome of what you expect from a luxury historic 5 star hotel.  I will always stay here when I am in Venice...worth every penny!Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jan 16, 2017Dear Guest,   We are very happy to learn that your partner and you savored a magical stay from the moment the doors of our Palace were opened until we said goodbye!
