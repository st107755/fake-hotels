We had the fortunate opportunity to stay at the Gritti Palace during Carnivale and what a fabulous experience it was!  From such welcoming reception/check-in to exceeding our expectations with a Grand Canal view room to assistance on any of our needs with the personable and humorous Concierge - we had a perfect stay!  I can see why this is one of the best hotels in Venice (I would say best!) and have such a great reputation globally.  And it is in a prime location for anyone visiting Venice as well.  We especially appreciated the Concierge and their helpfulness - we hadn't booked a gondola in advance, but with their connections and know-how, we were set.  Hats off to the Gritti Palace team during a peak season - they made us feel welcome and special.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 25, 2016Dear Client, let me thank you for the feedback provided towards our Hotel Gritti Palace and its Staff .
