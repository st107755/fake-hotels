4 days at the Gritti Palace in October 2016. It's wonderful and the location could not be better! Apart from being a beautiful hotel, and our room being very nice indeed... we really loved the position of the hotel right on the waterfront in the Grand Canal. No one can walk in front of the hotel and so when you are dining (breakfast and evening drinks for us) there can hardly be a better place to sit and enjoy Venice. The Riva bar was fabulous and we enjoyed evening drinks here with plenty of heat from the electric heaters. This meant we could enjoy breakfast and evening drinks outside even in late October.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Nov 3, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having expressed your satisfaction with your stay at our Gritti Palace and for having profusely praised our hotel’s location.  We agree with you that ours is one of the best locations in town: central and at a walking distance to major attractions and at the same time in a quiet area, but most of all disposing of a terrace directly over the Grand Canal that is unique in whole Venice.   Indeed, no better place to enjoy the life of Venice on its main “thoroughfare” …  We hope to have the pleasure of your second visit!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
