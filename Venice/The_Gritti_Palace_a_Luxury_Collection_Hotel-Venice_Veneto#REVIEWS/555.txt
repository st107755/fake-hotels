We stayed at the Gritti for 5 nights the first week of November to celebrate our anniversary.  From the moment that we checked in, we were absolutely pampered.  The room, the lobby, the restaurant and bar were all just incredible.  We ended every night with a drink outside at the bar and marveled at the amazing view.  It really couldn't have been any better.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Nov 21, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having selected our Gritti among the large hotels' choice and for your gratifying comments.
