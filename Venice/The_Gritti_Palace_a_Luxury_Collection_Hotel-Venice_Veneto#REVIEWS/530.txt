After a thorough restoration, the Gritti is back amongst the top hotels in Venice. Actually, if you're partial to smaller, more elegant and chic establishments, this might be the best choice in a difficult city like Venice. Rooms (a junior suite, in my case) have been renovated with taste and are now worthy of a five-star. Food is excellent (although not cheap) and so is the service, lead by an always present general manager (which is quite unusual, even at this level of service). A truly excellent experience.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
