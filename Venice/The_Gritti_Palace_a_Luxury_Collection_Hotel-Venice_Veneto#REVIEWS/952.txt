We stayed at the Gritti Palace for two nights. Rooms are nice and comfortable, specially the beds. The concierge is not helpful at all, as well as the front desk, for a hotel this level, the service with concierge and restaurant is not satisfying.  The breakfast is a great spread, overall food is good.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
