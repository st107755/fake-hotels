This would have to be one of my most favourite Hotels in the world. We were there with a group of 14 at the hottest time of the year. The Hotel a/C system was exception the best I have ever seen in Italy.  Rooms are immaculate THE BATHROOM is incredible every attention to detail is covered. The staff and service is immaculate and the breakfast and aperitivo out along  the grand canal are memorable and magnificent and if you are there during acqua alta it is the only Hotel in Venice that has an underground system to release water flow so it does not have a  flooding problem ! magnificoRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
