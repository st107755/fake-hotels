This was our first visit since the renovation and we were delighted to see that although everything had been refreshed very little had been changed within. The patio/deck however has had a complete makeover and it works pretty well.  It now has the feeling of a luxury yacht with a stream line vibe.  A lot of chrome and white leather with touches of luxury woods. My only comment would be that if you have chrome, keep it polished.  There were a lot of fingerprints and smears visible on chair legs and serving tables. This is not excusable in this price range. The snack menu on the deck is pricey as to be expected. Everything is well prepared and delicious. Presentation is restrained but lovely. Service as always, perfect.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
