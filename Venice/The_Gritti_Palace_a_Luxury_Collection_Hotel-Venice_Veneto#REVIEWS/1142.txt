How sweet it is to visit a five-star luxury hotel that truly earns its rating! Everything about the Gritti Palace is palatial.  The setting on the Grand Canal is spectacular.  (It's hard to pry yourself away from the outdoor Bar Longhi that looks out over the busy Venetian Lagoon.)  The location, minutes walk from the Palazzo San Marco, is excellent. The newly renovated rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed.  The first-class touches, like delivering a bottle of wine to your room as a welcome gift within minutes after checking in, are, well, first class.  The staff is accommodating and helpful.  I'm trying to think of a better hotel that I have stayed in, but I can't.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Sep 30, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for having selected the Gritti among many Venetian hotels.
