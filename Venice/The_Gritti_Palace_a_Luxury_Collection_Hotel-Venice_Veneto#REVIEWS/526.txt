We spent 4 days in this palace and for sure whenever we will come back, we will book here again... Rooms are nicely decorated in the Venetian style with luxury bathrooms, the breakfast buffet is proposing local products, the Acqua di Parma Spa is just amazing.  My husband booked there for my 40th birthday and even the staff had a special gift for me in the room : smelly red roses. The concierge recommended nice places to eat, drink and visit. We were treated like VIPs, we really enjoyed our stay. I think this palace is the most beautiful place to stay in Venise (even better than the famous Danieli which I found a bit old-fashioned). I hope to come back soon !Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
