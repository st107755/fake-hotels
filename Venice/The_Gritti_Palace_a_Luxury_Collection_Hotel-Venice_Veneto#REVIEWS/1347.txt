The front desk guys were slow and ineffective, the two (out of three) concierges were not enough helpful and expedient, breakfast was overpriced and disputable.

We do regret of the opinion you gathered during your stay with us and we hope you will allow us another opportunity to disclose you our best care and attention, as we are doing with the majority of our Guests.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
