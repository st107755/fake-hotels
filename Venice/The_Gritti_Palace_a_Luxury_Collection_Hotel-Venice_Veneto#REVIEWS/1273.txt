We stayed here on the first night of an extended honeymoon.  We decided to change our flights to leave a day earlier and I was rushing around trying to make a reservation at a hotel so we had somewhere to stay on our first night.  In my haste I had made it for the day we left the states instead of the day we arrived.  Many hotels would say "oh well" you are out your points and money for the night.  Not so at the gritti palace, it felt like a true start to our honeymoon, they even let us pick which room we wanted to stay in and walked us up to both.  Breakfast was wonderful and the hotel is centrally located.  The only strange thing about this hotel is leaving your actual room key at the front desk and picking it up when you come back.  Would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 26, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for having chosen the Gritti Palace for the first night of your honeymoon and for having shared the adventurous beginning of your journey with this community.  We are grateful to you for having recognized our true concern for customer service and the empathetic attitude of our staff.  We are glad having managed to waive the indeed applicable no-show fee.  Given the ever various circumstances, however, this is regretfully not always the case since many aspects are to be evaluated, such as the booked rate type, the hotel’s occupancy, and so on.  As far as the room key is concerned, we do ask our Guests to hand it to the Concierge when leaving the hotel, even for few hours, for their security.  We would be honored to welcoming you back on your future trip to Venice (maybe your wedding anniversary…?) to make you feel even more special.  Yours sincerely,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
