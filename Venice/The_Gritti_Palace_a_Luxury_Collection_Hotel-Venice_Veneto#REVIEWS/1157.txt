The Gritti Palace lives up to it's reputation for luxury and service.  A big thank you to the concierge Claudio for all his help and recommendations.  We took a Gondola ride right from the dock of the hotel as well as hired a private water taxi for a 4 hour tour including Murano and Burano (a little pricey but well worth every penny...thank you JeanLuca)  The only negative comment is for housekeeping and turn down service. They just tossed my nightshirt on the bed in a heap and threw the pillows haphazardly on the bench at the foot of the bed (trivial but surprising at a hotel of this caliber).Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Sep 30, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for posting these comments, they are important to us.  We are really pleased to read that your overall experience at our hotel was an enjoyable one and that you very much appreciated the help and sightseeing recommendations received from our Concierge.  Venice has so much to offer, an immense artistic heritage located both downtown as well as spread out on the countless islands, the beauty of the lagoon ecosystem along with an inland rich of treasures (Palladio Villas, wineries, Dolomites, Lake Garda and wonderful cities, among others) that sometimes it is indeed difficult to give the proper suggestion.   Differently, weâ€™re sorry to hear that the turn down service was not delivered up to the usual standard.  Thank you so much for bringing this back into focus for us, we appreciate it and we trust that should you visit again your experience will be fully satisfactory.   Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
