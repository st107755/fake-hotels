My stay at Grittii Palace was really wonderful, the room overlooking Canal Grande was a unique spot to admire the life in this busy spot of Venice. The suite itself was fantastic, the furniture, wall paintings and tapestry real masterpieces. Beside this the hotel restaurant, bar, concierge and all services were of the highest quality.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
