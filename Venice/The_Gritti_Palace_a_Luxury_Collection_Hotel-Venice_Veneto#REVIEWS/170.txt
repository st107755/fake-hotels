Our travel agent suggested the Gritti Palace and I am so happy that we spent the extra $$ to have the experience we did. Going to Europe off season was a gamble with the weather but we had spectacular weather (very lucky), less crowds and got to see so much more for less money. Sitting right on the Grand Canal, close walking distance to St Marks Square and every other site in Venice but out of the way of all the passing people -the Gritti Palace is a very intimate hotel. For casual Aussies, we were unsure of how dressy we needed to be. Smart casual was fine, Europeans dress up more than Sydney siders so fair concern. The room we had was amazing -so big!!! We had to miss a booking last year due to a family emergency so we were given an upgrade this time around. Very welcomeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
