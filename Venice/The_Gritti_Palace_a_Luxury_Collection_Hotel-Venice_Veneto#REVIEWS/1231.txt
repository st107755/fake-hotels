The best hotel we have been to and what a start to our honeymoon. We couldn't have asked for a nicer, friendlier and more comfortable stays. We love this place and wished we had stayed longer in Venice.  Our room is nice and colorful. The bed and pillows are comfortable. The bathroom is spacious and clean. We don't have a view of the canal but we can go down to the bar and sat by the canal to get the view. And that was what we did one afternoon.   We are very pleased and would love to come back again. Thank you for giving us a memory of a life time. Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
