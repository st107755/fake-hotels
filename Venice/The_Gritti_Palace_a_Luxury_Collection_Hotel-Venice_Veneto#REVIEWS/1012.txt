In the surreally beautiful movie set- ready city that is Venice, the Gritti Palace is the like a fairy tale blown glass ornament covered in cinnamon sugar. But really, once you spend time on the canal-side bar terrace, they'll have you. There is no place quite like it. Country club vibe, Italian style. A bit like an Italian Beverly Hills Hotel in vibe, but of course, Venetian style.   Service is absolutely exceptional. Helpful and warm. I had some room issues which everything was done to rectify. The Aqua Di Parma spa..wonderful concierge there and the best massage by Sylvia!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
