I feel really bad to write this review so late. I actually came to Venice with parents on December 2016. I booked two rooms with AMEX FHR, but none of them got upgrade. Anyway, the room was really beautiful, and we were satisfying with what we got. The highlight of this hotel is George, who just came to this hotel from Beijing Ritz. He was so nice and helpful, and he spoke great chinese, which made my parents really happy. Thanks a lot to George.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare
