We made a short visit to The Gritti Palace Hotel for a cocktail in Bar Longhi.  The cocktails were world class as was the service, Bar Longhi has unbelievable views and fabulous decor.  A great venue, great cocktail and we rubbed shoulders with Jude Law! Expect a sizeable bill for the drinks, but given the venue and location it is understandable, or there would be a huge queue outside!Read moreDate of stay: January 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
