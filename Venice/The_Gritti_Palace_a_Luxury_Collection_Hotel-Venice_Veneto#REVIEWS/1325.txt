Stayed at the Bauer last year, thought it was nice, but the Gritti is amazing!  Rooms are well-appointed and spacious, truly elegant.  It is a hotel that caters to Americans: clock radio in room and faucets marked with "C" and "H".  Linens are opulent and the bath is gorgeous.  Loved the marble, double sinks, seperate shower and abundance of towels. Appreciated that the blow dryer wasn't wall-mounted; a nice touch when sharing a bath with your hubby. Breakfast is far superior to many other highend hotels we visited in Italy. The renovation is beautiful.  We hated to leave!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
