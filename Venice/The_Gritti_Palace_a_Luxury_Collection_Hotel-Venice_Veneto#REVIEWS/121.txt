The Gritti was more than we imagined. My partner and I stayed here for a short mini-moon after getting married and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel for our first trip to Venice. The ENTIRE staff was superb; very friendly and knowledgeable. The manager kindly upgraded us to a gorgeous room overlooking the canal and included a complimentary bottle of wine. The breakfast is delicious and the view is beautiful. When commuting from the airport, as someone who tried both public and private transport, I greatly encourage private.Read moreDate of stay: February 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
