Beautiful room (211) facing the grand canal. Expensive but you definitely get what you pay for!  Staff at reception and restaurant/bar very helpful and pleasant, somewhat less helpful at concierge depending on who attended. One was wonderful, the other a little curt.  Breakfast is a good spread eaten on the terrace over the river. The best bit of the whole stay was sitting out on the terrace! There is a gorgeous riva right outside too.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
