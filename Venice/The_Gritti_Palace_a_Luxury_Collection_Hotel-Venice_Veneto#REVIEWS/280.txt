You'd be hard-pressed to find a single negative thing to say about this awesome hotel. The most ornate guest room, beautiful modern bathroom, and amazing sitting rooms and study downstairs. Pleasant, helpful staff. Spent the money and stay here when you visit Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
