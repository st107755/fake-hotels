Overrated and overpriced.  Definitely not worth the price.  The service isn’t very good.  The closet drawers smell like mold or bug spray.  We stayed at Bauer last time we came and I thought that hotel was way better.  I would return to Bauer but I wound not return to Gritti.Read moreDate of stay: July 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from DayTrip44222784780, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Aug 3, 2019Dear E S,   Thank you very much for having shared your honest and detailed feedback regarding your recent stay at The Gritti Palace.
