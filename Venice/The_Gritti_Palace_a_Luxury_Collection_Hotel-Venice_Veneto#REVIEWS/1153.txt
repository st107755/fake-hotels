I stayed in the Gritti Palace for a milestone birthday and felt like royalty from first checking in. My room was so well appointed, the Doge could have stayed there comfortably. The hotel was closing for renovations soon after I stayed (Sept 2011), but the staff could not have been more cordial and welcoming. The breakfast brought to my room on my last morning was lovely and a kind complimentary gesture.  It made my stay even more enjoyable.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
