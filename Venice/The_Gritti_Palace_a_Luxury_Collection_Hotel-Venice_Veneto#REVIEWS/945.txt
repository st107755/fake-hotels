We stayed for only one night and, if being honest, I would not choose the Gritti for anything longer than a couple of nights. The location is perfect but it is very expensive and better 5 star value can be obtained elsewhere in the centre of Venice. It was, however, wonderful to stay there and to have drinks on the terrace overlooking the grand canal. A once in a lifetime experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 31, 2015Dear Guest,  We greatly respect your feedback about your recent experience at The Gritti Palace and are pleased to read that it was wonderful to stay with us; a “once in a lifetime experience"!    We agree on the fact that Venice has a very high offer of accommodations at all levels and that there are many hotels which are under the same “5* flag”. Despite it, each one is different from another, with own characteristics and offerings, to suit everyone’s needs, in all respects.  In a palace like The Gritti the global services, its unique atmosphere, its location and history shall be taken into consideration, although of course the values of all these components are very subjective…  We hope that we will have the pleasure of your further visits in the future.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
