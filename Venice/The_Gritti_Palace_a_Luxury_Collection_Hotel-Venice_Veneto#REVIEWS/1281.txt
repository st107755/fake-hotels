Recently stayed for 3 nights in a Canal view room for our 35th Wedding Anniversary. The Staff were all excellent and complimentary bottle of prosecco on our arrival delivered to our room. The hotel is beautiful, small and feels like home from home. Excellent large beds and the hotel position is perfect for visiting all areas of Venice. One of the best hotels we have stayed on our travels around the world. Just spoil yourselves and go!!!Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
