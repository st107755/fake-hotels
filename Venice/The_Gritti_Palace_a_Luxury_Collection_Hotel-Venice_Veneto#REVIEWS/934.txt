Great location and an amazing property. But, I have to give it 4 stars because we were very disappointed with our room check in due to dirty dishes, open drink bottles and food containers when we entered our suite. This should not happen in a 5 star L hotel. I expect things to be perfect! Otherwise, our room was large and luxurious, and the bathroom and bed were amazing. We really enjoyed the staff! Enjoy the front deck of the hotel over looking the Grand Canal.

We definitively agree with you that things should be perfect and we do really regret that your stay, otherwise enjoyable, was marred by an improper beginning, which was surely related to a miscommunication between the different departments involved!  We are delighted that you could anyhow overall enjoy the interactions with the staff and its services, which represents a great reward for us.   We hope you will allow us both the pleasure of your return visit as well as the possibility of transforming your assessment into a 5 star one!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
