We just had a wonderful 3 nights at the Gritti Palace. They met us at the airport and transported us via road and water taxi to the hotel. Fantastic! Great sitting right on the Grand canal having a beer üç∫ Our room was very nice and comfortable with a great bathroom. Their breakfast has a huge selection and is very enjoyable. Perfect location for getting around. Very near St. Marks square. The concierge team were tremendous in every respect.Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare
