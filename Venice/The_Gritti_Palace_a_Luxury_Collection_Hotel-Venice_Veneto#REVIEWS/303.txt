We absolutely loved this hotel. It was majestic, nostalgic and indescribably beautiful. Has old charm with a modern renovation.  From the start the service was personable, pleasant and extraordinary Italian.   They supplied an upgrade, personal roses and a letter from management when we arrived.   Just sitting on the terrace and watching the boats and vivacious grand canal was worth our whole stay.   Our only complaint was that there was some noise above room 220, but nonetheless we absolutely loved our stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
