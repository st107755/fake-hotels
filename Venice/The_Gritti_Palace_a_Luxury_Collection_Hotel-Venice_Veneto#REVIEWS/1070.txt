We went there on our honeymoon and it was just spectacular. I've never met such a nice and attentive staff, they went out of their way to make our visit perfect. The hotel itself is an amazing building with very comfortable rooms with an amazing shower. I don't think any other hotel in Venice can come close to this in terms of service, hotel and location. It's the perfect stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 27, 2015Dear Guest,  We are honored that you selected The Gritti Palace for your honeymoon and that you felt well taken care of throughout your stay from our attentive and caring staff.
