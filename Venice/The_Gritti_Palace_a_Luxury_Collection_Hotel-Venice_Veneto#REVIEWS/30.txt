The Gritti is luxury done right with impeccable service and a great location!  Its expensive but you get what you pay for with this magnificient hotel!   The rooms are beautifully appointed with fine linens and amenities and the hotel is maintained perfectly with not a scratch on any surface that I saw! The concierge is amazing!!  He got us into any restaurant with a quick phone call and prepped  the restaurant that we were coming and to take care of us!  He was the highlight of our trip with amazing recommendations for both restaurants and site seeing.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare
