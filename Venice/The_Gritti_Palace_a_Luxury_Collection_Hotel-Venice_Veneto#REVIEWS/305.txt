Simply stated, the best hotel of my well-traveled life. Decadent and luxurious with a superb location on the canal, Unsurpassed SPG recognition (Italy in general has far superior SPG recognition than the US), stellar service, and an 'old world meets new world' ambiance that immediately took hold of my heart and never let go. We will definitely return to this most special place.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
