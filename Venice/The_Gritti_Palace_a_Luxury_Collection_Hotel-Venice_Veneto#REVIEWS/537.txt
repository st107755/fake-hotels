We have stayed at the Gritti more than 5 times (we love Venice) and are now just as excited to be back in Venice as we are to stay at the hotel.  The staff is amazing, the outdoor setting (weather permitted) for breakfast and drinks is both romantic and quintessentially Venice.  The front desk and concierge staff are welcoming, knowledgeable and very willing to help.  Excellent location, on the Grand Canal and near major sites and a quiet vaporetto stop.  They are also very good about offering SPG Platinum upgrades and amenities.  It's expensive, but so too is it luxurious, but with a friendly, welcoming attitude.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
