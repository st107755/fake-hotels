The room was fantastic.  We had a large suite that was completely restored, with a beautiful marble bathroom.  They delivered a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates.  The restaurant was fantastic too.  Everything was great until the last night and there was a water sprinkler leak at 1 AM.  It ruined my fiancee's sleep and our last day there.  For our inconvenience, they offered 20% off our food bills, which amounted to about 80EUR.  Not what I had in mind, then they reluctantly issued another 10,000 SPG points.  Their rating went down from 5* to 3* in my book.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jun 21, 2018Dear Guest,   Thank you for your visit and for your review. We cannot but reiterate the same reply you already received on our private correspondence.   It is indeed our regret that your enjoyable stay was spoiled by the technical issue related to the high fog sprinkler in your room, that suddenly moderately leaked during your last night of stay.  Despite being our technicians present in the hotel on a 24 hour basis, this damage could not be repaired, since the only maintenance service allowed is by a specifically qualified technician.  According to our records, trying to solve the unpleasant situation the night concierge offered you to move to a nearby accommodation for the remainder of the night. Only after your denial, a Rollaway bed was added to your room to allow you to rest.  Once again, we very much regret for the occurred incident, and we hope we shall anyhow have the pleasure of your return to ensure a most memorable and delightful sojourn.   Best Regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General Manager Read more
