A friend very kindly booked us for lunch on the terrace and what a great booking! A view over one of the most beautiful vistas in the world, great food and ice cold rose. What more could you ask for... oh yes perhaps a Audrey Hepburn look alike..  fortunately i have one.  Go for lunch and experience the ' Dolce vita'Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
