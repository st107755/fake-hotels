You have to see this place for yourself - the location is pure magic!  When you walk inside everything is just stunning! My husband and I were treated like royalty!  Our room was breathtaking and we didnt really want to leave to go sightseeing (but we did) Excellent food, excellent service!Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
