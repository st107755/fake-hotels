This really was an incredible stay, the hotel is elegant, comfortable, traditional with all the modern facilities needed. The staff are incredibly helpful and breakfast and drinks looking over the canal is sensational. The restaurant for dinner was some of the best food we have ever eaten... Strongly recommend the lamb!! Such a calming experience whilst being in the thick of the action - highly recommend! Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
