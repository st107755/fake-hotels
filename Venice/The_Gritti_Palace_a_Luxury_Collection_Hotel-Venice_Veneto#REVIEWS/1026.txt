My husband and I have done cooking classes at other hotels in Italy, and the one we just did at the Gritti Palace with the amazing chef Franco was truly a fantastic experience! Starting with a trip to the open market for the fish and vegetables with a stop for prosecco and cod, at Cantina Do Mori, then back to the hotel's gorgeous kitchen.  We spent the next several hours learning how to prepare soft shell crab, the BEST risotto, sea bass, and a spectacular shuffle - This was truly one of the our best experiences ever, and we've been going to Italy for years.  Thank you Chef Franco for this incredible experience we'll be back! Susie & BrianRead moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
