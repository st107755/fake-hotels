The Gritti Palace NEVER disappoints! We have stayed here a couple of times over the years and honestly, it is hands down, no doubt about it, our favorite hotel. Everything from its' setting on the Grand Canal, to the restaurant & bar and of course its' fabulous rooms are top notch all the way.  Most hotels have a concierge, but Ivan Schultz and his staff are what all concierge staffs should aspire to. Every request, big and small was handled perfectly.   The Gritti Palace costs a little more, but it is worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: September 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
