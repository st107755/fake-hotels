Stayed here as SPG platinum and had a magnificent experience. One of the best SPG hotels in the books.   The hotel is grand, the staff are amazing, and the location is impeccable.   When we told others we were staying here, they said “the best hotel in Venice.” They were right. It is luxurious and incredible!Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
