We booked a night on points but the room wasn't one of those sad rooms they punt off to point-paid rooms, it was luxurious even with the eh-view. But I can understand those who paid for the room deserve a canal view. It was incredibly luxurious. Marble lined bathrooms, fantastic shower, high-end bath products, gorgeous fabric-lined walls, beautiful bedding and furniture. Really everything was well done and elegant and clean and beautiful. We stayed somewhere else the first couple of night only because Gritti wasn't available then but I'm glad we at the chance to stay here once.  Concierge service was impeccable. The breakfast buffet wasn't what I expected so we only went once but otherwise it was lovely. Definitely have drink out by the water. It's so lovely.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
