Loved this place. The views from the outdoor seating for the restaurant were breathtaking!  Breakfast buffet was fantastic. Coffee was fabulous.  You could walk everywhere!  You could also take the public boat transportation to places as well.  Surprisingly, the leather products were not much higher than the leather market in Florence.  Food was fantastic. Loved the fresh pasta and different toppings. Also, the gelato places were everywhere. Had one that was yummy.  Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
