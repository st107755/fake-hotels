A true 5 star hotel in everyway, staff so welcoming and friendly nothing is too much trouble, they are complete professionals.  We had a stunning room with a balcony facing the Grand Canal looking onto the Santa Maria della Salute. We were there celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary February 2014 and have been left with the most wonderful memories of our stay.  The decor of the hotel inside is stunning, full of character and very beautiful. Bedroom and bathroom spotless everyday nothing to fault in anyway and gorgeous Acqua di Parma toiletries.  We ate in the hotel restaurant, breakfast was fantastic, lunch and dinner excellent, everything we ate was absolutely delicious.  The location of the hotel is perfect very easy to walk to everything you would want to see in Venice.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
