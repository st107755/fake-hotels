We had a great experience during our 3 night stay at the Gritti. I would stay there again at any time and ideally for longer. We were in the Dursoduro Suite - lots of space for our stuff as well as the extra bed for our 8 year old. This suite is located on the back side of the hotel, so very quiet but you will hear the hustle and bustle of restaurants/businesses starting to get organized in the morning (which for me is part of the charm) as well as the serenades in the afternoon/early evening gondola rides. I don't agree with the reviews I read about the staff. In our experience everyone was extremely courteous and polite and very willing to help. If you are coming in by train or airplane, highly recommend taking a water taxi to the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
