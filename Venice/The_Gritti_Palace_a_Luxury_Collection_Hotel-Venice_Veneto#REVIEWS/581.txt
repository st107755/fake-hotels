      We stayed at this hotel prior to the renovation, and had a beautiful room with two windows overlooking the Grand Canal. This time, although the room charge was much higher, we were given a room whose sole window is partly obscured by an enormous bathtub. Although this might appeal to honeymooners, we are hardly that, and would have preferred two windows overlooking one of the world's most glorious views. Next time we will stay at the new hotel across the canal.       The bathrooms have been renovated, and are fine.        Almost all the staff are very courteous and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you for your return visit to the Gritti and for taking time post your review.   We very much regret that your experience did not live up to your expectations due to the room assigned in your favour. We wish to assure you that it was of the same category of your previous visit, i.e. a Landmark Grand Canal view room.  Nonetheless, due the specifics of our building, a XVI century palace with a unique gothic structure, rooms of the same type and exposure may differ not only in décor but also in size and indeed in windows’ number, variables which are of subjective importance and priority.  Please be informed that, out of nine double rooms facing the Grand Canal, only two of them dispose of two windows.   We hope you will reconsider your decision and allow us another opportunity to change your feelings towards The Gritti Palace and would invite you to specify your room preferences upon your next reservation, so that we may personalize the room assignment based on your preferences.   Thank you for your understanding and we look forward to welcoming you back to The Gritti Palace.   Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General Manager Read more
