The location and views from this hotel cannot be beat. The terrace is magical and the rooms are stunning. I loved hearing the gondola singers ride by our window each day! My check in process was great, the the agent was incredibly helpful and polite. I appreciated all of her insight. The lovely service however, ended there. The concierge desk, who you have to regularly deal with to drop off and get your room keys each time you leave and come back, were simply unfriendly. I actually started to wonder if someone told them they were not allowed to smile. They seemed stuffy and arrogant and annoyed anytime we spoke to them. This hotel is wonderful and Venice is a gem but that concierge staff couldnâ€™t make this a 5 star review for me. Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
