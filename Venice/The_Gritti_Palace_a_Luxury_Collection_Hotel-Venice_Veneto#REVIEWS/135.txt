The Gritti Palace, like its long-term rival the Danielli is now part of the Marriott group and some of us had feared that that might signal a decline in standards but a recent visit was reassuring.

Go there with your expectations high and they will be fulfilled.Read moreDate of stay: February 2019HelpfulShare
