Gritti Palace is the best hotel I have stayed in. Staff were a credit to the hotel without exception. So many little touches made our stay memorable like a postcard in the room every day to tell you about the forthcoming weather. A bottle of prosecco on my birthday.  Breakfast was excellent and just sitting outside watching the boats on the Grand Canal was a pleasure. Also a good base for all local attractions and walks to other areas.  Well done Gritti Palace, you should have six stars.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
