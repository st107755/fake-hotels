My husband and I booked to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and as a result of this the charming concierge upgraded us to one of their prime suites (room 211) overlooking the canal. The view was simply staggering from our balcony and throughout our stay the staff were friendly, efficient and extremely welcoming. The terrace area on the canal is unbeatable, be it for breakfast, dinner or a drink.  Our thanks to all the staff for making our anniversary weekend such a truly memorable experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Oct 1, 2015Dear Guest,  We are delighted to learn that you had a memorable stay with us on the occasion of your 20th Wedding Anniversary and we are truly satisfied having accomplished our mission as the Gritti is indeed THE place for celebrations.
