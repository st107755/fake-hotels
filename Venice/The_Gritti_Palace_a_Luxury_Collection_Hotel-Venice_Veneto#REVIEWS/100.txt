Hotel is 5 stars in every respect. The outdoor  bar and/restaurant has wonderful views. Bring bags of money but worth every Euro. We had to leave at 530 AM for the airport and the concierge arranged everything including a porter from the dock to the check in desk.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
