Had a wonderful stay at the Gritti Palace last November. Try to avoid the rooms on the side unless you want to be woken by the sound of gondoliers serenading other tourists. The service, location, and hospitality can't be beat.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Dec 29, 2015Dear Guest,   We are delighted to read that you recently had a remarkable sojourn at The Gritti Palace and that our hotel was classified at the top of your preferred hotels’ list, for its service, hospitality and location.  As you correctly underline, two of the hotel’s sides face canals: the main façade is naturally on the Grand Canal and a side one is on a narrow canal. Both of them (actually all canals in Venice!) are literally the “roads” of this unique city, with the consequent traffic noise of boats transporting goods, people and, not least, the musical entertainment on board of gondolas.  Nonetheless, since The Gritti offers a wide selection of room categories on different part of the building, please kindly contact us directly for your future reservation: we shall be delighted to assist you and to suggest you the best solution to fit your needs!  With very best wishes,  Paolo Lorenzoni General Manager Read more
