This was our first stay at the Gritti Palace & it certainly did not disappoint. We could not fault anything at all. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, & so was our room. The location is perfect, & the staff are exceptional in every way, whilst still being 'real' as we did not feel that they were 'stuck up' at all (some other reviews have said this about the staff which we do not agree with). We throughly enjoyed the breakfast & no request was too much trouble. We also enjoyed sitting out having a drink at the bar watching the Venetian world go by. A wonderful experience!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
