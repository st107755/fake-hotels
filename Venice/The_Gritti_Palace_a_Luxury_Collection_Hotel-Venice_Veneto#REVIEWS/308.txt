This was a perfect place to stay our last few nights in Venice. We were so close to everything: gondola rides right outside, easy access to San Marco Square, as well as beautiful views of the Santa Maria Church. The staff are second to none: they help with anything and everything. The rooms are stunning and spacious. You can sit out on the Canal and enjoy a drink and watch the world pass by--truly a wonderful place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
