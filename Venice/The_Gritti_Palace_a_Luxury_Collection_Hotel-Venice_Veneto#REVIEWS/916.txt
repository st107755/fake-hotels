Stayed at the Gritti Palace July 7th to the 10th.  Perfect location in Venice.  It is close to everything and a simple water taxi ride out the front door of the hotel to everywhere that you can't or is too far to walk to.  The room was beautiful and clean and quiet.  The food at the restaurant overlooking the main canal was excellent.  The staff were all knowledgeable and helpful with directions and recommendations.  Everyone at the hotel was quite friendly.  Overall the perfect place to stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
