First let me say that if I was rating this hotel based on location alone, I would give it 5 stars, however, this review is based on my overall experience during my stay.  I had very high expectations for this hotel based on reviews I have read. Upon arrival, check in went like usual. Was not offered a warm towel or even a drink to welcome us to the hotel. Strange!

As you stated, the large majority of guest’s comments, praise the professional yet friendly attitude of the entire team (not only on social sites but also directly to the hotel, may I add).  However, it is evident that we failed to deliver to you our usual bespoke service, and for this we are truly sorry.   We hope that you may reconsider your decision and give us an opportunity to improve your impression of us. I would be delighted to personally welcome you back to The Gritti Palace  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General Manager Read more
