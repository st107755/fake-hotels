What can I add to already superlative reviews? After several years we came back to the Gritti, more beautiful than ever, after a remodeling that kept intact the grace and elegance of the Canal Grande Palace.

After a few days of breakfasting on the terrace, overlooking the Salute and the Guggenheim and the great scenery, we said sadly goodbye, but we are already planning another Venezia holiday!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
