This was our first stay at this hotel, and it exceeded our expectations in every respect. From check in to departure everything was perfect. The property is beautifully renovated, and the staff is world class. The housekeeping is impeccable, and the hotel has a great fitness room which I'm sure is not typical in Venice where space is so valuable.  We can't wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jul 8, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your patronage and for your review, we are glad to read that your expectations were exceeded.  We are also grateful for having underlined the availability - to our resident Guests only - of our newly added fitness room, adjacent to the sophisticated Blu Mediterraneo SPA by Acqua di Parma. Our Guests’ comfort is very important to us, hence the realization, in occasion of the recent restoration works, of this area dedicated to training, relaxation and beauty, the essence of “being well”.  Thank you on behalf of the entire staff -housekeeping particularly- for your appreciation.  We all look forward to welcome you back to your Venetian residence.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
