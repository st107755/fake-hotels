Having just been at the hotel, I was looking for an ATM. They have one just off the lobby. Using it I realized that there is a 12% mark up plus $3.95 charge. This is nothing short of theft. A hotel of this caliber should not allow something longer like that on their premises. Not good. Sad.

Due to this, it has been decided to place an ATM machine near the Lobby, however, being a third part company, the ATM machine does not belong to the Hotel and it is an additional service to facilitate our guests requests to withdraw cash (otherwise they would need to reach San Marco Square).  I do regret your perception of this service, but we have no responsibilities over the ATM machine (as informed in the sign placed above it). In case you desire to contact them, the customer care number is: +39 06 20 39 39 39.  Kind regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
