We came in from the rain to get some drinks and bar snack type meals . The Bellinis were wonderful and we enjoyed bread with various dips , some sandwiches etc all served with aplomb and in a luxurious setting . The Gritti chocolate cake was amazingly nice and the tiramisu wonderful . All very expensive but a nice treat with attentive service. As it was wet ,we did not sit on the Terrace but they do have a wonderful view and some lovely tables out by the water . The terrace opens at noon .Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
