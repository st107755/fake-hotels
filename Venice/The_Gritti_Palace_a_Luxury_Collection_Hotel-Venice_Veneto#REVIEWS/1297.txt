My husband and I stayed 3 nights at The Gritti Palace in early November and were ready to permanently move in.  We had a standard room NOT facing the canal. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated and the bathroom was luxurious, large and well appointed. We loved having a late afternoon drink on the deck on the Grand Canal - a better view of Venice is difficult to imagine.  We dined in the Club de Doge Restaurant and in the bar and were delighted with our meals and the service, not to mention the exquisite setting.  The staff at The Gritti Palace really make this hotel unforgettable; they were fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
