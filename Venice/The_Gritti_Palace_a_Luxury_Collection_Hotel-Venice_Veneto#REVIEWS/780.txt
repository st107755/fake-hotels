We did not stay here, but we ate at the RESTAURANT CLUB DEL DOGE and WOW.  This was definitely the best meal we had while in Venice.  The view on the deck is stunning and the gondola's going by truly enhance the experience.  Expensive, but what isn't in Venice?!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
