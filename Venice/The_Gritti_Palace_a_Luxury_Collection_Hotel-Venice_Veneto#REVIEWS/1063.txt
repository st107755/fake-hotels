We are delighted to read that you were impressed with the outcome of such a careful restoration which, as you underline, has preserved and retained the old charm and antiquities while bringing the hotel into the 21st century in terms of comfort and technology.  It is for us very important to know that your sons were captivated by the Gritti: children are usually very incisive and determined, hence uncompromising arbiters!  Thank you for having reported to us and to all Tripadvisor’s readers your sons’ feelings towards our Gritti!  We hope that your 9 years old son – naturally, together with the entire family - will soon visit us again for other "funny shower moments”!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
