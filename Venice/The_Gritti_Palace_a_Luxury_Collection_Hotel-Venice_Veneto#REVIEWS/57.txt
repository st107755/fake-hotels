Venice is such a beautiful place itself and calls for romance and love, staying here just makes Venice memories perfect. The rooms are very big and art lovers would definitely love the ambiance here, pink marble bathrooms are something else! You can enjoy breakfast downstairs or just sip cocktails on the terrace. Definitely try the River boat experience, its amazing!Read moreDate of stay: December 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
