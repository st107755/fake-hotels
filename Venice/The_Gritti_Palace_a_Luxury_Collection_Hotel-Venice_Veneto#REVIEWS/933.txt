An old, stately hotel in an awesome location right on the Grand Canal. Probably one of the best views one could have at a breakfast table anywhere. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The only let down was the staff. They weren't overly helpful and their level of service didn't match the hotel at all.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Aug 11, 2015Dear Guest,   Thank you for taking time to post your comments related to your recent experience at our Gritti.  We agree with you that our palace’s location directly on the Grand Canal is awesome, particularly since “our” section of the Grand Canal might well be considered the nicest one with an incomparable view of the magnificent “Basilica della Salute”.   It must be added that it is a very strategic position, at a walking distance to St. Mark’s Square, however in a very quiet area.   Although being a negative one, we appreciate your comment about our staff (more details would have been useful) and regret to read that you were not provided with the caring and attentive service our clients have become accustomed to.  We wish to assure you that your experience was an exception to a rule of high service standard and hope to have the privilege and opportunity to welcome you again to our Gritti in a near future to make you feel the atmosphere that made the Gritti well-known all over the world.  Yours sincerely,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
