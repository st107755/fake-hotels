While any visit to Venice is a treat, our (far too short) stay at the Gritti Palace made it an absolute joy. Nestled on the grand Canal,(enjoying a drink or meal on the terrace is a must) it brims with classically Venetian old word style yet offers modern amenities (my husband delighted in the remote for the skylight) All of the staff were gracious and helpful and shared some off the beaten track sites to visit. Maurizio was so charming and kindly upgraded us to one of the fabulous suites which boasted a huge marble bathroom, unique antiques, Murano glass lighting and original paintings. At once elegantly luxurious and discreet, it's impressive guest list not surprisingly features dignitaries and celebs past and present. Hope to return again someday!
