Cannot say enough about this truly magical Venetian hotel. The staff is exceptionally professional, warm and attentive. The concierge did a wonderful job organizing all dinners and a boat trip to Murano, Burano and Torcello, including a private tour of ARS Cenedese glass factory which amazed us all. Christmas diner in Club deal Doge was a truly special 5 course seafood menu, accompanied by a hand printed menu and hearty "Buon Natale"  echoed throughout the festively decorated dining room. A wonderful time of year to come to Venice and we felt very well looked after. Highly recommend Gritti Palace!
