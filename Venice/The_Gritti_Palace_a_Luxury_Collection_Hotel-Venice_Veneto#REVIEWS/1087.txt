Have stayed in the amazing Gritti Palace twice now and loved each visit. A beautiful location right on the Grand Canal with lovely terrace which is perfect for breakfast and to sit out in the evening. Rooms are incredibly luxurious and decorated in the Venetian style. This is the perfect hotel for a "special occasion" trip.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
