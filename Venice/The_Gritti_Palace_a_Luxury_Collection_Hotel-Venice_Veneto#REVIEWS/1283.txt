The recently refurbished and restored Gritti Palace sits astride the Grand Canal and offers guests the quintessential Venetian palazzo experience of luxury, splendour and opulence in a wonderful location. The rooms are beautifully appointed, with indulgent toiletries and heavenly beds. Staff are excellent and responsive, the breakfast room is a delight. Drinks on the canal terrace are a must. An exquisite hotel. Choose the private transfer from the airport if you can-it is magical.Read moreDate of stay: January 2014HelpfulShare
