This hotel is perfectly located for catching the water ferry.  It is close to San Marco square (probably an 8 minute hike).  There are a few restaurants close by if you don't want to eat at the hotel.  The bar here is right on the canal so a great place to watch the traffic on the water.  Our room was very nice (king sized on the 3rd floor) and very quiet.  Better yet, the a/c really worked well.  The hotel and our room were very elegantly appointed, and the staff was very helpful in giving us directions for various places we wanted to go.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
