Lovely position to sit and watch the grand canal, drinks are pricy as you would expect on location for a 5 star hotel but the service is impeccable, we also ate lunch there one day, both having a chicken caesar salad ( think it was about â‚¬15 ) it was lovely though and very filling. A trip.to the toilet is worth it too seeing the signsd pictures of guests such as robin Williams. Definitely a place to visit Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
