Very nice old world luxury hotel. I am a concierge level SPG member and used multiple suite upgrades on our recent Italy trip. However, we were not prepared to find ourselves in the €9,500 per night Terrazza Redentore Suite for several nights! Probably unfair to base our review on this amazing experience, but we were smiling from start to finish. Every detail conveys opulence, down to the heated towel rack (take that, St. Regis!) and the mouthwash. Only word of caution to future guests would be to make reservations at the restaurant in advance to avoid having to go elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Dec 29, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having shared your “amazing experience” with the readers of Tripadvisor; your review is surely not unfair since this is your authentic memoir.  We are delighted to read that your were stunned by the multiple upgrades to the unique Redentore Suite featuring a 250 square meters private roof top terrace and by its opulence!  Thank you as well for your advice to our future Guests: restaurant reservations, and allow us to add SPA reservations, are always welcome! It makes us uncomfortable to deny a request, although a last minute one…  We hope you will consider our hotel your residing personal address when visiting Venice again in the future.   Best wishes,  Paolo Lorenzoni General Manager Read more
