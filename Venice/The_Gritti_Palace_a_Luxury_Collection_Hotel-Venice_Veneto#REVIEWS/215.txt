We recently completed our first visit to Venice. This beautiful city is replete with historical sites. The Gritti Palace may be counted along these historical sites as it dates back to the fifteenth century. Our room was beautifulâ€”decorative woodwork and marble bathroom. The property is well situated on the Grand Canal, not far from San Marco Square and the Doge Palace. Our only complaint with the Gritti Palace was the absolute indifference of the Concierge. We asked for fine dining suggestions and he referred us to a touristy pizza and pasta place. We ended up making our own dinner reservations through a Google search. We expected more from the Concierge staff. Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
