We had an exceptional Christmas holiday in this fine hotel. The suite felt like home and the staff was perfectly accommodating. Room 210 upgrade was a dream. The details are as one would expect. The hotel is authentic and central. Do not miss the breakfast and be sure to taxi out!Read moreDate of stay: December 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
