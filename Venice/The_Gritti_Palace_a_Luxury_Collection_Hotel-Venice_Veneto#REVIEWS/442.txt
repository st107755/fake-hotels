Hard to beat a stay in the classic Gritti Palace in Venice. Breakfast and lunch overlooking the gondolas with the best view in the city. The staff is also great and helped me offer a birthday cake in the room for my friend. Walking/Boating distant to main attractions.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
