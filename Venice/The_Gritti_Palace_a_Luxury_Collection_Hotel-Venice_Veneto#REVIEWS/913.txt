An awesome weekend during the Carnival with SNOW !  Wishing we had gone to stay for much longer, as we have to return to see so much we missed.  The side streets are best for great food at good prices and where the locals eat :)   although we also enjoyed meals along the Grand Canal in superb restaurants.  The MASK shops especially Valantina's were such and eye opener to this ancient art. Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
