This was a great hotel for our two nights in Venice. The location is close to the San Marco area but far enough away from the crowds and noise. Our rooms was beautiful and functional, overlooking a side canal. Service was excellent. We loved ending our first night with a cocktail on the terrace on the Grand Canal. Highly recommended if you have the points or cash to splash out a bit.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
