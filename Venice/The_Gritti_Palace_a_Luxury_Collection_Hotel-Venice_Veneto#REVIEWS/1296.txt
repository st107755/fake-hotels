A fabulous hotel! Room and public spaces all beautiful. Staff completely charming and helpful, and manage to make you feel at home straight away. We had a Prestige room  - very spacious, with a sideways view of the Grand Canal, and a vast marble bathroom. Champagne breakfast on the terrace in the morning sun, even in November!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
