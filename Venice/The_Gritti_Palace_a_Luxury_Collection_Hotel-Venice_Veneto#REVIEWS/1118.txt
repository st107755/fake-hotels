As an SPG Platinum (100+) member, I've stayed in a lot of hotels in the last years, but the Gritti Palace in Venice was for sure on of the best so far. Great stuff, nice rooms and a proper Venice style interior. It is obviously from a price point of view in a different league to a lot of average hotels, but once in a while you need to do a trip like this. Fortunately we had fantastic weather (18° end of October), so the breakfast in the morning outside at the terrace was already a highlight on its own. The area is great and in my view fortunately not in the crowdie markus square area, but still well placed to reach the main attractions. For sure a recommendation if you plan to travel to venice and in my view THE top hotel in Venice!  PS. Make sure you get to the hotel at night…Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Nov 12, 2014Dear Guest,  We are delighted to read your positive impressions on TripAdvisor, particularly given your SPG Platinum member status and your frequent stays at the best hotels worldwide.
