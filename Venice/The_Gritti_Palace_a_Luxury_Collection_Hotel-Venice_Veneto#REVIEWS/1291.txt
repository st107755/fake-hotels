The only issue that I had with the Hotel is that it puts all the rest to shame...!  This was by far the best hotel I have ever been to. It is grand, yet relaxed. You can wear your tux or your trainers and no one will care one way or the other.  The hotel looks stunning. It has been restored wonderfully paying homage and attention to the original venetian interiors, using a lot of local materials. Fabrics, glasses, floors.   It feels more like a private house than a hotel.  The staff is very well trained, kind and fast. The concierge organised for us a beautiful boat trip. I know Venice quite well and they made sure I went to places I didn't know yet.  I am already planning a trip for next year.Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
