We all are moved by your thoughtful note and knowing that The Gritti Palace is the place you elected for your birthday celebrations, means a lot to us.   We are most pleased to read that many of the team members remembered you from your last visit and that you felt most welcomed, like visiting old dear friends.  This reminds us to a letter of Somerset Maugham, who in 1960 wrote a letter saying: “For at the Gritti you are not merely a number …..; you are a friend who has been welcomed as he stepped out of his motor boat, …. you cannot but feel very much at home”.  Thank you so very much for letting us know that this unique perception, beloved by many generations of extraordinary Guests, remained unchanged over the years….  We look forward to your next birthday party with us!  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
