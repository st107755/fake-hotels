We arrived with a taxi boat directly onto the hotel private pontoon. On a beautiful sunny day, it is simply exceptional. From checking in to checking out everything was perfect. The concierge is very friendly and provided us with great recommendations for lunch, dinners and things to visit. The room was nice and breakfast on the river-side terrace has an exceptional view. We cannot wait to come back. Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
