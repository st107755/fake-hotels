The Gritti gave us the lap of luxury in the heart of Venice. The room while modest in size was beautifully appointed down to the last detail. The service was excellent. We most enjoyed sitting on the terrace and enjoying the spectacular view on the grand canal. Expensive but worth the price. Of course you have no view from your room unless you are ready to take out a second mortgage.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
