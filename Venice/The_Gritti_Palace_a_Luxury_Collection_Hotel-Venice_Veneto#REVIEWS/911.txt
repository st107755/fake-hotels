We finished our trip to Italy with 2 nights in Venice.  This hotel was the right choice to finish on a high note.  From check in through checkout, everything was great!.  The room was very nice and breakfast was outstanding.  Sitting on the Grand Canal with the sun rising was very special and something I hope never to forget.  There is no question as to why this is the best rated place to stay in Venice.  We were at the Waldorf in Rome before this and the Gritti Palace made the Waldorf feel like a Motel 6.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
