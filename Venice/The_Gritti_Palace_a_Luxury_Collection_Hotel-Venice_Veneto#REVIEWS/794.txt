We had a room with all wooden walls and paintings but no view on the canal. The room was quite small but beautiful and you dive into the atmosphere of different times.  It is a perfect location for the trip to Venice and even if the service and the hotel is not what it used to be it remains one of the most beautiful places in Venice.  It is very easy to get around from there, walking of by taking the boat of course.  For Breakfast I am a bit particular and like to just walk out early and find some authentic places for a real italian coffee or espresso.  April is a good moment to visit Venice, it's pleasently warm, sometimes a bit rainy but just what makes the city appear more dreamy and beautiful and April is the perfect spring time before the mass tourism starts.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Feb 21, 2016Dear Client, thank you to have provided your personal feedback towards our Gritti Palace. From my understanding you chose one of the authentic venetian '700 style double with wooden boiserie  which recalls ancient times. Sorry to read that the service was not in line with your expectations but from the many positive independent reviews we have, tells we are on the right track . We always can do better .
