A five star experience at a 5 star hotel. We had a lovely room, extremely spacious by European standards. Luxuriously appointed bathroom and amenities. Super comfy bed. Staff and concierges all wonderful. The Gritti has a cooking school and we spent a morning taking lessons with the executive chef, Daniele. If you want a break from all those Tintorettos, highly recommend. You will not be disappointed at The Griitti.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Sep 1, 2014Dear Guest,   Your gracious review of your recent visit is most appreciated.
