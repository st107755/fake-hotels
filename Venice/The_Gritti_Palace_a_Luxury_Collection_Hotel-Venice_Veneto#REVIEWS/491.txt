What a great hotel! Perfect location and the view from the Grand Canal room was worth the price. Free wifi & breakfast was included since I reserved the room through Fine Hotels and Resorts. The staff were wonderful, always helpful pointing you in the right direction, or offering to get tickets for Venice landmarks. Can't wait to go back!Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
