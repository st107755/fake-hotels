We checked-in to our room and there were two double beds pushed together (we were supposed to get a king). We called and told them the problem, which they said would be fixed when we returned from dinner. Four hours later (and later that evening) we returned to find nothing had been done. At $1,000/night you think they would go out of their way to make perfect? On top of this, the air conditioning had power save on it. We put it on high, but it was still very hot.  Would not stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Aug 6, 2013Dear Guest,   Thank you for having shared your experience with the TripAdvisor community.  We take great pride in providing our guests with the highest quality standards and I am very sorry that on this occasion we failed to meet your expectations.   We are usually very attentive concerning the bedding preference of our Guests and this is one of the questions we do always place during the reservation process. In those cases when the booking is not handled by the reservation department, we do normally assign our Clients to double rooms (the most required bedding type).  Your comments have been brought to the attention of the Department Heads involved for corrective action and, considering the standardized procedures already in place, I can only imagine that your experience was an isolated case most probably caused by a human error.  I regret we were not able to rectify your feelings prior to your departure, but I hope you will allow us another opportunity to show you how much we care of our Guests.   Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
