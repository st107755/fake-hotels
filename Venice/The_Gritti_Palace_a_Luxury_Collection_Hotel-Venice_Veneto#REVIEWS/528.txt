Beautiful luxury hotel in stunning location the staff were friendly and helpful. It was always a pleasure returning to this oasis after long day of exploring Venice. The Riva lounge was great enjoyed sipping on limoncello and watching the boats go up and down the canal they also have a really good breakfast!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
