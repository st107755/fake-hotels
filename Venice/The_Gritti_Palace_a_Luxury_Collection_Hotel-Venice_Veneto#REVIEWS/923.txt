When you stay at a tourist hotel you expect to be treated like a tourist even when you are an SPG Platinum member and when it's a SPG Luxury collection hotel, given previous experiences. Not at the Gritti, from the moment you arrive you get a sense of team work and people who care about you. Everyone and everything is personal and friendly. The staff have time to speak to you and make you feel like a person not a number. We used two suite nights to upgrade our room and I must say they were the best two suite nights we have ever used. Dinner waterside in the restaurant was amazing, make sure you try the cabinet and the Riva Bar is exceptional, especially the drink selection and we loved the furniture. Breakfast is relaxed and great quality. Well done the team at the Gritti Palaceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
