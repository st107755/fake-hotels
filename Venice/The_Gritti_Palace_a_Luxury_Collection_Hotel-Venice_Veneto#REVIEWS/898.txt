The Gritti Palace hotel is a luxurious property to be sure, but it is pretentious while still hosting tour groups.  My husband & I splurged for a 6 night stay here for my 60th birthday in an upgraded room that originally did not have a view of the Grand canal. It cost us over $12,000 for the entire stay.  What a waste.  My husband & I are professionals—not any kind of recognizable VIPs as per the celebrity wall in the hotel--& we were made to feel like pretenders at first.  We are accustomed to staying in luxury properties the world over & this was only the 3rd hotel in the world that challenged whether we were guests probably because it is our habit to walk in & out of  hotels instead of ordering taxis—in this case, water taxis.

We apologize for not having been able to provide you with our usual caring, attentive and bespoke service and most of all for having failed to transmit you that sense of warmth to make you feel most welcome, aspect which usually distinguishes our team of professionals. We are sure that it would have left you with a different impression.  As far as your comment concerning the public area on the Grand Canal is concerned - which is a wooden terrace where our bar and restaurant facilities are located as you mentioned – your additional statement is not clear to us since no cover charge is required to simply sit outside.   In fact, we have several guests relaxing on the restaurant terrace in between meal periods, although the majority prefer, throughout the day, to take a seat on the bar section and sip a drink.   Among the many duties of the Concierge there naturally is the ticket purchase, service which is regularly rendered. Nevertheless, for those arrangements which can only be booked and purchased on-line, the concierge prefers not doing it personally since this would involve requesting guests’ credit card details, sensitive data which have to be carefully handled and securely stored.   We hope you will allow us another opportunity to show you how much we care of our Guests and to improve your impression on your next trip to Venice; we invite you to contact the Executive Office to take care of your next reservation.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
