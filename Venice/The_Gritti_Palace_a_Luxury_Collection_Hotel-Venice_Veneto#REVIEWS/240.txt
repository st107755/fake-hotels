Building has been repurposed as a hotel which generates a unique character to the facility.   Location was an easy walk to most of the main attractions.  The water taxi stop Giglio is one building from the hotel.  Gondolas are available at the front door.  Both are super convenient to the hotel.  Our room was spacious with a pleasurable view of the Grand Canal.  Shower had a drainage problem but was corrected very quickly.  Bathroom lighting was the best of our Italian hotels. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Did not dine at the hotel only had drinks on the terrace.  Terrace has a great view and could be enjoyed for hours.  Prices are not cheap (ie wifes Crown and Coke was 30 euros).  The complimentary bottle of wine was a nice and very tasty gift. Overall a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
