The Palace is so lovely, it was such a treat to stay there. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The terrace on the canal  in the front of the palace is a must to sit and have breakfast, lunch drinks etc. It was a wonderful vantage point to view the action on the canal. I would highly recommend a stay so that you can enjoy a wonderful hotel in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
