First 3 nights of our honeymoon were here.  This was an incredibly beautiful hotel.  We were upgraded to a suite - and it was AMAZING. Highly highly recommend.  It was beautiful, clean, luxurious, quiet and romantic.  We were greeted with a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit.  Hotel staff were as professional as you can get!  Fitness studio was a bit small, but - who works out in Venice anyway?!  You walk 20 miles a day!!!  The view of the canal was lovely - tables right on the water with the most amazing view of an old cathedral.  There is a spa downstairs if you want - we did not so I cannot rate.  This is a hidden gem - a true place of luxury - and a place among celebrities.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare
