A historical and luxury hotel on the Grand Canal. The place is perfect with a beautiful view on the canal and near to San Marco Square on foot. The decoration is absolutely amazing and travels you to the magic old Venice... The room (a Giglio one) has enough space, very clean and with an extra nice bed. The marble bathroom is quite big and luxurious with Aqua di Parma products. The staff was excellent at all. At the reception and the concierge desk was so helpful and at the restaurant and the bar were so polite! To stay at Gritti Palace is a part of the experience of VeniceRead moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
