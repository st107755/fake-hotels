Stayed here with my two Daughters.  Was worried about connecting rooms and they accommodated us over email which made me feel more comfortable. This is hands down the nicest place I ever stayed, it was like stepping back in time.  The rooms were wonderful, and there was a nice bottle of wine there to greet us.  The breakfast and dinner options were fantastic and they accommodated our Gluten Free needs. The staff was excellent, from picking us up at the train station to check out and everything in between.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 28, 2017Dear Guest,  We are grateful for your nice review and for being willing to assign more than five stars to The Gritti Palace!
