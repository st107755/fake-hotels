Venice is an odd, slightly crazy and definitely busy city. The huge influx of tourists and cruise ships can impact almost everything you do. BUT at Gritti Palace none of this matters. It is a sublime hotel with exceptional staff, especially in the restaurant. The breakfast team were outstanding but at lunch, right on the Grand Canal, it was like being a rock star. This is a wonderful place to soak up the splendour of Venice and avoid the crush that happens around St Mark's. The rooms are wonderful along with the bathroom and linens. My room was noisy due to staff prep early in the morning which was the only negative. Worth every cent, it is a fabulous Italian experience. Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Oct 2, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you for your review and for sharing your experience with us.   You are absolutely right, Venice is a small and busy city however, the Grittiâ€™s location although very central and with the main attractions at a walking distance, shelters our guests from the crowd.  We are very happy to hear that you savored the time spent on our terrace and the services of our waiting staff at breakfast and lunch. Providing our guests with the best possible hospitality and service has always been our aim.   On the other hand, we are really sorry for the noise you could hear early in the morning. It would be helpful to us receiving more details on the room you occupied and, to this end, we kindly ask you to contact us via email, thank you very much.   We really hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back soon to our Gritti Palace and to allow you a nice, undisturbed sleep until later in the morning...  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
