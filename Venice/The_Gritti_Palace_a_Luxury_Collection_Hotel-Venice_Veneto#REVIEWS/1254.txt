We stayed in a Giglio Prestige room which overlooked the quiet street near the church.  The decor, fiitings and attention to detail made it very special. From the moment we arrived, service was fantastic.  Check in was charming, seated rather than the usual hovering at reception.  Room and restaurant service were both impeccable.  Breakfasts on the terrace, watching the world go by, were a real treat. The Concierge service was also very helpful. The Gritti was a fantastic experience and  we would very happily stay again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
