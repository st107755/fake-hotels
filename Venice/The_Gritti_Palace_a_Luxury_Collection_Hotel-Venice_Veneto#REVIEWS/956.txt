Arriving in style by water taxi, you feel special the moment you step onto the jetty. This hotel rates as one of the very best. It's location on The Grand Canal can't be beaten, watching the hustle and bustle along the canal while having breakfast or a late evening nightcap. Attentive staff, concierge and beautifully appointed room all added to the ambience. Will definitely visit again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
