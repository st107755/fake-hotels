We had a great two night stay in the Gritti palace. Our room was absolutely gorgeous the marble tiled bathrooms were exquisite! The hotel decor is very old but with a very comfortable feel. The location was great. The employees were attentive and very friendly. The outdoor restaurant in the grand canal was lovely. While we never ate dinner there the breakfast and lunch was very good we sat outside one night for drinks and it was quite lovely. I highly recommended this hotel!
