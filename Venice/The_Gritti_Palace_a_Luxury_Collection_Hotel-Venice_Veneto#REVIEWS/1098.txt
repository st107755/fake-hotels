I have stayed at many hotels in my lifetime and this hotel was by far the nicest and my favorite hotel in the world. The rooms were absolutely gorgeous, clean and comfortable. The hotel itself is gorgeous and I could have spent all day gawking at the details of the hotel. The staff is phenomenal, everyone we encountered was absolutely amazing, I have never felt so welcome at another hotel. The food is unbelieveable we ate in the hotel bar several times because of how delicious the food and drinks were. I highly recommend afternoon tea at the hotel! I am not familiar with locations in Venice, but I felt the hotel was in a good location we were able to walk to a large amount of shops and the square fairly quickly. Yes, the hotel was expensive, but it was worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
