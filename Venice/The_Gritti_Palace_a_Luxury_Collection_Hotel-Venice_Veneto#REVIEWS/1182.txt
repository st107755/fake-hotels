We have just returned home to London after three excellent nights staying in The Gritti Palace, the staff were very helpful, nothing seemed to much trouble, checking is easy you are escorted to your room, cases arrive shortly after, complementary wine and water.  Thank you Gritti Palace for your attention to detail making a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
