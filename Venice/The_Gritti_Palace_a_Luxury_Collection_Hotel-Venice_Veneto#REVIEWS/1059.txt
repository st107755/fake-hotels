What a beautiful Hotel. Everything in this hotel is beautiful; the furnishings, the linens, the paintings and lamps.The room we had was spacious and quite luxurious. I especially loved the warmed marble bathroom and the Aqua di Parma toiletries. The staff were friendly, helpful and kind.  We were in Venice in January, so there were no crowds in the city and the hotel itself was very quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thank you Gritti Palace for making my partner's birthday trip to Venice especially memorable.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 27, 2015Thank you, dear Guest, for having privileged us on occasion of your celebration and for having publically shared your memorable experience at The Gritti Palace.
