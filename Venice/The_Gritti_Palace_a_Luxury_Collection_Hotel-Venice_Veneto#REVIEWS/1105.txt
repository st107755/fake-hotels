Give it a miss as there are a lot of other better places.

Upon your check-out we were very pleased to learn that you had overall an enjoyable stay and appreciated all services received, with the exception of the breakfast on your first day of stay.  Although being this not an excuse, please be informed that on that morning the coincidence of the temporarily absence of the responsible person plus the presence of newly hired staffs, led to your dissatisfaction which we do regret very much.  Please be assured that appropriate action was already taken in the outlined area.   We wish to apologize if in this occasion we were not able to entirely meet your expectations and we sincerely hope you will allow us another opportunity to show you that we can do much better.  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
