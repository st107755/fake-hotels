Coming from a Boat taxi in the Grand Canale the Gritti is just another beautiful building like all the rest on the sides. Once you are greeted by the concierge on the dock, time stands still...

And the "plat de resistance" is the best terrace in all of Venice which we could not have enough of. The room is spacious and extremely well renovated without compromise to the authenticity of times and themes.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
