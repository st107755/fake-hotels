We had a wonderful stay at Gritti Palace earlier this month . We booked deluxe Rooms and we were upgraded to beautiful heritage suites, very venezian style. Everything is very authentic and charming. Concierge, front desk and restaurant service were perfect without any exception. Breakfast with a view not to be missed, by all means book their breakfast inclusive rates, you will not regret!!Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
