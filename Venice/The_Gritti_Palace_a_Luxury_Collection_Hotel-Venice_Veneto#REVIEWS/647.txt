I love grand historic hotels. The Gritti Palace shines as the best I will probably ever experience. Everything (bed comfort, bath and bed linens, shower size and water pressure, lighting, television, etc.) was modern, clean and of the best quality while maintaining the hotel's historic character. All employees were excellent. Somehow, the hotel manages to provide all modern comforts while being true to its history.  Even if this hotel were not in one of the most beautiful settngs on Earth, I would seek it out as a place to relax in luxury.  If you are trying to decide between the Gritti Palace and other luxury hotels in Venice, look no further, this is it!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Aug 21, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having defined The Gritti Palace the best hotel you have ever experienced, thanks to the knowledgeable combination of historic atmosphere, modern comfort and skillful service.
