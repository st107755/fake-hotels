It's the second time I have stayed at the Gritti Palace Hotel, first on business, this time with my wife, superb adventure from the time the water taxi left the airport to being greeted at the Hotel docking point at the Hotel, food, room, staff all excellent, which we all expect from this class of Hotel, but all too often do not receive. We visited the other first class Hotels for lunch and still say that the "Gritti Palace" is the best.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Sep 15, 2014Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind comments and for finding our hotel to be the best one in Venice!
