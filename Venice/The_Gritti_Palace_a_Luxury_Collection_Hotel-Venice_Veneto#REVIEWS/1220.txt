As usual high end Starwood does not disappoint! This place doesn't look like much from the outside but the rooms absolutely extravagant and lavish. Incredible decor, luxe fittings and fixtures and a bathroom to die for! The restaurant was a standout, outstanding service from a professional staff that view waiting as a serious career and do it with the utmost professionalism and knowledge. Only a short stay but will definitely be back! Always love the Starwood beds and linen!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
