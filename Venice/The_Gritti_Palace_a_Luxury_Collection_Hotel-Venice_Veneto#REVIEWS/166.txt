What an amazing place. From the minute you set foot in the door to the minute you leave. Attentive staff, beautiful decor and lovely treats for you in your rooms. Large room with an amazing bathroom, thoughtful gifts on arrival and complimentary water each night. Perfect location for exploring the city and the best cocktail bar in town. I canâ€™t wait to return. Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
