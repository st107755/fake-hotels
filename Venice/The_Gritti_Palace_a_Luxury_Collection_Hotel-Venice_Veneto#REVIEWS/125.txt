We have just spent 3 nights at the Gritti and can’t recommend it enough.  Perfect central location; impeccable hospitality from the moment we stepped off the boat; attentive staff and concierge to help us avoid the boring tourist traps and make helpful suggestions and reservations; huge rooms and deluxe bathrooms; excellent breakfast on the Grand Canal and sunset drinks at the waterfront bar.  It’s location was ideal for all our planned outings and activities.  It’s exactly what you expect from a “Grand” hotel.  We most definitely will be back!Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
