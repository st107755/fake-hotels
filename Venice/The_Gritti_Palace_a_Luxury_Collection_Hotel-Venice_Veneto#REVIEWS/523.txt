My third year staying at the wonderful hotel on my birthday and it just gets better and better!  Superb decor, wonderful staff - I have run out of superlatives!!!  We were upgraded to a beautiful suite and given beautiful roses from the hotel on my birthday.  My husband and I had a massage in the gorgeous Aqua de Palma spa and an excellent dinner in the Doges restaurant - and a birthday cake courtesy of the hotel. Very expensive but worth it!!Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
