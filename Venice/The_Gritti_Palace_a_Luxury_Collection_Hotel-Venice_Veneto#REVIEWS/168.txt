We spent a couple of nights here. We got a grand Canal of you room, which was phenomenal! Everything about this hotel is beyond beautiful. We were treated very well by all the staff. If you get a chance, please stay here at least once in your life. You will feel like royalty.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
