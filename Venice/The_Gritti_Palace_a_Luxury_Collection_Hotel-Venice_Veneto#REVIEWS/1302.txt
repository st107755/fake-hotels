In anticipation and trepidation we returned to the Gritti for the first time since its reopening.  Would it have been ruined by changes to its essential character under the guise of refurbishment?  No need to fear - it remains the ulitmate Venetian destination combining opulence with discretion.  Its prize assest, its staff, seem simply to have returned after a lengthy holiday and even a curious incident in the night time was perfectly handled.  One reviewer once headed their conribution "Gritti not greaty".  Well in my book it's perfection.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Dec 22, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having elected The Gritti Palace as your private Venetian residence years ago and for continuing being one of our esteemed loyal Guests.
