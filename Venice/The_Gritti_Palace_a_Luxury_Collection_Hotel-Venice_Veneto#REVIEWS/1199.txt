Wear your breezy casual summer wear with fabulous accessories to flash your style. Dolce & Gabbana anything is the top or go sleek Prada to contrast the ornate backdrop that is Venice. Hotel breakfast sumptuous & on time.  Coffee could be stronger and more storage would be helpful, but who cares?! There's lots of fabulous Italian Vogue & AD magazines sliding off every flat surface that will drive you to distraction. Enjoy lounging in lobby lounge or canal side bar with a Bellini in hand.
