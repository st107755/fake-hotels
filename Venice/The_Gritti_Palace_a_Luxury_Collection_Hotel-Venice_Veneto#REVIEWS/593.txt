I popped in for lunch and cocktails on the terrace with my partner, it was lovely inside and had a beautiful view of the grand canal, the drinks and food were great. I give the review an average one due to the fact the service is sloppy, plates and glasses being left on table for half an hour not acceptable also not a great deal of attention on people sat outside i appreciate the lads are working hard but 2 people catering for 30 outside not helping, could do with more waiters on hand. and a black hair was found on my potatoes of my beef fillet dish it was changed for a fresh one swiftly but still not nice, they need some training in a michelin star restaurant in england i was expecting precision service for the price i left feeling a little disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Oct 10, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having underlined both the positive as well as the negative aspects of your lunch experience at our Club del Doge Restaurant.
