It has been really well refurbished and the rooms are excellent. You pay a very hefty price - E1200 per night for our room: very spacious but no view.  Some service was good and friendly but then there were two episdoes of dreadful service and sadly we witnessed others having similiar experiences.  Our second drinks order at the bar that didnt arrive for about 30 minutes and a breakfast order which was not only wrong but delivered about 40 minutes late (after the maitre d had twice had to chase it up).  The service was so bad that I dont think I could recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, Direttore generale at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear Guest,  First of all thank you for having chosen The Gritti Palace for your Venetian sojourn and for having summarized your experience through your comment on this site.  Despite being pleased to learn that you consider our rooms excellent and that you could enjoy a friendly and good service in some departments, we are really sorry to read of the difficulties you encountered in some others having to wait for a long time for your orders to be delivered.   Although this is certainly not an excuse, please be informed that we have undergone some system changes with the consequent failures, i.e. orders not being transmitted and/or mixed up.  Please allow us to apologize for the experienced disservices which are not a fair reflection of our usual high standard of service and customer care.  We do appreciate that you do not feel as to recommending us to other travelers; nevertheless, we hope that you will allow us another chance to welcome you back to show you we can do much better!  Best regards,  Paolo  Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
