We have been to Venice several times (my favorite city) and stayed in a few different hotels, but we keep coming back to The Gritti Palace.  Everything about it is top-notch!  The staff is first rate; the food is outstanding and the rooms are beautifully appointed.  In our opinion, the location is ideal since it is on the Grand Canal, convenient to explore a vast area yet a distance from the suffocating crowds around San Marco Square.  Having a meal or just a hot chocolate on the veranda is like being in a fairytale!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
