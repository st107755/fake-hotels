Luxurious, beautiful hotel with a very accommodating and hospitable staff. Every room in the building is something to view that will amaze you. Our room was decadent and almost to comfortable to leave and tour the city! Dinner and breakfast is fantastic but drinks on the terrace with fantastic view is a must. Thank you so much for making my first trip to Venice so special!Read moreDate of stay: January 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
