This was a lovely hotel.  We stayed for five nights and would definitely visit again.  The staff was polite and friendly and ready to help with whatever we needed.  It's conveniently located near excellent restaurants, shops and just a few minutes' walk from St. Mark's Square.    We would recommend this hotel to anyone considering a stay!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
