We had an absolutely lovely stay at the Gritti Palace. I booked a room last minute on points for a girls reunion on Venice, and from the moment we got there we were just so impressed with the fantastic service and attention to detail by the staff. From the fantastic upgrade to a massive suite with a Grand Canal view, to the bottle of wine to greet us, to the incredible breakfast on the Grand Canal terrace, the Gritti Palace exceeded all possible expectations. Definitely one of my favourite hotels I've ever stayed in, and one of the best SPG properties out there!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
