Located in middle of the grand Canal Gritti Palace is everything you would have hoped for in Vennice.  Just open the window of your room and you ll see gondola boats pass by with boats and some singing. Located right on grand canal means you can walk around to most of the tourist places and if needed can take the water taxi from the station which is 5 mins walk away from the hotel. There are multiple restaurant around so you are not stuck with just the hotel restaurants. We had our breakfast at the hotel which was scrumptious. The rooms are extremely luxurious and spacious.  All in all the Gritti Palace lives upto its name of luxuryRead moreDate of stay: February 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
