We had a great lunch here in the Riva Lounge and some pre-lunch cocktails including their indigenous blue Riva Cocktail which was very nice. We had some nice pasta for lunch which was tasty, well prepared and delivered by friendly staff and although a little expensive itâ€™s a great venue on the grand canal and you get to see all the signed pictures of the famous guests that have frequented the place over the years. It was a little cold to sit on the terrace but probably worth a visit in the spring to sip cocktails whilst watching the grand canal.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare
