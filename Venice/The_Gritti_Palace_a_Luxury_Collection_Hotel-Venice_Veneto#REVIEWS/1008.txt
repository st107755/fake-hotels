This is luxury at its finest! The Venetian canal-facing location cannot be beat. The stay began with a personal escort to our room. Marble bath and shower with Acqua Di Parma products. Quick walk to San Marco Piazza... Centrally located to great shopping and restaurants. Highly, highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
