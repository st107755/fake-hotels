This is lovely hotel located on the Grand Canal.  The rooms are big and plenty of room for luggage and storage. I never saw a maid or a cart but no matter what time I left my room it was always made up when I returned. The staff is beyond helpful and accommodating. Book the breakfast with the room and you will be treated to an extensive buffet in addition to being able to order whatever you want off the menu. All of it is served outdoors overlooking the grand canal. If you are lucky you will be seated by the wonderful, Angelo, who will take care of your every wish! Finish the day with a Spritz, or two, at the bar also over looking the Canal. You will be pampered here by a staff that only wants to serve you. A wonderful place to come home to after walking through Venice!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
