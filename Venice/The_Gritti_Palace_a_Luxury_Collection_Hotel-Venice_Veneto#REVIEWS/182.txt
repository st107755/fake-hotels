Just stayed for 3 nights at the Gritti Palace, and had the most incredible time.  From the moment we checked in and were greeted by Silvia, everything was seamless.  We were lucky and got upgraded to a better room with canal view, and enjoyed complimentary breakfast (delicious) with marriott platinum status (some of the best benefits we've enjoyed).  The room was stunningly beautiful, the bar was fantastic (pricey, as you'd expect) and breakfast delicious.  I've seen a couple of comments on here about the concierge crew - I have to agree that they're not as warm/friendly/naturally helpful as the rest of the staff, which I found a little odd, given everyone else is clearly expert in intuitive customer service.  It certainly didn't spoil our trip though - what a treat!Read moreDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare
