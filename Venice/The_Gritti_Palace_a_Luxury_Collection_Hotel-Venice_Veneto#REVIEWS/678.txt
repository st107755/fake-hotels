This was truly the grandest hotel we've ever had the pleasure of staying in. From the professional pickup at the airport, to the enormous and immaculately decorated room everything radiated class and elegance. The canal view felt truly special, and at night the enormous bed, carerra marble bathroom and incredibly large lounge provided the perfect base and home in Venice.   Breakfast was good, and the canal side bar a great place to watch Venice pass by. Service was professional and attentive, and the communal areas grand.  Compared to other five star hotels, the lack of pool, complimentary pick-up and other shared facilities was notable, but given the incredible room and hospitality (and city beyond) it didn't matter. The emphasis is really on the rooms and location here.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare
