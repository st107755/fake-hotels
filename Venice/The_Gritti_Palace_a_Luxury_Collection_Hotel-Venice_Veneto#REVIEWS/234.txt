Beautiful palace hotel full of such rich history that the Venetians are proud of. The hotel recently went through a remodel and is just breathtaking. Dinner at their restaurant on the Grand Canal is a must! The food, view and ambiance was unforgettable. Venice will always have our hearts thanks to the amazing Gritti Palace!Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
