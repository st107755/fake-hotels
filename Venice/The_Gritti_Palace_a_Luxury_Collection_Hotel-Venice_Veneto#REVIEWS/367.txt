We really enjoyed our time here and wish it could have been for longer. It is in the heart of Venice, but just enough on the edge that you are not overrun by people coming in and out. The water bus stop that is nearby is along main routes, there are gondola places nearby, and of course lots of great places to eat and drink. Venice is really one of the most iconic places to visit and, because of it's awesome location and grand exterior, the hotel itself makes for some great photos. The staff was amazing, very helpful and friendly. They went out of their way to help us as we were newly adjusting to the time difference and, to make a long story short, helped us from even almost forgot some of our luggage!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
