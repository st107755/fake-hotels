Oh my, this hotel is beautiful! So grand and full of character.  The room, although on the smaller side, was beautiful and well appointed. The toiletries were acqua di Parma and the bathroom... no words. It’s magnificent.  The bar was really good and a nice place to have a drink before dinner. Also the outdoor seating has such a wonderful view.   The only negative about this hotel was the recommendations for restaurants. They sold hard on certain places and even had a pamphlet? Hmmm, I don’t prefer hotel recommendations like.  Also this very close to Harry’s bar! Definitely make a stop there :)Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
