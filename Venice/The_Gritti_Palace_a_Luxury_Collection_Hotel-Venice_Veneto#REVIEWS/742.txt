Seen this fab hotel after riding the traghetto gondola crossing and knew it had a good reputation so went in for a drink on the sunny verandah facing the canal, we had a hot chocolate which was amazing and a latte and enjoyed the complimentary biscuits with it, we watched a cruise liner pass in the background and listened to the gondola singers. Wifi didn't work at the hotel, so that was disappointing, loved the pictures & signatures of hollywoods greatest on the corridor wall on the way to the rest rooms Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded May 11, 2016Dear Guest,  We would like to thank you for having visited us during your Venetian sojourn and for having shared your experience with the readers of this site.
