We stayed here using SPG points. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the room was with points. Both the bedroom and bathroom were spacious (an understatement) and luxurious. We liked that one can contact the concierge through WhatsApp.  The hotel is easily accessible through the public boats. We took a private speedboat when we departed, which was easily arranged through the hotel. It's expensive but we felt it was worth the splurge for the experience and ease.  Our favorite part of staying here (and what I had been most excited about from the photos online) was breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Canal. It was picture perfect! The food was delicious and watching the gondolas go by and hearing their serenades was one of my favorite memories of Venice.
