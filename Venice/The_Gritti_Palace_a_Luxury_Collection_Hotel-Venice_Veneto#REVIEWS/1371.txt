On a sunny afternoon where on earth can beat lunch at one of the outdooor tables at the Gritti? The views of the traffic on Grand Canal may be matched at the Regina but the food and service at the Gritti are unsurpassed. Of course its expensive but all top end eating experiences are going to be so - and its great value which is more important. My sole negative is that (as with all the "grand" Grand Canal hotels the menu states that prices include vat and service. Staff at all these hotels state that the money is kept by the hotel and not given to staff. Why this deception and why not say "service is left to the customer's discretion"? None of the hotels' management have ever explained this.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jun 6, 2013Dear Guest,  Thank you for kind comments and for your courteous appreciation of both food and service at our Gritti Palace, which I read with great pleasure.  With regard to your request for an explanation of the term “service included”, which we are more than pleased to provide you with, please be informed that the statement “service included” is related to the fact that the published menu prices are the final ones, so no additional charges are due to the establishment upon delivery of the check.  What is completely left to clients’ discretion and obviously not indicated on the menu is the tip. Tipping in Italy is also customary and welcomed by the staff, though as it is up to clients discretion, and  never a recommended percentage. Tipping is not however compulsory, and only reflect the appreciation of the service delivered.  I sincerely hope to have the privilege and the opportunity to welcome you back to The Gritti Palace in a near future.  Best regards,  Paolo LorenzoniRead more
