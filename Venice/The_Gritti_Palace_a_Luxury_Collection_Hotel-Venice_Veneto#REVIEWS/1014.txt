My wife and I stayed for 4 nights to celebrate a special anniversary. The hotel is exquisite from its location to the quality of the rooms and decor. The staff are charming and knowledgeable. A particular highlight was the private cooking class with Chef Franco which produced some of the best food during our stay in Venice. Push the boat out(excuse the pun) and go for a room with balcony and Grand Canal view and savour the experience morning and night. Sublime!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Jun 3, 2015Dear adp130,  Thank you very much for having taken time to express your appreciations related to your recent sojourn with us, not only privately, but also through this site!  It is for us a delight to read that a particular highlight during your stay was your private cooking class with Sous Chef Franco who, despite normally being “behind the scenes” managed to create special moments and allowed you to taste some of the best food of your stay.  Our Venetian culinary journey besides being an enjoyable experience is also a fruitful one, enhancing the knowledge of local products and cuisine, while learning how to create at home the delicacies savored while being with us.   We look forward to welcoming you back to our Epicurean School, for our chef to disclose other “professional secrets” with you!  Best regards,  Paolo Lorenzoni General ManagerRead more
