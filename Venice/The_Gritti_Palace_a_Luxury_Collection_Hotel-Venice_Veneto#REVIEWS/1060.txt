The Gritti has been compleetly refurbished and looks great. The rooms are beautiful and all spaces in the hotel look real old but greatly restored where needed. The guests are a real international mix.  Location is the best. Can not be beaten. Some staff are really very good. The breakfast staff could improve as could the breakfast itself. If the weather is good reserve a table at the Terras. If we can afford we will certainly be back.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecOffice-HtlGritti, General Manager at The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection HotelResponded Mar 27, 2015Dear Guest,  Thank you for your patronage and for having posted your precious comments related to your stay at our Gritti Palace.
