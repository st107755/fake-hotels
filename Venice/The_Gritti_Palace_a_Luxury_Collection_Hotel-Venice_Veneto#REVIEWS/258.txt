First of all, choosing this hotel took a ton of research for me.  There was the Danieli, their sister property also part of SPG's Luxury Collection.  And then we also compared it to the Bauer property.  All I have to say is location, location, location... oh and the views!!!  This hotel is almost directly across the Santa Maria della Salute Church of the best part of the Grand Canal... google it!!!  This is completely opposite of what the Rialto Bridge area offers... it's not a touristy spot, it's much cleaner, less crowded, and classier.  Rialto Bridge was so disappointing to us in comparison to the atmosphere of this side of Venice.  It's a short walk to the Ponte dell'Accademia bridge where we watched the sunset from (google this too).  We stayed in a Landmark Grand Canalâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 20173 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
