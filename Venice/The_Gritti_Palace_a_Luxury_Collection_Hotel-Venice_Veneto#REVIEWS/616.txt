After 6 nights of hard beds and even harder pillows in other hotels around Italy, we finally got a good night sleep at the Gritti Palace. The beds and pillows were heavenly.  We were checked into our room by Carlotta, a native Venetian who speaks 6 languages and was the most gracious of hosts.  She left us a thank you notes when we checked out of the hotel- what a nice personal touch.  We stayed in corner Suite 331.  It didn't have a view of the canal, but that didn't matter- it was still fantastic.  Pros: - Heavenly beds & pillows - Two sinks in the bathroom and each had an electric outlet that would run a hair dryer. Many of the older hotels in Europe only have one outlet and it is only able to run a shaver. - Supreme quiet- couldn't hear a sound except around 8am each morningâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
