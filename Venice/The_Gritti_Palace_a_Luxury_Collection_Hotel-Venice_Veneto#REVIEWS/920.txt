Wow! Just walk to the restaurant/bar and you will know what I mean. Wow!   The views are unbeatable. Directly on the Grand Canal. And the water taxi drops you directly in front of the hotel.  The hotel lobby feels like you are staying a palace museum. But you get to actually sit in the chairs and use the facilities.   Our room was spectacular. Marble bathrooms, antique couches and chairs, Murano glass chandeliers. But with modern air conditioning, super soft king-sided bed, and high-end toiletries (Aqua di Parma).  The staff was fantastic, particularly the front desk and restaurant teams.  The only place I'd stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
