The Gritti is beyond fabulous! The entire experience was perfection. We arrived from the airport in a Riva, which is a luxury wooden runabout boat, arranged for us through the concierge. The theme of this hotel seems to be service. Everything is geared toward making you feel like you are royalty. We opted for the Grand Canal view and boy was it spectacular. The room was gorgeous, the bed exceptional, and the bathroom luxurious. It was a perfect 2 night stay. I highly recommend the Gritti Palace.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
