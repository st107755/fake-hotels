My family spent five fantastic days at the Gritti Palace in December. We were made to feel very welcome by all the staff. Our two Grand Canal rooms were exquisite with excellent views, sumptuous decor, luxurious bathrooms and superb housekeeping (who never stinted on supplies of Acqua di Parma toiletries). The welcome bottle of Prosecco and fresh flowers that were changed regularly really made the difference that set this hotel out as the best in which I have ever stayed. We used the bar every evening, the concierge were very helpful, even coming outside to pick an excellent gondolier for us, and the restaurant, in which we ate three nights, kept us all happy. This is a truly outstanding hotelRead moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
