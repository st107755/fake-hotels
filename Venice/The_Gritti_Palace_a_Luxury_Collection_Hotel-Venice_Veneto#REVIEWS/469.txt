This is not a cheap hotel- just over 800 euros for a standard room. However, it is worth it for the luxurious furnishings and surroundings and the level of service offered. The best thing by a long way, though, is the wide open air terrace where you can have a drink from the bar or have a meal. It overlooks the Grand Canal and is just gorgeous. The "people watching" from there is also fascinating.     The other advantage from the location of the hotel is that it is only 5 minutes walk to Saint Mark's Square.  We really enjoyed our stay in such a great city.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
