Our room was the most beautiful room ever. The ceiling was exposed wood beams in the tradition of buildings in Venice. The decor was luxurious. We had a small balcony overlooking the Grand Canal and every morning we opened the balcony doors at dawn and watched the workers traveling up the Canal. Every evening we stood on the balcony and took in the lights of the beautiful buildings lining the Canal. This was a once in a lifetime experience for us.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
