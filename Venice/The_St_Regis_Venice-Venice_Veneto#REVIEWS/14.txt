Stunning hotel in a stunning location. The view from the bar and the restaurant alone make the hotel worth it. Regrettably, although the hotel has had six months to prepare, the service was still rusty around the edges - not something one would expect in a hotel of this calibre.  The slightly snooty attitude of the staff was also unwelcome - this is now an industry fighting for its survival, and a degree of gratitude that people want to give them their money would not go amiss.Read moreDate of stay: July 20201 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Guest Experience Team, Guest Services / Front Office at The St. Regis VeniceResponded Sep 8, 2020Dear Filou000001, First of all we would like to thank you for having selected The St.Regice Venice for your stay in our amazing city and we are pleased you appreciatred our stunning hotel and location.
