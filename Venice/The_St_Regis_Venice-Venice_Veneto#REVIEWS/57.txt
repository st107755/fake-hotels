We ate and drank here on Saturday and it was delicious and the staff were exceptional .  We enjoyed the sabering of the champagne which they let my son do on the second bottle great fun .  The cocktail seats are right by the canal with the best view in town and the comfiest seats .  The staff are what made this visit very attentive and looked after us very well nothing was too much trouble for them .  We will be back for sureRead moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
