I am bonvoy titanium, get checked into a horrible room which doesnt fit 2 suitaces, after 4 requests i had to move furnitures the table and the chair to fir 2 suitcases. Didnt even have a square foot to move. Horrible house keeping, they never refill shower gel etc. Halfway in the shower u relaize that u have no soap. Pathetic treatment for bonvoy memebers, its been 3 weeks no points got credited and after that i had 4 other bonvoy stays whoxh got credited. The worst the staff is patheric and insulting, after repeated complaints they do an apoligy. Giving 4000 miles, i have a million miles, for gods sake dont insult a titanium member. Honestly they should be kicked out of bonvoy. They dont desrve it. Lastly we were a group in 3 rooms AC didnt work and they gave a fan.
