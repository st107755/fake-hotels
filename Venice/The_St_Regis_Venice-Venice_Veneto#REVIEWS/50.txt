The St. Regis is a newly renovated hotel in Venice located across the Grand Canal from the Salute.  It used to be the Westin Europa and Regina and has been beautifully renovated.  It just opened in September 2019.  I had lunch there during the historical regatta and asked to see what the rooms looked like.  The rooms are very modern with lots of space and some have exposed beams and canal views.  The food was very good; the wine list was too.  The location is great - close to St. Mark’s Square, La Fenice, Harry’s Bar, the Contini Art Gallery, and the best places for shopping.Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
