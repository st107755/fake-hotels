When we arrived, check in was not the usual standing in line at front desk; private area. The glasses of Prosecco was a great touch!!  We stayed 2 nights and loved every minute of it. Our suite was just right and we returned to our room the first night to a bottle of Prosecco, chocolate covered strawberries and a note from our butler. The property is spectacular, right on the Grand Canal where the water taxis pull right up. The restaurant and bar so beautiful. We canâ€™t wait to return.Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
