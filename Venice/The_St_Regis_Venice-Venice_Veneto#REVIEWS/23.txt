I enjoyed a lunch on the terrace here and would say that the views and service were good. I ordered a fried calamari appetiser for 24 Euros and asked for a bit of lettuce on the side and was charged 20 Euros extra.  They also charge 6 Euros/person as a "table charge".  There are plenty of great terraces with similar views and equal quality food. We felt that these charges were a bit much and would recommend guests to go to similar restaurants like the one at Gritti Palace nearby.

We take customer feedback seriously in our constant drive to improve our product and services as it is expected at a St. Regis. In this case, We would like to apologize for not meeting your expectations during your dining experience at our restaurant. We will review your comments careful and take the necessary measurements to ensure that they are addressed.  Kindly note that the cover charge that was applied to your check is a standard found in most if not all venues in Venice and in most cases higher than that. We have chosen to apply the cover charge only during weekends due to the higher demand of our Garden and Terrace seating’s, however this fee is not applied during the weekdays even and we are one of the few who do so.  Regarding the charge for your salad for €20 is not in line with our pricing and therefore apologize for this.   We would like to welcome you back to  dine at The St. Regis Venice in order to have the opportunity to restore your faith in our exquisite service and products that we are worldly renowned for. Should you have the opportunity to do so, please do not hesitate to contact me directly and I will personally arrange your dining requirements.  Thank you.  With warmest regards,  Read more
