Dear Manager, the Hotel structure is very beautiful, but the service is very poor.  I understand the period of time  but the service is very slow and the hotel look without staff and sometime without genuine care.  I`m Chinese and my wife don't speak a good English, and he hotel like this you didn't have any Asian speaking, and when i ask the lady in the lobby if they have she told me  before yes,  but now no more, for my advise you need to have Asian speaking, but overall experience it was ok.
