We were so impressed with the staff and location at the St Regis... beautiful views on the Grand Canal and the newly renovated hotel will not disappoint..the hotel is conveniently located to St Marco square (about a 5 min walk) high end shopping(Louis V, Prada, Gucci) and so many restaurants that even with TA we used the Concierge (Mattia) who graciously helped us decide where to dine and made the reservation for us... we will definitely return one day ❤️Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
