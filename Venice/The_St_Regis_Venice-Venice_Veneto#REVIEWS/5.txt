Spent three nights in this luxury hotel. It has a perfect central location with stunning views. The bedroom was comfortable and the room servicing prompt and efficient. There is a good restaurant and, if the weather permits, you can have table on the Grand Canal waterside. The staff are uniformly excellent and always remember your name; nothing is too much trouble. All of this is reflected in the room price but, if you want a really special stay, the St Regis is perfect.Read moreDate of stay: September 2020HelpfulShare Response from Guest Experience Team, Guest Services / Front Office at The St. Regis VeniceResponded 4 weeks agoDear jeflloyd,  Thank you for all exquisite words you wrote on you review., We are delighted to learn of your satisfaction for your recent stay with us and that you enjoyed our Restaurant overlooking the Gran Canal.
