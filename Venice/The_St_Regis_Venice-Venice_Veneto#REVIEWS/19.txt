Pretty much nothing to say - The St. Regis Venice team has made our stay one of the best we've ever had! The rooms are very well appointed and the marble bathrooms give a truly St. Regis feel. Location wise, it's perfect - The hotel is tucked in a very cute corner just steps away from Piazza San Marco and faces the canal. Last but not least, breakfast was stunning and the best we could ask for. We'll be back soon!Read moreDate of stay: August 2020HelpfulShare
