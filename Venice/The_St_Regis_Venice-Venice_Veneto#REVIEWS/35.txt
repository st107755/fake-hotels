We travel the world a LOT, and we've experienced many hotels and services at global chains and boutique hotels.  We wanted a unique high end experience in Venice, and this hotel delivered.  Big time.  It's a beautiful facility, wonderfully located with amazing views, delicious food, and staff that goes the extra mile to make guests feel special.  With or without high water, this is a place we plan to return to again soon.
