The hotel itself is lovely - staff very nice, standard rooms quite small but luxuriously fitted out.  The lost star is purely for the 20 euro “delivery charge” added to all room service breakfast orders and 25 euro delivery charge for dinner room service orders. I can only imagine the room service department is under the control of the Venetian Mafia as these fees (listed in the most illegible and tiny tiny font) are pure theft.   Note I paid 800 euros per night for my room so I’m not short of money - it’s just the principle.   I will stay here again (once they address the daylight robbery room service charges).   Whoever decided these fees should not work in hospitality.
