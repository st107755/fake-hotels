We stayed here for 3 nights and it was well worth it. Probably my best memory of Venice will be eating breakfast at the hotel. The view is stunning and something I couldnâ€™t get enough off. The rooms are really nice and the hotel staff are incredibly polite and eager to help you.  The location is excellent and the main sites are in easy walking distance.
