The staff was most helpful and efficient with all of our needs and desires from tourism information to helping with business needs.   The hotel is new and elegant in every way.  Small steps to turns hallways on each floor insured privacy.  The restaurant overlooking the canal is a special treat that can only be had in Venice! Finding it can be a bit tricky at first as it is tucked into a courtyard that takes a few turns off the main road to arrive at. Near St. Marks and local transportation, ie the gondolas and near the main boat services.  Highly recommend this hotel.  Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
