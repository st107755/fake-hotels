We had one night in Venice after our cruise. This was the best way to end our trip! We had an outside patio overlooking the Grand Canal and a large Church across the water. There was a bottle of wine and snacks waiting for us when we checked in. We got a free upgrade through Marriott, so we had a 2 room suite. It's a new property that just opened in August. It's absolutely beautiful! Wr decided to order room service for dinner because we weren't going to be able to find a better view. They brought the food on a table, wheeled it out on our patio and had candles lit. We ordered 2 different pastas which were just as good as any restaurant!The hotel also has a very nice breakfast buffet.
