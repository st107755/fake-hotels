Exquisite, ornate and exceptionally beautiful hotel. No matter where you are in the world, the St. Regis guarantees a great stay. This is no exception for the St. Regis Venice, the spaces are beautiful, the room was luxurious with nothing left to chance. The location is undeniably one of the best, the views itself are worth it. It is literally right next to all the luxury boutiques but still tucked away enough that it's quite private and not noisy. The staff are all in a league of their very own. Everyone from the doormen, to the check in staff to the concierges were all warm, welcoming and came across as sincere without trying too hard. It was the little things they did throughout my stay that made everything special. Itâ€™s my home away from home.Read moreDate of stay: September 2020HelpfulShare Response from St Regis Venice, Owner at The St. Regis VeniceResponded Sep 16, 2020Dear L4597OJlaura,  We are delighted to read your fabulous review regarding your recent stay at The St.Regis Venice.
