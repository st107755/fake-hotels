I learn with deep regret that we did not meet your expectations during your stay with us. I would like to sincerly  apologize for the condiscendent feeling you perceived during your arrival  and allow me to reassure you that this has been cascaded to the concern department in order to improve our guest experience.  It seems to me that there was a misunderstanding related to the pressing service as it is available however,  due to the severe procedure we are applying in order to preserve our associates and guests' health, all items are washed prior to be pressed hence would not be possible to return the items immediately, this is the reason why we offered you an iron and ironboard.  Referring to the service charge, I understand your point of view, still it is a common charge applied to all of our guests, both internal and external.  I am delighted read you appreciate the great restauration completed as of last year and the quality of food at Gio's Restaurant. I truly appreciate the time you spent because the feedback from our guests has a great value for us.  Sincerly,  Read more
