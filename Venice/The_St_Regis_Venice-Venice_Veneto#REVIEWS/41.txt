First of all this hotel is so beautiful inside and out and  newly renovated. The rooms are so comfortable and quiet you think you are the only there. The service from the doormen to the concierge, butler and front desk are exceptional. They all speak about 4 + languages. WE were sad to leave after we went to the garden lounge we had a cocktail and a few appetizers. WE had dinner reservations and we felt bad not staying there for dinner it was good. After dinner we went back for a night cap and right across the way we were seranaded by a choir at 10:30 at nite. This was a great way to spend our last nite in Venice. Well done St. Regis Hotel, all the staff we encountered went above and beyond. WE will be back.Read moreDate of stay: October 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from Trek37601622545, Guest Relations Manager at The St. Regis VeniceResponded Nov 8, 2019Dear Bubbs61,  Thank you for having shared your amazing experience at our The St.Regis Venice.
