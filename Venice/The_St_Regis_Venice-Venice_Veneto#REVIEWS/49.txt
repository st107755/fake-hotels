My husband and I just stayed at the newly renovated St. Regis hotel in Venice.  We booked 2 nights with a suite upgrade bonvoy award and were given a Grand Canal View King suite.  My husband is a titanium level member and the breakfast buffet was included with our room. It was amazing!  The room was not ready when we arrived at noon so they let us use another room to shower and rest.  We were able to then take a walk and get lunch and when we returned the room was ready.  I canâ€™t say enough about the exceptional service we received throughout our stay.  We will definitely be back!  Read moreDate of stay: October 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
