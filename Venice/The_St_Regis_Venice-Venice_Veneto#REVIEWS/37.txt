The beauty and refined details of the hotel are only surpassed by it’s staff. We stayed for the weekend, and were concerned about what we would find after the flood. The hotel is beautiful with no evidence of what occurred 21 days ago in Venice. The staff was so attentive. Pep was our welcoming butler, and was very thorough, helpful and welcoming. We used the concierge service for all recommendations and they were spot on. We happened to be there on my husband’s birthday and they went above and beyond. Excellent location for views and sightseeing. Thank you!
