The hotel is a far to the North side of the main island so it takes roughly 30 mins to get to San Marco Square, the path gets pretty dark at night so beware if you travel solo. There is an excellent spot to see the sunrise at the back of the hotel by the pier. Breakfast service is excellent and you get to order an item off the menu. Quite stingy with the elite upgrade though with only one category upgrade when there is plenty of rooms available as it was low season.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare
