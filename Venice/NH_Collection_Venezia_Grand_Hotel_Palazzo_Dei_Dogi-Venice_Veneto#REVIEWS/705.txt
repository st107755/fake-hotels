While visiting this wonderful hotel for the Easter holiday, after several days of walking throughout Venice with aching feet and legs, I had the pleasure of meeting Maria and enjoying a luxurious pedicure.   Maria was wonderful, the spa facilities were great and it was super to be able to relax and be well taken care of, get a nice massage,  pedicure and polish!  I highly recommend The spa and Maria in particular.
