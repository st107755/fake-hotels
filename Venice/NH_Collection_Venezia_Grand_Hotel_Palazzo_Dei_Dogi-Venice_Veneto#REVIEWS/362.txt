The Boscolo is an old building that has been tastefully modernised, the restaurant outside on the terrace can get a little busy at peak times, but inside is still OK. Being outside it is a target for the Pigeons which can get a bit annoying! Food is great, service is attentive without being overpowering. The location of the hotel is perfect, it is 2 bridges away from the bustle and crowds, with loads of restaurants but beware of Rio Tera Farsetti nice food, but RIPPED off on wine. Hotel has free shuttle to St Marks, nice 30 minute walk back (no Hills!) if you want/need exercise. Hotel also booked evening at Opera for us Euro 78 for 2 people front row! Nice garden with sunbeds, really needs a small plunge pool to cool off in. Spa is great and realistically pricedRead moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
