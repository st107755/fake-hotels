My husband and I stayed at Boscolo  in mid Sept. for 4 days. I wish it could have been 4 weeks! It is a beautiful hotel with impeccable service. The beautiful garden and the historic hotel gave a wonderful ambiance to the total experience. The location is excellent and just far enough away from the crowds and the free boat shuttle service made sightseeing easy and enjoyable. If you are going to Venice don't miss an opportunity to stay at this hotel. It is excellent in every aspect.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
