We just visited the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi with another couple.   We were assigned a room in the garden villa - right next to the water.  GREAT VIEW.     There is one major issue.   The bedroom was upstairs and the bathroom was downstairs.  This was a big issue for my wife.   She had to walk downstairs to use the bathroom.   We assumed all the rooms were the same until our friends invited us to their room in the main hotel.   What a difference.   They had ceilings that were at least 20 feet high, beautiful chandeliers, bathrooms attached to the room, etc.     Please make sure you don't end up with the same room we had.    I am really sorry that we weren't provided the same rooms as our friends.     The breakfast was great, the concierge was excellent.   His name is Ivan Roranello.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 11, 2019Dear Josep F, Thank you for your valued feedback.
