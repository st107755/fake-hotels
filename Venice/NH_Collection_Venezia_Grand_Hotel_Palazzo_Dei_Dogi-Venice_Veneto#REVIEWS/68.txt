We booked at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi through Delta vacations and were not disappointed.  Although our flight arrived in the morning, and check-in was not until afternoon, we got into our room after ~1 hour.  The room was on the canal.  The gardens at the hotel are lovely, and the residential neighborhood away from the tourists crowds was great.  All hotel staff were extremely polite, spoke English and were pleasant.  The only reason I didnâ€™t give 5 stars were because the bathroom was a bit cramped with the bidet, and the paint was flaking.  Would return to this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
