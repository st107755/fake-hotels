Nice hotel that is in a quiet location in Venice.  Stayed on a low floor overlooking the front of the hotel.  Room was on the small side.  Hotel was quite pricey and breakfast was not included.  The hotel had a complimentary boat service that took you to and from St. Mark's Square.  Quite a distance to walk to the majority of the tourist sites in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 20, 2017Dear Biatty, thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
