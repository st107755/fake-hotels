We had a wonderful 24 hours in Venice prior to business in Milan. I was able to use hotel points at this beautiful property and couldn't have been happier. The service was excellent, the room and especially the bathroom were beautiful and had plenty of room. Loved it! Also loved that it was off the beaten tourist path.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
