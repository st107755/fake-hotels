Outstanding hotel, just outside of the mass crowds.  Beautiful buildings, and gardens...feels like a mansion.  Staff excellent...Rewards status acknowledged....room upgrade, and excellent breakfast.  We took a public water taxi, from in front of the main train station...number 4.5 taxi...to Madonna Dell'Orto stop...3 minutes walk from there.  Or, if you know the way, you can walk from the main train station, in about 20 minutes.....Lovely lobby, beautiful room, great staff, and good value.  You can walk to all the key locations...Very enjoyable stay....highly recommend...Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2017Dear John B, thank you so much for taking the time to write such a glowing review!
