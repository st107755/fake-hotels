Loved my stay here!  The place is quite unique and has a beautiful garden. Checkin was smooth, room with a view was fantastic and they had taxis to and from S. Marco every few hours so I saved a ton of money on water taxis. They also have a taxi to Murano to a great gallery and you can take a boat back to the hotel or the gallery will taxi you back to wherever you would like to go. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again if I returned to Venice.
