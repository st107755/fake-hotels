Wonderful hotel experience. Easy walking distance to all sights, lovely gardens in the back of the hotel, on the water (on both sides) as well as a private dock for water taxi.  Perfectly appointed room with great bathroom. Away from the crowds/noise but only takes 10 minutes to be there on foot which was exactly what we wanted. Staff was friendly, accommodating and helpful.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
