We enjoyed our stay at the Boscolo Venezia so much that if we are lucky enough to return to Venice, we will stay there again. Off the beaten path and away from the crowds, but still within easy walk to anywhere you want to go. The history of the building (monastery, embassies of France and Savoy) lend a magical feel to the property. The gardens are an unexpected treat (only hotel with a private garden), leading to the lagoon. Very nice. Breakfast each morning on the terrace was delightful with a great buffet as well as an extensive menu. We ended every day at the bar enjoying good conversation with Edo the bartender. Must also add the front desk staff and concierge were excellent. Really great trip.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear Marcy B, Thank you for you kind feedback.
