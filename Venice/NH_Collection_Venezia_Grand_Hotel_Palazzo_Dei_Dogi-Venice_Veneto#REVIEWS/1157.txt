This is a beautiful hotel in a quiet, unspoilt area of Venice. We had a room with a lagoon view, that was accessed through the lovely gardens. The room was spacious and well equipped. The beds were so comfy and the linen cool and spotless. The bathroom was perfectly furnished and, again, spotlessly clean. The breakfast options catered for every taste, good choices and plenty of fresh, hot coffee. Nothing was too much trouble for the waitress. We had dinner here on our first evening, and the waiter helped us with our menu choices, which turned out to be just right. The hotel is some distance from St Marks area, but if you are able to walk, take your time and enjoy all the lovely sights and atmosphere on the way. It is well worth it. Fully recommend this hotel and would stay hereâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
