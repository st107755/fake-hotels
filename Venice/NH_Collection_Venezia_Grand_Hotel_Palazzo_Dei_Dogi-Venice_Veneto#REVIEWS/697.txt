The hotel is very cozy and beautiful although you need to take a ferry (which is free) to get to San Marco. The staff are very friendly. The amenities in the room are great, the room is spacious and comfortable although everything seems a little old but charming.  The only incident we had during our short stay (we were there for 1 night) was that we ordered hot water for tea and the water tasted salty. We called reception and were told we would get more water (the problem was the hot water machine).. but again it tasted salty.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
