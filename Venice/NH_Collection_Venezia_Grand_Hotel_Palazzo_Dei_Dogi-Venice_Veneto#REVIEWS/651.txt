This hotel is in a quiet location, but in walking distance of all of Venice.  I was there for four nights and  stayed in one of the rooms in the garden away from the main building.  This location was peaceful and serene with the roses in the garden n full bloom and the room had a terrace with table and chairs.  Room was large as was the bathroom.  Service was excellent and efficient.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 19, 2016Dear Mr. Keith,  It is our pleasure to read such a positive comment as it was hosting you at our Hotel.
