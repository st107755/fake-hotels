This is the way to experience Venice.   This hotel is in a quiet neighborhood which I welcomed.   A short walk to many restaurants where the locals eat and hang out.   There are a couple of vaporetta stops nearby to take you to the hustle and bustle of Venice.   So location wise, it was great.  As a platinum I was upgraded to a canal room, the rooms are small in italy so that was no surprise.   There is a lack of drawer spaced (3 teeny tiny drawers in the closet).  There was only one outlet (which they recommend you plug the mosquito repellent into).  We had lots of things we needed outlets for, so we just kept out windows closed, never had mosquito, but really could have used way more outlets. Breakfast was in the beautiful garden.   One dish off the hot menu and the buffet.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
