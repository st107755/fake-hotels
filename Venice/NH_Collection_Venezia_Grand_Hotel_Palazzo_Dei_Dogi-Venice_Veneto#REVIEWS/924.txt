Great location, away from tourist traffic, real deal. Hotel is very nice, surrounded by canals and great proprietrary garden. Staff is nice, more than available and helpful. I have been there with Marriot Reward, the room was not the greatest in the world but the ameneties are fantastc. I would have been disappointed if I should have paid for that Deluxe room, considering it is a 5 stars hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare
