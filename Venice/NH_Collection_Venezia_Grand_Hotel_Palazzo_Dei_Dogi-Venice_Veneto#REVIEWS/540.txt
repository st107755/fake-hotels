We stayed for 3 nights at the Boscolo Venezia. Easy to get to from the airport and very close to the public transport stop. From the moment we arrived we knew we had chosen well. The hotel staff we all very pleasant and helpful and above all, seemed genuinely pleased to be of service. Upon check in, we we advised that we had been upgraded at no cost, which was a fantastic surprise, and this included breakfast, which we had not booked. The hotel was very clean with a beautiful outside garden leading to the water. It is located in a lovely quiet area which was good but also within easy reach of all the attractions. This was our second time in Venice and if we were to return again ( I hope so) we would not hesitate to stay at the Boscolo Venezia.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 29, 2016Dear Tracey,  We are grateful to read that we did live up to your expectations, and this is the best reward we could get for our efforts.
