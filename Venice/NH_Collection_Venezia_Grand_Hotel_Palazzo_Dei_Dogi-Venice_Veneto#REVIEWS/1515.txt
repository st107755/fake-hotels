I cannot fault this hotel. Easy reach from airport.Take the 'orange line'  from the airport ...its the 1st stop called  (Madonna del) ORTO  cost is 16 euros per person + 1 euro per bag ...takes aprox 30 min and leaves once an  hour 9 am till 11.30 pm ish You can also get a bi=us from airport ...about 6 euros to Piazzale Roma, and then catch a vaporetto to Madonna Del Orta. but you dont save any money really and it takes quite a bit longer ! its approx 5/10 mins walk to hotel from the vaporetto. The hotel ...what an entrance hall....Our room was huge , we went with Airmiles and had a free Deluxe room upgrade. Didnt eat in hotel , but breakfasts were fine.Hotel staff were all great , couldnt do enough for us ! Approx 30 min walk to St Mark's square ...but no problem as such anâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 20101 SaveHelpfulShare
