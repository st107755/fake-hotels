This was our first trip to Venice.  We wanted to go with a known commodity so we chose this Marriott Autograph collection hotel.  It was better than expected.  Staff was very attentive and helpful.  I was worried about it being a good distance from St. Mark's Square, but that ended up being one of the good points. We were able to experience a totally different part of the city with a very different feel.  The hotel's complementary private boat that shuttles guests to the Square was very convenient. It was a great experience.  We would stay there again without question.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
