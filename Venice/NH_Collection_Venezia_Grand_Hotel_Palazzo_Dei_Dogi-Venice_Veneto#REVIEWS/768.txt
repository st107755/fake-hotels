The hotel is out of the way, but easy to get to from the train and accesible to all of the main sites.  As others have commented, it is a quite hotel in a quiet location , which is great for couples , but not sure kids would enjoy the location . Our room was very spacious and quiet with updated bathrooms. Staff was helpful and attentive.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
