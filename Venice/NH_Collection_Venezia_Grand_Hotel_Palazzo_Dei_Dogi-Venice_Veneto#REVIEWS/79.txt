Our family really enjoyed the hotel. The location is perfect, away from the noisy center that on a previous visit to Venice, I knew I'd want to avoid in the future. We arranged for 2 water taxis from airport which made our arrival easy and added to the atmosphere. The staff was very patient with our group and provided assistance in planning activities and dinner reservations. Breakfast buffet offered a large variety of fresh fruit, pastries and hot dishes. Restaurants and bars are a short walk away. There is an amazing gelato shop nearby. I would definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 12, 2019Dear freebird99, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
