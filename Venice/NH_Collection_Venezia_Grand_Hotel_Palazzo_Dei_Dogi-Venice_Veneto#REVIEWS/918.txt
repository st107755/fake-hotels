stayed two nights without little one (yes a romantic stay)  The good: - location: one stop to the airport, shuttle taxi to the St Marco or vaporetto close by it is a fair distant to St Marco, but nice walk - Away from the tourist area - nice restaurants near the hotel, with locals - nice to stay in a palace - nice shower,  - comfy bed - view on the canal - friendly staff - shampoo and shower gel made in italy.  The not so good: - a little bit tired.

We strive to offer service of the highest quality to our guests. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. Our staff is here for you at any time. I am happy to hear we were to your service and that you felt welcomed and taken care of.  The building that hosts Boscolo Venezia was a wonderful residence built by Patarols family in the seventeenth century. During the years the palace hosted first a monastery and  then the  Embassy of France and Savoy. It is a very historical building. As such, each of our rooms has different size and layout.  I hope to welcome you back at Boscolo Venezia, should you travels take you back to Venice in the near future.  Barbara Ghea Front Office ManagerRead more
