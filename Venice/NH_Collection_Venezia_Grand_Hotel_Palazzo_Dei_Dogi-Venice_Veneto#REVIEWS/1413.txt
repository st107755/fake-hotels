I returned from a very hot stay in Venice at the Boscolo (Marriott) Autograph Collection.  I had a very nice time, especially since I was staying on Marriott points, but the hotel is not worth the 500 euros a night they were charging as of the time of my trip.  Pros The hotel itself is a beautiful former palace for diplomats (see somewhat blurred lobby photo) The front desk staff is wonderful, very friendly and helpful - I cannot say enough about them The gardens behind the hotel are some of the largest in Venice and adjoin the medieval church of Santa Maria della Madonna You'll either have a lagoon view (I imagine far preferable) or a small canal view Wifi worked fine Breakfast (35euros) would've been entirely free every day of my stay had I woken up before ten but I didn't.  â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
