The rooms definitely give you an old world feel with their size and decor with modern amenities with respect to the bathroom, tv, etc...the walk to my room through a quaint garden area was serene.  They have a water taxi that will take you to the main area of venice on a schedule which was nice.  The only thing was trying to find the hotel after getting off the water taxi from the train station was a struggle since it wasn't easy to find and pulling luggage on the cobblestone.
