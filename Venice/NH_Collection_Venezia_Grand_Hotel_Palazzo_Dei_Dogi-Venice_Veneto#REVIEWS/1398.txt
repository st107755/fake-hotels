Being born and raised in Venice Italy I was so excited to bring my husband there for the first time ever. The property was absolutely stunning back in the day the king of France used to stay there when he went to visit Italy. it is probably one of the few places in Venice that has a private park. the room was $350 for something the size of my kitchen.air conditioning could not  be turned on and it was full of mosquitoes because we left the windows open because it was so hot I believe check-in took us 45 minutes they were actually somewhat rude even though I speak the language fluent and I expected a lot more from this beautiful property. overall I would never ever go backRead moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
