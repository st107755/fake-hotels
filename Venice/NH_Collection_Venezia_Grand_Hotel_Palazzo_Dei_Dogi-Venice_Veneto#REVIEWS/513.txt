We should have heeded the warnings from others. As a platinum member redeeming lots of points here i would have expected better than the very basic room which, while had views over the water, internally looked very dated with damp patches on the wall and faded decor. Not the sort of elegantly glamorous aged decor that might go with such an old building, it just looked like it hadnt been renovated since the 70's.  The positivies  - the main lobby is beautiful and the boat ride takes you right to the heart of the venice (right in front of st marks square).  - Breakfast was also included with the points which was not the case on the Marriott resort island - Its in a great area which otherwise we would not have explored - its is more quite and feels more local.

Our goal is to make the stay of our guest as enjoyable as they would like it to be and we are always committed to meet and exceed guest expectations.   I am really sorry that the room assigned to you did not meet your expectations. I was very frustrated in reading your comments, because, beside the score is scarse, the considerations are positive: our majestic lobby, the residential location, breakfast wit an extensive variety of delicious choice, our shuttle transportation to Saint Mark's Square.  Anyway, I would have loved to be informed during your stay and before your departure time, in order to improve your experience and solve some of the issue you highlighted in your comment, such as the room design or the room furniture.  I hope we would have the chance to welcome you back and provide an excellent hotel experience.  Best Regards, Chiara Zambianchi Vice Director Read more
