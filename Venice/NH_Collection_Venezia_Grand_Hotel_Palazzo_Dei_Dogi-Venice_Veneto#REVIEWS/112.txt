We loved our stay at this hotel, which is far away from the hordes of touristas who mob central Venice.  Our room was delightful, although we were disappointed to find two twin beds joined together to form a “queen” size mattress when we surveyed it.  The bathroom was spacious, well-appointed, and stocked with premium “product” (as the hairdressers say).  The garden behind the hotel couldn’t be nicer, if it weren’t for the everpresent - and bold - native pigeons who WILL help themselves to your food if you leave your table unattended.  Which brings me to the excellent (but expensive at €28!) breakfast.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
