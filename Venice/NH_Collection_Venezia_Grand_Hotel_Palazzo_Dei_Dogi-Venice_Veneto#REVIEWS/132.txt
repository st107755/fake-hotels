I would not stay here until renovations are finished...probably will take months. Noisy construction with workers smoking and talking outside your room was unacceptable. Front desk will give you a HARD time if you want to switch to a quiet room..they made my wife cry. Outdoor patio and spa are still being worked on. Dinner restaurant the food was all salty - local restaurants we're much better.  Only good things were the free private boat to Murano glass factory, the tasty breakfast, and the great location in a not touristy area.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 24, 2019Dear TIMMC2018, thank you for choosing Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
