This was our first visit to Venice.  The Boscolo Venezia is located in a quiet area in Cannareggio, close to the Jewish Ghetto.  Close to the alilaguna. And veporetto stop at Orto!  Venice is a walkable city, and all the main sites are reachable well within the hour.  We were given a room at the end of the garden, overlooking towards Murano and the Airport - not convinced this was the nicest room, but clean and comfortable.  Nice breakfast buffet.  Friendly concierge staff.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 12, 2017Dear Tony E, Thank you for your kind feedback.
