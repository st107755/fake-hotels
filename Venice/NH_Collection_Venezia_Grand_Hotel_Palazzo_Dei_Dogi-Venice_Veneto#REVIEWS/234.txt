The hotel is magnificent .  Philip at the front desk was the first person we met and he was our go to for any questions we had.  He helped us with every question and his recommendations were excellent. The breakfast buffet was excellent with wonderful selections in every category.   Our room was spacious with plenty of space to unpack and store our clothes.  the bedding was luxurious and very comfortable.  TV was available and even had some english speaking channels. The hotel location was the best.  We loved walking to and from the hustle and bustle of the city (about 25 minutes to ST. Mark's) to return to the quiet quaint streets of our hotel.  There was a free shuttle that ran from St. Mark's to the hotel door.  Very close by were restaurants if you did not want to go farâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 29, 2018Dear Chris R, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
