My "inexpensive" $345 (US) room had modest area and no view to speak of. Best included breakfast I've ever experienced. Bathroom was cramped, as is common in older European (inexpensive) rooms. Large quantity of "extras".  Especially the water taxi service is of value. Beautiful garden behind hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 6, 2017Dear frank2176, We are very pleased that you enjoyed your recent stay with us.
