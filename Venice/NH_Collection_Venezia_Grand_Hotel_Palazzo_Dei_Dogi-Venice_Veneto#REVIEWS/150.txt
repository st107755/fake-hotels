My husband booked a room 'with a view'. However, when we arrived, the view ended up being an alley with trash.  The room was much smaller than it appeared on the website, but it was fine for just one night.  I gave this property 5 stars because it is beautiful, the staff were very gracious and accommodating, and we loved the location which allowed us to explore parts of Venice we had not seen before.Read moreDate of stay: August 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Agent at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 7, 2019Dear Renee F,  thank you for taking the time to share with us your impressions over your last stay in our Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
