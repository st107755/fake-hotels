The hotel had an amazing garden. You could get lost back there for hours. Surrounded on both sides by water the views are spectacular. The room was very well appointed with giant towels even by American standards. The staff was very helpful arranging transfers and guiding us to nice restaurants. The only negative was the bar service was slow. It took a lot of effort to track down the bartender and order and pay. This happened on numerous occasions. The rest of the service was impeccable.
