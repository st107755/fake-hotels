This is a magnificent hotel. We were given a good size room with a small but georgeous bathroom. It is quiet and out of the busy tourist parts but a short walk from it all. In just about half hour walking and looking at the goods in the plenty of stores you will get to San Marcos plaza. We were given directions by the very friendly staff and enjoyed our walks all over the place. Too bad that the air conditioning was well bellow par. We asked for it to be cheked but did not expect for it to be fixed. The comments I had read in Tripadvisor as to the problems with the A/C were indeed correct. While very attentive, the staff did not offer to change us to another room and instead offerered to bring a fan to the room to which I agreed because we were staying only overnight beforeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
