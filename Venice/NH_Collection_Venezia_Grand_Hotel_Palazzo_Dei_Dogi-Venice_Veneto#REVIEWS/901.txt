My wife and I loved everything about this hotel.  we liked the location that was close to a ferry stop and removed from some of the busier streets.  It was always quiet along the streets.  The room was nicely appointed and traditional in style as was the hotel  and the breakfast was terrific.  When we would return from a very full day of roaming around Venice we found this to be a veery warm secure place that we could feel at home.  There was a staff person on the desk named Gaia that was very helpful with good local tips.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
