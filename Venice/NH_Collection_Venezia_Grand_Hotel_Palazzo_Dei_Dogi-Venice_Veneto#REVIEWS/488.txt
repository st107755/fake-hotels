This hotel is on the island of Venice but away from the centre so it is peaceful and quiet. However, easy to walk to all of the top sites. We went during the amazing Venice Carnival and it was just wonderful. It also has a lovely garden which is rare in Venice. The rooms vary in size enormously - ours was quite small but very comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 13, 2017Dear Jennifer H, Thank you for your kind feedback.
