Venice, our favorite city in Italy, especially AFTER the cruise ships leave in the afternoon/early evenings was better by staying at the Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel: Boscolo Venice, on one of the side streets/canals of the city.  The room, on the second floor overlooking a small garden, was small but adequate. The lobby was beautiful filled with Murano Glass.  This is not an inexpensive hotel so breakfast was NOT included and was a special price of $25 per person (vs $35 normally).  They did provide limited free transportation to St. Mark’s Square.  Up to the point where we stayed at La Mongolfiera in Rome, this was our favorite hotel of the Italian vacation.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office department at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 10, 2016Dear Mr. Wlifeman,  Thank you very much for your kind feedback.
