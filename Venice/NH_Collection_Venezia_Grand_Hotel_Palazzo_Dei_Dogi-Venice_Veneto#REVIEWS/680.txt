I had a sports massage at the Wellness Spa in this hotel to alleviate a sports injury I aggravated in the gym. I'm 6'4" and 95 kg and lift weights on a regular basis, so I needed someone who is strong. When Maria turned up, I was a bit taken aback as she's only about 5'6". But I didn't need to worry. She gave me an absolutely fantastic massage and paid particular attention to all the problem areas I pointed out. And she was strong enough to really get into the knots, etc. I left feeling a thousand times better and I will definitely recommend her for anyone who needs a proper sports massage.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Vice Director at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 7, 2016Dear Mr Knobel, thank you for your valued feedback.
