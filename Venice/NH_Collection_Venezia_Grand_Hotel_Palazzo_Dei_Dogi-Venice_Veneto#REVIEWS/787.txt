This is a lovely hotel which is stylish and comfortable at the same time  The building is amazing, the lobby is a real feature especially if you arrive by water taxi, step inside and wow, what a building   The rooms are well equipped with all you need, TV, wifi etc but are also very comfortable. It's a city hotel so the bathrooms are always small but this one was tiny and the shower could have been better  Apart from a curt and disinterested receptionist who really didn't want to help us , the staff were excellent, friendly, attentive and efficient  We didn't eat there apart from breakfast which was excellent   Overall I'd rate this hotel highly but be prepared for a walk to and from the main areas of townRead moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
