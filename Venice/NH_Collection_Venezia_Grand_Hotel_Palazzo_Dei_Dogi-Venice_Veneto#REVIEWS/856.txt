We stayed @ The Boscolo hotel in Venice & it was absolutely wonderful!  The hotel has a hidden garden as they like to call it & it was beautiful!!  In a town over run by cement, water & tourist it was so peaceful to come back to our little bit of Eden!! So much so that two nights my husband & I picked up salami, cheese, bread, & a bottle of wine & ate outside our room. We had a deluxe room & we got to walk through the garden each time we went to our room & had a table & chairs outside on our little patio!! It was an awesome  & romantic hotel for our 29th anniversary tripRead moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
