Me and my wife have been traveling for 15 days thru Spain and Italy and we have stayed in all the hotels that have ties with Marriott due to our elite status but this particular hotel in Venice has been the worst experience we have had when we checked in we had a young gentleman very attentive but his inglish was very hard to understand our first room was so small there was barely room to walk out of the bed wen I went to take a shower the shower fell and hit my head well the changed our room after we had unpacked the other room did not have a shower that's something I usually won't check.they did not honor the rate I had on my reservation thru Marriott and also they did not honor the Spa discount that was in my room there was no way to reason with this people I WILL NEVER STAYâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare
