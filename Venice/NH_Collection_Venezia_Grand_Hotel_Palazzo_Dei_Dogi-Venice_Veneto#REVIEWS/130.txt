At the first moment the hotel looks good at the reception. Later when you go to your room you see how bad it really is. Dirty and worn out curtains (pic attached) not washed for years full of dirt and dust. Towels (pic attached) absolutely below any expected level, totally worn out. Very limited breakfast with NO fresh vegetables! The same stuff every day. Dont mention omlet at breakfast you might get it after 30 min 0 r...never. Terrible, lazy staff that does not collect used plates and glasses until you really finish (pic attached). If you plan to eat anything (which I do NOT recommend) order it at least one day earlier. Basically a shame for Marriott to include such miserable hotel in their offer. Better stay away!Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 27, 2019Dear Jaroslaw S, Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback.

Our goal is allowing all our valued guests to experience a memorable stay in our historical palace and bring home wonderful memories of their time in our magical city on water.  We are truly sorry to read that you did not enjoy the breakfast you had during your stay, in particular since no team member has been notified about that during your sojourn and could therefore not show you any empathy and good will that we are accustomed to in order to try to solve the unpleasant situation.
