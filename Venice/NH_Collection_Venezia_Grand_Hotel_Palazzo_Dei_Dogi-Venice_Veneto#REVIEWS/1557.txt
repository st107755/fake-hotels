There's nothing wrong with this hotel that retraining or firing all the staff (starting with the manager) couldn't cure. These people have no clue about customer service, and couldn't care less. Among many other things, the lift was out for the entire 5 days we were there, and no one apologized or seemed to care. This may be endemic to Venice in general, after centuries of tourism; I don't know. But it's a real shame when you have such a beautiful hotel in an interesting neighborhood, offering what they pass off as service, unacceptable in a Motel 6.
