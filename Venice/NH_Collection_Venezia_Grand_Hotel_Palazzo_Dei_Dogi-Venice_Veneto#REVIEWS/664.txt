This Is a very quaint hotel off the beaten path in Venice.  The room was excellent, bathroom was very nice, and the hotel staff spoke very good English and were extremely helpful in assisting us in planning our day in Venice, with maps and shuttles to where we wanted to visit. Make sure you check out the gardens in the back of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 26, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for having chosen Boscolo Venezia for your stay in Venice and, what is more, for your kind review.
