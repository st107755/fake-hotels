We stayed here for two nights. Getting from the train station to the hotel was a nightmare!  Walked with our bags for a mile and got lost. It is frustrating that better correspondence isn't made in advance about how to get to the hotel. Once we finally arrived it was beautiful and very nice. Free boat to Murano was nice!  $140 Euro to get a boat to the airport. Well worth it even though it was expensive!Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
