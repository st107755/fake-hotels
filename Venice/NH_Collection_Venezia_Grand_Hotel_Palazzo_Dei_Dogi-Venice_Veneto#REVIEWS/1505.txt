We loved the location in a quiet part of town, with good local bars/restaurants. The local vaporetto stop (Madonna Dell Otto) also had a convenient and cool water bus direct to/from the airport (Arancia line â‚¬13 each way) The hotel itself looks good but our standard room was smaller than expected, air con was inadequate (so had disturbed sleep in the heat) and service OK but nothing special. More of a 3.5 star than a luxury hotel as claimed. Oh , and drinks prices were very high so go local .Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
