I have just spent a week away in Venice with my wife and we were delighted with the Boscolo. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The restaurant food and breakfast were exquisite - and the bar was good for an evening cocktail or glass of wine before heading out to see the area by night. We also spend a few hours in the spa and although we didn't take advantage of the treatments on offer we enjoyed the steam room, sauna and jacuzzi. You can't fail to love this hotel - the decor, atmosphere, garden, space, rooms...very good indeed. And although it has a complimentary river boat service to San Marco we found it relatively easy to walk to most areas...well...just a few detours along the way but that is part of the joy of VeniceRead moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 17, 2018Dear Mr. Tom B, Thank you for your feedback.
