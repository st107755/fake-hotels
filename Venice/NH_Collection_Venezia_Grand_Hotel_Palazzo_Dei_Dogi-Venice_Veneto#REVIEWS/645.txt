Lovely hotel with a charming and friendly staff! We were upgraded to a beautiful suite and they went out of their way to accommodate any request. The complimentary boat ride to San Marco is a treat. I would rate our dinner three and a half stars, although it's not for lack of effort on their part. The outdoor garden setting is very nice but both the service and the food was a bit clunky and uneven for the price. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. It's away from the "action" so keep that in mind depending on your preferences.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 14, 2016Dear Caryn R, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
