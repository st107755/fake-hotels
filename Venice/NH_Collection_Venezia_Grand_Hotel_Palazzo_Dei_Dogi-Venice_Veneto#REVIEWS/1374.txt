At first we were a little concerned about the location since it was away from major destination areas of Venice, but this proved to be the most appealing part of our stay.  At the end of the day, we could relax away from the madness of the crowds and nearby are nice restaurants and cafes.  The hotel itself is beautiful with old world charm.  If I had to take issue with anything it is the costs within the hotel.  I understand that Venice is quite expensive, but to charge 35 Euro per person for breakfast and 15 Euro for a cocktail is a bit excessive even by Venice standards.  You'd think the hotel would want people to use the bar.  But the hotel is beautiful and we would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
