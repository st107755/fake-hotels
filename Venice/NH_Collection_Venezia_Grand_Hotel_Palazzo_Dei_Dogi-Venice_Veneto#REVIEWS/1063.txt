This hotel is a little overpriced, however, the customer service is great and the hotel is clean. I did enjoy the complimentary spa usage and I had the best massage:) this would be a great place to have a wedding, as the grounds are beautiful. I did enjoy the complimentary boat ride that took us to the Island of Murano. Take the Murano Glass factory tour and spend some time walking around the peaceful island of Murano. Also, the hotel is a little far from St. Marks Square but again there are complimentary boat rides that run every hour or so. We actually liked staying off the beaten path and  taking in Venice's culture from a locals standpoint.  The shopping, food and park (for our son to play) was just a few minutes walk from the hotel. We would stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
