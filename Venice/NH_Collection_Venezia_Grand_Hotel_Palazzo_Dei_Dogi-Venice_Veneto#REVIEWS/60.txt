This hotel is truly a palace, with a setting in a quiet area close to all the sites but far enough away to enjoy the ambience of the city, and is elegant without being overdone. Close to a vaporetto stop, it has lovely gardens, kind and attentive staff, and a great breakfast. For those who like beauty without the bustle, this is a perfect setting. I would definitely return.
