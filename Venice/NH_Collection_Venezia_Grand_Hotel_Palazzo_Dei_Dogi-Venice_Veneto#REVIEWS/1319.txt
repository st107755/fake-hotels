My wife and I spent our 5th anniversary here. The hotel service was phenomenal and the staff was very friendly, funny and helpful in finding restaurants and other events for us. This was a place very close to the train station and within walking distance of the market. Nice a cozy place, quiet. Beautiful in the morning. The hotel had a shuttle to take us to Murano which was very cool. Stay here, they'll treat you well!Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
