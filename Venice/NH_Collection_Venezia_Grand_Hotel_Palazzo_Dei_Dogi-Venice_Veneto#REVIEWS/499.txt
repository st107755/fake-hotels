This is an 'Old World' style hotel. Classic Italian rooms, gilded mirrors, heavy brocade fabric, and marbled bathrooms. The garden is a real surprise and worth meandering through. The hotel manager was fantastic and went out of her way to assist us more then once with questions. We found this location to be quiet and a very pleasant walk to the more crowded areas of the city. One point of advice-if you arrive with lots of luggage (or heavy baggage) take a private water taxi-worth the expense especially for the pics.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 13, 2017Dear Waveblanca, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
