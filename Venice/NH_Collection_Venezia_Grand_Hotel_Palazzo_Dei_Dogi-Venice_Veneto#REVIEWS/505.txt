The Boscolo is a beautiful building with a gorgeous little garden.  It is out of the main tourist area of Venice, however the hotel provides a free water taxi service to the Piazza San Marco.  The water taxi operators were great and acted like tour guides, always going in a different direction so that we could see different parts of the city.  The staff were fantastic.  The best thing to do is just get out and start walking...So much to see and such a beautiful city.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 19, 2017Dear Owen H, The whole staff of Boscolo Venezia thanks you for your wonderful review and for choosing us.
