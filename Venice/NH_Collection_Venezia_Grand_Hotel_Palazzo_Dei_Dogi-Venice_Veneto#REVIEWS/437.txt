A true five star hotel in the Canareggio district, away from the crowds near San Marco.

There are many excellent restaurants within walking distance.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 26, 2017Dear travelbugmom2010, it is such a pleasure to read your fantastic review us Boscolo Venezia!
