I have stayed 5 times at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi. Present front desk staff is best ever - specifically Andrea Sampietro, front desk Manager, and Phillipe Clark and Fabio. Could not have been more cordial (remembering me from last year!!) and helpful in other trip reservations. Other staff - Fabrizio, overall service, Mattia (bar manager). Upgraded me to panoramic view room overlooking canal. Lovely! Location in Cannaregio is very convenient for seeing all of Venice.  Can't wait to visit next year.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 21, 2020Dear 123lacey,  First and foremost thank you for your loyalty towards Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
