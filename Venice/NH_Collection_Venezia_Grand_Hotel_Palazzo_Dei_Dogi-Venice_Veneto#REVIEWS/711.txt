This was my fourth stay at the Boscolo Venezia and as in the past I was very impressed.  From the moment we walked in the front door, Claudio at the front desk treated us like royalty (I am a Marriott Platinum member and the staff at the Boscolo Venezia really appreciate it).  He made a special effort to introduce us to the Hotel Manager Martina, who could not do enough for us.  Mohamed showed us to our room (he also remembered us from previous stays and couldn't do enough to assist us) and brought our luggage up.  The staff at the restaurant for Breakfast was outstanding as was the food.  I always feel like I'm leaving family when we have to leave the Boscolo Venezia.  Thank you, Grazie Mille Martina and all of your staff.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 13, 2016Thank you for your kind feedback.
