The staff was amazing! Romano, Edo, Ivan, Pablo & Romina made our stay fun and worry free. They all did a great job in making us feel comfortable and took care of us every step of the way. Relax and enjoy the extras such as the trips to Murono and Burano. Ivan, the concierge had great tips for us and even gave us contacts to talk to at each location. Like almost all the buildings in Venice, this one is very old, but overflowing with beautiful decor. A quiet garden terrace for breakfast and dinner, along with a beautiful walk-through garden and access to a small canal all the way through to the waterfront.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 22, 2016We are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia!
