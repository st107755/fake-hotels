Staying on the island made it easy to get around. It is in a more residential neighborhood but is easily accessible by water taxi. They have excellent services like the water taxi to San Marcos or the the Murano Glass Factory. The breakfast was great and the staff make me feel very welcome. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Mike G, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
