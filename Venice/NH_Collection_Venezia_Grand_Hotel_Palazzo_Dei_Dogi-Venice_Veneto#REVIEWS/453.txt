This is a really nice hotel but not up to the best in the Marriott collection.  I was not recognized as a platinum premier member until I brought it up, so although I checked in online before arrival, my original room was sub-standard.  They changed my room but that should not have been needed.  The staff, however, was excellent, very helpful throughout our visit.  The hotel is well situated, away from the hubbub of St Mark's Square in a very nice part of Venice.  A free water shuttle gets you to St Mark's without a problem.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 23, 2017Dear Mr bmcgold, thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
