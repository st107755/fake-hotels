This is a beautiful property off the beaten path.  We initially selected it to use Marriott points and were concerned about being far from the main San Marco area; but after spending 5 minutes in the San Marco mob scene we were thrilled to return each day to the charming and serene Cannargio neighborhood.  The hotel lobby and garden areas were as advertised, very beautiful and relaxing.  The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The room was fine, comfortable, excellent bath facilities and no problem at all with A/C.  The negatives (as we had read on Tripadvisor) included slow unreliable Internet service, and very expensive food / drinks.  But the overall charm and friendliness far outweighed the little issues and made for a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
