Stayed here for the second part of a stay in Venice after enjoying the Gritti palace. To be very honest I have to say that the Dei Dogi impressed me more:  Good stuff: - great a la carte breakfast choices beautifully curated and served in their garden - picnic option on their garden or on their pier looking over the islands - room we had had 6-7 meter high ceilings - lobby is gorgeous and feels palatial - neighborhood is very authentic and has great restaurants (eg Mori) and vine bars (Vino Vero).  - staff is very nice and proactive (shoutouts to Fabricio and Fabio)  Things to improve: - small bathroom - no gym - no espresso machine in the room (had the same issue with the Gritti...)  My hotel of choice in Venice! Read moreDate of stay: August 20203 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
