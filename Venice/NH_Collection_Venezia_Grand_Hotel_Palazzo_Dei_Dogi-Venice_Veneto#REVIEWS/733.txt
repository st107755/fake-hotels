This Hotel is in a quiet neighborhood that will require some walking or water taxis. We loved the location and the majority of the service was thoughtful. The breakfast was  consistently very good with plenty of options. We enjoyed omelets, pancakes, and eggs. We are Marriott platinum members using points and requested a higher room adjoining to our children room. Neither request was granted. As a platinum member we were given a couple of free breakfast each day. Our room was small, yet very nice and quiet. Our children was placed at the end of the same hall in a small room. Their room had issues with Hot water, our hot water was excellent. All in all the staff was nice, the hotel is gorgeous, and we would stay again. Just would be nice if they truly valued the platinum members…Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 24, 2016Dear client,  Thank you very much for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and for your kind review.
