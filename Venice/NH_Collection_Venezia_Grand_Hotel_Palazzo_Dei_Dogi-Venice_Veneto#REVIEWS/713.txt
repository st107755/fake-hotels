As always, Venice is better in the off-season.  We had a lovely three-day stay here.  The hotel is located off the main tourist areas so there are a lot of locals places nearby for dining choices.  The rooms were quite big for Venice and we happened to overlook a canal, so ask for one when booking.  Staff was really good.  Excellent breakfast.  Rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms were big, too.  Very clean and tidy.  No complaints! Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, General Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 13, 2016Thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for your kind feedback.
