Well away from the madness of San Marco, this superb hotel is in a quiet neighborhood off the Orto vaporetto stop.  We met another couple here for dinner, sitting outside in the garden was a special treat.  The food and service were top-notch, the stunning lobby with giant Murano chandelieri set the tone for over-the-top elegance.  The water taxi ride back to the Londra Palace was a high point of our vacation.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
