Beautiful hotel, if a little smaller than other Boscolo hotels, but the usual brilliant, friendly staff. Only downside is that for a 5 star hotel you expect tea/coffee making facilities in your room. There are facilities near Reception but we prefer to have our own in the room. Otherwise would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 6, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you very much for having chosen Boscolo venezia for your stay in Venice and for your kind feedback.
