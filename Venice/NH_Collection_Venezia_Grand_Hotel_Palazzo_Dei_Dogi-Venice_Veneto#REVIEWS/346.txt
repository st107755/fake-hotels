We stayed in 2 different rooms at this hotel, and they were a well decorated with lots of Murano glass, both as functional and art pieces.  Both rooms had a curious use of space, but were large and comfortable.  While every single guest I encountered was American, the staff struggled to interpret our room service requests, but that's reasonable since we're in another country!  Also, all the television channels were in not-English, which isn't surprising, just frustrating when that's the activity of choice.  I got a LOVELY massage in their small spa and considered coming down for a soak.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 12, 2017Dear Charlotte S, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay with us.
