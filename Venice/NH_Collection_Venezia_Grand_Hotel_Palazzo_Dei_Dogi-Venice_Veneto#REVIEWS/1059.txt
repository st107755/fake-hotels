Fabulous location and easy to get to from the airport. A 10 minute walk from St. Marks Square. Beautiful hotel with Murano glass chandeliers. Our room had a nice view of the city. Breakfast was delicious and offered an assortment of custom made dishes. Staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel has their own stylish water taxi for rides to the square or Murano Isle. Our little boy loved the secret garden in back. I wish we would of had more time to relax there. Graze Boscolo!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
