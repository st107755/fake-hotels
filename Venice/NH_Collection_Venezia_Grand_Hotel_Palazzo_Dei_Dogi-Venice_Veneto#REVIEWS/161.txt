The hotel is located near the Nossa Senhora Dâ€™Orto vaporeto station, what makes it easy to reach  from the airport and to move around  Venice, It is just 30 minutes walk to Sant Marco square, which is nice as you can explore the little streets while walk. Also there are good restaurants around, mostly used by locals. The rooms are nice and big and the bed very  confortable. The negative in the bathroom is the lack of ventilalion, but it is big and the toilatries quality provided is very good. Breakfast is excellent and the service and attention from all staff is outstanding. A special thanks for the reception staff. The Wi-Fi was unstable, and did not worked well.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Dec 11, 2018Dear Eduardo T, thank you for your feedback.
