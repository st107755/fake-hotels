This is a beautiful hotel in a quiet neighborhood of Venice. We walked to St. Mark's square in 20 minutes and enjoyed lots of restaurants in the area. We also rode the water taxi shuttle the hotel provides free of charge to Murano and to the square. We had a large room overlooking the canals, great bed, nice bathroom, great a/c.  The breakfast was wonderful and complimentary due to our Marriott status, served in a beautiful garden which is a unique feature in Venice. Staff was wonderful and helpful. Highly recommend and we will be staying there again!Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
