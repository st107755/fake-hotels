Warm welcome from the staff although some seemed fairly new and did not know the area so well.  Easy to get to from the airport boat levy; first stop on Alilaguna Orange line at Orto stop.  Also Orto is the last stop before returning to the airport.  Easy to use public water bus to get around the city.  Orto stop is two minute walk from the hotel.  Hotel also provides complementary shuttle boat to downtown.  Hotel is gorgeous and in a quiet residential neighborhood away from the normal throngs of tourists.  Daniel, a young guy and a local who works reception, knows the city best and can assist with travel directions and tips.  Internet and business center definitely need upgrading as wifi is weak and drops off a lot.  Air conditioning is functional but is a bit weak.
