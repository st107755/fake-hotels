Nice property in terms of the house the garden, etc. But the facilities dont match. No bar, nor nice restaurant. No proper gym.  Breakfast outside was sort of romantic but service was terrible. Selection for a 4* hotel very basic and boaring. Also quality was very average. Stayed there for 3 nights and I am a Marriott Platinum member. No recognition at all. My wife is allergic against milk products. Asked if sheep milk cheeses or soy milk produces are available were left unanswered even... never had that before in any hotel...  Best was the reception & concierge desk. Watch out for staff member Mr Benedetto !! He is a crook !! We ask for information to book our transfer back to the airport. He told us 120,-- EUR. We paid only 64,-- when we arrived... no other alternativeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
