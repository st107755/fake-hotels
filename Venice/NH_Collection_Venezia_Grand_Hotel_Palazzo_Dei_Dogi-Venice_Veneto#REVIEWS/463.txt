Nice hotel, however not living up to the expectations suggested by the price.  The room was charming, but far too small. Minibar prices horrendous, the spa area only accessible free of charge for one hour per day, but the sauna was out of order anyway during our visit. One day at breakfast time we had to cue for a table for 30 (!!!) minutes, the other day just 10 minutes.  We really liked the garden and the exclusive boat dock, where we enjoyed great views during sunset.  Next time, I would choose a different hotel with better value for moneyRead moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear Claudia80331, first and foremost, thank you for taking the time to write your opinion about your stay in Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
