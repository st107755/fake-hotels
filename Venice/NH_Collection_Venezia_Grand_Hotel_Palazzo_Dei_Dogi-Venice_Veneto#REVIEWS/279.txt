At the same time, We are very sorry to learn that you encountered some inconsistency in the service delivered, specifically concerning the shortfalls you highlighted.    With regards to the specific point you raised in your billing issue, the reservations fixed at our system and confirmed to you by email, were one with a paying rate and the other one with Marriott Points plus a supplement . We would like to inform you that, because the high request for the period in reference, all the rooms dedicated to the members redeem points program were sold and the only way to book with Marriott Points for the dates you reserved was the above mentioned rate, Points + Cash.  We are truly sorry if your stay with us did not fully match with your expectations, particularly since no team member sensed your feelings, regarding the noise you could hear in the room and the unsatisfactory f&b experince, during your sojourn and could therefore not show you any empathy and good will that we are accustomed to, in order to try to solve the unpleasant situation.  In closing we would like to thank you for taking the time to contact us with these valuable comments. We appreciate that your experience at the hotel was affected by the events you described, but the hotel will be taking action, using your feedback, to ensure that any future similar events do not occur.
