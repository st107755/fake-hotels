This hotel is in a great location if you don't want to be in the center of it all.  However, you can walk to the Grand Canal in approximately 20 minutes.  Also, there were plenty of the less touristy restaurants within a 5 minute walk.  We were updated to a suite (used points) and the room was huge!  The breakfast was included (for Marriot Platinum Members) and it was in a gazebo.  There was plenty to choose from as this was a full breakfast.  My only regret was that we did not ask for a room in the rear section of the hotel which is truly on the water.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
