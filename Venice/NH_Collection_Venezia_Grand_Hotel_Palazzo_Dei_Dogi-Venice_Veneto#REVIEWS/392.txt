This has to be one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in and I have over 1150 reward nights.  I am platinum for life with Marriott.  The lobby beautiful as was our room. Couldn't tell about the gardens since our room overlooked the tented restaurant.  Sorry we missed out on the full experience.  Disappointed.   Saw the rabbits at breakfast.  They were cute.  Say the pigeons at breakfast. They weren't.   Wifi very slow and difficult to connect on.  The tech that came up said it was because we had American iPads and iPhones.   Not a problem in any of the other hotels we stayed in while in Italy.  Even the B&B in Siena had a much better wifi set up. Not sure but never had issues elsewhere  Great venue, great property.  Wifi needs updating.  Please do so before we come back Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 4, 2017Dear beagles1013, First and foremost thank you for staying with us on for your trip to Venice.
