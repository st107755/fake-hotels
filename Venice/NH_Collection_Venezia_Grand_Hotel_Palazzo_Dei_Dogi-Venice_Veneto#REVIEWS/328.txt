Very chic and historic Hotel, very different to others Marriott brand. We stay there for one night , location perfect away from heavy tourist area. The room No 218 is dated and well maintained, The manager was very friendly to us , he help us to pay the taxi boat as we did not have enough Euro only Card and Aussie dollars on us. We did not enjoy all the facilities as we check in at 4 pm and check out around 1 pm.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 26, 2017Dear serge24, thank you for the appreciation shown in your review about your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
