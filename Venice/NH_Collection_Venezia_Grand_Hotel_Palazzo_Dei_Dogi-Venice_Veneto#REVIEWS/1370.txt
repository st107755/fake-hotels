We loved this hotel on the edge of the lagoon in Venice. The garden setting was perfect and our room was spacious and full of all the extras you would expect from 5 star accommodation.The calm atmosphere was very relaxing after sightseeing all day and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly  We didnt try the spa or eat in the restaurant in the evening but the breakfasts were very fresh and cooked to order. One small suggestion is a pot of boiling water for tea in the morning. Tea is available but you have to help yourself to a teabag and boiling water. Otherwise everything was fabulous and thanks to the staff for their attention to detail.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare
