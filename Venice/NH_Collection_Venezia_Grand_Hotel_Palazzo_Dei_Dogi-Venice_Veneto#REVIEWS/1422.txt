The Boscolo Venezia is in a quiet location with beautifully decorated rooms and nice garden to have a relaxing afternoon drink.  I didn't give this hotel an excellent because of the following: - Room A/C did not work very well.  We switched rooms and it was marginally better. - The wait staff are friendly but not as attentive as a 5-star hotel should be.  The free shuttle to San Marco is very convenient and takes about 30 mins to get to San Marco from the hotel.  There is a shuttle schedule at the from desk.  We walked back to the hotel from San Marco and it took about 1 hour, including stops in a lot of stores.  Advice on how to get here from the main bus station: walk across the "parking lot" and buy an ACTV ticket for the vaparetto (waterbus).  The hotel route is 5.2 or 4.2â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
