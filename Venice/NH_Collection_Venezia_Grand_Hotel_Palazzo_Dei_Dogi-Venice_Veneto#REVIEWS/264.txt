Such a lovely historic building, walking distance to everything you could want while giving you a true Venice experience.  The marble in the rooms alone is impressive but the gorgeous light fixtures in the lobby remind you that you could be no where but Venice.  At night there are so many cozy little spots to sit and share some wine.  Breakfast was lovely and the outdoor dining in the courtyard was very memorable.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 6, 2018Dear Lynette W, Thank you for you kind feedback.
