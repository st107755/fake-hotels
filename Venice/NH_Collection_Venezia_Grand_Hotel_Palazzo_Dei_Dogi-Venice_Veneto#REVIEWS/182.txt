This hotel is a gem, away from all of the crowds but near enough to walk to everything - and close to a water taxi and bus stop for easy transportation around Venice and the airport.  The hotel provides a free shuttle to the Murano Glass Factory - which we also visited and loved.  There is also a free shuttle to San Marco square - which can cost over 50 Euros for a private water taxi.  The hotel provided excellent service, food, and the best breakfast we had anywhere in Italy.  The biggest surprise is the gardens - which are not common in Venice - but were a big part of Dei Dogi.  Hoping to go back some day and spend more time here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 7, 2018Dear Tom L, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
