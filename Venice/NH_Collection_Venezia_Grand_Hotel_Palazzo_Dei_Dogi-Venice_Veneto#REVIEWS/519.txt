This hotel is relatively big considering it's in Venice.  It's a bit of a walk to the main part of Venice, which might be a disadvantage for people who want to be near the "action".  If you want to be away from the crowd, this is the place for you.  They service great coffee!  Staff is very attentive to your needs.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 21, 2017Dear Paco_Magsaysay, Thank you for your feedback.
