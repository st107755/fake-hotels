We recently spent five nights at this hotel, and it was truly charming. We were lucky enough to get a room overlooking the lagoon and the island of Murano. The room was beautifully appointed, and comfortable. The Staff were consistently friendly and helpful. Always a greeting and a smile. We ate breakfast there daily, and it was delicious. They also have a charming little bar perfect for a glass of wine or a drink.  They also have a large garden, almost an acre in size, that provides a park like refuge after a day of walking the city.  It is located in the Cannaregio area of Venice, which is a charming neighborhood just far enough to be out of the hustle and bustle, but close enough to be very convenient.  It was a delightful stay.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
