This hotel has old world charm with all the new world amenities on a canal and walking distance to everything (and close to a vaporetto stop). Both restaurant and bar areas had super selections. Loved the room, the atmosphere, the staff, and would definitely stay here again!Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare
