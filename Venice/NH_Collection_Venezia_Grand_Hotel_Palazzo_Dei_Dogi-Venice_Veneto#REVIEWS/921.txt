Loved this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and so beautiful. Breakfast was excellent--making for a delicious start to a day of sightseeing. Our stay at the Boscolo contributed greatly to a wonderful visit to Venice. Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare
