Beautiful hotel in a very serene area of Venice, away from the crowded areas. Convenient to the vaporetto stops (water bus) for traveling around this wonderful city. Close to many small places for breakfast- usually just walk three bridges and turn right- or left, located on canals. Great internet connection and plenty of hot water. Would definitely return to this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
