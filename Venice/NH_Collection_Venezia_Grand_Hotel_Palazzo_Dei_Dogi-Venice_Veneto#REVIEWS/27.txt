Regarding our Restaurant, we are glad to hear that you found our breakfast buffet much better than you expected to and we are aware how important that is for our guests, that's why we always serve fresh and local products.  We deeply thank you again for your kind feedback and remain at your disposal should you ever return to our wonderful city.  Best regards, Mihaela Belghiru Front DeskRead more
