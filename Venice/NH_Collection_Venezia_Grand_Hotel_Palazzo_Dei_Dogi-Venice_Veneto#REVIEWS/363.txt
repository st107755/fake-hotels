We had a wonderful 3 night stay at this charming hotel on the north part of the island. It is walking distance (30 minutes)to San Marco Square.  The service was great. Take advantage of the complimentary taxi to San Marco square. The first shuttle starts around 10am so if you want to take advantage of this, book your tours after 10 am.  We booked early to avoid the cruise ship crowds. Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
