Our 1st trip to Venice with the family and we stayed at the Dei Dogi. Our stay was too short. The hotel is located in a quieter part of Venice and with the daily free shuttle to St Marks Square throughout the day is very convenient if you feel tired and not wanting to walk the 20 odd minutes back.   Venice is a lovely city to walk and walk and just wander the small alleys and explore.   Allow 4 days minimum. Our 3 nights and 2 days wasnâ€™t enough. One day is needed for Murano and Burano for Glass and Lace. Another 3 days for Venice to wander leisurely.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 8, 2019Dear GeorgetownPenang, Thank you for your kind feedback.
