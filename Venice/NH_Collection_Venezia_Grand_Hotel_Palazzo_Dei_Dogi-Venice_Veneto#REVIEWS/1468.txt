My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for the two nights we stayed in Venice on our Italy trip.  This 5-star hotel lives up to its reputation and its high rating.  The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The breakfast was truly delicious and had a wide variety of choices.  Our favorite part was the complimentary private boat that was available to take hotel guests to St. Mark's Square and the island of Murano to see the glass making companies.  We took advantage of this and saved a lot of money this way.  The service at the hotel was exceptional.  They spoke very good English and were eager to please us.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
