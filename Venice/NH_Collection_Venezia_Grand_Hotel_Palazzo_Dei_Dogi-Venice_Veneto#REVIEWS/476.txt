Quite often I end up choosing a hotel which in the end is "ok" but not special. This time, however, choosing the Boscolo was absolutely perfect. Situated in a  quiet northern part of the city but within reasonable walking distance to all of Venice's attractions, restaurants, cafeterias and shopping. Complimentary shuttle service from the hotel to San Marco Square is available but need to be pre- booked. Breakfast buffet and dishes from morning menu are very "more-ish" made even tastier by the wonderful service of Romena and the the rest of her team.  The reception team is extremely helpful and always ready with great suggestions provided with a smile. A special "thank you" goes to Phillip and Stefano for their help with our little transfer problem we had. Very unique in Veniceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 7, 2017Dear Ivo97152, thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for your kind feedback.
