Very beautiful property located in the quiet side of Venice. Fortunately it is also not too far away from all the main attractions. Service is very prompt, very classy ambience and the view is spectacular. Due to may status I was also upgraded to the para room which is gorgeous. The breakfast buffet spread is limited, but with high quality. The ala carte main dish selection are very nice and delicious too. They also provide complementary tour to the Murano glass tour. This is definitely worth going. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Highly recommended!!! :)Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 12, 2018Dear Shoto,  thank you so much for choosing Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection and for taking the time to review your recent experience with us.
