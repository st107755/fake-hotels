I booked online on the hotels website 2 months before arriving and had to cancel providing a full 30 days notice  due to unforseen circumstances and was refused a any refund. They claim it was a "special rate" and I only had 24 hours prior to booking to cancel (Thats insane!).   Poor business practice, I expect this from an online discount website, but not a Marriott Hotel!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 27, 2014Dear Sirs, Thank you for your valued feedback.  I think that your reservation was an advance purchase that requires a prepayment in full at the moment of the booking. The advance purchase is a rate that could not be cancelled, modified nor refunded.  The terms of cancellation of this rate are written in the policy of it, we always invite clients to read carefully them.  We really hope to have the opportunity to welcome you in our Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection to regain your trust.  Best Regards,  Martina Malusa Front Office Manager AssistantRead more
