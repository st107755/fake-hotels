We just Returned from 3 1/2 weeks in Europe with stays in Venice, Rome, Florence, Rapallo, Nice, Montreux, and Paris. Picked the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi by chance and because it was off the beaten path, and it was great. Venice is small enough that you can walk to Saint Marks Square in 20-30 minutes which is 1/2 the way accross the Venice. The Room was small but very nicely furnished, the breakfast was great, the staff was excellant. This was our first trip to Europe and the first stop on our trip and it was a great beginning. Took walking trips to Saint Marks Square and Rialto Bridge. Took water taxi to Murano Glass factory. Was strange though, 4 days never saw a car....only boats.Read moreHelpfulShare
