Very Nice Hotel in a very nice quiet place!  They have Water taxis from airport just ask! The room was very nice and clean!  Bed very comfortable !  Our breakfast was included and it was a very nice buffet with lots to eat!  You can walk and catch ACTV ferries into the center of Venice. Besure to walk around the area of the Hotel it is very nice! There are shops and restaurants just a nice walk away! We enjoyed our stay very much!  The staff was very helpful and friendly! Now that we know our way around would stay again!
