We ended up here because of a diverted flight to Venice and this was the only hotel with two rooms available.  What a blessing in disguise!  We arrived near midnight after 24 hours of traveling and crossed our fingers that the bar was still open - they stayed open, brought us some snacks and helped us chill out before heading up to our well appointed rooms.  The breakfast buffet the next morning in the courtyard was extensive, delicious, and the setting was just magical.  The hotel staff was pleasant and accommodating.  While it seems off the beaten path, it is not.  If we ever return to Venice, we will stay here!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 18, 2017Dear Divepam, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience with us, we really appreciate your comments, they give us the strength to improve day after day.
