During our two day stay we had the opportunity to reside in three different rooms due to air conditioning issues and cave-like atmospheres.  If you reserve a room at this hotel we advise you to keep your bags packed so you have time to actually see Venice in betweem room changes.  Of slight consolation was the opportunity to participate in their totally overpriced breakfast buffet at $22/Euro per person.  This hotel must know someone that hands out the stars!!  Don't do it!!!
