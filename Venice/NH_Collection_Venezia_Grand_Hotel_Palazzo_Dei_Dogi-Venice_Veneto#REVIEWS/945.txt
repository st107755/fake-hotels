Spent several nights at this Hotel in September of 2014. Was able to use Marriott points but would have stayed there anyway. This was our second time to Venice and we wanted to find a Hotel that was away from the tourist and we found it. Hotel was great with friendly and helpful staff. Slightly past their garden area, they have their own private dock that is rarely used. Great place to sit at night and watch the world go by. Approx. 20 to 30 minute walk to Rialto Square or 10 minutes by water bus. Lot of small family owned restaurants nearby.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
