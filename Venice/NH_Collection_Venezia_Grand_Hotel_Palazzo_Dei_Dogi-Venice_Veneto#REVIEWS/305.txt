Fabulous in every way.  So good I want to keep it a secret!  In quiet part of Venice but can walk to the Rialto Bridge or a water bus to St Marks Square.  Service is sublime. Food excellent.  Runs a water shuttle to St Marks Square.  Excellent for a long weekend.  Looks nothing from the outside but you walk into a palace.
