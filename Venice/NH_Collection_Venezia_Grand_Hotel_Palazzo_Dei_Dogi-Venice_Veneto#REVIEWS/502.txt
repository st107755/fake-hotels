The hotel is a beautiful palazzo with the rarity for Venice of a large private garden. In a charming and relatively quiet part of the city it is very easy to reach from the airport and provides a regular boat service to San Marco. Rooms are spacious, as are the public areas. Breakfast is good, though the breakfast seating area is a bit cramped. Service is at 5 star level.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 4, 2017Dear Mr. Oliver H, Thank you for your feedback.
