My husband and I are members of Marriott Rewards and are time share owners so we always stay in a Marriott or allied property when we travel.  We used our accumulated points on a trip to Italy and France in September, 2012, and were fortunate to be able to stay at Boscolo Venenzia Autograph Collection in Venice.  It is former noble palace and it has the most amazing gardens and lagoons within it's walls.  It is utterly charming.  The accommodations were fabulous, roomy and extremely comfortable.  The staff was exceedingly gracious, polite and helpful.    Breakfast in the gardens was a treat every morning.  We had dinner one night at the hotel and that was the only negative.  It simply was not very good.  We were too tired to go out and our first choice was closed that evening. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
