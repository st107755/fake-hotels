We spent one night here in June 2018.  The room was spacious, clean and delightful.  The lobby is beautiful with the Murano glass chandeliers.   We dined outside for dinner and the food was superb.  Venice is expensive and our dinner certainly was pricy but delicious.  The morning buffet breakfast was super good.  We took the hotel boat to St. Marks and then walked back.  It was a long but interesting walk.  The hotel is on a quiet canal, the gardens are gorgeous.  I highly recommend it!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 11, 2018Dear Lisa M, Thank you for your kind feedback.
