Everyone at this hotel, especially the concierge were friendly and professional. The garden is spectacular.   The hotel is clean, quiet and an oasis after a day of walking around.   The outside dining area is very inviting. We enjoyed walking to the end of the garden and sitting on the hotel pier conversing and enjoying red wine.   I would recommend this hotel to couples and families.   Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
