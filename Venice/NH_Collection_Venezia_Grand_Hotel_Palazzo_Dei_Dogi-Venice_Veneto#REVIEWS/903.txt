Boscolo Venezia was the perfect place for us to discover Cannaregio. The hotel is very easy to get to and a wonderful sight to have when you come rolling your bag from the Alilaguna airport boat. Wonderful staff, warm, friendly, professional. Terrific breakfast and a tiny gem of a garden. The restaurant was truly a surprise for us... dinner was exceptional. We had a fantastic time and would recommend to anyone that has already experienced bustling San Marco -- try this quiet, beautiful neighborhood of Venice. We miss it! (Madonna dell"Orto is practically next door.)Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
