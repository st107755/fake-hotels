This hotel is located very conveniently to so many wonderful shops, restaurants and sites. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and very helpful with directions , recommendations and assisting guests. The room was comfortable, very clean and very nicely appointed. Their breakfast buffet had a wide range of tasty options and I saw the dining room staff accommodated several guests special requests. The lobby is nicely appointed with Murano chandeliers and the garden is beautiful. We ate one dinner in the restaurant and the pasta with smoked gouda was fantastic.     We were provided with transportation to Murano with a tour of the factory and showroom.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 19, 2018Dear mclaughlinmariea, Thank you for your feedback.
