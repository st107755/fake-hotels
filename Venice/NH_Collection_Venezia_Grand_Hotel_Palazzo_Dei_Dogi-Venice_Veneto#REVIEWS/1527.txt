We stayed here with a Globus tour and liked it the best of the hotels we stayed in. The lobby was beautiful. Our room was a bit small but charming, clean and neat. We could see a small courtyard and canal from our window. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed and had lots of goodies: soaps,etc. slippers, and robes. The concierge staff was friendly and helpful. We used the public water transport (vaporetto) twice to return to the hotel. It was a fun although crowded way to travel and the boat stopped close by the hotel. There are some eating spots a short walk from the hotel. Our buffet breakfast was included and there was plenty to choose from. The hotel has a beautiful garden out back and it was such a pleasant surprise to find it when the rest of Venice appeared to be soâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20091 SaveHelpfulShare
