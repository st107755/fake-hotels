The hotel is beautiful.   The hotel has history and character and even if you are not staying there actually it is a must see location.   For me the key thing about this hotel was the staff each and every member of the team running this hotel has been trained to treat all customers so very very well.   We were treated with respect and all of our requests were met with a passion that I'd  prefer to see at all the hotels are staying at.   This hotel is by no means cheap I feel that we paid a very high price however for that price we got very good value for money in terms of the service we received.   I highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 7, 2017Dear Bratster73, We are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia!
