The hotel is located at the Rizzo-Patarol Palace, it is a beautiful 16th-century building and it takes you back to Venetian history. The hotel is luxury decorated, full of paintings and beautiful crystal chandeliers. We got an upgrade to a luxury suite and it was very comfortable. The service was very good, and the breakfast was awesome. It was a little far away from Piazza San Marco, but its worth. Very recomendable!Read moreDate of stay: January 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2017Dear Juan O, thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
