My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in October, 2017 and were satisfied with our accommodations. Our room was comfortable although without enough chairs or space to relax comfortably. This was more than made up for with the second floor "lobby" where there is not only a great deal of space but also some marvelous art work. The location is ideal for wandering around Venice and the hotel provides boat travel to St. Marks and to Murano free of charge. We did not eat in the hotel, except for a pizza our first night after a long day of travel. It was just fine.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 26, 2017Dear Peter S, thank you for your feedback.
