We stayed in this hotel for 2 days in September of 2014.  If was super.  You can walk into the city center or take the water taxi.  The Location on the water was so peaceful after a day in Venice.  Nice small bar for a cocktail or glass of wine before a nice evening out or after a long day or touring.  The breakfast was also very good.  Lots of local restaurants nearby. The staff were very helpful and courteous.  We would stay again if we ever make it back to Venice.  We highly recommend this hotelRead moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
