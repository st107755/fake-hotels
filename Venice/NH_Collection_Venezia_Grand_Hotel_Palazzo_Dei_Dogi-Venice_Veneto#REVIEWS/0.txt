We recently spent three nights here in the presidential suite, this is located at the far end of the garden from the main hotel with 4 other rooms. The suite had lovely views over the lagoon and the garden the other side .  I was a bit disapointed that there was no coffee machine in the room and the mini bar contained only water (perhaps due to covid? though other hotels in Italy had full mini bars) The garden is rather special and enchanting with a seating area looking out over the water. I found the breakfast a bit restricted and the cappuccini a bit strange. Being on a quiet canal was nice and there were plenty a restaurants within a five mins walkRead moreDate of stay: October 2020CleanlinessServiceSleep QualityHelpfulShare
