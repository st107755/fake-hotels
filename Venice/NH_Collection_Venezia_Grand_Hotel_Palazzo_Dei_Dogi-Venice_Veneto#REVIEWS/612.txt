The only redeeming quality is that it's a really old building and has a friendly staff. There's no way we would have paid €500 to stay the night. Our first room smelled like sewer and our second room had a floor that was coming apart. The shower had poor water pressure and was impossible to regulate the water temp.   Really expensive art and decoration. The bellman said one of the chandeliers cost $300,000... Gulp.   The staff was excellent. They quickly changed our room after the sewer smell was verified by maintenance. The location on the back side of the island was good. It's away from Piazza San Marco so the traffic is lighter, but there are still restaurants around.
