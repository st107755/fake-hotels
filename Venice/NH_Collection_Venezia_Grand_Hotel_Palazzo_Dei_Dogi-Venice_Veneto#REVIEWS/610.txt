Me and my family stayed in this amazing palace  for 3 nights  . The hotel staff were very helpful and very welcoming. The rooms are very clean and very historic. The only nagtivty in this hotel is the breakfast no much variety to choose from however the food is delicious. I recommand this hotel for everyone.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 14, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
