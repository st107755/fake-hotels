Location - great - close enough to walk to Rialto bridge but in a very quiet area so very peaceful. The first stop on the boat from the airport so very easy to get to on arival,  Accomodation - good - we had a cottage style room in the garden which i'd recommend. The gardens are lovely and there is a pier with a free boat which runs to the main square a few times a day.  Food - did not eat here but the bar and cocktails were nice. I recommend one of the small local cafe's nearby for a cheaper breakfast option.  All in all very impressive and reasonably priced.Read moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
