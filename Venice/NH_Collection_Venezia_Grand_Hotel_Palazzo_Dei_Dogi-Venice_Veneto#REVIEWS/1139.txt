We stayed here for two nights as part of a tour group.  This hotel was a last minute change from one on the Grand Canal, so I thought it might be an upgrade.  I was not disappointed.    The hotel itself is an old building, but fairly well maintained.  There are many touches of it's luxurious past!  Rooms were small, as with most European hotels, but adequate. Our room, however, didn't have much of a view: the windows of the building next door and a very small courtyard.  Staff seemed friendly and helpful.  Internet Wi-Fi worked, and was free!  The garden at the rear of the hotel was lovely!  I wish we had more time to enjoy it.  Breakfast was very nice with the usual breads, pastries, meats, eggs, and beverages.  The assortment of jams and jellies was truly awesome!Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
