We have enjoyed stays in some of the best hotels in Venice including The Danieli but The Boscolo Venezia is the place we will return to next time we are in Venice.  A warm welcome by Pablo and a much appreciated upgrade made us feel we had made a smart decision choosing The Boscolo Venezia.  Spacious accommodation in a historical palazzo and faultless service validated our decision. Excellent breakfast, Compact clean spa, unusual garden and lots of space in central areas all contributed to a sense of being in a very special place.  Pablo booked two very good restaurants for us and his smile and infectious energy will surely carry him to higher levels in the Marriott group.  Thank you Pablo and Boscolo Venezia team for looking after us.   We look forward to our next visit.Read moreDate of stay: February 20171 RepostHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 26, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
