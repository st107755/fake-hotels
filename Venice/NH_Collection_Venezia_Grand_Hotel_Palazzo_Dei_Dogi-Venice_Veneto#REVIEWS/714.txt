The Boscolo was a wonderful and pleasant surprise. A Marriott hotel (we stayed on points), we could have not been treated better. It felt nothing like a cold American hotel in Venice but rather like a warm intimate hotel run by friends. They staff was terrifically friendly and helpful at all levels. We were upgraded to the Suite on the fourth floor overlooking the canal and I recommend that room very highly.   The hotel is a 20 minute walk from San Marco square which makes it perfect for a relaxing stay. By the time you leave the main pathways and head for the hotel you have left the crowds of tourists behind and it feels like an intimate trip back into time and the real Venice. Even though not in the center of the city I would call it centrally located as is almost everythingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 13, 2016Thank you for you kind feedback.
