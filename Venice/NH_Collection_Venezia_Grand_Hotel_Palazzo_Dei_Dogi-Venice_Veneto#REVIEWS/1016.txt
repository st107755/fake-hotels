Stayed here for 3 nights and were more than satisfied with it. The staff are extremely helpful,friendly and knowledgeable about all things Venetian,and took a genuine interest in us and our trip. The rooms are well appointed,if not a little chintzy for my taste,and the location is perfect if you like a haven from the madness of St Marks Square,the Rialto and the centre of town. We loved it and particularly appreciated the complimentary water taxi. We'll be back!Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
