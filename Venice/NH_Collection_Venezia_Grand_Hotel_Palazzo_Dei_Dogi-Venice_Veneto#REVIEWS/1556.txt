We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Yes the food and drinks are expensive but we found fabulous eating places close by - family run, full of locals and wonderful food. The hotel was extremely tranquil and relaxing, and the staff were eager to please. The real bonus was the private water taxi which swept us in amazing style to the centre of Venice and back. Although dont miss the opportunity to stroll into the centre one morning..its a wonderful walk.  We wanted a magical experience from Venice and we got it. The hotel really played its part in this. When we saw the city centre hustle and bustle we were grateful we chose an elegant, relaxed hotel in a quite, residential area. And yes, there are no kettles in the room..but heh, how often are you in Venice? Crack open the wine!!â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2007HelpfulShare
