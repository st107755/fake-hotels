This was very elegant hotel in a quiet section of town. Beautiful lobby and restaurant. We loved the location and the hotel has their own boat.  The rooms were spacious and the bed very comfortable. The overall service level here is very high and you will enjoy your stay in this nice Marriott owned property.  The breakfast was good and served outside.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
