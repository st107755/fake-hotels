Located in a quite area of Venice (30 minutes or so walking from St. Marks Square) situated by a canal in front and the lagoon behind.  Beautiful gardens are located on the property.  Delicious restaurants nearby.  If you want a place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist area, this is it.  Only disappoint was the lack of availability to charging phones/cameras, etc.....(220/110 ) When we are back in Venice,we would stay here againRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 15, 2018Dear mjgfamily, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
