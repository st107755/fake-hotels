After having traveled around Europe for almost 2 weeks in celebration of our 10th anniversary, Boscolo Venizia was our last stop and wow what a terrific stay and end to our trip. The hotel was home away from home for us. When we arrived in our room we were welcomed by a bottle of champagne in celebration of our anniversary. The room was very classy, neat, warm and comfortable. Their service out of this world. We loved it there and  will definitely go back...Such a lovely placeRead moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
