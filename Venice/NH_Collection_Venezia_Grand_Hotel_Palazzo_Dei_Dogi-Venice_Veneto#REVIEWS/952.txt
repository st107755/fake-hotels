Excellent property! It was our first time in Venice and we had a fantastic time there. The staff is there to help you with anything you might need, and their services are fabulous. The property is gorgeous! It is located off the Grand Canal by a couple of canals, in a charming neighborhood, with great restaurants, and local shops. They have a hotel water shuttle service if you need it, and the water bus is a short walk. We will stay with them again in the future, and ANY Boscolo properties. Ciao Boscolo for the most wonderful vacation.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 27, 2014Dear Kathy, We are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection!
