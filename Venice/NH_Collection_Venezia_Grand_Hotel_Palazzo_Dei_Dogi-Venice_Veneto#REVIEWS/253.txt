We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on Tripadvisor.. and we were definitively Not disappointed. Through staying here, we discovered a part of Venice which we probably would not have seen otherwise. Much more residential, yet also filled with lovely cafes and restaurants. The hotel itself is great, fantastic staff, excellent breakfast en gorgeous rooms.  I know where we'll be staying a next time in Venice, for sure!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 19, 2018Dear Myra R, Thank you for your feedback.
