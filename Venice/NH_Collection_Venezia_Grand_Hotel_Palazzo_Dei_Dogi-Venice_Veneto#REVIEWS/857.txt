My wife and I enjoyed our honeymoon here and it exceeded our expectations. The location is great (away from the tourists), their courtesy water taxi rides to St. Mark Square and Murano are great, the rooms are large and clean, and their concierge Ivan is amazing. Whatever we needed, Ivan was friendly and so incredibly helpful. The one thing we regret was not spending more time in their garden behind the hotel. It's really beautiful and unexpected in the tight quarters of Venice. It's a getaway in itself. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
