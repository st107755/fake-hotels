My family and I just adored this fantastic hotel.  They make you feel like honored guests from the moment you arrive.  Our family suite was gorgeous with a loft space for our children.  We sought several restaurant recommendations and all were truly wonderful, surprising given our previous experience in Venice of mostly tourist trap fare.  This hotel is far away from the crush of summer tourists in Venice and a lovely place to relax.  We hope to come again!Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 12, 2019Dear cdptraveler, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
