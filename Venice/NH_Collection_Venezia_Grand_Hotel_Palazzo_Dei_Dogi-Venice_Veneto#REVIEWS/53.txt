This hotel was our first of three during our Italy vacation and was by far our favorite. My husband and I were travelling with our two teenage daughters and my parents. Our daughters and us had two "upgraded" rooms that had patios onto the beautiful gardens and my parents (who are not titanium elite) had an equally lovely "non-upgraded" room by the back dock with an impressive view of the water. The staff was wonderful and the bellinis were amazing. Exploring the secrets of the garden was a treat for all of us. The slightly off the beaten path location of the hotel was a major plus, with plenty of non-touristy restaurants a five minute walk away.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
