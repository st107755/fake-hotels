Tried to cancel a reservation with over 2 months notice and was told that I had booked under a special rate and that my trip was non refundable even though i have given them over 60 days notice. Person I spoke to was completely rude and would not listen to reasoning nor would they let me speak to anyone else. From the attitude I received trying to book and the no refund policy I would recommend staying away!!!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 1, 2014Dear Sirs, Thank you for your kind feedback. Probably, your reservation was an advance purchase that requires a prepayment in full at the moment of the booking. The advance purchase is a rate that could not be cancelled, modified nor refunded. The terms of cancellation of this rate are written in the policy of it, we always invite clients to read carefully them. It would be our honour to welcome you at the Boscolo Venezia and provide you an excellent hotel experience upon your next visit to Venice.Read more
