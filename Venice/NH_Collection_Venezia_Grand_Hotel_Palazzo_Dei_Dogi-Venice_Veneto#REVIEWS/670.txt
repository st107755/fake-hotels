Having Never been to Venice it is hard to make choices about a hotel. So, I researched the Marriott affiliates and decided that a hotel near the airport would not provide the ambience of old Venice and the resort might be too difficult to get to. Then I happened upon the Bosolo.. 100% the right choice!!!  A short walk to all of the sites. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and it's charm. Beautiful frescoes, chandeliers and former ballrooms and the secret garden backed up to the lagoon.We did not eat dinner in the restaurant, but we had room service and breakfast which were delicious and plentiful. The room was large, comfortable and charming. This is not a Marriott by US standards, this is in a class of its own..world class. Enjoy itðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2016We are happy to read your review and your appreciation.
