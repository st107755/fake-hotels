My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights on 6/1 -6/3 and we love, loved it.  We were fortuante enough to get a lagoon view room on the opposite end of the property (stroll over and take a picture of the sun setting at dusk from the private dock).  The garden here is amazing, there are 2 rabbits that are just adorable to watch mill about the garden.  The staff is very helpful (Evan, Barbara come to mind) and the breakfast is fantastic and managed be a top shelf staff.  The location is great and low key, and a 3minute walk to the main tourist zone.  Our rooms were exactly what we had hoped and we are very much looking forward to returning.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 19, 2017Dear Gaillion, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
