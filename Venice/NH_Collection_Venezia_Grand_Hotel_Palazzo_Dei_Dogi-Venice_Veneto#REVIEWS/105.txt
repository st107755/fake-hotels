Great service, but THEY WERE DRILLING RIGHT OUTSIDE MY ROOM  Pro's - Clean Room - Great Service - Nice Staff  Cons - Individuals were DRILLING right outside my room, woke up my baby SEVERAL times. See pictures - I'm a platinum elite member and no upgrades were available - TINY ROOMS, could hardly fit my 2 suitcases and stroller - Ancient TV, hardly any room to watch  Overall, ruined my trip as the drilling was reprehensible and disappointing.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 19, 2019Dear Johnny C, thank you very much for choosing Grand Hotel dei Dogi, The Dedica Anthology.
