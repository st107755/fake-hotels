We stayed 5 nights in the early fall. We had two rooms that were adjacent but not connected. The hotel is beautiful with elaborate murano glass chandeliers and lovely painted walls and headboards. The staff is attentive, friendly and welcoming.   The breakfast buffet was lovely, with fresh mozzarella, fresh breads, brilliant coffee served with steamed milk, smoked salmon, fruits, cereals, etc.   To get to the hotel from the airport, we took a water taxi on the orange line to Madonna D'Oro. It is expensive! We bought a round-trip ticket. You don't need a reservation just wait at the area for the orange line. After exiting the water taxi, it's an easy 5 minute walk to the hotel. Good to have wheeled suitcases.  The hotel is a pleasant 45 minute walk from st mark's square. Be sureâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
