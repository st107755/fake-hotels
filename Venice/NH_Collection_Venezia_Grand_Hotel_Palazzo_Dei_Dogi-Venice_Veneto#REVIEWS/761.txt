This hotel is located in more of a residential area in Venice. The area is referred to the Jewish ghetto.  Very quiet and quaint hotel. The staff was very nice. The room was very larger and was so quiet with the marble flooring and padded walls.  The walk to the gran canal and San Marco was very nice and manageable, but as is true in all parts of Venice, is is quiet easy to get lost. Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
