My family stayed in this amazing hotel one night before boarding a cruise. We are Marriott Rewards members and were thrilled to be able to use points.  The hotel is located somewhat off the beaten path, but they do offer water shuttles to the San Marco Square several times a day.  We found it was nice to take the shuttle to the main square and then walk back to the hotel enjoying the sights and ambiance of this historic city. Our rooms were large and beautifully decorated. Breakfast in the garden was exceptional.  Staff was extremely helpful offering dining recommendations, city maps and arranging transportation to the port.  Highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 4, 2015Dear Valued Customer, First and foremost thank you for your loyalty towards Marriott and Boscolo.
