A fairly formal baroque looking place. Very friendly service. About 30 minute walk from st marks square. Or about 15 minutes to the "hands" sculpture area. We were there for only one night. Perfectly comfortable. You need to know the bridges to know how to get to anywhere so a bit of a struggle there for us. Hotel is probably most notable for its large garden with a lovely garden restaurant. Breakfast is amazing since you get the buffet and also an item a la carte.  No bar or lounge scene to speak of.
