We stayed here on a tour and were very happy with this hotel. It had very friendly staff, the surroundings were great, there was a shady, green garden and we had a comfortable, quiet room. The bathroom and toiletries were very good. This hotel had the best breakfast we had on tour. There was free wifi but if you did not use it for 10 minutes you had to log in againRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
