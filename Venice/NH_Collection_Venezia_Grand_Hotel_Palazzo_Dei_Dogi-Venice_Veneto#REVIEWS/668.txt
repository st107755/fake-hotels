The Boscolo Venizia is a work of art inside of a hotel. The former Palace has been transformed into a wonderful, comfortable place to stay. The bathroom is amazing, the public spaces are beautiful. What we liked most of all was staying in this area is much more quiet than the hustle and bustle of what is Venice. The walks to the main areas are not troublesome and there are amazing sites to see along the way.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2016Dear Mr. Lloyd, Let us thank you for taking the time to post your review.
