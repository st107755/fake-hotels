The highlight of our stay was the spa treatment we got. Maria was awesome. We got the spa special for 80 euro, body scrub, massage and facial. Philip was great at checking us in and giving us restaurant recommendations. The hotel has a boat shuttle if you don't want to walk to St. Mark's Sq. Take the airport boat shuttle to the hotel, to the Orto stop. The American breakfast was great.  I look forward to returning again. Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
