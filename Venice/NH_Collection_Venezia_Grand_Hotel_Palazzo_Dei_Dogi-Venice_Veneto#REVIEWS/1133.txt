This was our third time in Venice,  but our first time staying in the Cannaregio district.  What a wonderful part of town.  We chose this hotel because of our Marriott reward points, but we were so delighted that we did.  This hotel has two buildings, and a fabulous garden in between.  It is a really pleasant surprise to discover this serenity in the middle of bustling Venice.  We were even more delighted to discover our room faced the lagoon and the island of Murano and it was glorious and sunny our first day in Venice. We also enjoyed a very sumptuous breakfast.  The service was excellent and so was the staff.  We really recommend this location if you want to stay in a real Venice neighborhood.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare
