There are 2 x Boscolo hotels, one is close to the railway station and this one is further away in a very quiet part of the city. We thought we booked the one close to the station, but had to walk and navigate our way to the other at night, and been new to the town, this was an experience that would have probably been fun if we weren't tired and it wasn't dark. The hotel is nice and the staff were friendly. The rooms were comfortable and the breakfasts (included in our stay) were excellent, we ate 1 x dinner which was also very good, all other meals we ate out, which was easy and cheaper. Venice is easy to get around from this hotels location and we found walking to be fun turning down all the little lane ways. I guess it was expensive but what isn't in Venice , we loved our stayâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare
