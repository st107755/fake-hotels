We arrived in Venice cold and wet.  Upon entering the hotel my face lit up.  It was in a location that we liked and the room was warm and big.  They also have a great spa that allowed us to use the hot tub and sauna for free.  Would definitely stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
