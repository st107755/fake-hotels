The hotel was very nice, we received free breakfast as Marriott rewards members when we arrived which was definitely a plus as the breakfast offered was very good! The staff at the hotel were all very nice and helpful giving us great suggestions on where to eat and where to shop for certain things, they were constantly seeking to make our stay more enjoyable. There was also free wifi which worked very well!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
