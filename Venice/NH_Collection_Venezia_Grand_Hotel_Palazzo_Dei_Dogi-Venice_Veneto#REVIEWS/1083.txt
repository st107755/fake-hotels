My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for two nights in the middle of April. Overall, we had a great experience. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful. They gave us great directions and suggestion on what to see in Venice. In addition, the hotel's water taxi is convenient and also a pleasant ride to St Mark's Square.   Our room was beautiful and fully equipped with everything we needed. The hotel is a few streets over from the main part of the city, but we preferred being off the beaten path. There were some great restaurants a street over that we found ourselves at both nights. I would highly recommend this place.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
