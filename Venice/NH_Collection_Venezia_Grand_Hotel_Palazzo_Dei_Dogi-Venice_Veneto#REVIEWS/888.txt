The Boscolo is a beautiful old Venetian mansion ... which is great!  But what I loved most was that it was off the tourist path so I felt like I was getting such a peaceful, authentic Venice experience.  We were only a couple of blocks from a number of really excellent restaurants and then another block or so to the Grand Canal and all of the tourist needs like shopping and gondola rides.  You are far from San Marco but the complimentary water shuttle gets you there in no time!  I also have to comment on how helpful and friendly the staff was.  They went above and beyond!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
