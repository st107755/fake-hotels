We stayed here 7 nights during our recent visit to Venice.  The hotel concierge, Ivan (who was fantastic!), spoke English and helped us plan our week's activities.  His assistance made our stay quite enjoyable.  The hotel was quite lovely (a former palace) and was in a quiet corner of Venice.  We loved the delicious breakfast buffet (no cost for Marriott Titanium level) adjoining the beautifully landscaped gardens.  We appreciated the boat transportation to/from St. Mark's Square as well as Murano Island.  There was also a very convenient vaporetta stop near the hotel, just a short walk away, and the pier also serviced boat transportation to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
