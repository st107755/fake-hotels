Lovely and clean hotel away from the crowds. Our room was 109, again spotless albeit a little compact but the bed was large and so comfortable after a day walking around.  However the noise from the corridor sounding like a vacumn cleaner going all night did disturb our sleep and early in the morning the noise from the hotel receiving items on the canal and sending baskets of linen away to be cleaned was again disturbing.  Perhaps ask for a garden room. Lack of kettle for making a hot drink would be useful.  Did not eat as it was not included and previous reviews said it was expensive.  Nor were we offer a glass of fizz.  Spa was a welcome to my husband's aching bones - but the girls are bordering on being rude and do not go out of their way.
