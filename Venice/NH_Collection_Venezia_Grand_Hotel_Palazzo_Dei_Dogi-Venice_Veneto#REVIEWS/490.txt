Without realising it we booked a weekend to Venice during the Carnavale but this hotel is just far enough away from the main tourist area to be a haven of peace and quiet. Classic old style rooms and reception. There are local restaurants a couple of canals away that are excellent, also directed by Philip at Reception to a couple of his recommendations...very good. Great holiday in a beautiful place.Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 3, 2017Dear Mr Robert R, thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
