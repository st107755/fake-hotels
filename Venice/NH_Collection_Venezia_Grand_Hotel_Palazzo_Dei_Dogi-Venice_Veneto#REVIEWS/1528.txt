The staff is untrained--for example, we were told that the gym around the corner accepts hotel guests.  Upon arrival at the gym, we were told that the gym does not have any realtionship with the hotel.   We asked directions to the casino at the front desk--they gave us directions, but failed to tell us that jackets were required, so we had to walk all the way back to the hotel so the men could get their jackets.
