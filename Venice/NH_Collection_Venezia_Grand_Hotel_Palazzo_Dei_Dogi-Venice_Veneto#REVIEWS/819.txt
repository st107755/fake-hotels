The Boscolo Venezia is located far enough from San Marco Plaza to provide a quieter sense of Venice's many charms.  A converted mansion, its modern occupants can appreciate the building's opulent past while enjoying modern air conditioning, comfortable beds and great breakfasts!  The water taxi shuttle provided by the hotel makes getting to San Marco or Murano easy, without having to schedule tours or expensive taxi rides.  The hotel is also conveniently located by the public water transport station Madonna Dell' Orto so trips to the airport or train station are also easy from the hotel.  Service is excellent, both at the desk and restaurant.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
