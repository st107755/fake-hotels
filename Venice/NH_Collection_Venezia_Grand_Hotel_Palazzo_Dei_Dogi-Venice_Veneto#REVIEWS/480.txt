We stayed over night in this hotel and it was lovely. The room & bathroom (suite) was large for European rooms. The bed was also very comfortable. Don't miss their breakfast it was great! It's 15 walk from the train station and 30 mins from St Marks. There is boat taxi service right around the corner. Don't miss a walk through the garden and the view from the pier.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 30, 2017Dear Tulipdoll, Thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for your kind feedback.
