Well checked in tonight with my wife n son. The moment we entered the room there is a distinct foul odour which I went down and complained at the reception, n was told the housekeeping would come to clean it.

After further investigation on the matter with our front desk members and housekeeping staff we would like to advise you that your room was inspected twice each time straight after you came down to the front desk to report the issue. As per our housekeeping staff both times there was no foul smell detected in your assigned room. The reason that you did not see the housekeeping staff personally in your room is most probably because you were down at the reception at that time. The Assistant Front Office Manager Martina Malusa recalls to have informed you personally accordingly.  We deeply regret that we were unable to offer you a room change as the hotel was  fully booked and we had no available rooms left that evening.   Once again we apologize for the inconvenience you might have experienced during your stay and we hope to see you back in the future.  Kind Regards,  Rositsa Tsvetkova For Martina MalusaRead more
