Found this hotel so beautiful I was lost for words.. In such a special place as Venice it is worth every cent to stay at a special hotel and Boscolo truly is very special. The hotel is 25min walk to San Marco Square; 10min walk to Roma Termini and Orte Ferry is around the corner: Our Room was magnificently decadent; decorated Venetian style - huge space with king double and single bed; lounge suite,wardrobes, dressing table/desk; the bathroom was also huge; stocked with beautiful bathroom supplies (which were restocked each day - not like a lot of hotels that only supply soaps, shampoos, shower caps etc on the first day and only give you 1 toilet paper roll a day which is ........ when there are three people in the room!) Your bed is turned down each night with sweets left onâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
