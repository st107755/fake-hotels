This Marriott property is well-staffed with those who care and want to ensure your stay is the best that it can be. It is so beautiful and the garden must be one of the largest and special places in Venice. With a vaporetto stop nearby and located on a small canal, great walking access (if you enjoy walking and exploring), it's in a great spot while away from the crowds. The staff organized an amazing dinner while we were there--awesome food from a chef of Michelin quality and wine served all nightRead moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
