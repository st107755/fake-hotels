The hotel is a former 16th palace that overlooks a canal. The lobby is gorgeous with beautiful chandeliers and paintings.  My husband, I and another couple stayed there two nights, and the staff could not have been nicer or more friendly and helpful.  The hotel is located in a quiet area of Venice, which we loved. It was walking distance to many great restaurants and to the Piazza San Marco.  We took advantage of the free water taxi right outside the hotel to visit other areas of Venice, including Murano. The room was a good size, and the bathroom included two cozy guest bathrobes . The breakfast was excellent, and coffee, tea and lemon water were available all day in the lobby area.  A computer was also there for guest use.  We truly enjoyed our stay in this exquisite hotel,â€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
