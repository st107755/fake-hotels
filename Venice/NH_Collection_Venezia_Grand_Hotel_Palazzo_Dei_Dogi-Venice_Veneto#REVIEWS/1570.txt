The hotel had some good qualities, nice location in a pretty, quite residential area, yet only 5 minute walk from the main street. The also have a free shuttle, nice water taxi, to St. Mark's square several times per day. The hotel also had lovely Etro toilettries.  However, the hotel did not  match up to other 5 stars I've stayed in. Apparently in italy there is a higher class 5 star L, which this hotel is not. The rooms were not as clean as I would expect with crumbs on the carpet and mildew in the corners of the shower.  The room service was also very expensive, with a cup of coffee about 10 E. The turn down service was not sufficient either, they only made the bed, did not straighten up the bathroom or bring fresh towels. Read moreDate of stay: August 2006HelpfulShare
