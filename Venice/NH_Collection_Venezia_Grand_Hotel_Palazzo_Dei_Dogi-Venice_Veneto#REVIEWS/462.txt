4 days with the family for a quick vacation break. Beautiful place north of the island, facing Murano e.g. outside of the too crowded part of the city and therefore very quiet. Incredible garden with a private pier on the Â´lagune' All the charm of an old fashion yet luxurious place with good service. Can only be strongly recommended.
