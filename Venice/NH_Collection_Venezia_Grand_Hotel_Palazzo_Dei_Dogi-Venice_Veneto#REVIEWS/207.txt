We checked in pretty late at night and in spite of my status (platinum) was still given a regular room all the way out in the garden. An old, musty, cold room out in the garden.   Because I was in good company, it did not matter, but as a hotel guest I was underwhelmed and unimpressed. Not worth the price I payed for the night.  The hotel is also pretty far from the important sights of Venice for example San Marco. Maybe 45 minute walk if you know the way. It was pretty hard to find at night without GPS.   Breakfast was mediocre at best. Three stars is truly generous...Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 21, 2018Dear sebastian P, thank you for choosing Grand Hotel dei Dogi, The Dedica Anthology. We are very sorry we were not able to satisfy all your expectations. We could not to provide you with a free upgrade due to the high occupancy our hotel currently runs and, for that reason, we assigned a room with a desirable location, immersed in our botanical garden. The district in which our property is located is a residential one, where you can enjoy the flavour of the authentic Venice and find typical bars, restaurants and artisans' shops. Moreover, we provide free shuttle transportation from and to San Marco's Square for our valued guests.  We sincerely hope you could give our hotel another chance to regain your trust on your next trip to Venice.  Best regards, Chiara Zambianchi Deputy ManagerRead more
