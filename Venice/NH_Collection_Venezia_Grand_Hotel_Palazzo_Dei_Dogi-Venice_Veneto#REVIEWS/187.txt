We recently stayed at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi.  The service was wonderful and the hotel was stunning! When they found out we were celebrating our anniversary, they sent a bottle of prosecco to our room.  A delicious breakfast was served every morning on the patio next to their gardens.  It was a great way to start the day.Read moreDate of stay: September 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 1, 2018Dear Kimberley425, Thank you for your kind feedback and for choosing our property to celebrate your anniversary!
