We have been to Venice several times but never stayed in this part of town before.  The Boscolo is a beautiful property, very quiet, with its own garden.  We think in the summer this would be a fabulous location, especially since the hotel offers a motorboat shuttle to San Marco Square several times a day (do remember to book it, however!) In the winter, it felt a little bit remote, but it took us away from the hoards of tourists--a major plus that allowed us to enjoy the magic of Venice.  You will probably get lost getting back to it...that is also part of the Venice experience!  There is a wide variety of rooms--some are out in the garden and at least one suite contains stairs.  If this is a problem, be sure to specify that you cannot handle stairs! The rooms vary in size. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 7, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
