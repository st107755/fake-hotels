We had an incredible experience at Boscolo.  The room was beautiful!  We absolutely loved the staff and the hotel location was great.  We enjoyed several meals at the hotel restaurant and there were several other places near by to eat and drink.  Fantastic!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
