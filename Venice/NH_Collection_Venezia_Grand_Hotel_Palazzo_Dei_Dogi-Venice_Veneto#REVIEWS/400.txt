My husband and I stayed there four nights last week.  It was perfect! We loved being away from the hordes of tourists and experiencing a residential part of Venice. The room was large and very well appointed. The gardens are magnificent; we enjoyed a picnic lunch there one afternoon.  The buffet breakfast was excellent.  The staff were all very professional and warm.  It was our fourth visit to Venice and we vote this the best location and hotel we've stayed at in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 28, 2017Dear Guest,   We wish to thank you very much for your kind words.
