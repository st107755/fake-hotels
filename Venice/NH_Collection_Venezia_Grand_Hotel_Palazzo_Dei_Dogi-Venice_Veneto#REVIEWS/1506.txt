Beautiful hotel BUT there is litle to no working A/C and in July, Venice is sweltering.  Therefore you won't be able to sleep and if you open the windows, mosquitos will come in and eat you alive.  (I had over 30 bites in one night).  Message to the owners:  Fix the A/C!!!!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
