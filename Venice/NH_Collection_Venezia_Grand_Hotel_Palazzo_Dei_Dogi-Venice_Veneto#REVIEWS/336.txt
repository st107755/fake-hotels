Upon arrival we were greeted by polite reception staff but not offered a refreshing hot towel as the plate was empty. When showed to our deluxe rooms the hotel appears to be tired and in need of a makeover.   Our room was very dark and the view disappointing. The bathroom was not to a five star standard and the quality of the shampoo and shower gels not good enough and there were no flannels at all. I would have expected feather duvets and pillows but was disappointed to see that the pillows were hard and the duvet very thin bearing in mind that it is October and is getting chilly at night.   I have stayed in a lot of five star hotels around the world and at home in London and I would say this hotel is no more than a 3 star. I would not recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 15, 2017Dear Valued Guest,  Thank you for staying with us and thank you for your valued feedback.
