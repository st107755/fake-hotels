Arrived in Venice via cruise ship.  Communicated with hotel before arrival and got directions on how to get to the hotel from the cruise terminal.  Didn't find getting to the hotel from the cruise terminal using their directions a problem.  Hotel itself is quaint and away from madding Venice crowds.  We booked a standard room and was very pleased with it.  Opted not to pay the 22 Euros for breakfast and grabbed a coffee and danish on the walk from the hotel to the closest Grand Canal vaporetto stop.  As has been stated, it only takes 30 minutes to get to the airport via vaporetto.  Can recommend this hotel and if we are ever in Venice again we would stay here.Read moreDate of stay: November 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
