Everything we wanted to say has already been said!  What can we add?  Lots of hot water!  Lots of peace and quiet!  Lots of friendly staff!  Extremely comfortable beds!  Hugest and best breakfast in Italy, with prosecco for mimosas!  The private garden alone is worth the price of admission - a haven of rest to rejuvenate body and soul.  The private taxi is a gorgeous wooden motor boat fit for visiting royalty.  As a matter of fact, we'll just end our review by saying that every single staff member at Boscolo treated us as if we WERE visiting royalty.  Do not hesitate!  Go!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
