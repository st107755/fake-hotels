The hotel is easily accessed from the main airport using the orange line vaparetto and is the first stop after leaving the airport. We really enjoyed this hotel and were very pleased with the room that we were assigned overlooking the lagoon. This August was extremely hot however, the air-conditioning system in our room was quite adequate and we had no problems unlike others who have provided reviews. We found the staff universally helpful and pleasant from check-in to check out. As others have noted the hotel is a little distant from the center of Venice (and the crowds)  however, the free boat service to St. Marks square was delightful and the staff were very helpful. We walked from the hotel to St Mark's square and the Rialto bridge and found that 20-30 minutes was the norm.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
