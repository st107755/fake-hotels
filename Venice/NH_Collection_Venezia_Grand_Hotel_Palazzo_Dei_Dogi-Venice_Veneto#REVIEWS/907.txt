I stayed for only one night and was impressed from the moment I arrived to the time I left. The hotel is in superb condition and conveniently handled all requests I had. The free water taxi to St Marco's square just added on top of the experience. Next time I am in Venice I plan on booking a longer time at the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
