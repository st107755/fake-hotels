We stayed here for two notes and had a fantastic time! The property is beautiful and it was not hard to get here from the airport water taxi - maybe a five minute walk at most. The staff spoke good English and we never had any language problems. We also loved that it was not part of the touristy side of Venice and really enjoyed the local coffee shops and restaurants nearby.   Our room was a little small but comfortable and we loved that we could open the windows for fresh air. I would go back to this hotel for future stays in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
