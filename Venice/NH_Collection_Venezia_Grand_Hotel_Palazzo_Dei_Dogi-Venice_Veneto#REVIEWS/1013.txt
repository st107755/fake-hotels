The hotel was lovely with a beautiful garden that is quite unusual for Venice.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  This place is located in a quiet area about 20 minutes walk from San Marco.  There are plenty of places to eat and shop, however, within a five to ten minute walk. There is scheduled hotel transport down to San Marco and the public boat transport  is just a short walk away.  All in all, a really relaxing way to enjoy Venice.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
