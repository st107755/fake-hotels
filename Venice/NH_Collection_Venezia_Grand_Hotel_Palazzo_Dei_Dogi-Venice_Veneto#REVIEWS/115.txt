As many things in Venice are old, so is this hotel. It does have pretty marble floors and chandeliers and the lobby is elegant. The outdoor gardens are beautiful. The hotel is in a nice quiet neighborhood but close enough to the tourist areas. Our room was very small and very tired looking. Overall, I was disappointed with the room. It could definitely use some updating! It might have been a 5 star hotel at one point but does not seem to be a typical 5 star today. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel does offer free transportation to St. Marks Square as well as Murano which was nice amenity.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 6, 2019Dear 1Pineapplewave, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience in regards to your recent stay at the Grand Hotel dei Dogi, The Dedica Anthology.
