I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay here. From the moment we stepped into this elegant building the staff made us feel welcomed and at home. They were friendly and tentative and did everything it seemed to ensure our stay was a pleasant one. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the other autograph collection hotels we stayed at during our trip. Apart from the exceptional service our rooms were spacious, well appointed and luxurious. The breakfast was delicious and offered an variety of fresh fruits, breads, and hot items. It was served  by a beautiful garden with covered seating.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 19, 2018Dear GaylonandAngela, Thank you for staying with us at Grand Hotel dei Dogi and thank you for your kind feedback.
