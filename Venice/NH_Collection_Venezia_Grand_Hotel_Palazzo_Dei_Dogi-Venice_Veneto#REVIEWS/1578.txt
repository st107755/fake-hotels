We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in a junior suite.  The room was lovely with a welcoming bottle of champagne and biscuits, lovely toiletries in the bathroom, but the view was of the kitchen!!!   The hotel is very ornate and has a lovely garden and jetty area which overlooks the water.  We dined in the hotel restuarant on our first night and the food was passable but the breakfast the following morning was truly awful.   There was an extra charge of 30 euros for a plain omlette.  Staff, with the exception of reception, were inexperienced and not particularly helpful and the service in the bar was very slow. Would return to Venice in the future but would stay elsewhere.
