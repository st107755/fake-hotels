Our first trip to Venice, planned late with not a lot of time to research. I am a frequent Marriott guest so I went with the brand.  Hotel is in the Cannreggio district which is not centrally located - can be a positive or negative depending on your view. Very easy to get here from the airport, the Alilaguna boat stops at "Orto" which is less than 5 minutes walk to the hotel. The hotel also runs shuttles a few times a day to San Marco and Murano. All in, we found the location workable.  The property is a palazzo that's been built into a hotel. Our room was spacious and very well appointed (3 of us, including my daughter), plenty of room.  Air conditioning was key...it can be spotty in some Venice hotels...if you visit in the Summer you'll know why its important..:)  Breakfastâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 13, 2016Dear Mr. Jim, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection Hotel.
