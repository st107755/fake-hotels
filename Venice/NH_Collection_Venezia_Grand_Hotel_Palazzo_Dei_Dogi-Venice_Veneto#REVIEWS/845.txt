This is a pretty hotel older formerly the French Embassy we like to stay at in in Venice.  It is a Marriott compared  to the new JW Marriott for us (Our new #1 Fav Venice Hotel) it was a bit of a let down We were there recently for our fortieth wedding aniversary. We booked with points and are supposed to get a FREE upgrade to a suite but got a lower floor view over a small canal poor view. Staff was ok not great food good beds comfy clean renovated rooms big TV. FREE use of older spa for an hour was a plus.Best approached by water location is a thirty minute HARD bag drag over 6 big bridges over canals from the train station. Alilaguna water Taxi from the airport 18 euro per person the best way to come in/out.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
