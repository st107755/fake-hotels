We were able to book a room at this hotel using our Marriott points, we stayed four nights at the end of April.  What a treat this was!  The hotel is lovely, the location is great, the breakfast is sumptuous.  Our only complaint, and this may sound trivial, is the wifi.  We were barely able to access it from our second floor room.  Although we asked at the desk for help with the problem it never got better and at times was impossible.  We wanted to use Skype to stay in touch at home, so this was frustrating.  It is a problem so easily solved, it is a mystery to me why it never was. While the front desk staff were helpful if you asked a question, the staff who served the breakfast could not have been more pleasant.  I would love to return to this palace!Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare
