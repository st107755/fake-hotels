Stayed here for just 1 night after meeting family to spend a few days in venice. Hotel is very grand with gorgeous  artwork paintings  and glass  chandeliers.  Room was very comfortable  and service was exceptional.  Breakfast  was very good with lots if choices. Would highly recommend  a stay here, you will not be disappointed.  On a small beautiful canal close to local bars, restaurants  and a famous  coffee shop.Got a water taxi from marco  polo  airport straight to hotel which docks just at the rear if the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 8, 2020Dear honeybug29, Thank you for staying with us Grand Hotel dei Dogi and thank you for your kind feedback.
