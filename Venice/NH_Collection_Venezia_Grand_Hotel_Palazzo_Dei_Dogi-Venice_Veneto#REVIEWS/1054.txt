This is a beautiful hotel! They kindly upgraded us upon request (I have Marriott Gold status). The hotel has a nice boat that will take you to San Marco - or you can walk it. We walked to San Marco and back on the first day...it was good because it gives you a chance to explore. It is a long walk though - we took the boat there and back the next day. Breakfast was fantastic, there is a beautiful area with luxurious lounge chairs in the garden and a nice dock to sit out and have a bottle of wine late night. The staff were very nice and helpful. They made dinner reservations for us...it was great. I would stay here again. It was nice to have peace and quiet away from the craziness of tourists near San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
