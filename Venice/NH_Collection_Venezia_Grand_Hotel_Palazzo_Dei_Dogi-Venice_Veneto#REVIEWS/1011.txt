Expected a bit more from this hotel. We only stayed one night, (2 rooms). One room was upgraded (for our daughters), it was a good size but the pull out sofa in the loft area was extremely uncomfortable.  Our other room was very small.  Service was mixed. Front desk check-in was pleasant and efficient. Bartender not so much....... The hotel has a beautiful garden and a lovely dock - very nice place to relax and have a cocktail in the evening. However, as you walk through the hotel and the garden and the same used plates, bottles and glasses that were scattered around at noon are still around at 10:00pm (and some were still around the next morning), the experience goes quickly downhill.  We would find somewhere else to stay next time.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 9, 2014Dear MamaKlebs, we would like to thank you for taking your time to share your comments with us.
