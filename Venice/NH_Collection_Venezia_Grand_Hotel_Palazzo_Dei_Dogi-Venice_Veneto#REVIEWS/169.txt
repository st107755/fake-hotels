My husband and I enjoyed our first trip to Venice, August 29 to September 3, for five nights.  We stayed at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi on Marriott reward points.  We were warmly greeted upon our arrival by the staff at the front desk.  At check in we were given an upgrade to a king room in a separate building overlooking the lagoon.  The room was spacious with a couple steps down to a small but beautiful bathroom. We stayed there for 2 nights, but on the third day asked to be moved as we were woken up each night by extremely noisy neighbors and could not sleep. There is a building attached to this separate building on the hotel property.  The hotel does not owe it, but shares a common wall. where we could hear our neighbors conversations in the middle of the night and their TV. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 20184 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
