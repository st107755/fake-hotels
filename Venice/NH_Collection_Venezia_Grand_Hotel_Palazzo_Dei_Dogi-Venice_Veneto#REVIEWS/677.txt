Loved the hotel.  Stayed in a junior suite which was really just one big room, but it included two chairs, a couch and a few tables.  Huge.  An amazing chandelier hangs from the middle of the room and the ceilings had to be 20 feet high.  The garden in the back is very nice for a stroll.  Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the location.  You are a good 20-25 minutes walk from St. Marks, and that's assuming you don't get a bit lost which is easy to do.  It is nice to be in a quiet neighborhood, but it was not ideal if you wanted to drop off some packages or pick up a jacket while you were out and about.  Still, one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
