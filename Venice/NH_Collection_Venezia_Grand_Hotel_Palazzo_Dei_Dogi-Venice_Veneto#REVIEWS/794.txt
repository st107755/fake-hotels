This hotel is off of the Orto Vaporeto stop.  It is not too far from the train station, but I would take public transit.  There is complimentary water taxi service to and from San Marco Square.  I wished we would have known that up front.  The room we had was a beautiful junior suite.  The light switches were unpredictable as to what they controlled and the shower was difficult to get the water temperature correct; however, once the water temperature was good, the shower was amazing.  The restaurant is really good.  The breakfast was EXCELLENT.  We at in the patio area behind the hotel and it was so peaceful.  The staff were amazingly helpful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
