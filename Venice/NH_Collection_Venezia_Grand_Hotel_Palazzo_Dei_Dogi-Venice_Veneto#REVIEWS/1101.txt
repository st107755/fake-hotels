The hotel is very beautiful but is very far from everything.  It is very far from any main tourist attraction or good eating places.  From the train station, you can take the water bus line 42 or 52 which is a lot cheaper than the taxi. The line that goes to the airport also passes by the same port for the hotel (Orto) so you dont need to take the water taxi or the hotel service. The concierge will not volunteer this information and will just offer you their service which costs 140 euros. For a five star hotel, the venice map that they give you is a black and white photocopy where you can barely read the street names. We definitely did not get the service we were expecting for the price that we paid.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Direttore at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 21, 2014Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind feedback which allows us to look at our services and facilities from the guestâ€™s perspective and to review and update our standards where necessary.
