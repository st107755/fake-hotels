This hotel is not in the main touristy section of Venice but is only a 20-30 min walk away from St Marks Piazza plus the hotel has free taxi shuttles there. The service was excellent and the staff was friendly. The hotel is beautiful. Though away from the tourist crowds there are still numerous restaurants and bars within short walking distance. Would definitely come here again. Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
