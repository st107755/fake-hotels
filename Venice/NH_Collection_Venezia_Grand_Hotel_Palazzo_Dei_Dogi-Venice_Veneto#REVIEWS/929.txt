The Marriott Boscolo in Venice was a fantastic choice for my wife and I because it is close enough to the action to walk.  At the end of the day when you just want to get away from the hustle and bustle, the Boscolo is about three blocks off the beaten track.  The hotel is actually in a neighborhood where the local lives unlike most other hotels on the island.  The benefits of this being, there are more traditional restaurants and bars ets.... The prices in these local establishments are about half the price of the tourist district.  We spent most of our trip walking, exploring and eating - and of course drinking.  We went to Venice during the carnival with no plans on what we wanted to do.  I would recommend this approach to any couple who enjoy wandering and great cuisine. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare
