An excellent hotel with stylish and traditional decor. Welcoming staff, very attentive and professional. Free water/tea/coffee in lobby is a nice find. Well recommended area, away from bustling tourist activity with a local and authentic ambience.   25 minutes casual stroll to St Marks with option of using the free boat service offered from hotel. Some building work ongoing at time of visit (01/04/18). Well presented garden area located in central courtyard.   Several nice restaurants nearby particularly enjoyed Paradiso Perduto, within 3mins walk from hotel. Menu is in Italian. Mostly locals, fantastic seafood and cacio e pepe is a MUST (spaghetti served from cheese wheel by chef at your table).  Two nights in Venice is plenty of time to experience this unique city.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
