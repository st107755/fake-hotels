The Boscolo Venezia is a lovely hotel.  It is away from the Grand Canal and the crowds, but because Venice is small, within walking distance of anywhere.  The people working there were friendly, professional and very helpful.  They have a lovely garden which stretches all the way back to the lagoon.  We ate at the restaurant the first night we were there and it was the best meal we had in Venice.  One of the best meals we had on our trip.  The chef is fabulous.  And while they have a room inside the hotel, we sat at a table in the garden.  It was really lovely.  I would stay there again, and definitely eat at the restaurant again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Vice Director at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 17, 2016Dear Mr Stan, let me thank you for taking the time to post your review.
