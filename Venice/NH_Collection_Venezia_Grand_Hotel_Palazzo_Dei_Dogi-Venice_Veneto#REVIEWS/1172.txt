This was the first Autograph Collection hotel my wife and I stayed in with Marriott.  The hotel is beautiful and is located in a quiet section of Venice right next to the Madonna del Orto church.  The rooms are beautiful and the whole hotel is beautiful.  It has a large garden and its own boat, which took us to Murano.  Their breakfast was wonderful in the garden area.  Despite its location, it only took us a few minutes to get to the heart of Venice.  If you arrive by air, look for the Alilaguna, orange line boat.  It will take you to the Madonna del Orto, right next door for less than 20 Euros.  A water taxi will cost you at least 100 Euros.  The hotel is filled with art work and the service from the desk, concierge, maids, and everyone else is topnotch.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
