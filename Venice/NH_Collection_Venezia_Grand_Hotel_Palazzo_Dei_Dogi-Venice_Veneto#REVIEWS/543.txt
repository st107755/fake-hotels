My husband booked this hotel as part of my 50th Birthday celebrations. We stayed 3 nights in this quiet location away from the hustle and bustle. All the staff are warm, friendly and very helpful. Comfortable rooms and beautiful surroundings. Great shuttle service to St. Marks Square. Good choice for breakfast and superb bar service. Wonderful guest engagement. Thank you for a memorable stay.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 29, 2016Dear guest,  Thank you so much both for so kind a review and for choosing Boscolo venezia Autograph Collection for your stay in Venice, specially on such a particular occasion!
