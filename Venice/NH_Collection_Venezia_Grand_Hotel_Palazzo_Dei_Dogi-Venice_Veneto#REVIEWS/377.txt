Just spent 3nights at this excellent hotel. Loved it. From check in to checkout staff were welcoming, helpful and charming. Hotel was relaxing elegance. Ate in hotel for breakfast and dinner. Lindy was fantastic at breakfast. Always had a smile and super efficient. Edo in the bar was fantastic. He was so lovely and helpful. He really made our holiday. Loved everything about this hotel. We had a canal view room which was a real bonus. The hotel is in a quiet are but central for walking to major sights. Hotel offers free water shuttle to st marks and murano. Easily reached by waterbus from airport. Already planning our next stay at this lovely hotel. Garden was a real selling point for this hotel. Peaceful,relaxing area.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 17, 2017Dear Isabella C, thank you so much for taking the time to write such a glowing review about your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection!
