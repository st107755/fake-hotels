Stayed here in august .   Perfect location for many reasons.   It's the first boat stop on the orange line from the airport.   Hotel is located within a 5 minute walk from boat stop .     Hotel is locatef away from the crowds but an easy walk to all the hot spots.    It was not inexpensive but worth every penny we spent.  If we go back to Venice I wouldn't stay anywhere else but here.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
