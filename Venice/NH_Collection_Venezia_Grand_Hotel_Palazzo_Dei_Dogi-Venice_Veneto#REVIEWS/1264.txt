Not sure where the rooms in their website are but we did not stay in anything like this. This was our 20th anniversary and I was expecting a romantic hotel. Our room was standard fare - bed/desk/bathroom. It was pepto - pink and had a musty smell to it a. We used our rewards points for the 2 night stay - so if Marriott uses this room for guest who do this - shame on you Marriott! I wondered where the Marriott bedding was - the mattress was not comfortable the linens were below par. So this is not a Palace. If they take you to the garden to get into your room - go back to the front desk and try again. I thought the rooms would out way the problem with the remote location but I was wrong. Not many restaurants around here and be prepared to walk...a lot!Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
