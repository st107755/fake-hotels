The most beautiful hotel inside and out that I have ever been to. The grounds were gorgeous, with a beautiful garden towards the back. Top notch customer service. Amazing Relaxing private spa session with Turkish bath, Sauna and Steam room. Breakfast was magnificent with all kinds of food imaginable to include mimosas. Great water taxi service.
