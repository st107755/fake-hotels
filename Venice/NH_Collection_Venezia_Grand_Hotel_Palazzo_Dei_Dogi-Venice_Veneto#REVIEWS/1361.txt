Venice was the first city on our tour of Italy. Yes Venice is very expensive as far as cities go and when booking our hotel we had Marriott reward points we wanted to spend, so here we stayed. The room had an elegant fussy (a bit 18th century) yet contemporary feel to it. The bathroom was very contemporary covered in Marble. The bathtub was absolutely perfect to unwind in. The staff was very helpful, however do not ask them where to go to eat dinner, they send everyone to the same place, (it is okay but you can do better!) Take advantage of the free boat shuttle at the hotel that will take you to San Marco square. Call and they will pick you up as well! Breakfast was included, it was simple and delicious, walk their private garden when you finish breakfast it is beautiful!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
