We stayed at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi for 5 nights and loved it!! The Alilaguna airport shuttle drops you off and picks you up right down the street, so airport transportation is really easy. We were between staying at this hotel in Cannaregio or San Marco. The free water taxi provided by the hotel to San Marco ended up being the final decider, but we ended up never taking it because the walk was so enjoyable. However, after visiting San Marco were so relived we chose this hotel. It was really crowded and a maze. We loved visiting San Marco, but we would not want to stay there. The Cannaregio is definitely the better choice.  The Grand Hotel Dei Dogi property was beautiful and with the current renovations underway will only get more so. The staff and super friendly and helpful.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 20193 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
