My husband and I booked this hotel to hold our wedding reception and we also stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. The wedding reception that they organised for us was fantastic. The food and wedding cake they prepared was beautiful. All the staff were very helpful and kind.  The hotel rooms are great as well.  They also have a complementary boat service to take guests to St Mark's Square, very useful for the older guests! Read moreDate of stay: December 2004HelpfulShare
