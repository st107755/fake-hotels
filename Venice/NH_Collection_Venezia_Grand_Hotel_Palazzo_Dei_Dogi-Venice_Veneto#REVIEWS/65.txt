We stayed here three nights and loved this hotel.  The staff made the stay truly wonderful.  Each one was helpful, booked dinner, helped us on and off boats with luggage, booked a free water taxi to Murano, Elizabeth at the spa was great, and the list goes on and on.   The small bar area and outdoor restaurant seating were very nice.  We sat outside for both dinner and breakfast.  The buffet is huge with a lot of variety. The area wines were delightful.   Our room was a nice size as well as the bath. We overlooked a portion of the garden.   A wonderful stay all around.
