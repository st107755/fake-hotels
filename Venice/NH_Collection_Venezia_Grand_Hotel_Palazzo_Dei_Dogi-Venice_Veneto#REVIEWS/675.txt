The Hotel is fantastically located on a canal with easy access to the other canals as well as the ACTV water cabs.  The staff at the Boscolo are fantastically friendly, efficient and helpful - offering suggestions about restaurants, visiting sites or travel. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room we had overlooked the canal.  When we re-visit Venice, there will be no other options for staying - Boscolo Venezia, Autograph Collection.
