We really loved our visit to Venice and the Boscolo Venezia contributed greatly to our fantastic stay.  Our room was gorgeous and had an amazing venetian hand-blown glass chandelier in the center of our spacious suite.  The service was excellent 90% of the time. We only had one encounter were the front desk person seemed bothered by our question.  He was only their one time during our stay so we were happy to work the with the other staff members who were excellent.  The breakfast was really great and the service was impeccable each morning.  The housekeeping staff were excellent and had our room clean, stocked, and organized each day.  The spa was a bonus and we took advantage of the complimentary roman bath, and both wet and dry saunas.  The spa facilities were beautifullyâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 20151 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
