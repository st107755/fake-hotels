Tons of character and charm located in the residential neighborhoods out of the tourist mob.  It's rooms are updated, clean and very charming.  The staff is fantastic.   A great place for couples traveling together or a romantic get away alone.  Even a family stay utilizing the 4th floor suites that share a close-able lockable shut of securing the two separate suits together.  Kids in one , mon and dad in the other and a main door that locks the two rooms away from others.  Plenty of great restaurants but do not take the front desks recommendations.  Not good. That is My only complaint.   Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare
