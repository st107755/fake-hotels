After a long day's drive and a boat trip from Piazzale Roma we checked in around 1 pm. From there we experienced friendly and very effective service , had a quick and nice lunch prepared and were off by taxi boat to a performance at Teatro La Fenice at 3:30 pm. We stayed for two nights. Concierge service was excellent with good area restaurant recommendations. Nice, old fashioned room with a good bed. Very good and varied breakfast. We arrived by the vaporetto water bus to the Orto stop. This trip is good sightseeing and the stop is easy walking from the hotel. The hotel has it's own boat service in addition to the water bus option. The area around the hotel is very quiet when the day visitors has left.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
