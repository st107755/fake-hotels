Spent four nights in this 5 star hotel and loved every minute of it.  Ate in hotel for dinner every night from bar menu served in dining room. Food is delicious, staff so attentive. Special mention to Edo who must be the member of staff every hotel wants. Nothing is a problem to this guy. Best barman I've ever come across. He aims to please and does it in the most professional style. Made every evening special. Thank you so much to all the wonderful staff at reception, breakfast and housekeeping. Everyone extra special.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 11, 2017Dear Guest, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
