Stayed 3 nights on our visit to Venice. Great atmosphere, wonderful location away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Central Venice. Good service , a great place to have breakfast and one of the best places I have been to in Venice for a great meal. The menu has some Venetian dishes and the prices are extremely reasonably. English appears to be the lingua franca @ breakfast and this seems to indicate  a predominance of North American visitors ......after all it's Marriott or some linkage. Anyway this is highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
