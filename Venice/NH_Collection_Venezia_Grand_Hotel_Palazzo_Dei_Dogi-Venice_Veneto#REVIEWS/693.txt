A beautiful hotel! Lovely decor, nicely appointed rooms with many amenities. We had a gorgeous room with painted ceilings and lovely Venetian tiles in the bathroom, that looked out on the garden.The staff was extremely helpful when booking tours to the islands of Murano and Burano.  Our concierge, Ivan, gave us great suggestions for places to eat and places of interest.  The hotel is located away from the crowds near the Grand Canal, in a great neighborhood that is quiet and peaceful. Overall, we are so glad we decided to stay at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 6, 2016Dear guests, it is our priority to offer our guests service of the highest quality.
