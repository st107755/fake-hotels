We spent 4 days at this hotel. It is located in a quiet area with few tourists wandering around (at least in early May). It is possible to walk to the touristy areas from there. The best way to get there from/to the airport is by water taxi (120 euros) or shared ride (37 euros/person). The room was comfortable and quiet. The staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was good quality but as expected in a Marriott hotel. We took advantage of the "tour" to the Murano glass and from there to Burano (a most!). Overall a pleasant stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 29, 2019Dear Laura R, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
