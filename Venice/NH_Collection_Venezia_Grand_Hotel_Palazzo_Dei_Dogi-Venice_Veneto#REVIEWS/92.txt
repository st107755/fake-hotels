My husband and I had a very nice stay. If you are looking to get away from the crowds and relax this is a great spot to do so. We also enjoyed the free water taxi over to Murano. The breakfast was fantastic, but we did not enjoy the dinner selections as much. Overall a clean and nice hotel. Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
