We arrived to Venice via train from Munich to spend 2 nights before our journey back to AZ.  The staff was welcoming when we arrived, since my husband is Platinum Elite status with Marriott, we inquired about an upgrade.  They informed us that there was no availability the first night, but they would check the next morning. When we went down fro the delicious buffet breakfast in the lobby, Beatrice excitedly came to us and told us they had a surprise for us.  Alessio then escorted us to The Presidential Suite!  I gasped.  This room is simply amazing!  2 floors overlooking the bay.  I've never stayed in a room of this caliber before.  This was by far one of the best nights we've ever spent in a Marriott.  Thank you Beatrice and Alessio for making this anniversary trip so veryâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Agent at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 15, 2019Dear Leah E,  thank you for your wonderful words on our hotel, service and for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community.  As you have discovered, we are always happy to surprise our guests with nice little attentions and offer them the chance to live memorable moments and enjoy the magical atmosphere of our property and our wonderful city on water. In your specific case we had a singular opportunity which is not normally at our disposal, since our majestic Presidential Suite is a unique solution and generally always booked much in advance. A last minute cancellation allowed us this gift that we hope made you enjoy everything in first person. We are glad to learn about your satisfaction and read such a beautiful review.  We simply wish you will come back in the future and pay a visit when the hotel has finished the renovation works going on in this period. The situation will then be much more magical again.  Until then, we wish you our best regards,  Alessio Front Office DepartmentRead more
