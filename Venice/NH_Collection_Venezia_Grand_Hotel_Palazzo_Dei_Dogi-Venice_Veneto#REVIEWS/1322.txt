Superb staff led by the Front Desk Manager Ms Barbara.  Gaia and Ivano performed exceptional concierge services, and the breakfast staff was very attentive.  A very classy, old European Hotel with very well appointed furnishings, superb water taxi service and well connected with outstanding Tour Guide.  We were delighted by our choice and commend Marriott's Autograph Collection relationship. We took advantage of the Murano tour sponsored by the Hotel. WiFi was no problem for our four devices. On revisit - we will use the nearby Public Water Taxis as well as visit the outer islands.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
