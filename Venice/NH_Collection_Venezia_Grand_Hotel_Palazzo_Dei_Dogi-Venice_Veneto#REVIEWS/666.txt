We stayed in a quiet room off Venice's largest private garden. Perfect for a destination wedding. This building has approx. 4 rooms and a Presidential Suite. We stayed in one of the 4 rooms (2 on level with the sea level). Amazingly quiet with a beautiful view. One of the breakfast staff (her name was Romina) was very, very passionate and helpful. She deserves recognition. Very helpful with English translations too.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for your kind feedback.
