The staff, the food, the rooms, the location--loved everything.  But in a city where there is almost no greenery, to find that this hotel had a huge garden, complete with little paths and a secret underground chapel--it was the best!  The food is very expensive.  I would say not worth it--other places were as good or better for less.  But we enjoyed it despite the price.  (For example--one pot of coffee to our room was 13 euros!)  Great experience overall!Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
