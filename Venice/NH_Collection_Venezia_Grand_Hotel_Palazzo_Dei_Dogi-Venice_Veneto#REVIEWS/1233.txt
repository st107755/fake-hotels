We stayed two nights and loved this hotel.  The location is off the grand canal, located in a quieter section of town.  The gardens are beautiful, the staff attentive, and the rooms we comfortable and very clean.  I loved opening my windows to look down at the canal outside our room.  A great location away from the touristy areas, but a quick walk to lots of great restaurants, water bus stop, and many interesting shops.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
