The hotel photos show a grand sparkling hotel, but in reality it’s an old dirty hotel in need of renovation.  As a platinum elite member I booked two rooms and there was no upgrade, instead we were given too small old rooms when there are much nicer floors at the top.  The bathroom was uncomfortable and the furniture and decor was not worthy of Marriott.  The breakfast is ok but there is a serious pigeon problem that makes it less than enjoyable.  Not the worst but there has to be better options.

We daily try to reach the guest expectation and make memorable all the stay but in this case we clearly didn’t meet your expectations and we, as hoteliers, are naturally very disappointed  that you didn´t leave with the memories that you wanted. We are currently doing renovation but of course we must keep the essence of this place and the Venetian style.  Regarding the hotel cleanliness our expert and professional housekeeping team is working every day hard to keep luxury standard, also we always try the best to upgrade our Ambassador, Titanium, Platinum and Gold Member but during the high season when the hotel is fully book is not always possible. We are glad that you enjoyed the breakfast in our Secret Garden that is one of the most ancient and fascinating garden in Venice.  We would like to thank you again for your feedback and we hope that, whenever you will decide to come back to our property in occasion of your next visit in Venice, we will have the chance to show you our improvements here at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.  I remain at your full disposal for any further assistance.  Andrea Sampietro Front Office Manager Grand Hotel Dei DogiRead more
