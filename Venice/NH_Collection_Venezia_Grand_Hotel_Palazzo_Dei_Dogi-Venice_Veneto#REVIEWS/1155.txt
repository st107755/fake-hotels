Very spacious corner room overlooking the canal.  This hotel was the former French embassy when Venice was a state and it is very quaint and charming.  The hotel garden is fabulous and beautifully kept (several acres, a rarity in Venice.)  The hotel is near the lagoon and a short walking to the busy part of Venice.  It is very quiet and secluded.  The buffet is excellent for breakfast and the prepared food is very good, too.  The staff is terrific.  A nice feature is that the hotel has its own boat and takes people to the different islands on request.  That was fun!Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
