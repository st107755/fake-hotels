This hotel is fine but certainly isn't 5* standard, more mid range 4* at best.  The building is stunning but the decor is quite tired (carpet in our room was very worn and there were a lot of scuffs on the walls) and the bathrooms were dated.  Also staff weren't particularly helpful or friendly but then again I have rarely experienced good customer service in Italy which is a shame as it is such a beautiful destination.  I wouldn't stay here again but not because its that bad but because there are much better places for the same money.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
