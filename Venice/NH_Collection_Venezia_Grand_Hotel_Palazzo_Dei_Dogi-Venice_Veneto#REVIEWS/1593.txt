Stayed at the Dei Dogi for four nights in mid August. It was an oasis of calm after the bustle of the city. Total luxury, from the stunning public rooms to the huge de luxe bedroom with drapes and real venetian touches. A short walk to good restaurants and the vaporetto stop only two minutes stroll away. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit. The only complaint is why, at 5* prices, do they not even give complementary coffee in the morning when staying on a room only basis. A real gem in a quiet but accessible area. Read moreHelpfulShare
