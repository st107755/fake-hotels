First of all accept please our apologize for any inconvenience you might have experienced during your stay.   We completely understand your point of view but we tried to make our best during your stay regarding the issue in your room. As a boutique hotel, our property is located on a Palace from the 17th century. For these reason we have a central air conditioning system that  according to the venetian law must be turned off during certain times of the year (like October). Our hotel has different type of rooms in different location like the mezzanine floor or the rooms on the garden were you can have the unique view of the lagoon.  We made a great use of all your comments to ensure that our staff members had done all the appropriate trainings again in order to refresh and better assist all our guests.   We hope to have the opportunity to apologize once more at you next visit in Venice. Best Regards  Martina Malusa Front Office Manager AssistantRead more
