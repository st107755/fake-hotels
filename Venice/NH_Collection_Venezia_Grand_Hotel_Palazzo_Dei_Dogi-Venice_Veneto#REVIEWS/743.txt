Just got back from 3 nights at this hotel. From start to finish this hotel was perfect. The room, the staff, the ambience, the food, the garden and the location. Faultless. We will definitely be back!  It is also only a 30 minute walk to St Mark's square and 15 minutes walk to the Rialto.  We walked an average of 7 miles each day exploring the alleyways of Venice and then slept like logs each night.Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
