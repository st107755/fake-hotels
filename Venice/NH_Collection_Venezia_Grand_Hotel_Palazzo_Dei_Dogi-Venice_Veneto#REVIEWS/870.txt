We visited a couple of weeks ago.  We enjoyed the experience of walking to San Marco and elsewhere as we explored Venice in a way not available to those who stay near San Marco.  Ivan, the concierge, and Maurizio at the front desk, were excellent at providing guidance to sites was wished to visit and with restaurants and transportation.  The breakfasts were the best on our trip; plenty of choices!  We stayed in Room 139 which overlooked the lagoon.  It was a long walk through a beautiful garden, but it was quintessential Venice.  There are nearby neighborhood restaurants, and more tourist oriented restaurants closer to San Marco.  We highly recommend the Boscolo, and encourage guests to try the nearby restaurants.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 18, 2015Dear Guest, We are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia!.
