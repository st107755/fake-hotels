This is a lovely hidden gem, far from the madding crowd.  Since Venice is so zoo-like nearer to St. Mark's square, this is one of the best qualities. The rooms were nice, although a little dark.  the service is nice, and there is a stunning garden in the back. I would definitely stay here again if I had another trip planned.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 28, 2017Dear Vikingdragon, We feel deeply thankful for your positive review and the fact that you have chosen our Boscolo Venezia for your stay in Venice.
