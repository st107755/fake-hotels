The hotel is far from St Mark's square but Venice is not that big and it forces you to explore the more distant parts of Venice.  The hotel is an old mansion with garden that used to be an ambassador's residence.  The rooms are large, stately, and clean in a quiet part of Venice. Some views of the water facing north and public water taxi is available not far from the hotel. Given the alternatives and the price, therewas great value in staying here.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
