This was our first visit to Venice.  It was the embarkation point of our 14 day cruise.  Had no idea how we would get from the hotel to the dock.  Just a little nervous, but willing to try a hotel in a quieter part of Venice.  It paid off!!  Beautiful hotel, lovely staff, wonderful grounds.  Would go back again and again.  Our breakfast, though pricey, was worth the cost.  Champagne, fresh juices, good coffee, pastries, cheeses, omelets.  The rooms and lobby area were so beautiful.  We spent the morning in the garden and watching the boats on Canale dell Navi.  Lovely sights all around us. Walked all the way to Rialto Bridge.  Hotel boat will take you to St. Mark's Square from where you can take the Vaporetto to the last stop- Plaza Roma, I think.
