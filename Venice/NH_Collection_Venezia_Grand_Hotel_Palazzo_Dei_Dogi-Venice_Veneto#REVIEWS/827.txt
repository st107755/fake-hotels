Beautiful hotel. We loved the location which was away from all the tourist areas. Rooms were clean and staff was helpful. We felt the food was better in our area cheaper and more authentic. They give boat rides to the glass factory but we felt it was a bit of a waste of time and a tourist trap. Overall we would absolutely go back and stay here again. Only gave 4 stars because of an air conditioning issue in our room. Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
