Located just a few minutes walk from the Orto stop, this hotel is in a very quiet area (away from the tourist hot spots). While getting a water taxi or taking the water bus is quite easy, you can also walk from this hotel to anywhere in Venice. The concierge is VERY helpful, and the staff in the hotel restaurant provide a great dining experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
