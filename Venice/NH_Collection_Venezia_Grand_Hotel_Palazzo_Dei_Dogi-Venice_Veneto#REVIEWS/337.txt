We are long-time Marriott Gold members so chose this hotel for our Venice adventure. It is out of the tourist throngs in a residential area, yet not that far from the train station. The location is important because it is a very quiet retreat from the crowds. There is a free water taxi shuttle to Marco  and back all day and that is important too. Also a free ride to Murano Island for a glass factory tour - worthwhile! It is very classy in the Italian version of luxury - so don't expect a to apply American design standards, for example. The service was excellent. I would give it a slight downgrade for the breakfast quality and service - could have been better, but good enough. Highly recommended!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 9, 2017Dear longtimeresident, thank you very much for your kind review about your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
