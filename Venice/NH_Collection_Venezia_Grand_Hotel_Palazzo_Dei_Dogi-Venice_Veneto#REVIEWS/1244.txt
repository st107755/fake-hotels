My family and I spent 2 wonderful nights here.  The staff was so helpful and accommodating, assisting us with questions, travel arrangement issues, etc.  Our three rooms were absolutely beautiful and well maintained.  We enjoyed the gardens and the fragrant flowers that fills it.  We would definitely recommend this to anyone and look forward to coming back again sometime!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
