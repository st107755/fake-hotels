It was great.  I must say that the first night we were checked into a very small room with a view of the dumpster which if we were stuck in there I'd give the hotel a 3 or less.  Upon complaint, they moved us to a much bigger room with a great view of Venetian rooftops which was fabulous.  The common areas are gorgeous. Restaurant is great and garden area is stunning and one of a kind. Also very big!  Shuttle to St. Marks is great and one time we had it just the two of us which was awesome. It is a long walk from the main tourist stuff but that is OK because you get to see more of the real Venice.  Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 3, 2017Dear guest, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
