I stayed for one night prior to a cruise departure. This hotel has beautiful grounds and classic Venetian decor. The standard rooms are small, but standard for Venice. The free breakfast was wonderful and included continental treats, as well as typical American style fare. The outdoor restaurant is lovely and backs up to the garden, which merits a stroll through. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is in Cannaregio, which more residential and a bit of a walk to St. Markâ€™s Square. The only reason for 4/5 is that the standard room was a little worn.
