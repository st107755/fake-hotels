We stayed in the junior suite with a view over the Canal (not the Grande Canal). The room was absolutely majestic. The room captured the overall feel of Venice perfectly. Laden with history in a very silent quarter (read; not boring!) of Venice. The bed was absolute heaven of gigantic proportions. I can heartily recommend this room and Hotel. It is not cheap but absolutely worth it.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 6, 2016Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for choosing Boscolo Venezia and for your kind review.
