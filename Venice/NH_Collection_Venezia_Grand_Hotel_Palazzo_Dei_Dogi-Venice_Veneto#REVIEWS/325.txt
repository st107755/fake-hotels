We loved this hotel!   We enjoyed the location being away from the center of the tourists.  It was a delightful 20 min walk to San Marco square through all the quaint streets, alleys and bridges.   Our room was lovely with a water view.  The gardens, with many places to sit and relax, are beautiful.   The staff is what makes this property outstanding.  Claudio welcomed us and extended his hospitality helping us make plans and get to our next destination.  Ivan, concierge, helped us with a perfect day in Murano and Burano.  We canâ€™t wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 27, 2017Dear cmacc2017, thank you for choosing Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
