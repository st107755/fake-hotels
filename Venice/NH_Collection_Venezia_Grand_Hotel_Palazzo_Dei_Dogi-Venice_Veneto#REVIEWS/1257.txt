   Wonderful friendly service from check-in, food service, room service, maid service and concierge.  Benedetto, Ivan and others at the hospitality desk made our six day stay enjoyable and helped us avoid a lot of the mistakes and stress associated with foreign travel.  The hotel lobby was beautiful and comfortable.  Our room was quiet and well appointed and the shower was terrific.  The breakfast was fresh, varied and the service exceptional.
