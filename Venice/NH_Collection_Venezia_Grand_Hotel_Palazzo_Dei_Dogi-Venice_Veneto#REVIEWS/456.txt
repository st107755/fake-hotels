A sure delight The hotel is excellent. Great location,wonderful breakfast and very helpful courteous staff. It is easy to get to the central areas walking. They offer transportation to and from San Marco although we did not use it as well as to Murano which was very nice. I would strongly recommend the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 3, 2017Dear RatnaD_12, let us thank you for taking the time to post your review in this forum.
