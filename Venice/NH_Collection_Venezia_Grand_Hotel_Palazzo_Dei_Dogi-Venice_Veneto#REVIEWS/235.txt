WOW!! This hotel is breathtaking.  The grounds are charming, similar to a secret garden.  The rooms have amazing wooden beams, and the windows were gorgeous and ornate. We especially loved the large, deep tub!  The lobby is very eye catching, with chandeliers from Murano ‚ù§Ô∏è We took advantage of the free boat shuttle to Murano and to San Marco! Great location, we even walked to San Marco and back from the hotel one day.  I would recommend anyone to stay here as it was the perfect end to our Italy trip üáÆüáπ They took great care of us!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 23, 2018Dear Tara B, Let us thank you for taking the time to post your review in this forum.
