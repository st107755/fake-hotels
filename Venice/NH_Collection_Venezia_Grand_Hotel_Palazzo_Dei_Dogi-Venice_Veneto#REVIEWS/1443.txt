This palace was amazing!!  The service was incredible. The room was perfect. It was the largest bathroom I have ever seen in a European hotel. The location was off the beaten path which was nice in such a crowded city. It was still an easy walk or water bus to everything. The morning breakfast was delicious. I would highly recommend this hotel for any trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
