Absolutely beautiful hotel, with 2 Murano glass chandeliers in the lobby. Stepping outside the front of the hotel is a quaint and quintessential Venetian canal. This is the quieter part of Venice...not near the San Marco square area where most of the tourists are, therefore, the local restaurants are where the locals eat.  The Boscolo has a beautiful garden and rear of hotel overlooks the lagoon, where you can get a water taxi or nearby is the boat to the airport.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
