Excellent hotel with lots of veritable pieces of art, located north of Venice.

Take a fast boat from the airport (quite pricey for Venice)  and reach the hotel in 20min.  The hotel has its own gardens (was a french embassy some 200 years ago, the only negative thing, our room was located in front of the building, so the hotel's boat would wake us up in the morning.  Otherwise, great hotel and they had lots of small things thrown in for us. Read moreDate of stay: March 2007HelpfulShare
