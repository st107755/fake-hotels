Excellent quiet location near restaurants.   Spacious, clean, air conditioned room. Comfortable bed, marble bathroom with luxe toiletries. The room only lacked artwork, not a single piece in the room. View of rooftops.   Excellent staff throughout, very good breakfast included and gorgeous terrace to dine on, while looking at a large beautiful well treed garden.   Bonus: free hotel water-shuttle to St Marcâ€™s and to Murano. Read moreDate of stay: July 20198 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
