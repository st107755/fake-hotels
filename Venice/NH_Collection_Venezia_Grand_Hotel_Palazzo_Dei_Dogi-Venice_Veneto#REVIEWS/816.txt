We recently stayed there we our 2 kids ages 12 and 8 during our first trip to Venice. Unfortunately it was only for 1 night since we were catching a cruise right after. First, the hotel has an excellent location. Once you take the vapporeto (orange line) you are only a block or two blocks away from the hotel entrance making it super convenient since it's very easy to get lost in Venice. This was to us the first highlight of this hotel stay. The second highlight was the actual hotel. It has beautiful gardens. Our room had 2 floors with a great private enclosed terrace and only two steps away from the canal. Great room, ask for it if possible. Room size was good and appearance and cleanness was excellent. I wish I would had more time to enjoy the private terrace and hotel gardens.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
