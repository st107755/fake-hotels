We have been to venice a few times now, this hotel is a must its in a quiet area with nearby great restaurants or near enough to walk to St Marks square. beautiful rooms, great staff who cant do enough for you, if you want 5* luxury you must visit, beautiful garden leading on to the lagoon, just beautiful, you wont be disappointed trust me. Many thanks Christine & Terry (England) See you again next year .Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
