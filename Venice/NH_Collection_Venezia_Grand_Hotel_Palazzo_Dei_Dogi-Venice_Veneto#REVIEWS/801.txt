My husband and I chose this hotel after staying at the JW Marriott in Venice. Traditionally Venetian with the most beautiful garden on the property. Service is excellent and make sure to visit Maria in the luxury spa. Best massage I have ever experienced.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
