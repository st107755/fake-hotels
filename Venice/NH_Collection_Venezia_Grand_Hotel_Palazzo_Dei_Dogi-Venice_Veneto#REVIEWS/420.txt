Hi, This hotel is off the tourist areas and quiet but conveniently located to the Grand Canal and walking to key areas.  The hotel is in a peaceful setting and has nice rooms. I had a fantastic facial and mani and pedi at the Spa. Elizabette who runs the spa is excellent and makes you feel at home. Several of the employees stand out for great service, warm smile and making you feel at home, especially Luigi, Pablo and Erika. Definitely recommend this hotel for your entire stay in Venice.
