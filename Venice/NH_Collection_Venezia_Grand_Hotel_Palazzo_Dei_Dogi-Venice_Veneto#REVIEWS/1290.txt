My wife and I only stayed in Venice one night and chose this hotel due to its high ratings and reasonable rate when compared to others in the area with similar ratings.  I'm so glad we chose this hotel, very classy and really quite. My only complaint would be that it was a tad warm and when we tried to turn the AC down, I don't think it worked but it wasn't a big issue due to the nice windows that we could open for fresh air :) it was everything we would have expected for a romantic weekend in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare
