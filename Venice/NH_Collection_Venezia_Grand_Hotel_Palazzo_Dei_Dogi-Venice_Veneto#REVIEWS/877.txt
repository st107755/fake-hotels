There's a number of ways in which you judge a hotel even if it is only subconsciously; Location: 4/5 with easy access to airport, trains, piazza San Marco but quiet. Reception Staff: 4/5 very polished very friendly very helpful Room size: 2/5 but after 35 days in an MSC cruise cabin I don't know what I was expecting. Room Amenity: 5/5 brilliant wifi and in room safe. Bathroom: 2/5 tiny no bench space and the shower pathetic size tap location changing water temp. Concierge: 4/5 but don't take the free tour to Murano glass. Walk to the Foudanete Nuove pier and take No. 12 ferry bus it'll save you heaps as the glass on streets is far cheaper than where they take you. Nice place but not 5 star.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 20, 2015Thank you for your valued feedback.
