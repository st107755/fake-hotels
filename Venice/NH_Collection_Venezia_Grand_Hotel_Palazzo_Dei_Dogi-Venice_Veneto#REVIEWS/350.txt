The Boscolo is away form the crowds of Venice with a beautiful garden (the only green space you will find in Venice).  It is an old mansion facing both the canal and the lagoon. Their beautiful boat will take you to St. Mark's Square or to Murano. The bar was a great place to relax and meet other travelers. The concierge, Ivan, was wonderful!  Very knowledgable and helpful and spoke prefect English. Only complaint is the internet --- very slow and not dependable.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 15, 2017Dear SteelerPSUfan, thank you for you kind feedback.
