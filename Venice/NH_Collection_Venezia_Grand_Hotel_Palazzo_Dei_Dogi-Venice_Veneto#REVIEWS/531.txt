We stayed at this hotel for 3 days in early November and could not have asked for better service.    The hotel's location was convenient to get to and from the airport.   We liked that it was in a quiet location but easy for us to walk evey where we needed to go.   We took advantage of the hotels shuttle to st. Marks on one day since it was raining.  It was convenient to have this option available for guests.   The front desk was extremely helpful with all of our requests regarding things to do and how to get around Venice.  The beds in the hotel are very firm but this is a matter of personal preference.   I would definetly stay at this hotel again,Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 30, 2016Dear Julie F, Thank you for your kind feedback regarding your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
