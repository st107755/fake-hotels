Simply - one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. The rooms were very good, but it was the overall setting both the front facing a small canal and the gardens and patio in the back that made this outstanding. Wish we could have stayed longer.   Stay here if you want to be a bit off the beaten path and the busyness of the Grand Canal. But, it's only a 10 minute walk to the main waterway. All the sights and little back streets and canals in getting there were some of our favorite things about Venice.
