This Palace hotel is an outstanding example of old Venice architecture and beauty. Superb staffing lends to an exceptional experience. Wonderful rare large garden grounds for a stroll or quiet sitting. Tall grand ceilings and staircases leading to fabulous rooms and private baths. Buffet of traditional Italian food, pastry, coffee is wildly vast and wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
