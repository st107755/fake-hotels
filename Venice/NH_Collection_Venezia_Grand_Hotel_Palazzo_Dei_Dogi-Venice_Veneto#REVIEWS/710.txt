Lovely hotel. Impressive foyer and our room looked out onto the canal that runs past. Easy waterbus journey from the airport. Loved the neighbourhood which was quiet but with some great little bars and restaurants and with the Rialto only 15 mins walk away. Perfect and you felt you were seeing the real Venice. Point off for minibar prices which are irritatingly high.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare
