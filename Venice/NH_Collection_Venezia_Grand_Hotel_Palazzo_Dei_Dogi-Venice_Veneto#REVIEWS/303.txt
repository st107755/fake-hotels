Every comments, positive or negative, is important for us to understand our strength and our weakness. We are particularly glad when guests have been satisfied in their expectations, but we need to know as well different point of view to professionally grow up and improve. We would like to apologize for any inconvenience you might have experienced during your stay at Boscolo Venezia. We are sorry to understand that you did not get the chance to visit our Spa. During the period of you stay it has been closed for sudden maintenance works that we could not postpone. Please allow us to apologize for the inconvenience experienced with our shuttle transportation. It is sad for us to read that the sign board that is placed close to San Marco's Square was not clear enough to identify the departure point from which our shuttle transportation departs. However, this kind of notification was rarely brought to us in the past and our guests find the boat with much ease. Please be confident that a further verification will be processed on the details reported on our schedule at San Marco's pier in order for the our precious guests to never incur in such difficulties and enjoy this comfortable and complimentary service.  At this point I hope that regardless all of the above your overall memories of the stay in our hotel are pleasant and I hope to see you back in the future.   Best Regards,    Chiara Zambianchi Vice Director  Read more
