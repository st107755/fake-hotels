This hotel is in a wonderfully quiet suburb alongside a canal. As we were staying for a week our room was upgraded to a canal view. It was absolutely lovely staying there. The staff were so helpful, particularly the two ladies who oversaw breakfast.  The hotel offered a complimentary trip to the Murano glass factory and a shuttle boat to S. Marco square. We mostly walked into the centre but always had the shuttle as back up.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 9, 2018Dear Mr. , I am so happy your visit to Venice was such a success and that you so much enjoyed your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
