I spent three days at this hotel with my older parents. They could not have been more accommodating and helpful with all of our various asks, including arranging for special transportation to the airport. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave fantastic recommendations and insight into Venice. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room was huge and very comfortable. Also the garden was a welcome oasis during the heatwave. I would definitely stay here again without question. It's in a quieter location, but the shuttle to San Marco made it very convenient for touring.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 10, 2018Dear Ibmack476, Thank you for you kind feedback.
