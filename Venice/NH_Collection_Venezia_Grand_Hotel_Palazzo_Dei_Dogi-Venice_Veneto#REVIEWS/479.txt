This is a rather belated review, but the delay bears no reflection on our experience at Boscolo, which was simply wonderful. Apart from the stunning and sumptuous hotel grounds as well as our room, what made our stay memorable were the warm and extremely friendly staff members who were helpful and accommodating around the clock. The hotel is located in a beautiful, relatively quiet and central part of Cannaregio, with several restaurants and bars at a few minutes' stroll.  We would love to come back here!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 30, 2017Dear amber86, We are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia!
