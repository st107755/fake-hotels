Just returned from a two night stay.  Had a special $210 night rate with breakfast.  Lovely room and bath ... view of the quiet canal.  Breakfast was extensive and plenty to get you well past lunch.  The coffee happened to be the best that I had in Rome, Florence anywhere .... yum!  Located close to the vaporetto stop, or right on the canal if you can afford the taxi (60 euro ouch).    Location was out of the way, but Venice really isn't that big.  You could walk to San Marco in less than 10 minutes, but getting lost is the fun of Venice.  As with any town, go there with a good map. Read moreDate of stay: July 2004HelpfulShare
