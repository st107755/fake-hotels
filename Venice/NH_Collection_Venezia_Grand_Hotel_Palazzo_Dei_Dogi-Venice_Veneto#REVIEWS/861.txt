This hotel is situated in a neighborhood away from the tourist crowds, and that is one of its most important assets.  It is one of the Marriott affiliated hotels, and the service, cleanliness, etc. are all up to Marriott standards.  The public rooms of the hotel are fabulous.  The rooms themselves are luxuriously appointed and well kept.  We had some problems, but the staff was very helpful and took care of the problems.  Breakfast was very good.  Overall, the hotel is pricey (but everything else in Venice is) but well worth it.  Venice itself came as a pleasant surprise, though it was already swamped by tourists--and we were there in early May!Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
