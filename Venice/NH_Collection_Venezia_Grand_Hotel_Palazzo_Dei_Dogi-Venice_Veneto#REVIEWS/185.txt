The hotel is in a great location facing out to the lagoon on one side and a quiet canal on the other with fabulous garden in between.  We travelled from Verona to Venice by train, and were quoted about 100 euro for a water taxi to the hotel from the station, so decided to brave the 20 min walk, which was actually not too difficult even pulling our luggage (2 x 20kg suitcases) on a hot day.   The footpaths are fine for wheeled luggage, though there are 4 bridges to cross which have steps so may be a challenge for those who have mobility issues.  I stay in Marriott chain hotels regularly for business but this time using reward points to pay for our holiday accommodation. I have to say the staff here were truly exceptional… possibly the best service we have ever received in a hotel…Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
