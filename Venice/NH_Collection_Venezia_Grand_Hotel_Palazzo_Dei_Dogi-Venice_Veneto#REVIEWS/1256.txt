This hotel falls well short of its 5 star rating. The staff are uninterested to the point of being rude. During our stay we were charged 3 different prices on 3 different occasion for the same drinks. On one occasion we were hit by eggs being throw by the locals. Unfortunately when we told  The staff  they were totally unconcerned. The free shuttle is free but impossible to catch twice we tried the first time we were directed to the rear of the hotel only for the launch to leave from the front. After waiting we approach the front desk only to be told they tried to contact our room?  since they had already sent us to the rear  of the hotel we were not on our room. no apology.we had arrived straight from the Marriott on Milan which is a 4 star hotel an I would highly recommendâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
