Checked into the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi in Venice Italy on July 12, 2019. One word comes to mind.  Eloquent.  The staff and hotel are exactly what I had hoped they would be welcoming and accommodating. The place is beautiful and the staff friendly.   There are views and food and wine and all that screams Italy. . The rooms are large and spacious and the AC is a welcome gift after a day in the sun.  I give all 5 stars to this hotel.  I couldnâ€™t be more pleased.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 8, 2019Dear Bfedak, We are happy to read your review and your appreciation on our team, location and service attentions.
