From the reviews I wasn't expecting this hotel to be this nice.  We had Starwood points that we wanted to use so this hotel came up.  Many average reviews but I think it deserves better.  The rooms were very nice with high ceilings.  Appointed well too.  Food was ok.  I can't give it a five mostly because of struggling AC and mosquitoes in the outside dining but it is a nice hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 11, 2017Dear kkirby916p, thank you for staying with us and thank you for your precious time spent on providing your valued feedback.
