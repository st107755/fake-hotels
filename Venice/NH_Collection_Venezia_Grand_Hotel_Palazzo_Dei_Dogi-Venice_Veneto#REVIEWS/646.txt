Flawless hotel with great service and an unbeatable location away from the crowds. I was traveling by myself and they made me very welcome.  Spacious room with Etro amenities.  Breakfast in the garden is a special treat.  The garden extends all the way to the lagoon, a lovely walk.  An easy ride via Alilaguna to and from the airport to the Madonna del'Orton stop, with no bridges or canals to cross to get to the hotel's front door.  It's also an easy walk through Cannaregio to the Rialto and St. Mark's.  Can't wait until I can go back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 27, 2016Dear valued guest, Thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for your kind feedback.
