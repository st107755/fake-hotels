My first overseas trip since Covid arrived on the scene. This hotel was fantastic. The location is perfect, way from the busy tourist areas on a lovely quiet canal, but very near an excellent canal with lots of great restaurants - where the Venetians go to party. Absolutely spot on. The hotel was lovely, the gardens are stunning, and the staff are so kind, helpful and friendly.Read moreDate of stay: July 20201 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
