The air conditioning was great, really great.  It was so hot while we were there, the AC was truly a blessing.  The garden is beautiful and the complimentary boat ride to St. Marks Square was used several times.  We slept well and awoke to a lovely breakfast in the garden.  The staff was excellent and caring.  We enjoyed our stay.  Thank you.
