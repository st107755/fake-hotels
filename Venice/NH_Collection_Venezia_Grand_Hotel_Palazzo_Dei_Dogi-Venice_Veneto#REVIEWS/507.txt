The hotel is a bit off the beaten path from all of the hustle bustle of Venice, but yet not too far (about 10 min walk to main street or can take the water taxis). Our room was very well maintained, clean and comfortable.  The staff was exceptional as was the daily breakfast.   There is a complimentary water taxi every hour or so -- which really is necessary given that it's about a 30 min walk to the St Marks area.  We walked some time and took the taxi other times.   I would stay here again.  You really feel like you're in a different world without the cars!Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 19, 2017Dear yonnac, Thank you for your valued feedback about your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
