Stayed from Aug 18th to Aug 20th and it was beautiful, from the breakfast buffet to the rooms. Flying in after a long flight and plopping down on the comfy bed was amazing, and the not so touristy location made it better. Will be back for sure one day.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 21, 2018Dear Stuart G, Thank you for your kind feedback.
