We stayed at the Boscolo hotel, with my family of four.  The property is beautiful and quiet.  The rooms were very nice.  The breakfast offered was very tasty. The only negative is the staff; they seemed very indifferent, unwelcoming.  I asked about a fitness center and they look at me like I was crazy. I tried to use a Marriot e-certificate for one of my rooms and was told I couldn't because the hotel was privately owned and the owner didn't accept these certificates.  Another example is the last few minutes of our stay; upon our check out; we waited in the lobby for a few minutes, my family, hotel manager and front desk assistant only ones in the lobby - when we got up to leave, they made no acknowledgement of us – a simple “good bye or safe travels” would have been nice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 23, 2014Dear Guest,   We would like to take a moment and thank you for sharing your comments with us as this is the only way to evaluate our service and improve it when needed.
