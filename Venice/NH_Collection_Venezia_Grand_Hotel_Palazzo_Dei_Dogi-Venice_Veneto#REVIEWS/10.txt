Located in Cannaregio district this lovely boutique hotel has itâ€™s own beautiful garden  and pier so there is no any hassle with the luggage- you may arrive on water taxi from the airport or use the orange line public boats (though will need to walk some 300 m then).  The main attractions are in walkable distance (20 min walk to San Marco) although good navigation skills / app is required.  Staff is very friendly and efficient, good breakfast, clean and spacious rooms thought a bit shabby.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 24, 2020Dear VadAnik, We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Venice.
