We stayed at Dei Dogi for 3 nights. It's a lovely hotel, conveniently located within walking distance from the city's main attractions but away from the hustle and bustle of the rousit crowds. The only problem we had was the air conditioning. It was too noisy and we had to turn it off at night in order to be able to sleep. Other than that we were generally very pleased with the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
