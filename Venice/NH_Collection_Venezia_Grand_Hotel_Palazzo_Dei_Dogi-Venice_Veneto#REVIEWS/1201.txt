Situated in an quaint part of Venice, with a shuttle to the madness of St Mark's (also walkable) Our stay there was spectacular! The complimentary breakfast was the best we had throughout our entire trip!  The service, in general, was top notch. Concierge's restaurant suggestions were spot on, places we would never have discovered without his help. Walking distance to some amazing sites and trattorias and bars.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
