This is a charming traditional hotel located in a quiet corner of Venice.  The staff and service was excellent as was the food.  What the rooms lacked in size, they made up in charm.  The staff made several excellent restaurant recommendations and dinner at the hotel was wonderful as well.  While the neighborhood is quiet, it is convenient to the train station and there is a vaporetto (water bus) station behind the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
