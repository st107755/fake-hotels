My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights during a trip for New Years Eve.  The hotel is nice with friendly staff but be prepared to walk quite a lot as the main attractions are a good 20-30 minute walk away.  For the price I expected better rooms, the photos on the hotel website make the rooms look far bigger than they actually are.  We didn’t eat in the restaurant so can’t comment on the food.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Dec 9, 2015Dear Guest, thank you very much for your feedback.  First of all we would like to apologize if we didn’t meet your expectations. As part of the Autograph Collection, our boutique hotel is set on a Palace from the 17th century, we have five different rooms categories that varied accordingly to the size of it.   We wish our hotel could be the perfect choice for everyone but we know that many travellers have different needs and preferences. Usually our guest chose our hotel because they want to enjoy the city and relax in a quite zone after spending the day in the crowd of the most famous spots.  Please accept our apologies once again and It would be our honor to welcome you back and provide you an excellent hotel experience.  Martina Malusa Front Office Manager AssistantRead more
