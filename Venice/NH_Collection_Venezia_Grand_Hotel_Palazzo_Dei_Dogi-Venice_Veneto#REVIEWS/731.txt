Every comments, positive or negative, is important for us to understand our strength and our weakness.   We regret to hear that you didn't enjoy the quality of food of our Restaurant. Our menus are created and approved by a young Italian Michelin starred Chef and we pride ourselves of his gourmet creations.  The Hotel is located in a quiet residential area, away from the most busy and crowded zone.  We are sorry to understand that you were not satisfied with the service provided in the city by the taxi companies. They usually accept payment only by cash because they haven't any credit card machine in the boats.  Our goal is to address your concerns so that we can ensure you have an exceptional experience on your next visit.  Kind Regards  Chiara Zambianchi Vice Director Read more
