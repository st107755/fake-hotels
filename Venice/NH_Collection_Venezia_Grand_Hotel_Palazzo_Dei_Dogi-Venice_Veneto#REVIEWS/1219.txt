We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our honeymoon. Beautiful property with really cool gardens and art everywhere. Conveniently located close to the airport (it is the first stop on the public transport from VCE), and they have a shuttle that takes you to and from Saint Mark's Square. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
