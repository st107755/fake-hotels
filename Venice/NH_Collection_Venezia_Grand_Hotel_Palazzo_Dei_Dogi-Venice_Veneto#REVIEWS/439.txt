Hotel is fantastic, venetian marble and chandeliers throughout, an old palace, Situated in the "real" Venice area and ideal for walking into the heart of Venice through cobbled streets and over canal bridges - a slow 15/20 minute walk, but absolutely worth it as you pass some amazing sites, and authentic Italian bars and restaurants.  The hotel staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are very individual and totally in the style of authentic Venice.  Our second stay there and we will be back again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2017Dear stuartgreenough1, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
