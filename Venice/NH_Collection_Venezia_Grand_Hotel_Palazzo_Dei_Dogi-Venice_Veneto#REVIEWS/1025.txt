This hotel is not in the center of all of the activity but that is part of its charm. It is only a  nice 10-15 minute walk from St. Mark's Square and it gave us a chance to walk through other areas of Venice.  The public transportation bus dropped us off very close to the hotel (literally a 3 minute walk) and it was a 15 minute walk to the train station. The staff was very, very helpful. There is a beautiful garden behind the hotel (the only grass we saw in Venice) that leads to a nice little private pier.  The perfect place to enjoy a nice bottle of wine in the evening.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
