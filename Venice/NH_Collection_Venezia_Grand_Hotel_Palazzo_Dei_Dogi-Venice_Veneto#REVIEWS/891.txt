Was a little concerned about the location, but it turned out to be a real benefit. The hotel is on a canal and provides free, private water taxi to San Marco and Murrano. The private water taxi experience alone is just so Venice. Given that a private ride in a water taxi starts at 70E it's a real luxury to use one every day and avoid the crowded water buses, which will also set you back 6E each.  The room was great, spacious with a view of the canal. Comfortable bed, great sheets.  The service was spotty, some great, some indifferent.  Was surprised breakfast was not included, but given the great price, should not be surprised. Not about to pay the 25E each the manager cheerfully suggested :)  There were great bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare
