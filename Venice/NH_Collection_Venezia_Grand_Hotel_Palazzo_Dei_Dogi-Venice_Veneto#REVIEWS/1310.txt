Stayed here the summer of 2012.  Fabulous property.  Incredible suites with very high classic venetian ceilings.  Located in the Rialto part of the city a 10 minute walk to Piazza San Marco.  Great breakfast and very committed staff.  We requested rooms close to one another for our kids and they upgraded them to a suite right next door.  They have a boat docked in front of the hotel that runs to Piazza San Marco every 30 minutes.  Don't miss the ride it's an incredible experience!  No gym, but I enjoyed jogging around Venice every morning and smelling the fresh pastries.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
