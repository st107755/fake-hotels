I travel many times a year for business acquiring hotel points so, I decided to cash some in for this breath taking property.  We booked it about a month out...the water taxi dropped us off behind the property at a public dock for about 15Eur each.  When you enter the lobby you are greated by the most friendly desk clerks, they could'nt be more helpful!  We had the bellman walk us to our court yard suite...the room was huge. The hotel and its courtyard is so beautifully lit up at night...enjoy a evening walk thru the lighted paths.  Breakfast was AMAZING !!! Don't forget to ask for some champaignRead moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
