Awesome hotel, amazing service, beautifully decorated, convenient (albeit in a residential neighborhood) with good restaurants, transit  (Orto) & groceries (Billa store) nearby. And it is still only a 20-30 min walk to anything (get a good map, as easy to get lost in Venice, but getting lost in Venice is part of its charm). The hotel also offers regular boat service to/from San Marco & a daily trip to the Moreno glass factory. BTW - as much as a gondola ride is a clich√©, do it, as the experience is worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
