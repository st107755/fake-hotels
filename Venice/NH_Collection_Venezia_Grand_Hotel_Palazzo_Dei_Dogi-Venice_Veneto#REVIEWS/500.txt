We were welcomed with a warm smile and excellent friendly attitude.  The room very spacious and dust free. We enjoyed the complimentary welcome sweets delivered to the room freshly baked.  The toiletry was perfect beautiful aromatic soap bar for washing the face. Clean towels. Breakfast area small but very warm and homely. Prefect water flow in the toilet. Complementary taxi to the nearby island.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 10, 2017Dear Ameena S, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
