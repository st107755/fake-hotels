Quaint hotel with an excellent breakfast buffet.  The birds where a little aggressive but the hotel is in such a lovely setting.

You even walk back to the hotel if need be.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 20, 2017Dear Sob29, thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Boscolo Venezia.
