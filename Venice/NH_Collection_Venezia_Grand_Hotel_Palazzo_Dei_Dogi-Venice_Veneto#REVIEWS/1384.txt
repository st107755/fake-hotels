Just arrived home from 5 nights at this 5 star hotel far away from the hoards of tourists in Venice. We took advantage of the hotels own boat to downtown Venice and the public transportation back to the hotel. Worked out beautifully with no problem. The hotel's wireless had a few glitches and the mosquitos were only minor inconveniences. We do wish the breakfast had options other than the full buffet so we did end up going a few blocks (3 bridges as we learned to say) to the main street and enjoyed eating breakfast among the locals. It was really great. The staff is exceptional and the facility is nothing but first class. Their recommendations for dinner within a very short distance from the hotel were all excellent and all were substantiated by other travel reviews in thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
