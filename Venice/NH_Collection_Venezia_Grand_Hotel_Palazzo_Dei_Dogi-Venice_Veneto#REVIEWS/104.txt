Location, facilities, d√©cor and food are all excellent, but what makes this place special is the staff, and especially Ivan the concierge,  Ivan took the time to get to know us and what we were looking for.  He recommended restaurants in all price ranges and made reservations for us.  Finding out I already had a reservation for a special 40th Anniversary dinner at Bistrot de Venise, he called them and arranged a special corner table in their most romantic room, and made sure they treated us royally.  Nothing was too much trouble for Ivan.  He even followed up every day to make sure things were perfect for us.  Couldn't ask for more.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
