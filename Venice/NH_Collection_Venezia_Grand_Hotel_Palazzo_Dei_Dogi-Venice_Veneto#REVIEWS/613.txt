My husband and I stayed here for a pre-cruise vacation.  The hotel is stunning and the staff was absoulely fantastic.  We were celebrating our 25th anniversary and were upgraded to a room facing the canal for the 3 days before our cruise.  Room service was great as well as the breakfast served downstairs in the dining area.  On our last night we had dinner in the gardens which was spectacular and the service was impeccable. They offer a water taxi to San Marco where you can spend the days seeing the sites or just to shop.  During your stay spend times in the garden as it is so serene and peaceful. I cannot say enough about this hotel but wished we could have stayed longer.  Would absolutely stay at this hotel!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 13, 2016Dear Mrs. Bridget, Thank you for your stay with us at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection, we truly appreciate you shared your special occasion with us and that you enjoyed the upgrade to a canal view.
