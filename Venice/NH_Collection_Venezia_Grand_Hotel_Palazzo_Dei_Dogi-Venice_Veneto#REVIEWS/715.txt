We recently stayed at the "Boscolo" hotel in Venice.  The hotel was so beautiful with spectacular chandeliers and an elegant yet warm ambiance.  The staff was very friendly and helpful which is not always the case in fancier hotels.  The hotel also provides a shuttle service to St. Mark's cathedral and the island free of charge.    We would definitely recommend staying there and maybe someday we'll return for another visit!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 27, 2016Dear Fran L.,  First and foremost thank you for choosing us, hosting such wonderful guests is our pleasure, as it is receiving a review like this one.
