Stayed for two nights right at the beginning if carnival, the atmosphere was amazing. The hotel is beautiful with a lovely garden. We stayed in one of the garden rooms at the back of the property, it was amazing to be right on the lagoon. Bed was very comfortable, plenty of hot water, spacious room. I was even given a birthday cake with compliments from the manager which was a wonderful touch. The only negatives is that the heating was not very useful, early february it was very cold but the heating system isn't very effective. The breakfast and room service is also excruciatingly expensive. Otherwise our stay was perfect, and it is a great base to explore Venice from. Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare
