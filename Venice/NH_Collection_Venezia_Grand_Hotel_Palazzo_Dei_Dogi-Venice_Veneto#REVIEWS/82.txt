What a place to stay with full American breakfast. Stay in a room on2,3 or 4 th floor and check out ballrooms. Quiet area bit of a walk to St Marks, but cool water guest suites. Relax in the backyard and try for a water suite out back. Staff professional and accommodating. Love the cozy ambience and water taxi drop off. The line to water taxis was so long so we took a land taxi over bridge and then caught a water taxi to the hotel , which I recommend to do to avoid long wait at terminal.
