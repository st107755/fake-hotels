We just loved this hotel.  We were nervous, based on some reviews, but we really found the hotel excellent.  The location is way off the beaten track, so you need to like to walk.  Of course, the best part of the hotel is the free boat ride; it is excellent; and is a real treat!  You get to go up and down the canals and don't have to pay a thing!  On more than one occasion, we were actually alone on the boat (with just the captain, of course!).  The service on the boat and overall in the hotel was exceptional.  The front desk was ready to help, and the breakfast was very good.   Be sure to get the room you want; ours was okay but not perfect (no views).  The room was beautiful and clean, but I would have liked a water view.  But other than that, our stay was awesome!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
