After one night in a mediocre junior suite, changed rooms to a third floor junior suite looking towards the sea for six nights. Wonderful room, view of the gardens and sea.

The location is quiet and amazingly close to everything.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 4, 2018Dear Joseph310,  thank you very much for taking the time to post your comments on your recent stay in our Boscolo Venezia.
