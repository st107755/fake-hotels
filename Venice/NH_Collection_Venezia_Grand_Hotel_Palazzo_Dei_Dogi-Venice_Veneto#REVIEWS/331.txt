We stayed two nights at this very attractive hotel, which operated as a convent in a previous life.  Although the bedroom and bathroom were not spacious, they were adequate and well furnished.  The dining room, which was located overlooking the attractive garden, was an ideal setting for enjoying the excellent dinner provided by the hotel, and breakfast was of a better standard than those experienced at recent hotel stays. This hotel was definitely worth a visit.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 25, 2017Dear paula67Adelaide, we are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia!
