A great hotel experience in an intimate, boutique setting in one of the most beautiful cities in the world! Beautiful breakfast, finally not another boring hotel buffet! Enchanting back garden on the water, try to book one of the private suites. Out of a fairy-tale! FREE water taxi at the front door of the hotel--saves a lot of money vs. hiring water taxi to city. QUIET! Which is exactly what you want after a day of noisy, busy tourist areas. Walkable to neighborhood restaurants in the evening--you get a true sense of living in Venice. Perfect!Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 28, 2015Dear valued Customer,  I would like to thank you, on behalf of the entire Boscolo Venezia team, for reviewing your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.  We strive to offer service of the highest quality to our guests. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. Our staff is here for you at any time. I am happy to hear we were to your service and that you felt welcomed and taken care of.  The building that hosts Boscolo Venezia  is located in Palazzo Rizzo Patarol, a wonderful residence built by Patarols family in the seventeenth century. During the years the palace hosted first a monastery and  then the  Embassy of France and Savoy. It is a very historical building. As such, each of our rooms has different size and layout.  I hope to welcome you back at Boscolo Venezia, should you travels take you back to Venice in the near future.  Barbara Ghea Front Office ManagerRead more
