First class from the time of arrival until our departure. Our first visit to Venice and I would most definitely go back and would not hesitate to stay here again. The service was professional, welcoming and friendly, our room was lovely, cleaned daily and comfortable. The restaurant was first class and as a little gift the staff brought to the table a specially decorated dessert plate for our anniversary. The food was delightful and the wine list interesting and the recommendations made by the staff of the wines were stunning. The staff most definitely make this place what it is. The secret garden is also something to behold.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 30, 2018Dear Anita H, Thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi during your special occasion.
