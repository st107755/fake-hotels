I recently attempted to book a business meeting for 12 people at this hotel and found the staff to be unresponsive and out of touch with the local environment.  Their prices were more than double similarly rated hotels in Venice city.  When given the competitive information, they acknowledged that the hotel was overpriced but were not willing to consider any reduction in price or increased services.  The price gap was over 1,000 per person for a 3 day meeting!  Based on the comments on TA and my experience attempting to deal with the staff of this hotel, I would steer clear of this property.  There are too many choices in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: December 2013HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Direttore at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Dec 16, 2013Dear Client, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write about our hotel on TA. February is a very particular time of the year in our town. As you probably know, Venice Carnival is one of the most important in the world, which makes it a very high season. Our property is a boutique hotel, which means it is a unique property in a unique part of town. As I understand you are a Marriott elite member, I personally took care of your request and I am very sorry we were not able to come to an agreement. Please do not hesitate to contact me. I truly hope we can work together in a near future. Once again, thank you.  Best regards, Chiara Zambianchi Deputy General ManagerRead more
