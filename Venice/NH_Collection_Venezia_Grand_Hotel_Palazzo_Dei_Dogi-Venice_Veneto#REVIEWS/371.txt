I will preface my review by noting I am Marriott Platinum, and we chose Boscolo Venezia because I could stay using points.  This hotel is over-the-top beautiful!  From the moment you walk in the front entrance witht he Murano glass chandeliers.  We were upgraded to a larger room.  The hotel is within walking distance of all the Venice tourist attractions, as well as offers free water-taxi shuttle to/from San Marco Square.  The walk is enjoyable, as there are several small restaurants/wine bars, before getting to the crowded areas. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly, and eager to please.  I recommend staying at Boscolo Venezia. Thank you for your hospitality.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 16, 2017Dear Sandi J, we are thrilled to read such positive comments about your stay at the Boscolo Venezia!
