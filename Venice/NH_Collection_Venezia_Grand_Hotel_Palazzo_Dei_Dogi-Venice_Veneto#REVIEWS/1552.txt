Spent 2 nights here as part of a group tour.  Delighted with the quality and uniqueness of the hotel.  It's pleasantly off the main tour routes in Venice - about a 20 minute walk to St. Mark's.  Some of the areas outside some of the rooms are quite unique and amazing.   Room quality was very high. Read moreDate of stay: June 2007HelpfulShare
