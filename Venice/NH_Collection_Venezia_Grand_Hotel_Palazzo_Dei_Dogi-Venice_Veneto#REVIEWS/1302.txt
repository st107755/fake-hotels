This was our first trip to Venice, and not only were we amazed at the moment we steps off the train , it just kept getting better as we checked in to the Boscolo.   The front desk team is world class.. the rooms are a step back in time and we had a canal view which just made our stay.  The private boats for the hotel were amazing, Nickolas , thank you again we cannot wait to come back, and we hope you are still there for a few more evening cruises!!    The bar is amazing in that it is small and all class... Make sure and do dinner , you will be more than impressed with the food and the service .. was a wonderful last evening   Once again , thanks to everyone who made this trip magical.. Stella and I are already planning our return. All the best, Tom and Stella McDermottRead moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare
