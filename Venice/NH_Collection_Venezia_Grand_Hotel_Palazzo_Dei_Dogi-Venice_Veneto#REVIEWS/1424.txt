Enjoyed our two nights at Boscolo.  The location was preferable to us - away from the busyness of St. Mark's Square.  Easy to navigate to (del Orto stop on Alilaguna; also, easy to walk to and fro with the provided map from the hotel)  The room was large, clean, quiet. The WIFI was free. We didn't pay extra for the breakfast.  The private boat was a wonderful treat.  We road it twice in our two night stay.  Once alone and once with another couple. Both times we had great views of the square and a peaceful, unobtrusive/private ride back and forth from the hotel.   The hotel's garden is also a peaceful retreat.  Would stay again if returning to VeniceRead moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
