Visited this hotel with my family and was very pleased to have selected this beats palace for my lodging while on Venice. The hotel is located within walking distance to all the major attractions, but tucked away in the residential area of the city to keep us away from the crowds and noise. Great cozy bar and restaurants near by. The hotel staff went out of their way to please every member of our family.
