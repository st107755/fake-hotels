Really liked the hotel and Philippe at front desk was most helpful and pleasant BUT we arrived with 2 kids and they wanted to charge 90 euros per cot which is a cheap foldout.  Found that disgraceful.  Also Internet is 20 euro for 24 hours and I'd expect a classy hotel to do better.  And the 6th city in Italy on this trip and the only one that charged for breakfast and at 30 euro I'd expect much much better.  Quiet location away from the masses but not central.  Net positive but the chain can do much more to enhance the customer experience. Also found the tranquil garden simply beautiful.  And why can't good European hotels have gyms......Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
