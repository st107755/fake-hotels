We appreciate your feedback and we do feel sorry for the inconvenience you experienced. As a boutique hotel, our property is located on a Palace from the 17th century. For these reason all rooms are different. We regret to understand that you didn't like the "terrazzo veneziano" a precious flooring that you can find in some of our Junior Suite.

At Boscolo Venezia we have a great selection of rooms with different layouts and it would be our honor to welcome you back to find the one for you that guarantees your highest level of comfort.
