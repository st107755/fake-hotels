Upon arrival, we were upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Junior Suite and were very surprised! A private elevator, bedroom, lounge room, sitting area, dining area and huge bathroom with shower and bath, double hand-basins and bidet. After locating the aircon it was sufficient, not great, but definitely took the discomfort from the air and made it easy to sleep. We were so happy with our little abode that we had room service for dinner, it was a great meal. Breakfast was in the outside gazebo with water fountains trickling, the food was standard but the atmosphere was great (coffee was foul). I overheard some people complaining about a toilet running all night, but we had no complaints at all. Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
