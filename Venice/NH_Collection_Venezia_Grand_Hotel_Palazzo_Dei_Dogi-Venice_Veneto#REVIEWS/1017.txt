We (family of 3) have stayed with friends at Boscolo dei dogi (25-28 July), to celebrate dear friends birthdays.  I had prebooked superior room (E600+ per night plus extra bed at E300+ !! For 14 yr old daughter).  As previous reviews, the quality of  breakfast and hotels's water taxi's a real bonus.  The front of house staff at reception are excellent, the bar and restaurant staff were "ok" (bar one waiter who was super with amusing stories of his time in England).  Overall, the experience has been very good, our room was lovely and the location whilst a little way out gives you the option of walking around or enjoying the water taxi's. Thank you for a memorable few days.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
