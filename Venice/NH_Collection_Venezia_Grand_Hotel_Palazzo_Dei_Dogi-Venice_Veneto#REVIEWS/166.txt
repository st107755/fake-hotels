This was a gorgeous hotel in a spectacular city and we enjoyed every moment of our stay. If you are looking to be spoiled rotten and well cared for in opulent surroundings,  this is your place! We were upgraded into a sensational junior suite on our pre-cruise night and somehow ended up in the presidential suite post cruise for two nights. Truly the best surprise! The service in the hotel, from the front desk, and the concierge,  Ivan was top notch. We ate dinner in the restaurant one night and breakfast all three mornings- it was great, service and food. We also enjoyed our time in the intimate bar; the bartender is a gem. Thank you very much for the hospitality that you provided us, it was very much appreciated.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 5, 2018Dear Sandy M, It is with great pleasure that we receive your review, and bigger was our pleasure of hosting you at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
