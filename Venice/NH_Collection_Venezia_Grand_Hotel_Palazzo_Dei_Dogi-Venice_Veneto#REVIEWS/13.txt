I am not sure who would take a trip without doing some investigating about the area and how close you are or are not from bus station and major attractions. But before booking I did some work and researched Venice and the many neighborhoods. Each one has its own personality and I knew the Cannaregio area would be perfect for us!  We visited with a party of 6 which required 2 rooms-each room was large and had plenty of room. Each room was clean and spacious. The hotel was gorgeous and the private gardens were beautifully maintained and led to a private dock to look out to the ocean and further islands. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful with any questions.  We hope to return to this hotel and beautiful city one day!Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
