The hotel didn't win us over with luxury, but instead with the charm of Venice. Grand room, albeit with a sloping floor, that made us feel we were in a special place. The hotel is in a nice neighborhood, away from the tourist throng, and it's easy to get there by either boat (Orto stop) or a walk from the train station. We highly recommend it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 10, 2018Dear 4444robert4444, Thank you for you kind feedback.
