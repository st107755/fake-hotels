We had a wonderful time at this hotel. Its easy to reach by getting the ferry from the airport. Hotel is the 1st stop and a 2 minute walk once you disembark. Cost is around 26 Euros each way. The hotel is in a nice peaceful area of Venice but not far from the hurly burly streets nearby. Lots of riverside cafes nearby to the hotel as well. The hotel offers a free boat ride to St Marks square if required about 6 times a day but its also a lovely walk through the streets and is approximately a mile which can take 30 minutes or much longer if you keep stopping along the way as we did. Definitely want to return and would definitely stay at the same hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 6, 2016Thank you for your kind feedback regading your stay at Boscolo Venezia.  we will be more than happy to welcome you back should your plans bring you to Venice again!
