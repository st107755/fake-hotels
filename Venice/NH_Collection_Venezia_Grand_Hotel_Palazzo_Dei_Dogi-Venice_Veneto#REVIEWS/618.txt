A quiet hotel with beautiful gardens in the northern part of Venice.  It is away from all the noise and people.  A water taxis stop is only steps away and convenient if you wish to go traveling around Venice.  The hotel staff is friendly and very helpful.  The breakfast is outstanding and served in an outside tent on the property.  The only slight problem we had was the water taxi to the airport was full for two trips and we along with others were concerned about getting to the airport on time. If taking the water taxi to the airport, leave in plenty of time.   The only other concern was the rooms are small but the location and helpful staff make up for this.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 13, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection Hotel.
