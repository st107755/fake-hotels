This hotel features the largest private garden in Venice.  Rooms are comfortable if somewhat small.  The included breakfast was quite good.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The hotel had free, scheduled water taxi transportation to and from St. Mark's Square.  Walkable neighborhood but limited restaurant options nearby.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
