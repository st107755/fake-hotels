This hotel is not in the tourist section of Venice, we were a little worried at first with the location but this ended up being the best quality.  There is a garden in the middle of the hotel that allows you to relax each morning for breakfast or if you need to get away from the heat.  We were able to walk from the Train Station and also to San Marco.  The hotel does offer a free boat ride to Murano Glass factory and to the Square as well.  The breakfast for Marriott Platinum members was the full buffet and also you could order off the menu.  We enjoyed an amazing 6-course dinner prepared by their chef and this was a highlight of our trip.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
