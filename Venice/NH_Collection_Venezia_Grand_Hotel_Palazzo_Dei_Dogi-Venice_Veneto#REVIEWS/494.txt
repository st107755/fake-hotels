We took a family trip to Venice and stayed for 2 nights. The hotel is incredibly decorated with marble frescos, Murano Glass and gorgeous carpeting. The service is top notch and the location is a good one-quieter part of Venice and has a complimentary boat shuttle if you choose to use it. You can also take an easy walk to many excellent restaurants and shops. Also easy to walk to San Marco Square.   Besides the decor, the highlight was the amazing garden that weaves its way to the lagoon. There are two 'caves,' gorgeous ivies and many plant which look like they will bloom in the next few weeks.   This is a very special property and we thoroughly enjoyed and recommend it.
