Delightful three day stay. Warm and hospitable staff. Spa was wonderful. Enjoyed the lovely garden and the outdoor dining. Quick and Easy Alilaguna ride from airport. Access to two vaporetto stops not to mention the hotel provides drop off and pick up at designated times to St. Marks Square. There are plenty of restaurants nearby that are frequented by locals. In off season you might want to stay in San Marco but during tourist season I would highly recommend the Boscolo Venezia.
