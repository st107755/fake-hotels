My husband and I spent a delightful 2 nights at the Boscolo. The location is very nice and quiet, and the staff (particularly front desk) were fantastic. Very helpful and knowledgeable.The rooms were much larger than I expected. It's not close to the St. Marks square and other major attractions, but this made the area uncrowded and quaint. Overall, the facility ranks as a 5 out of 5. Several good eating spots nearby (within 5 min. walk).Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 29, 2016Dear Guest,  Receiveng news of our success concerning customer satisfaction is our delight, as we aim to fulfilling and exceeding the expectations of our guests.
