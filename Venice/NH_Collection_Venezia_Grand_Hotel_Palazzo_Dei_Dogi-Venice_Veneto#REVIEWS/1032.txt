My husband and I stayed here recently for a few nights while traveling through Italy.  We haven't met a staff or venue quite like it.  It was a 17th century palace with some of the original architecture (we think).  The gardens are well kept and there is a private docking area in the back where we sat and enjoyed a drink.  The breakfast was fresh and delicious as well as lunch.  The front desk staff was extremely helpful and polite.  We highly recommend this hotel!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
