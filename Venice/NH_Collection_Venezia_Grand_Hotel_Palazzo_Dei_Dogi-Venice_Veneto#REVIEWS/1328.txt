My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel....located right on the canal and great trip via water taxi from airport.  This hotel is very nice and has lots of history.  The Breakfast was great and the Bar is very nice.  We also enjoyed lunch and you get the small personal touch from the staff here.  The room was nice and overlooked the Canal.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
