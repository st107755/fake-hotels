Staying at this hotel was a very nice experience. The staff was very friendly. The location is a little bit of a hike from the Piazza San Marco, so it was tiring for my kids to do all the walking around. Beware of the Murano factory tour offered for free from the hotel. The trip is exclusive for the factory and they expect you to purchase something from their expensive gallery and gift shop. I do not recommend wasting the time doing so. Better to get a vaporetto fare to go to Murano.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 5, 2017Dear Luz F, let me thank you for taking the time to post your review in this forum.
