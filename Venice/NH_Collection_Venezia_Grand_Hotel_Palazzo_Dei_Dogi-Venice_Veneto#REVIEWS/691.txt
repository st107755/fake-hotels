This is a beautiful hotel located off the beaten path.  It was once a palace and later an embassy.  Rooms are very nice and clean.  The staff was great and very helpful.  Restaurant was overpriced and was surprised that breakfast was not included.  It was the only hotel we stayed at that did not include breakfastRead moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare
