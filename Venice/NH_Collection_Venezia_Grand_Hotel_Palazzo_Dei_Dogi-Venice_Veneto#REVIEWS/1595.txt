So....my boyfriend and I stayed here in early March of 2004 after just graduating from college. It was the first stop in about 35 different hotels over the course of 3 months and we were impressed. Towel warmers in the bathroom and of course, very, very ventitian decour. However, for a five star room, it was a bit small. We did enjoy the canal view and the free shuttle to Murano (eventhough we didn't buy a thing!) However, I should note that we got this room at an AMAZING rate on a hotel website ($140/night for 5 nights). I don't know if I would pay more for it. We returned to Venice at the end of our trip and paid 60 euro for a room that was great too.  Read moreHelpfulShare
