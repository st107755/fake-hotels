This former Venetian palace was a real treat.  It offered a true sense of what it must have been like back in the day when Venice was a super power.  The amenities of the hotel are endless from superior service, fine dining, great hidden getaways all within the grounds of the hotel.  The "front and back doors" to the hotel are canals which just added to the charm of the place.  Loved it all!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 18, 2018Dear Joe G, It is such a pleasure to read your fantastic review about our Grand Hotel dei Dogi, The Dedica Anthology!
