This quiet boutique hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the train station.  However, it feels like you're much further away from the tourists of Venice.  The hotel itself is decorated beautifully, with an old world feel.  Hand blown glass lamps and chandeliers fill the lobby.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable.  A garden in the back of the hotel is the perfect setting for a romantic walk (and leads down to the dock/water, which borders the rear of the property).  The food at the restaurant and drinks at the small bar are exceptional.  There is a large selection to choose from and the setting is very quaint.  Last, but not least, the staff is excellent.  They go out of there way to ensure a peaceful and enjoyable stay.  We will definitely return to this "diamond in the rough"!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
