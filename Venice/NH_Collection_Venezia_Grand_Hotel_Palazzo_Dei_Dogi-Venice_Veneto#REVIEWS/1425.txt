My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in March 2012. The room was traditionally as you would expect for Venice. Not huge but plenty of room for 2 people unless you're planning on spending your holiday in the room all the time. The service was very good. We did have a slight problem at breakfast on our first morning as we were not on the list. But this was sorted out in about 5 minutes. The hotel is is a lovely area not as upmarket as the centre but this was reflected in the restaurant prices and things so if you're in a budget there are some nice little places that won't break the bank close by. I would recommend this hotel especially for couples who want a quality hotel that's sensibly priced close to the centre of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare
