A beautiful small hotel with a large garden area, off the beaten path in Venice. It is a 10-15 walk from the Water Bus stop at the Casino. It is away from the central area and very quiet. The rooms are wonderful with more than enough space. The breakfast is also wonderful; a combination of buffet with an entr√©e. The staff is excellent and will handle your every need. If you are looking for something different, not in the tourist areas, this is for you.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 4, 2015Dear Valued Customer, the whole Boscolo Venezia team would like to thank you for taking your time to share your recent experience with Boscolo Venezia.
