Out of the way, but not too far:  a pleasant walk to the tourist spots.  We enjoyed the neighbourhood and local flavour, cafes, bars and restaurants during the early evening.  Away from the throngs of main Venice.  The Hotel gardens and back dock are a relaxing area to have a late afternoon cocktail.  The Boscolo breakfast buffet is excellent, and the restaurant is worthy of a Michelin star (but I don't work for Michelin).Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 30, 2016Dear valued guest, We would like to thank you, on behalf of the entire Boscolo Venezia team, for reviewing your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
