Absolutely loved this hotel. Absolutely amazed with the gardens and the stunning foyer. Staff were lovely and helpful. My Detox and Revive Spa and massage with Elizabeth was the best i have ever had. Being away from the hustle and bustle of Venice was wonderful but we were within walking distance of some very good restaurants and shopping. The hotel provides a shuttle service to and from San Marco and the island of Murano...another bonus.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, front desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 18, 2019Dear Helenalicia,  On behalf of the entire hotel team, we want to thank you for sharing your most memorable experiences with us during your recent stay at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi, The Dedica Anthology, Autograph Collection.
