We we here for three days and had two rooms.. my kids had a superior which was larger to fit the three of them and ours was a deluxe which was small.  I have been to many hotels but I wish I had chosen one closer to the square.. It was too far and not worth. i thought since I stayed in the Boscolo in Rome which was gorgeous it would be the same thing but it was not at all. My kids had a nightly bug problem and were totally grossed out, no views and staff was very aloof and not helpful at all, and they recommended horrible places to eat.  will never stay there againRead moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jun 13, 2014Dear Sir, I would like to thank you for taking your time to share your comments with us.
