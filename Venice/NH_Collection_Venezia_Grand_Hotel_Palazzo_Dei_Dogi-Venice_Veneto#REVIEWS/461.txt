The room was great.  We had a view of the canal.  Very well decorated and comfortable.  One thing we liked about it was the location, which was away from the typical tourist destinations in Venice.  Long walk from parking if you have bags, so I recommend the water taxi.  Even at 70 Euros, it would be worth it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear Philip P, Thank you for your feedback.
