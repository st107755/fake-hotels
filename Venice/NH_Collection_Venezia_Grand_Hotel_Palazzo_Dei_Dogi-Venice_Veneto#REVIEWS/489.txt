We stayed at the Boscolo Venezia for 2 nights prior to a cruise in June 2016 and it was fabulous!  The staff was attentive and accommodating, the grounds were stunning, the rooms were spacious (we had a canal view)...all perfecto!  I would absolutely stay here again - close enough to the action and far enough for peace and quiet.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 7, 2017Dear Kara M, thank you for you kind feedback.
