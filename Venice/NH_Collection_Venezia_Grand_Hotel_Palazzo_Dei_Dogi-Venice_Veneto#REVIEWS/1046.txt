Stayed 2 nights @ Boscolo Venezia with family of 8.  What we liked:  friendly/helpful staff, clean room, very good buffet,  good location(20 minute walk to square), better than average accommodations for Europe.  What we did not like:  inadequate air conditioning - need ceiling fans in lobby , eating areas and in rooms.  Would be a 5 star for a Europe in better air conditioning.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
