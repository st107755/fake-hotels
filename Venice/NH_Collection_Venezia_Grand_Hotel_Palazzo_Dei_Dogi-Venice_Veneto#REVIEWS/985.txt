A nice hotel although we were disappointed with a small relatively pokey room ( beware requests for canal views etc waste of time) However great position for relaxing after the trials of Venice. Gardens great and private boats excellent easy to rack up costs if not too careful( but the hotel is 5star)  Staff all very helpful and offered great Resteraunt selections. Beware classic glass trip where you only go to the one " factory" probably better to wander around Morano and be your own agent. Good Internet no satellite tv.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
