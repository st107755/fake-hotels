We stayed here in July with out two teenage boys. The rooms were beautiful. Two junior suites. It was grand. Claudio, was outstanding. The garden outside was beautiful and fun to walk through at night as we drank wine. It is a 30 minute walk to most to the major sites and the walk itself is a great experience. The beds were comfortable and the room was impeccable. We will definitely be back to this hotel. Loved it!!!!!Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 4, 2018Dear LALALOVE L, Thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
