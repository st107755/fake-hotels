A beautiful old hotel, but with modern conveniences.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The food in the restaurant was delicious and creative.  The garden is charming and offers a peaceful retreat. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 25, 2016Dear guest, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
