Far from the madding crowd fully explains this hotel's position. An oasis from the throng of humanity that descends on Venice and yet only a twenty to thirty minute walk from the major attractions.  Beautiful reception area, magnificent gardens, go look, amazing chandeliers, great bedroom and bathroom. The restaurant is well worth trying for an evening meal, try their fish and chips, mmmmm! Very helpful staff whose command of English is to be applauded. Will be back.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare
