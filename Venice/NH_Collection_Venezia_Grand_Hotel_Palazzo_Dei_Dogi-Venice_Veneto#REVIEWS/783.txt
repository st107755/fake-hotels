Loved this hotel, it's like stepping back in time but with all of the modern must haves.  Very romantic decor.  This was our third time in Venice and third time on the festival of the Redentore.  The hotel put on a lavish dinner with wine pairings, followed by a water taxi to St Marks Square to watch the fireworks on the water....... A once in a lifetime experience, well worth the cost !  Cannot say enough about this hotel, superb in all aspects !  Will definitely stay at this hotel the next time we are in Venice.  The hotel had a complimentary transfer to St Marks Square and also to MuranoRead moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare
