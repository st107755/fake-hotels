Stayed here for 2 nights during our honeymoon.  This place is knock your socks off charm & gorgeous!  Was lucky enough to use Marriott points to secure this reservation.  The bathroom was enormous-very rare for Europe.  The only downside is if you take the train to Venice you will be hauling your luggage over eight bridges.  Great location if you fly in though-super close but not to close to the airport.  highly recommend.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
