Was whisked away for a romantic weekend in Venice. Arrived at night by water taxi to the Hotel. Okay it cost around 70 euros (probably more than the flight from UK, but it was very James Bond-esque.. We normally stay in modern hotels, but this is simply beautiful and so traditional and Venezian in architecture that it wouldnt have made the weekend half as charming had we opted for a modern hotel... Ive been told that it is the only Hotel in Venice with a garden...or at least a garden that big...especially for Venice! Walking through it to our room each day was enchanting and a great way to enwind or refresh before going for breakfast. Absolutely 100% would love to return to this Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
