I stayed here with my husband for an extended weekend. The hotel is beautiful, elegant and outstanding service. There are a few complimentary tours which we took advantage of.

I would highly recommend this hotel because of the unbelievable experience we had,Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare
