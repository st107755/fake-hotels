Luxury by a quiet canal with it's own private water bus.  It runs 3/4 times to St Mark's Square and last trip back to Hotel at 7-00pm.  If you need transport at any other time the water taxis run every ten minutes just five minute walk from hotel. Very welcoming staff and this hotel has the largest gardens stretching back to the lagoon.  Must be the most expensive piece of land in Venice. This hotel is not cheap but compared with other 5 star luxury places it is a steal.  Quiet and calm with many fine restaurants at fair prices nearby.  Would love to return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
