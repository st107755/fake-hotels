We spent  two nights at the Boscolo Venezia in May before a cruise.  It was our first trip to Venice and athe Boscolo was a wonderful start to a great vacation.  We loved the location; I'm not sure that I would have liked Venice so much if we'd stated in a busy area.  The vaporetto stop is nearby, the system is easy to use, and the passes are a great deal.    I don't know what I enjoyed more about the hotel: our view of the lagoon, the peaceful garden, or the water shuttle to St Marks, which we used 3 times.  Water taxis are a great way to see Venice, but they are expensive; having a free ride to St. Marks was quite a deal!    Our stay at the Boscolo was a highlight of a wonderful trip.  I look forward to returning some day!Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
