Stayed two nights the beginning of May.  Was impressed with the location, the apparent cleanliness, the breakfast offerings, the amenities but left with bedbugs.  Returned in one week with photos which they claimed were mosquito bites.  Compared them to other bed bug infections which they mirrored exactly -- and unless they have mosquitos trained to bite in linear formations there.....they were bed bugs.  They still claimed they were mosquito bites.  Hummmmmm.  I wouldn't take the chance again.Read moreDate of stay: May 20151 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 24, 2015Dear Mrs Maryelle, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.
