We met Roma & Emo in the Lounge two great guys, personable, attentive and knowledgeable.  We then encountered Bair for a white Glove dinner service. Went with his recommendations on wine and food.  it was the best meal we have had in Venice. Bair gave us undivided attention and what to see on our adventures outside of Venice.  Front desk was friendly and got us an early check-in.  YES!  We will be back as the hotel is located with good proximity of cultural sites, but with a quiet charm and sophistication and a spectacular garden.  It is away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 9, 2016Dear ReginaT63, Thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for your kind feedback.
