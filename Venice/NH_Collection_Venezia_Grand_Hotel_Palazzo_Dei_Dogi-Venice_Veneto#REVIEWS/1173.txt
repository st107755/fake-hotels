My husband & I spent 3 nights at this hotel in March 2013.  Our room was very large, a huge bed, with a gorgeous Murano glass chandelier hanging above it.  It is in a very nice & quiet location.  The entire hotel was just beautiful!  There is a garden behind the hotel, which was very nice, except for the smell of the water in the small lagoon.  The hotel is non-smoking.  The hotel offers a free trip by boat to Murano Island & tour of the blown glass factory & shop.  It was just a short walk from this hotel to restaurants & shops.Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare
