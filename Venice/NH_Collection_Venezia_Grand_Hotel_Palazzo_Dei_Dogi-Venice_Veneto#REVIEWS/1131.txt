Stayed for three nights this week at Boscolo.  Thought I would start with the positives:  The hotel is beautiful, filled with murano glass chandeliers.  Very clean and artsy.  If you've got status with Marriott, the breakfast is free (and very good). The restaurant in the hotel is excellent as well.  Good service and never busy. Bathroom amenities were good and bonus, a towel warmer! Concierge and staff were wonderful.  There is a free shuttle to St Marks which will save you a ton of money!  Now, for the not so positive pieces...  Touted as a five star hotel, it definitely is not.  Mattresses were hard and uncomfortable.  Bathroom was small and very cramped (door hits the toilet and you can't use the outlet without trying to stand around the bidet, very awkward). â€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare
