My husband and I loved our stay at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi.  The reception area is stunning and breakfast was great.  The location is a bit far from the popular spots, BUT they have a complimentary boat taxi at certain times that takes you to and from St. Mark's square which is so fun. We loved that. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Guest Relations Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 30, 2018Dear Mariakorea, We are happy you enjoyed your stay with us and that facilities and service experience were what you expected and deserve.
