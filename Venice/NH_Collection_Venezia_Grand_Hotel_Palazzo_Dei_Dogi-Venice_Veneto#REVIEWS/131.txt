An amazing property, tucked away in one of Venice's more authentic "sestiere." The house staff is welcoming, our room overlooked a canal, and Ivan (the concierge) recommended delicious restaurants and activities.  Arriving by boat is an experience to remember, and the free shuttle's are a great amenity.  The daily breakfast is also worth it, and will not disappoint.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 29, 2019Dear Curiosity592162, Thank you for your kind feedback.
