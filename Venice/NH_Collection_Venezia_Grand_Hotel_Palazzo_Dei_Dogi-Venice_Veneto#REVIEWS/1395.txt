This is a beautiful old world hotel in a quiet section of Venice - 20-25 minutes from the main square if you are a great map reader.  As noted, this has a stunning lobby, small rooms (by American standards), beautiful private park.  Lots of problems with wifi here (ok, I am kinda obsessed about this...but a day or two away from email is tolerable and we were here to enjoy Italy.  It is worth walking from here as your base to get a feel for Venice, and you definite can do that but DO bring a map and be ready to be lost from time to time.    I think it's worth staying here for a night or two, as we did with an Insight Tour.  NOTE - I WOULD strongly recommend reading The City of Falling Angels, a book about the Fire at the Venice Opera House as you prepare to visit Venice.
