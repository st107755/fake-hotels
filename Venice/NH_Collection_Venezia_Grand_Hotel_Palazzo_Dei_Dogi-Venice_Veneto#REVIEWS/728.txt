We had a great time at this "Grand Old Dame" in Venice. It is like going back in the time, but with all the comfort of the modern time. Due to the off-season the hotel was very quiet. We used the complementary water taxi to/from the Center, very convenient, although everything is within walking distance. The breakfast was excellent, free with the Elite Status, one dinner at the hotel was a great experience and the other nights the hotel staff gave valuable recommendation for good restaurants. The rooms were enormous, the kingsize bed very comfortable and the bathroom modern. Great place when you visit Venice. (realize that you need to take a water taxi or water bus from the parking to the hotel. It is not reachable by car).Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Feb 24, 2016Dear  family,  thank you for staying with us at Boscolo Venezia and thank you for taking the time to post your positive opinions.
