This is an awesome place to stay in Venice. Large room, amazing large beds, well equipped bathroom and lovely view :) I will definitely go back there again. Can't wait. The price is a bit high but Venice is not a cheap place to stay :) Someone can complain about the location because it is away from the crowds but that is exactly what I like - a luxury, quiet place.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jan 17, 2015Dear Valued Guest,  The whole Boscolo Venezia team would like to thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at our hotel.
