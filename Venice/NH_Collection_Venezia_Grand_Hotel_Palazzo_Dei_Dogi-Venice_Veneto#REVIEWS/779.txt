The property is beautifully appointed and perfectly situated in our opinion - near enough to the city's attractions, but just far enough removed to impart a sense of intimate seclusion.  Moreover, the staff is most pleasant and courteously helpful. Everyone we spoke with there made us feel welcome.  If we travel again to Venice, we most certainly will make our reservations at the Boscolo.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare
