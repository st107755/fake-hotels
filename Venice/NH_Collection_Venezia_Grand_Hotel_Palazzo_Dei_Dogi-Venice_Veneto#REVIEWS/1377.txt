This was our second journey to Venice and our first experience with Boscolo. Our fourth floor room over looking the gardens was beautiful.  The staff was exceptional and I must mention Claudio for his help in getting us to interesting resturants in the city. I definitely recommend this grand facility.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare
