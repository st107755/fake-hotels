My wife and I just came back a week ago! I cannot say enough good things about this hotel! The staff is extremely accommodating. The location is also very quiet and a nice escape from all of the crowds. I stayed on Marriott points and we were upgraded to a corner suite. The rooms are very large and spacious. Also the complimentary breakfast is very nice as well.  We loved everything about this hotel and we will definitely recommend it to our friends and family!  Hope to return some day!Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 20, 2017Dear Ferrel28, thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
