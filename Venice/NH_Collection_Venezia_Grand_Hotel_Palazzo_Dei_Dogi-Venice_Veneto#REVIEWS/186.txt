My fiancé and I decided to stay here the first couple of days in Venice just to try it out. To our surprise the hotel had a concierge, Ivan, who went above and beyond for us.  The hotel is amazing! Even if you don’t plan on staying here it’s a must see. The location is perfect and everything about it says Venice.  Again, I can’t thank Ivan enough for his help through out our stay. We’ll definitely be coming back.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Oct 1, 2018Dear Oscar R, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
