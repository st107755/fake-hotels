Hotel was priced by Holland American at $655 per night.  Actually this was 5 star price at 2 star quality.  Tiny rooms with no Air Conditioning, If you opened a window you got mosquitos as sleeping companions.  Attractive entry but 1950 style rooms.  Breakfast was OK, Water Taxi provided by hotel was a plus.  We would not stay in this hotel again.  Terribly overpriced!!. We stay at Ritz-carltons and four seasons and are accustomed to true 5 star hotels. Read moreDate of stay: October 2005HelpfulShare
