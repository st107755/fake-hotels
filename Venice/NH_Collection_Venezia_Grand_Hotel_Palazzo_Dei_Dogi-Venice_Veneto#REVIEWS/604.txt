We stayed on the second floor in a corner room second floor. It was spacious with three windows overlooking the canal. We went in August and it  was very hot and sunny in Venice so we welcomed the cold functioning AC and the extremely comfortable king sized bed. The large closet and luggage racks provided was amply suited for our needs.I was upgraded due to my Platinum status with Marriott. The staff was very helpful about everything we needed from directions to scheduling private taxis to our cruise ship. They also offered a free shuttle to St.Marcos square many times a day with a scheduled times. Just have to tell them when you want to go. The Palazzo has the only 30,0000 square foot garden that goes all the way to the next canal and it was gorgeously landscaped with seating.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Aug 24, 2016Dear Tollinche7, thank you so much for your positive feedback.
