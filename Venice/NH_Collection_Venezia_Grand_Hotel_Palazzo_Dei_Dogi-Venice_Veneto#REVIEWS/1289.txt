I liked this place, its off the beaten track but close to some hidden restaurant gems that most people will miss, thankfully because of the location you must walk around so really get to feel Venice. Having said this for the lazy tourist they might hate the fact it is so far away from St Marks Square so be warned.   Inside the general decor is beautiful and the rooms very good, however I can't put my finger on it but I felt something was missing... The place lacks a little atmosphere (even for a couples place), the rooms as I said although very good don't make you feel like your in a 5 star hotel, a little basic, but this caters for people who aren't there to be in their room apart from sleep, I still feel for the money you should get more.   We only ate breakfast at the hotelâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare
