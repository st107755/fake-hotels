This is one of those older hotels that was really nice 30 years ago. Not sure they have done much to it since then (except kept it clean). Comprable to a regular Marriott in the states, at least one that has not been recently remodeled. Did have free wifi, which is nice, since most Autograph collection properties would likely charge for that. We were only here one night and it was OK. I would only recommend if you are using points so the stay is "free".Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare
