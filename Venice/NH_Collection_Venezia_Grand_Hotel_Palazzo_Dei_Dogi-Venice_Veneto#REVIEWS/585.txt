It's kinda hard not to give this hotel the obvious 5 stars it might deserve, but there are reasons for that. The hotel is really beautiful, attention to details in every corner around you. Concierge was very helpful & suggested a couple of restaurants that were really delightful. The room was smaller than expected but had a  good view of the small canal. The location itself is quitter compared to other places in venice, but that allowed us to have a quiet, enjoyable, breakfast at "Osteria Al Mariner" restaurant nearby (highly recommended!). Be sure to use your free daily one hour steam & Jacuzzi at the hotel's spa. The free hourly shuttle is a very useful tool & a nice ride in the canal as well. I took a star off, because after looking around, you can really find other placesâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare
