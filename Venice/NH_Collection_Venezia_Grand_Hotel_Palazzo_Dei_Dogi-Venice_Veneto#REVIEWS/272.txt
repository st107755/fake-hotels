Boscolo Venezia was such a nice place to stay. We had a room that overlooked the lagoon. The staff at the hotel were so helpful! They offer a free boat trip to go to Murano, which was so enjoyable. They also have the largest hotel  in Venice with two beautiful bunnies that hop around. We loved the location of the hotel too. It was not too close to the tourist areas, which gave us the opportunity to meet locals and eat where the locals eat. We loved it!
