Lovely hotel on a quiet canal.   Beautiful Murano glass chandeliers in lobby.  Air conditioning was fantastic in the hot weather.  Martina at reception was courteous and very helpful.  Hotel provides water taxi to St. Marks Square and also Murano Island.  Highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare
