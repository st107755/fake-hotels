The hotel is in a quiet residential location which compared to the centre is charming. It is no problem being outside trhe centre as you walk miles and get lost a lot while you are there. To get to St Mark's is pretty simple. The beautiful Riva boat is free and they do have a timetable that you should be given on arrival. It was good enough but not four star and the general Venitian attitude to service is, well - they don't give any. The whole city is trading on it's past which admittedly has produced something amazing, but don't expect them to be pleased to see you or grateful for your business. It is also very expensive for pretty mediocre food.Read moreDate of stay: November 2009HelpfulShare
