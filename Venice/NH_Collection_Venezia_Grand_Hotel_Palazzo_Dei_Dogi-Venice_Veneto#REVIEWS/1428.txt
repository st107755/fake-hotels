The hotel was beautiful and the location perfect. Away from the huge crowds, it is nestled on a quiet street facing the water. As Marriott gold elite members we were a little disappointed with the "deluxe" room and the number of points we spent on the room per night. Clearly we paid for the location. Overall it was worth it. Free breakfast and a free shuttle each morning to the main square. It is also ideally located to the water bus that goes to the airport. It's jut a short walk from the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare
