Really enjoyed staying at this hotel while we were in Venice for one night - the location is in a very peaceful part of town and we loved exploring the neighborhood. There was a loud wedding going on at the hotel and the staff kindly switched us to a quieter room upon our request. The rooms were lovely and the whole hotel had a nice charm.  4/5 stars because breakfast was not included!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 31, 2018Dear danielle n, Thank you for staying with us at Grand Hotel dei Dogi and thank you for your kind feedback.
