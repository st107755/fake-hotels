My husband and I stayed at this property in May after a cruise to the Greek Islands and visits to Rome and Florence. We took a water taxi from the cruise port to the hotel...I believe it was for around $130 euros each way and we took a water taxi to the airport after our stay for the same price. It was costly but we did not want to deal with changing water buses or shuttles and we did not want to walk with our heavy luggage so it was more convenient for us to take the private water taxi.   We are Marriott gold reward members and stayed on points.  As Marriott members we did receive breakfast vouchers to use...let me say that the breakfast buffet was very good! The croissants were so yummy and we loved having breakfast outdoors on the patio.  The grounds here are so beautiful! â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
