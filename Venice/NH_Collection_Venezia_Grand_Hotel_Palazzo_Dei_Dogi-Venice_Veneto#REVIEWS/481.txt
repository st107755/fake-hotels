In relation to the comments you made about the teapots, certainly the issue you described is not indicative of the Marriott & Boscolo standards of quality and customer service, which both brands are renown for.   Allow me to take this occasion to inform you that after your recommendation we increased the number of teapots in our restautant and bar.

Kind regards, Chiara Zambianchi Vice Director Read more
