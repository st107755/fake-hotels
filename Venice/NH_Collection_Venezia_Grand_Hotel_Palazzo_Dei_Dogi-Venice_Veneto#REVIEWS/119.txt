We stayed for 2 nights and highly recommend this property!  The service, from start to finish was first class.  The property is in perfect shape and the room was outstanding. The location was a bit away from the touristy areas (more residential) and we liked that a lot.  Walking to the San Marco Piazza took about 20 mintues or so, but was fine.The staff always provided great directions and marked up a map each time.  We ate breakfast both days (included since I have a high rank at Marriott) was the best we had all week in Italy. We were able to easily walk 10-15 minutes to the train station when we left.  The only boat we needed the two days was a free tour of Murano & glass factory, provided by the hotel and a ferry from the airport.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 29, 2019Dear DaveTexas70, Thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Grand Hotel dei Dogi.
