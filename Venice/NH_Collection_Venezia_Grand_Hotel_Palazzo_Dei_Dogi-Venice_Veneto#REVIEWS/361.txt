We arrived at the front door on our water taxi, and entered a beautifully appointed lobby to be greeted by very friendly staff. The service and professionalism was visible throughout our visit. The rooms for decent sized, and well appointed. The AC worked great, which is not always the case in Europe.   The hotel has a free shuttle to/from Sant Marco Square, and has a free shuttle to/from Murano for a tour of a glass factory. I highly recommend using both.  All in all, what you would expect from a Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
