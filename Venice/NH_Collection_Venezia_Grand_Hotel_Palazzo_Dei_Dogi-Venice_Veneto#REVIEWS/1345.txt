This is a beautiful hotel close to the water taxis and easy assess for walking to the historical area. We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival . We used points as platinum members for our stay so we can not offer a comment as to the price.The free breakfasts were superb and presented in a garden or restaurant setting. The conceirge Claudio was very attentive to us. The hotel which seems to have mostly American guests was spotless and a very comfortable romatic setting for our stay. Our room looked over the canal and provided us with a spectacular view of Venetian life. You will love this hotel!!!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
