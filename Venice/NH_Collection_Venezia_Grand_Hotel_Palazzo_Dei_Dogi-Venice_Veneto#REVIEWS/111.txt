We’ve been at the Cenobio dei Dogi several times in the last few years and it has always been a lovely stay. The hotel is perfectly situated in Camogli with superb views of the beach, the old town, the emerald sea in this gem of Italy’s Ligurian coastline. The staff are highly professional , friendly and very attentive. One of our favourite place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
