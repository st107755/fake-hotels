The hotel is beautiful with great service.  The hotel decor is very charming and rooms were clean.  My only issue was that our room was on the first floor and it was very noisy from early in the morning till very late in the evening from all the noises coming from the lobby and the restaurant.    There is a boat bus stop close to the hotel (5 min walk) and water taxi from the train station costs 70 euro.  It's on the opposite side of Saint Marco square so it's nice to be away from all the tourists.  There is a free shuttle to Murano Island or to St. Marco Square.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Staff at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Mar 10, 2016Dear ChoosyTraveler0901,  Thank you very much both for your priceless feedback and for choosing us for your stay in Venice.
