Location, ambiance, customer service, romance, great food, convenience... I could go on and on. I've stayed at Ritz Carlton, Hotel Del, Grand Flora Roma, tons of Marriotts, Renaissance hotels, Hiltons, etc. Marquis properties - you name it. This is my favorite. Not the biggest. More like a boutique hotel. If I could return to any property in the world - this would be it. The hotel made our trip. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. Everything was just perfect!Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare
