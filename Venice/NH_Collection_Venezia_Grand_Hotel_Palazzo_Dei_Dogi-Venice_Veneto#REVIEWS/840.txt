Marriott lifetime platinum elite. 2 rooms using points. Superb location away from the crowds providing the most intimate experience with Venice possible.  2 charming garden view rooms - like stepping back in time. Gardens are serene.  Staff are courteous and professional.  Housekeeping was clean and invisible. Never saw a cleaning cart the entire time I was there.  Quality breakfast.  Small but well stocked bar.  Didn't dine at the restaurant - many, many excellent dining within 10 minute walk. Will return and stay again and again.
