I stayed at Boscolo with my wife this past June, the hotel was great, the reception was very helpful with tons of information on what to do and get around, the breakfast during the first day was great since we were able to seat on the outside patio, during the second day they had a big cruise ship group so we were told we needed to seat inside (not as nice as outside). Problem why I am not giving 5 stars is because the hotel has failed to give Marriott Rewards information on my stay so I can't get points credited to my account, Marriott Rewards has contacted hotel and they are not responding. Why would the hotel not do this?  I hope someone from hotel reads this review and takes actionRead moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare
