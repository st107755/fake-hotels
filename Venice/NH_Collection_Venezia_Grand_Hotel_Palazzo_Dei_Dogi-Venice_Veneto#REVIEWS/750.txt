We stayed at the Boscolo Venezia for 3 nights. The staff was very helpful and friendly.   The location is excellent. It's in a quiet neighborhood but everything in Venice is easily accessible. The hotel provides a shuttle boat to Piazza San Marcos throughout the day. The trip is scenic and drops you off right at the Piazza. It's a free shuttle. A paid trip would be 75 Euros. Great benefit for the guests.  We had a room overlooking the canal and enjoyed watching life on the canal.  This is a great hotel!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare
