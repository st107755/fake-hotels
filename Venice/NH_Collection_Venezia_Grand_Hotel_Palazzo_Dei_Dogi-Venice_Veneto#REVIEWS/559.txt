This really is a great hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great quiet location a bit removed from the bustle of the grand canal, but we easily walked to the things we wanted to see, or to the public water taxis that took us to St Mark's, etc. The complimentary breakfast was really good, much better than expected. This is a good choice for your stay in Venice!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Nov 6, 2016Dear Mrs. Debbie, Thank your for taking your time and reviewing your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia Autograph Collection.
