I'm a Bonvoyer so booked this hotel as it had rooms at the last minute.  Pluses -- away from the madding crowds around San Marco (just a 30 minute walk).  Nice staff.  Very good breakfast.  Cons -- small, dated rooms (typical for Italy).  The restaurant nearby - Ristorante Algiubagio - was one of the highlights of our trip to Venice.  On the water and amazing food and fair prices.Read moreDate of stay: July 2019HelpfulShare
