What a wonderful Hotel, we loved the quiet place away from all the hectic and crowd venice has, very charming hotel, we loved our room and bed, nice bathroom with two sinks and big shower. Very nice garden walking to the Taxi. Cant say something bad about this Hotel. The lobby was wonderful and also the hall to the room amazing. We really liked the old charming style. Very relaxing stay. Highly recommended.  Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
