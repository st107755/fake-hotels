Small boutique hotel, away from busy streets of Venice. I stayed for my birthday and they had a surprise cake on birthday night. Nice touch :) I loved the little garden in backyard. Breakfast spread was great. We mostly ate out so I cannot comment on the restaurant. But I would love to compliment the hotel staff who were so attentive and always in good spirits. It was a great time!
