Stayed here for a weekend break. Hotel is located in a quiet part of town but only 20 minutes walk from many of the main attractions. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Rooms comfortable but be prepared for some noise from rooms above if you stay on lower floors. Breakfasts excellent. Hotel also provides free boat shuttle to St Marks square. Would stay here again.
