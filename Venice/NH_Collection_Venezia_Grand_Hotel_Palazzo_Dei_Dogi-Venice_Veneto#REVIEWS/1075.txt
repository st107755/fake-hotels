I stayed at the Boscolo Venice in March 2014 and I really loved my time here. The hotel is very nice and has a classic feel about. The glass chandelier in the lobby was awesome and we actually ventured over to the glass factory in Murano to see more. The location was great just near the water. The back area behind the restaurant is a hidden gem. That should be advertised more. The staff was very attentive and I would definitely stay in other Boscolo properties based off of my experience here. Thanks!Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
