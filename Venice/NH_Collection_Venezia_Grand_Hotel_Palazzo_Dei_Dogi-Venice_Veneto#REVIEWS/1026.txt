Loved this hotel. The gardens are stunning - colours so brilliant they don't seem real. Our room looked ut into the garden and had all the comforts we needed. We took advantage of the free trip to Murano Glass and were dropped back at St Marco. The hotel is a bit out of the main centre but we enjoyed this. Breakfast was lovely in the garden open air restaurant. We left from the private wharf to go to the cruise terminal. A lovely stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare
