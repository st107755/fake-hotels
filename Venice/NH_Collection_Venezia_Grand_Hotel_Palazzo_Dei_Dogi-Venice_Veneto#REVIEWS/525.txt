This hotel is in an old palazzo and it is spectacular. We arrived canal side, and walked in to be greeted by a beautiful spacious entry with amazing Murano chandeliers and sconces. Our room was huge with a large and luxurious bathroom. We did not have a view, but there plenty of light and airflow through the room. We took the shuttle over to Murano and were dropped off on the lagoon side on our return. This meant that we had to walk through the gardens to get to our room. The gardens were large and beautiful. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was tasty too. The hotel is in a quieter spot in Venice and it was nice to get away from the crowds.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Dec 3, 2016Dear 2KauaiGuys, thank you for your kind feedback regarding your stay at Boscolo Venezia.
