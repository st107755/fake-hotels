Hotel is beautiful!!! The lobby is so classic chandeliers everywhere it's gorgeous. They have a huge garden in the back of the hotel which leads to about a handful of other rooms where I stayed. I had a room with the view of the Laguna. Breakfast is excellent and the staff is so friendly! The hotel is situated about a 15 minute walk from the train station which I do not recommend with heavy bags since the streets are narrow and the canal bridges, but there is no other way. Hotel offers a complementary shuttle to Marc Square but you need to make reservations in advance. Hotel is apart from the busy congested streets. Many restaurants and bars nearby. Will stay here again without a doubt next time in Venice.
