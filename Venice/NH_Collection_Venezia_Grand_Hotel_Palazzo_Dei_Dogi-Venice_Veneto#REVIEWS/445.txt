Stayed three days and really glad we chose this hotel. Location in Canareggio between the lagoon and a canal was great for getting to Murano and Burano and was in a quieter neighborhood thought only a few minutes from more activity when we wanted it. The garden was stunning. a quiet, green and rose filled oasis. The breakfast buffet was extensive (more options and hot food than most European hotels) with unlimited mimosas. Appreciated the free water shuttle to St. Mark's Square and the islands. And the staff was lovely. Bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful stay. Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded May 18, 2017Dear Deb B, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
