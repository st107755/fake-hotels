Not just a hotel, but destination and experience in one place.  Staff was helpful, courtesy and professional. Room was spacious and well maintained. Breakfast was fantastic. A truly five-star hotel. . Locating in Cannaregio was a plus for us since it was out of the busy zone.  Garden was a great place to chill out.  We love it.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
