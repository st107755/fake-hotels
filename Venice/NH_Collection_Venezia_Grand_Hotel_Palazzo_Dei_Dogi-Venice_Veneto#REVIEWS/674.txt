The Autograph Boscola is located a little bit outside the busy shopping area. Therefore the location is great. It even has a nice garden and a place to relax in a chair at the waterfront. The rooms are clean and designed with classic furniture. The breakfast is amazingly well sorted and within a 15 min walk you will arrive in the busy shopping streets.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
