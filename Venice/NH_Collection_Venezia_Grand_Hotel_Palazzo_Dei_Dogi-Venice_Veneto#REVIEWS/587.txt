Although our previous visits to Venice have been at hotels at Saint Marks square or at the Hilton, we found the Boscolo Marriott to be a great choice. We previously stayed in the Boscolo in Budapest, which is unbelievable! The hotel services were excellent. We had a room with a view of the canal, right where the hotel water taxi is to take guests to Saint Marks Square. It is a free service with a schedule to make a reservation. They also have a water taxi to Murano. The hotel is a 7 minute walk from the Jewish ghetto, where we hadn't been on our previous trips. We also discovered a whole different shopping area very close. I would definitely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Sep 18, 2016Dear Carol G, Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
