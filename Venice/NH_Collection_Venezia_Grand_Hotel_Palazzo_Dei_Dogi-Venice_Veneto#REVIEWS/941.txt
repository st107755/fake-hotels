Pros:  Beautiful hotel, large rooms, lovely grounds, overall gorgeous.  Delightful and helpful staff. Very good breakfast buffet and eggs cooked to order, though pricey if not included in your rate. Hotel provides complimentary water taxi to and from St. Mark's square, maybe 6-7 times per day.  Airport convenience: take the Orange line vaporetto to the first stop, Orto, for a very short walk to the hotel.  No stairs to navigate and a fun way to arrive.  Cons:   Location may be too far from the tourist spots for those who don't enjoy a nice walk. As mentioned by others, hotel needs to do something to make their hot water consistent and eliminate the temperature surprises in the shower. Like many hotels in Europe, shower has a glass 1/3 door.  I can say nothing good about thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare
