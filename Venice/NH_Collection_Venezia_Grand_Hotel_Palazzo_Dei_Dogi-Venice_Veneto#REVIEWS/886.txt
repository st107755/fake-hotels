We were there in april and THE  location is a little bit out of THE normal circuit.Thats good. THE service is very good.Now the rooms are ok but the bathrooms ,specially the bathrooms are so small that you nearly cant take a shower.Also THE temperature of THE water channels all THE time.Very dangerous to burn you.I was not THE only one with that problem that week.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Apr 18, 2015Dear Valued Guest,   Thank you for your  feedback.
