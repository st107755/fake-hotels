This hotel is not near St Marks but we liked that a lot. By not being in a touristy section, it was quieter and we got a true feel for the city.  We walked everywhere.Just take a map and explore!  The hotel offers a free water shuttle to St Marks and then we walked back. We also took advantage of the hotel's free water boat to Murano to see the glass factory.  We went early, didn't spend a lot of time in showroom  so came back in about one hr. Didn't get to Burano even though hotel does have free boat there too. As gold members, breakfast was included...very good and you sit by beautiful garden. Our room was OK...not the cleanest but it was big, had ac- It was in a separate building overlooking the water. No clocks in the room...strange.  Bathrooms are small with half showerâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
