The reviews are correct - keep your windows closed or the mosquitoes will deluge you. However, we found the hotel to be beautiful (a great old hotel with a large open area between rooms and a hugh garden),  the room was large, the bed comfortable and the staff was friendly. The bathroom is fairly small but not tiny. The area is quiet yet has many restaurants within walking distance. The hotel was right off the first ferry stop from the airport (and not far from the cruise terminal) and with the amazingly high water taxi prices, this is important. For Venice, let alone such grand old hotel, the price is actually reasonable.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
