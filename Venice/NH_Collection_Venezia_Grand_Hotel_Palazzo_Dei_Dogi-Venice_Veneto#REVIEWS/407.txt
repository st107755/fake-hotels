A repeat visit (after a few years) proved that this lovely property has so gracefully maintained its beauty, elegance and very pleasant personnel!  The location, the amazing gardens, and the view of the Lagoon are so perfect...not to mention the gorgeous accommodations, delightful dining and romantic ambience! This visit was even improved by the presence of two silly rabbits romping on the lawn, who would actually hop right over to say hello!
