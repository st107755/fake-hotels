We love staying in Cannaregio. It’s a wonderful part of Venice  that will expose you to everyday life in a city that has more than 400 bridges. Each time we have stayed at Grand Hotel Dei Dogi.  Something  about the place seems to have changed.  There were a couple of misses on the breakfasts; cold eggs, undercooked eggs and crabby service. Several times, we came back from a long day out and about in the city and found our room still waiting to be cleaned. And, the place seems overrun with Americans and their love of gon-DOUGH-las.  It just wasn’t as magical this time, but see for yourself.
