We recently stayed at Grand Hotel Dei Dogi. We are a family of 4 with two teenagers. We stayed in the junior suite. The room was incredible with a most spacious bathrooms. The room was incredibly elegant with a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us! The area is quiet and removed from the tourist areas. The grounds are spectacular and beautiful. It is a true oasis. We hope to return in the future. It was also very easy access to walk to the vaporetto stop to Murano/Burano.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Desk at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 11, 2018Dear Skip D, Thank you for staying with us at Grand Hotel dei Dogi and thank you for your kind feedback.
