The Hotel Boscolo Venezia, Autograph Collection was beautiful.  The lobby was exquisite and the location was very convenient.  We were greeted by professional and polite doormen and receptionists.  Everyone was helpful and accommodating.  Our room was beautiful and spacious and had an awesome view.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare
