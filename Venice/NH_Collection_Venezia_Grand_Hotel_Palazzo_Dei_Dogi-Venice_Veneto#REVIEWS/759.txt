It is definitely a hoof from the main sights to the hotel - a good 25 minute walk up and down lots of steps.  We paid an amazing amount of money for a pretty modest room, but that seems typical in the area.  Our room overlooked the canal, with regular foot traffic so we could not keep the windows open at night (and surprisingly we got bit up from mosquitoes from leaving the windows open a short while).  The bed was pretty comfortable but hard, and the bathroom was quite lovely, with a large bath. We ate a couple of meals at the bar, which was relaxing.  Room service would have been a nice option but they do not offer it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
