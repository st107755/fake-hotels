This hotel is a jewel located in Venice.  The staff is welcoming and helpful upon arrival.  There is cold water available in the small yet beautiful lobby.  Looking out towards the back of the hotel is a lovely outdoor restaurant and gardens.  The rooms were comfortable.  We had travelled withour teenagers and had booked two rooms.  Boscolo was the first hotel on our journey to put their room next to ours. The hotel is located on the quieter side of Venice, so it was a quiet oasis after exploring Venice with the throngs of tourists. I hope to return in the future and would definitely stay at Boscolo again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
