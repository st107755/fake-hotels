Actually stayed on 09/2013 for a week. Nice accommodations, helpful staff, breakfast was ok (although pricey but hey, you're in Venice !)really don't want to stay anywhere else ! There are two entrances. One from the lagoon that walks through the gorgeous garden the other is their own private taxi boat drop off in front of the main entrance (see photos)Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare
