Do not be deceived by the pretty lobby, as anything good about this hotel ends there!  Upon check-in, they would not honor my PRE-PAID reservation through Marriott, and charged me again.  To add insult to injury, the rate was twice what I had already paid Marriott.  I would have left at that point but Venice was packed with tourists and there were no vacancies.  I then went upstairs to this room that I'd now paid almost $1,000 for, only to find it had a lovely view of the roof next door, the lock on the room door was broken, there were hairs on the white duvet, and the bath tub had obviously not been cleaned in a long time.  It was disgusting!!  Never have I been so glad to get out of a place as I was to leave the hotel!!!!Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
