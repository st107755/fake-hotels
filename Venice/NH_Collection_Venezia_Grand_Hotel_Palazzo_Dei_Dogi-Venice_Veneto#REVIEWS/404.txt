What makes this Hotel great is that it is off the beaten path and in an area of Venice where people live as opposed to where all the tourists stay.  Consequently, you are around restaurants that are filled with locals and not tourists.  The Hotel is very elegant and filled with Venetian glass and has a very nice garden area.  The room we stayed at in the garden area was quite spacious.  Breakfast was excellent.  A great escape from the crowds and noise around San Marco.  There something special about walking around Venice where it is quiet and still.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear Guest,  Thank you for expressing your satisfaction with your comfortable and fine location, the hotel’s décor and our great garden .
