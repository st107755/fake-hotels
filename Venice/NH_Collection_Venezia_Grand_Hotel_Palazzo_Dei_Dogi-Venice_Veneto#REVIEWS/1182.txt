We just returned from a lovely trip to Italy, which began in Venice at the Boscolo Venezia.    This lovely hotel is well off the beaten path and as a result you get peace and quiet away from the crowds.  We found the hotel to be comfortable and the staff was amazing.    The concierge helped track down my lost luggage so we wouldn't have to lose time from our stay making calls.    Walking to the highlights of Venice was not a bad walk, and being able to sit on the back dock of the hotel and see Murano was relaxing.    We personally loved the opportunity being away from the crowds afforded us to "get lost in Venice" by wandering back paths and alleys.  Some of the best food was found this way and we really got a sense of the local culture.      I would highly recommend the hotelâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
