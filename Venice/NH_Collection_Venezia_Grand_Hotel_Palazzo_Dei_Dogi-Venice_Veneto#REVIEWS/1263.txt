I agree with other reviewers, this is a beautiful hotel in a quiet area with astounding gardens and great service. However, we were on the 4th floor and it was HOT! We also opened windows for air and awoke to swarms of mosquitoes chewing on us during the night. Not pleasant. We asked and the front desk told us about the AC rules but just shrugged off our comment about the room temperature. Everything else about it was fine but I might shop around depending on time of year.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
