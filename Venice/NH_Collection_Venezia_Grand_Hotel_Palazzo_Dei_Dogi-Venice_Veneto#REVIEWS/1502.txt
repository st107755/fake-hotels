We have travelled a lot and stay in good hotels but this hotel was unbelievable bad. For a 5 star hotel the service was terriblwe. 40 degrees and no airconditioning and no action at all from the hotel staff to make any effort. No suttle bus to the San marco as promissed. Breakfast at a 3 star standard. Do not order room service and think you will get what is in the folder, forget it. Eur 20,00 for a plain toast. After complains not even one single reaction. This should not be a 5 star hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2010HelpfulShare
