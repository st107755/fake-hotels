Dei Dogei is ideally placed when arriving from Marco Polo - Orange Line Waterbus has it first arrivel point only 100 meter from the hotel. The Hotel is clean and the sorroundings - especially the garden, are very peaceful in a hectic city. The staff very helpful - only one little lady at the front-desk - was arrogant and the arrogance was a bad way of trying to hide she was incapable to make the job - a reservation to a concert - the next took over in an effective and smiling way. rgds danish visitorsRead moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
