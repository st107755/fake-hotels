My husband and I were stayed at this amazing hotel for one night. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. We were suprised at how big the room was too. The staff encouraged us to go outside and walk around the gardens and it was like a secret garden, quite enchanted and to keep walking to the end to see the boats arriving into Venice - spectacular. The hotel also has a complimentary boat service to the Grand Canal as well. We were the only ones on the boat, and it was beautiful to watch the sun set whilst arriving on the Grand Canal. Whilst it's not in the heart of Venice, the service at this hotel, the standard of the rooms and the facilities make it special!Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare
