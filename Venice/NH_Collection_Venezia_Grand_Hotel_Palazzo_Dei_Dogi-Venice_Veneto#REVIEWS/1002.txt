We took the Alilaguna from the airport and it was a short 3-5 minute walk to the hotel from Madonna del Orto.  On the way back to the airport, we were passed by full boats so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to return to the airport.  We stayed here four nights and had an amazing time.  All the staff was amazingly helpful when we needed them; such as asking for directions or dinner reservations/recommendations.  We arrived shortly before checkin but our rooms were ready and we were taken up  by the front desk attendant who showed us the AC and other features.  The rooms were amazingly beautiful.  The room was very clean and beautifully furnished and was huge for Venice standards.  The gardens are also amazing to walk around in with lots of little places to explore. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare
