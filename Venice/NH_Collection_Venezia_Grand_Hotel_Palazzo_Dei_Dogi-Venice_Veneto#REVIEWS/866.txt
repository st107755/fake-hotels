What a dream come true.  So easy to get to from Marco Polo airport.  Grab the shuttle which is about a 7 min walk from the airport.  It's the first stop and then a 3 min walk from the boat stop.  Great staff.  Our only complaint are the pigeons.  They are ruthless.  They love to hop on your table and eat whatever they can grab easily.  Our room was spacious and clean and lovely.  The bath was bigger than any we have had in Europe.  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner in their elegant and small dining room.  Can't wait to try other Boscolo's.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare
