The Good: - Rooms decorated like an Italian palace.  Very large and very nice. - Location.  Not located in the middle of the "action".  It was nice being on the outskirts of the city. - 10 to 15 minute walk to the train station.  The Bad: - Location.  30 minute walk to get to the center of the "action". - Air conditioning was non-existent.  We left our window open to get some fresh air at night and were eaten alive by the mosquitoes. - Our room was on the second floor and was just above the kitchen....very loud.  We'd stay here again, but would look more closely at other options next time we're in Venice.  Still recommended.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare
