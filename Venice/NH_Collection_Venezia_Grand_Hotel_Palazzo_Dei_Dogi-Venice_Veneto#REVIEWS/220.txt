We stayed at this Marriott property in April, 2018 when it was called the Boscola Venezia.  The facility was shabby at best and the staff were consistently unacceptable.  This was the poorest excuse for a five star hotel we experienced in our otherwise successful 19 day, four city visit to Italy.  I doubt they could have totally refurbished the interior and hired a completely new staff in less than three months.  A new name will not change the poor quality of stay you will probably experience.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 10, 2018Dear KenCage, I would like to express my sincere apologies for your dissatisfaction with your recent experience during your stay at our property. Our guests are our upmost priority and strive to ensure that every client has an enjoyable time at our Hotel. I was concerned to discover that we could not deliver on your expectations on five stars services and I feel sorry that you were disappointed with our roomâ€™s product and some of the interactions you had with our team. In particular I have been surprised to understand that you had a poor experience with the staff, of which we are very proud and that  has been recently recognized as one of the best team among Europe Marriott properties.   I assure you that should your steps ever lead you back to Venice, I would be glad to regain your trust, both in terms of services and facilities and treat you as our most valued guest.  Kind regards,  Chiara Zambianchi Deputy Manager Read more
