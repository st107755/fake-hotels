We really enjoyed this hotel.  It's quiet, in Cannaregio, you enter into a spacious atrium with Venetium glass chandeleirs.  We liked the fact that it's off the beaten track, a thirty minute walk from St Mark's Square.  We took the launch once but walked the rest of the time.  Our room faced the canal, a delightful site when we woke up.  The breakfast was lavish.  We ate once in the restaurant, which was good, but the rest of the time we found quiet places nearby that were full of the (few) native Venetians.  The spa is good, and the jacuzzi is large and free. We got an excellent deal through Voyage Privee.  Venice wasn't all I'd hoped for, but I'd go to this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
