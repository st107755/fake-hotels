My husband and I stayed in Venice at the Boscolo for 1 week prior to our cruise using our points. The hotel was wonderful. Quiet and relaxing, off the tourist path. Even though we had a problem with the water pressure (too hot or cold) they did try to fix the problem. The staff was more than accommodating. We stayed on the 4th floor with a wonderful view of the canal and the sunsets. Everything was within walking distance or public transportation.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from VeneziaManager, Front Office Manager at NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo Dei DogiResponded Jul 4, 2015Dear Valued Customer, I would like to thank you, on behalf of the entire Boscolo Venezia team, for reviewing your recent stay at Boscolo Venezia.
