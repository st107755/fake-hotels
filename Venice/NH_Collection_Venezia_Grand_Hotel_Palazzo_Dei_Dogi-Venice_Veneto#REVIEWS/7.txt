Venice was very very quite as a result of COVID19 and the hotel must have been under 30% full but the staff were so keen to see tourists and happy to help with anything.  The spa was closed so I canâ€™t comment on that but the breakfast was certainly in my top 10.  We had a junior suite with two levels which was great with kids and the hotel looked after the children really well. The rooms were lovely and not your stock standard boiler plate hotel room so it was a welcome change. Took a water taxi to the hotel which is the best way to go. Hotel had a free water shuttle to the main square a few times a day which was a great feature. Would recommend hotel for a trip to Venice.
