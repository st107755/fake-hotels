This luxury boutique hotel is located near the San Stea vaporetto station, about 10min walking from the Rialto bridge and 15min frim the train station. It is a quiter area than the San Marco tourist hub.  This 18 rooms hotel has a garden by its entrance and a second  right on the Canale Grande, which is unfrequent. The building is a palace transformed in a hotel in 2016 by the taiwanese LDC group.  Our room was new, with even a smell of fresh varnish. The decoration and the furniture were chosen in accordance with the style of the palace. There is a music room on the first floor with many antiques.  The complimentary breakfast is fantastic. The reception staff is very nice. We loved our stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from Alice D, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear longtravel09, We would like to sincerely thank you for your kind comment.
