Palazzo Venart stands out by reason of it's superb canal side garden which offers privacy with canal views and it's top ranking quality of service which I thought was better than that at peers like the Belmond hotels. The quality of the decor, rooms and food were as you'd expect from this rating of hotel (ie. really rather lovely!). I'd say this is a hotel to indulge in some water taxis so you an enjoy swopping in from the canal side entrance rather than flogging by foot over the crowded Rialto Bridge.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Nov 3, 2017Dear 350ellison, The whole team and I are sending you our heartfelt thanks for your wonderful review!
