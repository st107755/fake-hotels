Recently stayed at Venart with my family.  Having been to Venice a few times before this hotel was fantastic.  Staff was very accommodating, extremely friendly, and very helpful in every request.  The food at the Michelin Star restaurant was nothing short of spectacular and the rooms were well appointed, very clean.  On top of that the overall feel as a boutique hotel was incredibly romantic and inviting and its location made getting around Venice very easy.  We witnessed a wedding at the property in the grand entrance off the canal that was one of the most beautiful ceremonies we have seen.  Would highly recommend and will definitely be staying here again the next time I visit!Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jun 7, 2018Dear wcoker, Many many thanks for sharing your kind review!
