The Hotel is beautiful, feels discreet and private with a cosy, bespoke feel to it. We decided to have dinner there and had the â‚¬90 pp tasting menu which was incredible and frankly quite a lot better than some of the Michelin Star restaurants that I've eaten at in Milan. I loved the garden and taking a private water taxi ride back to the Hotel down the Grand Canal after 3:30pm in the afternoon is highly recommended, we had the entire canal to ourselves at one point which was amazing. My only gripe was the classic room which was quite small and a little dark (although beautifully furnished) - I think it's probably well worth upgrading to a larger, brighter room in future.
