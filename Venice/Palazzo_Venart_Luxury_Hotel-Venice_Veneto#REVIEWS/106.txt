We visited Venice and this hotel for my girlfriends 30th birthday, we both loved it.  + Staff are truly brilliant, they make you feel very special, 5* service at its best. + The restaurant food is fabulous, go for the taster it's a joy. The wine was tasty and reasonably priced, the sommelier was helpful and knowledgable. Our evening dinner there was very memorable.  - Not clearly signposted, if you don't arrive by water taxi at the front you can expect to walk around in circles for a while, even using google maps.
