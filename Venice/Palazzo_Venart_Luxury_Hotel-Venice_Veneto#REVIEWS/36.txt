We absolutely loved this hotel.  Everything was just perfect.  It was immaculately clean, the service was spot on, the flowers, the garden, the venetian glasses in the restaurants, the rooms, the flowers, the location.  There could not be better.  We stayed in a Luxury Suite Open Plan.  I felt like I was a royalty in that room, so special.  The Palazzo was right on the Canal with a lovely garden located very close to all the attractions that you need to see when in Venice.  I couldn't imagine a better place to stay and we hope to return very soon.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, General Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Feb 23, 2019Dear Emmafivestar,  We are very delighted to read  such rewarding words and we really thank you for taking your time to share with us your comment.
