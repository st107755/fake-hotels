we spent three nights at the palazzo. the place is a world class luxury hotel. the staff was terrific, and very helpful. the place is immaculate. great breakfast. our room was small, but a gem, with a large private terrace. beautiful linens. comfortable bed. bathroom was very nice, great water pressure and temp.  i would recommend this hotel to my family. it is a true 5 star experience.
