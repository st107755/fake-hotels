I’m a pretty picky person and I have to say this hotel was so lovely ! The room to face the canal was great . The best part is you didn’t hear anyone next to you because it’s a corner room . It only has 18 rooms so it feels very boutique like which I prefer . Everyone knows who you are and bends over backwards to make sure you are happy . We ate at the restaurant two nights out of the 3 we were there , it was excellent . We loved it here !
