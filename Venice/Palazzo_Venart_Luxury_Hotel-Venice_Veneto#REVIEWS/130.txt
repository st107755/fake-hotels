Stayed here at the start of October 2016 but only just getting round to writing the review now. My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Venice for my 21st birthday and I couldn't have been happier to stay at this amazing hotel. Palazzo Venart is beautiful, is in a good location and the staff are very helpful. Our room was lovely and had a terrace area too, I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. Very luxurious!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jan 10, 2017Dear Hannah B, We would like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to share your comments regarding your stay at Palazzo Venart.
