We have just returned from a wonderful week staying at the Palazzo Venart.  The hotel was a peaceful oasis to return to after a busy day enjoying the Biennale and the amazing sights of Venice.  The staff were helpful and attentive, the room (whilst having no view) was quiet and tastefully appointed and the location, right next to the water taxi stop, was ideal.  We only ate in the hotel on one evening, but the food was exceptional and beautifully presented, the whole experience was thoroughly memorable. The only minor improvement I think they could make is to provide tea/coffee making fascilities in the room - otherwise perfect!Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded May 29, 2017Dear Amanda W, We would like to sincerely thank you for sharing such a great review after your recent stay at Palazzo Venart!
