What an exceptional experience! The hotel itself is stunning but it's really the staff that seals the deal. The best service we have ever received, from drinks in the library on our first night, to a day trip to Murano and Burano, dinner in their Michelin star restaurant Glam and aperitifs in the rear court as we were leaving, Palazzo Venart delivered!  Thank you to all the staff for their never ending service during our stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Oct 7, 2018Dear kymsim,  We are so happy to know that you enjoyed the peaceful and strategic location of the hotel, and we hope it has now become your "hidden home" in Venice.
