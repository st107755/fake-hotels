Staying at Palazzo Venart, i  discovered the most charming boutique hotel i ever visited.  You enter into Palazzo Venart, a hideaway in one small street near the Canale Grande, you open those big iron doors and besided a Michelin Stars Restaurant, the full setting takes you away in time and imagination.
