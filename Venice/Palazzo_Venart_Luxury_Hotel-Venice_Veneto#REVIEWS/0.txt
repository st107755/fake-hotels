This beautiful palazzo in the Santa Croce area of Venice is within 10 minutesâ€™ walk of the Rialto but is a haven of quiet luxury. Perfectly positioned to sample all that La Serenissima has to offer without the crowds. A hidden luxurious gem on a par with the big name hotels with a more manageable price tag. Highly recommended.
