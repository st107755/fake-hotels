I found this place through American Express Travel, and it is a gem.  This is an old palace that was renovated about 3 years ago and turned into an 18 room hotel.  The rooms are magnificent.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  They recommended some local casual restaurants nearby, that were both great.  They organized a tour to Burano and Murano.  And the hotel is only about 15 minutes walk to San Marco Wquare.  Excellent all around.  Breakfast was included and since the restaurant has a Michelin starred restaurant, the service and quality was amazing.  The only choice for dinner was this same Michelin starred restaurant - Glam, which we did not eat at.  The tasting menus were 120-150 euros per person each, and it would have been nice to have a more casual restaurant available.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart team at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Oct 20, 2019Dear 926lindsayd We would like to thank you sincerely for your wonderful review!
