We have a lovely stay at the Palazzo Venart from the reception staff to the room the whole package was 5 star + . The location is great just out of the hustle and bustle of Venice but easily walkable to Rialto and St Marks if you wish .  They arrange taxis to and from the airport . Go by private boat it just makes it all so special .  I would recommend this hotel without a doubt .   We will certainly return thank you very much .Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded May 2, 2017Dear jono3987, We would like to thank you very much for posting a fabulous review! It is great to read that you fully enjoyed your stay at Palazzo Venart and that you appreciated our ideal location, with many of Venice's must-see sights just a short walk away, and an adjacent water bus stop for quick and easy access across the city. And, as you mentioned, a private boat that drops you off and picks you up at our private pier is definitely an exclusive touch! Thank you for mentioning our lovely team as well, we'll keep doing our best to make our Guests happy!  Looking forward to welcoming you back in the future, we say..."Arrivederci"! Alice Dionisio . and the Palazzo Venart team  Read more
