Beautiful small hotel located on the Grand Canal away from the crowed tourist area but within walking distance of everything that Venice has to offer. We started off in a spacious room on the ground floor but were moved to a room on the third floor with balcony and views of the charming neighborhood. A small room but lovely. Our reservations included breakfast which was wonderful and served in a charming dining room over looking the hotel’s courtyard. We had drinks one night in the second floor “Lounge” which was unbelievable in it’s rich Venetian decor and furnishings.    We will stay at the Palazzo Venart on our next trip to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart team at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 7, 2019Dear VimMcG, thank you for your lovely review! We think you really got the point when you say that we are away from the crowds but close to the main attractions of Venice. All our rooms have a distinct personality and we are glad that you loved your, either for the size or for the view. Since the breakfast is a delicate and important moment of the stay, it is paramount that our Guests' day begins in the best way. We are therefore proud of our a-la-carte breakfast, where relax and taste meet. The lounge at "Piano Nobile" is always available for our Guests to chill down after a day exploring, and we are glad that you took the opportunity to admire its restored decor. We look forward to welcome you again in Palazzo Venart Kindest regards  The Palazzo Venart teamRead more
