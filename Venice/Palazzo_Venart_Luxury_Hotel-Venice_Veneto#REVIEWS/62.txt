Beautiful boutique hotel with welcoming, professional, motivated staff, and a fantastic restaurant. We stayed for the weekend and enjoyed our stay in Venice mostly due to the fact that Venart was like a little oasis. Magnificent historical property, attentive service â€“ the front desk and Giacomo and Co., went more than the extra mile..five star experience!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 8, 2018Dear agnemarti,  Thank you again for sharing your positive feedback!
