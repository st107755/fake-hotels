A truly great hotel in a fantastic location on on the Grand Canal. The cuisine at Glam by Enrico Bartolini is superb. The hotel makes you feel like you are spending the weekend at the family home of a Count or Duke. The service and cocktails are superb. The decor and garden is a gem. The airport transfer is seamless. All of Venice is at your doorstep. The front office staff is very helpful. Truly a joy to be there and I will go back at every opportunity I have . Would recommend to anyone who wants to experience Venice at its bestRead moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jun 7, 2018Dear Vivek R,  On behalf of the General Manager and our team, I would like to thank you immensely for the wonderful review you have shared!
