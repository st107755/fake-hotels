Stunningly beautiful and ornate hotel with real wow factor. Very friendly informative staff who arranged roses, water taxis, restaurant reservations etc. Had a fantastic time and the room(s) we stayed in were both beautiful. Communal areas are wonderfully decorated and breakfast was delivious and beautifully presented. Everything from the bedsheets to the mini bar has been tastefully selected. Loved it :) Really enjoyed our stay and would love to return. Would your girlfriend like this hotel?
