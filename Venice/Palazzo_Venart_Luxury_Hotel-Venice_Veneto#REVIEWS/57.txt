You are in a very luxury hotel but they make you feel like home. Beautiful and clean big rooms in a cozy area but within easy walking distance to major attractions. Great staff esp the team at the Glam restaurant where they serve their breakfast as well. Please have a dinner here to feel the passion and enthusiasm of the chef, rather than those tourist foods flooded in the city.
