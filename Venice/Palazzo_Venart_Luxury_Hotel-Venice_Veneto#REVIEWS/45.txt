The hotel is  conveniently located: just a 2 min walk to the Vaporetto-Stop San Stae.  The staff is friendly and attentive, especially the breakfast-team, however, they are somehow too formal and stiff when dealing with the guests. Some of the rooms are dark and very small, in particular the less expensive ones. The restaurant holds a Michelin Star and provides the appropriate menu (and corresponding prices, even for breakfast). Be prepared for minimalist plates.  Nice courtyards. Very plushy ambience, excessively decorated, but still transmits a cold feel. Will not return.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Nov 18, 2018Dear 7th-urbanite, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback after your recent stay. We are glad to read that you enjoyed the convenient location of Palazzo Venart and the attitude of our staff, especially at breakfast. As you mentioned, our Glam restaurant has one Michelin star and we are happy that you had the opportunity to experience our chefâ€™s unique menu, based on his great attention to fresh and selected ingredients, as well as his creative talent. On a less positive note, we are sad to learn that your overall experience did not fully meet your expectations. We have passed your comments on our rooms' light design to our senior management for future consideration, and we apologise for any inconvenience due to our staff's attitude. Our team's friendly and genuine approach is often considered our main strength by our guests, so I am truly sad to note that on this occasion we apparently failed to show our intention. I sincerely hope that we will have a chance to welcome you back and make sure you live a better experience with us. Wishing you our best regards, Alice Dionisio - and the Palazzo Venart Team Read more
