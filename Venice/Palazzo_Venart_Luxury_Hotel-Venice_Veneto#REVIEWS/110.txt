Arrived via pre arranged water taxi from airport. Expensive for what it was and probably could have done it via public transport but a quick and easy trip via grand canal to hotels own jetty. Met there by hotel staff, nice start. Easy quick check in to a beautiful boutique hotel. Classic room was beautiful too with lovely balcony, very large with comfy furniture, though not overlooking much. Staff brilliant and breakfast served outside.  Really could not fault anything. They arranged a water taxi for two hours around Venice which was really the best way to see all of this truly amazing city! Thank you to all of you there for a great stay.
