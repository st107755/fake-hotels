Because of the birthday of my girlfriend and another special occassion, I wanted a luxury hotel in Venice, away from the tourists but close to the Center. This hotel has it all. Really easy to reach with the Vaparetto (only 3 minute walk after arriving at San Stae) and minutes away from the famous Rialto Bridge. The staff was extremely friendly and professional and arranged a birthday cake for her and a bottle of Prosecco. Thank you again!   The rooms were really clean, and beautifully decorated. My girlfriend loved it!   The breakfast was also amazing with a Nice menu and Some special treats.  Can not say enough how we love the hotel and would definitely come back again!Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Nov 23, 2016Dear Peter E, We warmly thank you for your wonderful comment!
