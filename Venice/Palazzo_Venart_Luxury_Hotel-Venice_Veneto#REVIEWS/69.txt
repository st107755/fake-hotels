We spent a long weekend in Venice and booked Palazzo Venart after discovering it on our previous visit (while eating at Restaurant Glam). From the moment we walked in the hotel, we felt absolutely like Venetian nobility (thank you Giacomo and team for a caring, efficient and personalised service). We enjoyed a superb suite with canal view, the calm of the lovely gardens, and the beauty of the interior decoration (don't miss the golden altarpiece in the corridor of the second floor). The reception staff managed to get us two front seats in the Royal Lodge of the Fenice for La Traviata, and made excellent museum recommendations. By far, the best hotel we have stayed at in Venice. Also easily accessible (2 min from San Stae vaporetto stop).
