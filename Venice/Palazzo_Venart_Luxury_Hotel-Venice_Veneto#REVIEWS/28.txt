You are in for a treat ! This palace is a gem of note. Our room was majestic, with the best of everything in tastefully chosen furniture and appropriate decorations to match. You transcend the experience, and with the beautiful view of the garden and canal, one can only marvel at this well set out Venecian palace. Possibly its only drawback was the lack of a coffee maker in the room, but the senses were overwhelmed with its magic. You will not regret a visit to this gem.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, General Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded May 4, 2019Dear Trek741599, We are really impressed by your outstanding review.
