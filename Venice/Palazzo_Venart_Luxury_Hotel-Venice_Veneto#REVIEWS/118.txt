For a unique special experience look no further. We spent 3 nights here. Hidden away in a quiet location but 15 minutes walk to Rialto bridge and very close to St Stae vaperetto. The room was great.....like a elegant room in a castle but with the modern touch. Breakfast relaxed...staff super friendly in every section. We ate at the Glam restaurant recently set up by a michelin star chef. It was outstanding and no doubt will get at least one michelin star. Would definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Apr 26, 2017Dear londoncalling2016, We would like to sincerely thank you for sharing your positive comments after your recent stay!
