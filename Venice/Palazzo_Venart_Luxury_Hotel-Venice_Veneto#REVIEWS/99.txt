This hotel was a hidden gem, a rarity in Venice. Somewhat removed from the chaos of the tourist centers, it was a beautiful and well-designed respite. The grounds overlooking the Grand Canal were beautiful, and we enjoyed an exquisite breakfast in the lovely quiet courtyard garden. The building was formerly a palace, and they did an admirable job of redesigning, from beautiful original ceilings, to the creative use of space within the room; the second floor was like a museum.The staff were all very helpful and friendly and offered great dining and touring suggestions.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Sep 10, 2017Dear Ellie H, Many thanks for your positive comment!
