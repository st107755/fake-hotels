Venice was our last stop in our visit of Italy.  Palazzo Venart did not disappoint.  Their restaurant has 1 Michelin star and it shows!  The water taxi took us from the airport directly to the hotel.  That was a wonderful experience.  The hotel manager greeted us personally.  Breakfast was not the buffets we had in other hotels, but made to order.  When we said we were in a rush, they rushed our meal but did not compromise one bit on quality.  We took the hotel shuttle to the island of Murano where we were treated to a glass blowing demonstration.  Excellent in every way!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart team at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 7, 2019Dear anybody_10, the General Manager and all the staff would like to thank you for sharing your experience at Palazzo Venart.
