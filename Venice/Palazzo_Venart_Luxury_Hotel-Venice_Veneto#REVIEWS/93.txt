A beautiful hotel, a little away from the centre (the Casino is across the other side of the canal), with a lovely garden facing the Grand Canal, and a quiet courtyard behind.  The welcome from Sr Rizzi and his team was very friendly and the service throughout our stay was outstanding, The GLAM restaurant was quite exceptional - surely a future Michelin star or two - our only issue being the size of the tasting menu, which was almost too much for us.  Our room was quite small, but totally individual, and the salon on the second floor was in any event a beautiful place to relax with a drink.  Finally, when the airport waterbus left us stranded, the front of house team organised a water taxi within minutes - the perfect way to leave!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Oct 23, 2017Dear David R, On behalf of the whole team at Palazzo Venart, I would like to thank you much for sharing your positive comments about your experience with us.
