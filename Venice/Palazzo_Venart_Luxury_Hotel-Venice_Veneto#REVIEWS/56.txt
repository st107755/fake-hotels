Tremendous experience beginning with the arrival on the grand canal at the garden leading to the hotel. Beautiful, luxurious room—only issue was limited natural light. Dinner at Glam and breakfast in the garden was superb. Staff was very accommodating and professional—especially the concierge. Really liked the location (less than a 10 minute was to the Rialto Bridge) because it was very quiet and felt less touristy.
