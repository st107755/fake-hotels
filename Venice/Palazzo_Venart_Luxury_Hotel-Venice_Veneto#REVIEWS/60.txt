Last weekend my wife and I celebrated our 25th anniversary in Venice and we decided to stay at Palazzo Venart. What an amazing experience. Mr. Rizzi, the Hotel Director, and his staff did everything to make our stay unforgettable, from our welcome to our departure. Our room, over-looking the private garden and Grand Canal, was magical and made it hard to leave during the day. We enjoyed the GLAM restaurant, especially the romantic appetitive in the Garden. Looking forward to returning soon!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 8, 2018Dear Mr Timothy O,  We would like to thank you so much for sharing your wonderful review after your recent stay!
