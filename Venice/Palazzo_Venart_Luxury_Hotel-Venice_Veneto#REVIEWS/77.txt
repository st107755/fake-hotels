I stayed at the enchanting Palazzo Venart - a Leading Hotels of the World - for two nights during this week. It was pure luxury at every turn! Venart is a stunner, a true 5 star luxury boutique hotel with a privileged location on the Grand Canal, right in front of the Venice Casino. Glided stuccos, sumptous boiseries, fresh beautiful flowers...it really took my breath away. Thanks to all the staff: attention to detail is their must! I will come back and will of course recommend!Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Apr 2, 2018Dear HonoraryPraguer,  Thank you so much for your beautiful review, it was so kind of you to share!
