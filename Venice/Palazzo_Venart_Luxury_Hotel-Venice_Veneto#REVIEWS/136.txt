We are happy to read that our location perfectly suited to your needs, and we also think that it is quite a privilege to enjoy Venice from a nice and more peaceful perspective - still at a stone's throw from the main attractions. Many thanks also for your kind words regarding our staff: we were all absolutely delighted to be part of your Venetian experience and to give you our contribution! With regards to our Classic room, which you correctly described as our standard category, we are happy that you could enjoy the terrace: at Palazzo Venart every room is unique and different from the other ones, and surely a private terrace is a nice benefit for our less spacious rooms. You are more than welcome to try our Restaurant GLAM for dinner next time - our chef will spoil you! Please do not hesitate to contact us directly upon your next booking. Looking forward to welcoming you back. All the best, Alice Dionisio - and the Palazzo Venart teamRead more
