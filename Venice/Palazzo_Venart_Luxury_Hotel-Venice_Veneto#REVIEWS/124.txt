What a wonderful hotel! Arriving by water taxi from the airport the hotel is only a 1 minute walk from the San Stae stop, but hidden away down an alleyway from the everyday bustle. We were greeted by the wonderful general manager Angelo Rizzi and we were lucky enough to be shown to the Dandolo suite which overlooked the Grand canal. The hotel has been sumptuously renovated, with ornate furnishings and gave the feeling of what it would have been like to live in luxury in Venice during its heyday. The staff were without exception delightful being discreetly attentive.  We ate in the hotel on our 2nd night, the food was stunningly presented and the combination of textures and flavours was imaginative and delicious. Definitively a place to stay again on our next visit.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Direttore at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Mar 14, 2017Dear endhanney,  What a wonderful review!
