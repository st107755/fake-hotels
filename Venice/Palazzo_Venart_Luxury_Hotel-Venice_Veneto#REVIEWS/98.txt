We absolutely loved our stay at Palazzo Venart. While it was a bit of a walk away from the main tourist sites in San Marco, we actually enjoyed walking through Venice's small streets and canals, we found so many incredible and interesting shops and restaurants along the way, and really got to see a more "local" side of Venice going back and forth from the hotel. Also, the San Stae vaporetto stop is literally around the corner, so it is actually very convenient. It was just lovely to come home to such a beautiful hotel / palazzo away from the hordes of tourists in San Marco. There are some great restaurants in the area that are well priced and very authentic.  The hotel is beautifully updated, and the service is incredible. We upgraded to a better room facing the Grand Canalâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Sep 20, 2017Dear Julia S, We would like to thank you sincerely for posting your fabulous review! It is great to read that you fully enjoyed your stay at Palazzo Venart and that you particularly appreciated our ideal location - we are glad to know that our guests can relax in our peaceful garden after a long day visiting in Venice. Many must-see sights are just a short walk away and still you have a chance to wander in less known paths and discover another side of the city.  We are happy to read that you liked the comfort of our rooms, the little touches, and the decor of our renovated palace. It took some years to bring it back to life again and we are proud of the result! Thank you so much for sharing your precious comments. We all look forward to welcoming you back in the future and wish you our best regards! Alice Dionisio, and the Palazzo Venart teamRead more
