My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Palazzo Venart, we both loved it so much we didn't  want to return home. We can't wait to go back again.   The hotel has everything you'd expect from a property of this class. Comfortable rooms, beautiful furnishings, excellent food, etc.   However, what elevates the hotel into a league of its own is the staff. Everyone who works at the Palazzo Venart - managers, front desk, restaurant even the room cleaning staff are professional, polite, welcoming and more. I can't speak highly enough of the people at the Palazzo Venart, they make the hotel truly special.Read moreDate of stay: January 2019HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, General Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jan 13, 2019Dear Mitchll,  What a pleasure to receive your lovely review following your recent stay!
