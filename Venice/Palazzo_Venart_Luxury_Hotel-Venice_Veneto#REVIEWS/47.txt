Once you get off the water taxi, you know you are in a special place. We were greeted by the manager who introduced himself to us and offered his services to us. Our accomodations were small but very well appointed and luxurious. The hotel has a Michelin star restaurant which we did not use. There are plenty of other excellent restaurants nearby. The hotel otherwise is totally outside the maddening crowds of Venice but within walking distance of the Rialto and St Mark's square. Highly recommend.
