Palazzo Venart is a gem of a hotel situated on the north side of the Grand Canal, it manages to be both grand and intimate at the same time.  The decor is pure Venetian decadence whislt not being too overbearing, the gardens are immaculate and the location ideal for experiencing all that Venice has to offer.The staff are superb, beyond helpful without being intrusive and restaurant GLAM is one of the finest dining experiences I have had in the world.  My partner was heavily pregnant during our trip and the staff and restaurant could not have done more to be accommodating.  If you are considering staying here, then do, you will struggle to find a finer experience in Venice.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: November 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, General Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Dec 19, 2018Dear  Pioneer55317551697,  thank you for having shared your comment with us.
