We spent 3 nights at Palazzo Venart this weekend and it was a wonderful base to explore Venice from. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the room was very well appointed. We loved the bar upstairs and had it to ourselves the night we arrived for drinks and antipasti with cheese. The breakfast was amazing and a lengthy affair. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and even agreed to a few off menu breakfast requests. We canâ€™t wait to return!
