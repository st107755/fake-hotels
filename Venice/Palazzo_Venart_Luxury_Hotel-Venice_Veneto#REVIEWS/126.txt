We are delighted to read that you had a pleasant time while staying at Palazzo Venart, that you were positively impressed by our recently opened hotel and - above all - by our staff's attitude. This is the best compliment that you could ever pay us! As you rightly mentioned, visiting Venice in winter offers a different perspective of the city, which can be fascinating. Nevertheless, we do hope that you will be able to come back next year in a different season, so you can enjoy a dinner with Grand Canal view from our beautiful garden! It's been a great pleasure meeting you personally and we all look forward to welcome you back soon. Wishing you all the best, Angelo Rizzi - and the Palazzo Venart teamRead more
