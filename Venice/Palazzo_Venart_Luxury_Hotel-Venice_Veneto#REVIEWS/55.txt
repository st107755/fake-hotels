We stayed in our room the majority of the time while at this hotel, because it was THAT GOOD, and Venice is THAT CROWDED. Seriously, get a bottle of prosecco and relax here. It's the way to go. Beautiful grounds, off the beaten path. It's in a quiet, more local neighborhood which we really liked. The only reason we'll come back to Venice is for this spot.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear Trevor J,  thank you for taking the time to share your kind review...we just loved your straightforward comment! :)  It is very important for us to know that you had a chance to enjoy some relaxing time in our hotel despite the "hustle and bustle" in Venice and we really hope we played our part in making your Venetian visit more memorable!
