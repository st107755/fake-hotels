Palazzo Venart is an exceptional boutique hotel. A special place for a treat. Service and staff are excellent. As is the Glam restaurant and daily breakfast in the courtyard. Thoroughly recommend arriving by water taxi - being dropped at the hotel jetty makes for a fine arrival. We stayed in the Murano room. It was nicely appointed and very clean. Itâ€™s is one of their smaller rooms but also offers a lovely balcony overlooking the Venice rooftops. We will definitely return.Read moreReview collected in partnership with The Leading Hotels of the WorldDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear David T, We would like to send you our heartfelt "thank you" for sharing such a lovely comment!
