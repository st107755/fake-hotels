My wife and I spent 5 days at the Palazzo Venart and had the chance to see a lot of Venice and are looking forward to going back to visit again. The hotel staff at Palazzo Venart was extremely attentive and helped us have a special experience in Venice. They will help you with everything and make sure to try out their wonderful restaurant "Gema". It's amazing and well priced for an upscale menu.
