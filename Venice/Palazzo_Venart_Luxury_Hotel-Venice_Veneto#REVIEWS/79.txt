My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel in November. This was my second time visiting Venice, and I really enjoyed this location versus the hustle near St. Marks Square.  The bed was more comfortable than mine at home, air con worked perfectly, beautiful bathroom and very nice toiletries.  Breakfast at the hotel was very delicious - just don't expect to get in and out quickly. The staff also was very helpful with arranging dinner reservations, airport transfer and our day trip to Murano.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Feb 13, 2018Dear Kelsey, Many thanks for your beautiful review!
