Stepping off the water taxi to this beautiful hideaway luxury boutique hotel was an amazing find. It is a peaceful place to slow down the pace of life. Breakfast especially typifies this with leisurely presentation of Italian a la carte choices. The rooms are interesting & a very nice standard. Staff are friendly and helpful. I would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: August 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Aug 16, 2019Thank you so much for your positive review!
