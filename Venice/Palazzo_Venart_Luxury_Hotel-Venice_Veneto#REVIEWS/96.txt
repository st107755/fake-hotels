Stay in Palazzo Venart for 3 days before boarding The Queen Victoria cruise in Venice.  Already heard that the service of this hotel is good, the actual experience was that the hotel service was impeccable the minute me and my wife impeccable arrived by water taxi from the airport.  The hotel staff greeted me in he front gate and check me in swiftly, not only the room was clean and nicely decorated, the services was extended to me and my wife with great care by each and everything staff (from reception, room service to restaurant).  Breakfast and dinner were also nicely  served and the food quality and preparation were excellent.  Worth to mention that I ran into the General Manager Angelo Rizzi on the date of my departure, from him I understood why the service was Impeccable. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Sep 20, 2017Dear Analdo, On behalf of the General Manager and our team, I would like to thank you immensely for the beautiful review you have shared!
