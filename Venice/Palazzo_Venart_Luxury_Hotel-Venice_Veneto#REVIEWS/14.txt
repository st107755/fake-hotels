Excellent quaint place, very quiet but hospitable. The breakfast out in the small garden was a delight with two very attentive persons and an excellent chef. The larger room was luxurious, the smaller, a bit claustrophobic and needed more light. The dinner at the restaurant downstairs was fit for royalty!! By the time we stopped admiring and eating up all that came with the chef's compliments, there was hardly any space left for the main meal. The dessert was followed by another masterpiece - another compliment!! Would recommend this place to all who like to stay in hotels with character and history!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Sep 25, 2019Dear Kuntolini1, thank you very much for your kind words!
