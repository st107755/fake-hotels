Let's being with the General Manager who greets you, Angelo Rizzo, who is extremely pleasant, dignified and well spoken and dressed!  He, and others like Jocomo, made our stay personal and attentive to details.  The room was well appointed, clean and well serviced.  The location is also ideal, away from the hustle & bustle of Venice proper, and yet within easy walking to the Royale Bridge and a little farther from the Piazza San Marco.  They also lined up an excellent guide of the city for us, and she was wonderful.  Of course, the Michelin Star Restaurant, Glam is located in this hotel, and the Maitre D was excellent also.  We had a very special and enjoyable time here, and look forward to returning sometime soon.Read moreDate of stay: June 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 27, 2019Dear Bruce C Thank you so much for posting a beautiful review of Palazzo Venart!
