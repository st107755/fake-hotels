This is a very magical hotel in a very magical city.  You feel like a guest in a private, elegant and tasteful estate carved away from the tourism mania of Venice.  Set back from the canal with a refreshing and green private garden, this intimate and refined setting is completely relaxing. Everything is charming and the food is excellent.  Take an apero in the grand room on the second floor and enjoy living in this incredible Venice palazzo for a little while. It's pretty dreamy.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Apr 26, 2017Dear Mara A, Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful review of Palazzo Venart!
