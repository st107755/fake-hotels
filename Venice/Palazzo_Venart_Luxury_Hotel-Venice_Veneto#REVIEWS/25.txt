I came at the beginning of April and I wanted to write and say a very big thank you to the General Manager, Angelo Rizzi and his team for a lovely stay at this stunning hotel which is in a really location in Venice.  I had the pleasure to come to this beautiful city with my two young daughters aged, 7 and 11 and the General Manager himself welcomed us and he really lights up the hotel with his warmth and smile. He is always walking around to make sure all the guests are very happy...nothing is too much trouble! General Manager was very kind and helpful.  I will definitely be back! As I organise weddings, I feel this is DEFINITELY a great setting for one!  Many thanks again for a wonderful stay!Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart team at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded May 17, 2019Dear love-to-travel-sun,  we are glad to read your comment and your lovely words towards our General Manager and our team.
