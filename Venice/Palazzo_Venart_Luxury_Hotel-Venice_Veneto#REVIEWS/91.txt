Our 3 night stay in Venice was delightful made especially so by the helpful staff at Venart. Although the palazzo has been modernized there are still a few small inconveniences that keep it from a 5. We especially liked this part of town which was not in the heavily tourist area by San Marco.  The gardens are a lovely place for a drink! Ask for a room with a Canal view- ours was not.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Responsabile reception at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Oct 24, 2017Dear IMB95, We would like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to share your beautiful review!
