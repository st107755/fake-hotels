Not sure how I even stumbled across this hotel as it is not yet highly ranked on TripAdvisor but I am so glad I did. Booked to celebrate our Pearl Wedding anniversary which had to be rescheduled after the loss of my father. Having my heart set on staying here the staff were fantastic in accommodating our change of dates and our room was simply magnificent.  Hotel is still in it's first year of opening, is spotlessly clean and is packed with art and antiquities that give it lots of character and opulence. All staff were fantastically helpful. The two young waiters in the restaurant work tirelessly to look after you. All hotel staff were immaculately presented and dressed in great uniforms.

And what a review! We’re so delighted to read that you had an enjoyable time in Venice on such a unique anniversary and that our young and passionate team was able to make a contribution to it. As you highlighted, we are not a well-known property yet, since we have opened less than one year ago, but we are so glad that somehow you heard of Palazzo Venart and decided to stay here. We all strive to provide the best possible experience to our guests... everyone at the front desk, the housekeeping, and our GLAM restaurant, which you enjoyed so much. Knowing that you received a warm and excellent service is the greatest compliment for us! It's been a pleasure to meet you personally and I sincerely hope that we will have the pleasure to welcome you back in the future! ARRIVEDERCI!  Warm regards, Alice Dionisio - and the Palazzo Venart & GLAM teamRead more
