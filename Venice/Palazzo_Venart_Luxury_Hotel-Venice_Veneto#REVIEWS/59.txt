WE stayed for 3 nights in this boutique hotel and enjoyed our stay immensely. The hotel faces the Grand Canal and is very close to San Stae ferry stop. We took a ferry from the train station to get to the hotel and it was very conveniently located with cafes and restaurants close by. The hotel is well hidden from the busy tourist traps with lovely gardens on the from t and rear of the property. The room was clean, spacious and private with period decoration. The only fault was when the bath room exhaust was on, it was a bit loud. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was served in one of the sunny and beautiful courtyard. Very attentive staff but perhaps not proficient in English as we waited for our breakfast for over one and half hours at our first breakfast.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Front Office Manager at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Jul 24, 2018Dear Tweedie888, We would like to thank you sincerely for taking the time to share your beautiful review!
