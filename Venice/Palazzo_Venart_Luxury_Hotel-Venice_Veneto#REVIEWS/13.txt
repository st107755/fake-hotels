A beautifully, recently renovated Venetian Palazzo on the Grand Canal, but away from the maddening crowds, in Santa Croce. The manager Angelo and his staff made this a beautiful experience. Our room was spacious and well appointed, and the breakfast, served in the garden by the waiters, was a highlight. The front desk staff were only too helpful, with restaurant ideas and shopping. We did a half day tour arranged through he hotel with Alvise that was excellent and recommended. When in Venice treat yourself to an experience and enjoy being able to retreat to this oasisRead moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare Response from PalazzoVenart, Palazzo Venart at Palazzo Venart Luxury HotelResponded Sep 25, 2019Dear 451craigs Thank you very much for your beautiful review of Palazzo Venart!
