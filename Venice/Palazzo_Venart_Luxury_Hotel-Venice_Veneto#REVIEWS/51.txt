Palazzo Venart exceeded our expectations in every way. From the location close enough to all the key attractions yet completely peaceful and away from the crowds, to the staff, to the incredible attention to detail they have lavished on the interior decoration, everything was perfect. Leaving the hotel by private speedboat to the airport must rank as the greatest airport transfer in the world! We'll certainly be back and would not recommend another place to stay in Venice.
