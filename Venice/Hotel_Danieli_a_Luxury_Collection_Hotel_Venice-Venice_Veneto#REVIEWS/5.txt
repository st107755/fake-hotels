I would suggest you not to stay at this hotel. I have experienced worst customer service ever!!   To start with: here is what happened.  I book the hotel for 2 nights at the end of APR 2020 with the total cost of 1084 euro. I plan to take my 65+ years old mum to Italy during Thailand long holiday.  However, given the outbreak of Covid-19, I have decided to cancel the trip for health reason (Covid- 19 is deadly for elder so I am concerned on the health of my mum as well as for myself).   I emailed the hotel on 25 FEB  to ask for a refund and explained to them that I shall postpone/ or cancel my trip. I am aware that I book under the non refundable condition" but again in this case, i feel that there should be an exception. Nonetheless, the hotel insist on charging full amountâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 202013 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
