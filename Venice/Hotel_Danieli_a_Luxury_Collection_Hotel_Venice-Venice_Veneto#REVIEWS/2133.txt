I only stayed here for 2 nights. It is a beautiful hotel. This is not a modern hotel. Do not expect a normal SPG experience, if you want that pick a newer hotel.

The room I had was small but comfortable.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 3, 2011Dear Rich2809, We appreciate you for taking the time to post your comments and we look forward to have again the pleasure of your visit in the very near future.
