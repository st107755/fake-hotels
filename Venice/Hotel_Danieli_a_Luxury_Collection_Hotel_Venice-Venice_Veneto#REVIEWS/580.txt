We stayed here for a weekend in May and had a large room at the front of the hotel overlooking the canal. The suite with a bedroom and separate sitting room was beautiful (although the ac did not work in the sitting room and despite a few calls to get it figured out, it never was). The view were stunning. The rooftop deck is the perfect place to start the day with a buffet breakfast or celebrate the sunset with a bellini.  Overall, it was a really good place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 27, 2017Dear SMD8, Thank you for your review of the Hotel Danieli.
