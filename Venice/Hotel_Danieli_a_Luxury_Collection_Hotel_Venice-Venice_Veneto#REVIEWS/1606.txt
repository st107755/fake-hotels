This was our second stay here. The rooms are very nice, though small and showing their age a bit. The location is ideal- next to the Doge's Palace on the Grand Canal. 5 min walk to St. Mark's Square. As you can see from the photos, the gondolas and water buses depart from here, so getting around the city is optimal. The water taxi pulls right up to a door on the side of the hotel; I advise taking the water taxi from the airport- it costs about 150 Euros/ 200 US$- but is worth it, as it only takes about 30 min. I have also taken the water bus from the airport- much, much cheaper- but it takes over an hour, you may be standing most of the trip, and it can be miserable when it is crowded with 90 F temp and 50% humidity; the extra cost is worth it, believe me, to start your vacationâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 24, 2014Dear Bob-and-Mila, I am pleased to learn that you enjoyed your stay with us.
