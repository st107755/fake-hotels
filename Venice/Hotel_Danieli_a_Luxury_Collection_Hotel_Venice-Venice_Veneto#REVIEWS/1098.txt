I profess bias .. The Danielle is my favourite hotel, location, elegance but never pompous.. Caring but pure indulgence .. A few minute round the corner from St Marc's square and views to die for.. A terrace that's prefect to absorb Canelleto's light ...For Carnival it's a centre of activity .. One would have to be a serious grump to come here and not be moved ... No better place it the world for a romantic get away !!
