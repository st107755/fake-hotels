This hotel is an iconic building. Being here it felt like being in a museum.  The room was quite small with over-sized furniture, but it's ok for a single traveler like me  Unfortunately I didn't get the room with a view due to budget constraint :-( Service was ok in general, but very good from room service.  The hotel has a few computer with internet & printer facilities in the lobby; free of charge - very good to print last minute boarding passes.  I was there during summer - it was scorching hot and like most buildings in Europe, the hotel aircon was almost non-existent, even in room.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 4, 2015Dear MTG010, Thank you so much for having chosen the Hotel Danieli whilst in Venice and for having taken the time to share your feedback on Tripadvisor.
