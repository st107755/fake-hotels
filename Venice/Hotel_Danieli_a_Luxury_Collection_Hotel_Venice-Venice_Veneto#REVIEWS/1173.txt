This hotel is amazing! It is a wonderful historic site with an amazingly beautiful lobby that used to be a courtyard. It looks like something out of Romeo and Juliet.  Right outside the door are the gondolas awaiting your ride or the boat buses that take you around the Grand Canal. A few short steps away is St. Mark's Square and church. The hotel staff is so nice and knowledgeable. We had breakfast and lunch in the hotel's restaurant which has a unbelievable outdoor balcony overlooking the canal and all of the landmarks. The hotel occupies three different buildings which connect so when you pass from one to the other, you look out onto the canals and can watch the gondolas going by. Highly recommend!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 20, 2015Dear longislanddebbi, Thank you very much for your feedback and we are happy to learn that you had an excellent stay and that you enjoyed both your stay with us and that you found the location ideal.
