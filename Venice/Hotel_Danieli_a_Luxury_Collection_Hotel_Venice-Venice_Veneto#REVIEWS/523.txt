Part of the Venice-Simpson Orient Express week-end, this hotel is very welcoming, with well setup and well maintained rooms. We enjoyed a view over the lagoon and the atrium is a marvel of winding staircases, light and displays with attentive bar and front of house staff. Breakfast on the roof terrace is an experience not to be missed. Only minor grumble is that the breakfast staff seemed not to enjoy their jobs quite so much - possibly a function of the sheer numbers of guests they need to service.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
