Given the price we expected absolute luxury, but it's not what we got. After we got past the idiosyncracies of this beautiful old place, however, we even forgave the terrible shower and the shabby paintwork. The building itself, the furnishings, the dress and behaviour of staff are from another era, and it grew on us. Breakfast on the upstairs terrace looking down on the hustle and bustle was priceless, even if you did have to watch out for the sparrows. Not only that, it's out the door and you're right there a step away from the sights. Something everyone who visits Venice should experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 24, 2012Dear nellieDubbo, May I offer my sincere apologies for your dissatisfaction with your recent experience at our property and I welcomed your feedback.
