The hotel is conveniently located at the S. Zaccaria water taxi stop making it easy to reach from the train station. The interior is beautiful, but a little tired - like many of the older Ritz Carlton's in the States. General Manager was terrific - was available to welcome us upon arrival. Fabulous VIP amenities. Lounge is very expensive - 20 Euro for a mixed drink is a little excessive.  Guest room bathroom was wonderful - entirely done in marble with great amenities. Read moreHelpfulShare
