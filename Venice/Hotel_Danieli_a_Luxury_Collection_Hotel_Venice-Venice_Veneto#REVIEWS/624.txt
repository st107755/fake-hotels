Beautiful Hotel, Great view from the windows of your room. Great quality concierge services. Took care of every concern we had. Recomended great restaurants. Very warm, professional and excellent service. The lobby of the Hotel is a landmark, a beauty. Location could not be better.  Highly recommend this great hotel in Venice.
