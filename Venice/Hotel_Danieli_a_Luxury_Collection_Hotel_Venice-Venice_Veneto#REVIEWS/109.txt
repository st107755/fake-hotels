I certainly do like my cocktails and had tried again few here in Venice but this really was the best for its views as you sit on the roof terrace with the perfect combination of shade and sunshine, but then the cocktail which really was a dream was the Royal Dream... absolute heaven.. so proceeded to have three!!
