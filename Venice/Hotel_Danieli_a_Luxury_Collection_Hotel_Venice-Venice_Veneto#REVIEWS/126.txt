My husband & I were in Venice to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary.A cocktail on the terrace of this beautiful hotel was on our list of things to do in Venice. The hotel staff were helpful, informing us the terrace bar would open at 3p.m, & so we returned then. The staff were welcoming in the lobby & also on the terrace.We were shown to seats at the front of the terrace, snacks were brought to the table ( they are free).I chose a vespa martini(€26) & my husband had a Venizia Blanco beer(€16). The views & respite from the heat & crowds are worth paying for, this was a wonderful experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
