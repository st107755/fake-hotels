Considering the cost and the impersonal (or even rude staff), I would not stay here. There are plenty of other boutique hotels in Venice to stay at that actually want to make sure you enjoy your stay. Twice the conceirge staff was dismissive: first expressing my dis-satisfaction with their restaurant recommendation & second when i inquired to the prices of the leather goods displayed the hotel lobby.  My room was very nice and felt luxurious(lots and lots of marble?) but in the end, no thanks.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 19, 2016Dear Trvlr_USUK, Thanks for your post.
