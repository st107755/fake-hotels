Not everyone can stay at the Danieli, it is tres expensive, but if you can you should.  The location is great, just steps from St. Mark's Square and an easy walk to most places you would want to go by land.  The entrance is very understated, but once inside one gets a sense of what a magnificent property it is.  The lobby is old world in the best way, and the rooftop terrace looks out over the Grand Canal.  One can sit there with a prosecco and watch the world go by.  Our room was very comfortable even though it was also very old world.  Staff was impeccable.  As a guest, one feels that they are members of a very private and exclusive club.  Arrive by water taxi, which is more expensive than a water bus, but one docks right at the hotel lobby, the start of a great stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
