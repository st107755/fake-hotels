I was a bit nervous about staying here because of the over-the-top decor that I saw online, however, when I got here, I was blown away by how beautiful this property is.  Everything was just WOW.  The location cannot be beat as it is literally the first hotel next to St. Mark's Square.  Waterbus Route No.1 stops right in front of the hotel too so you can go to other parts of Venice easily.  The service from every staff member was top-notch (except the rooftop restaurant where we received no attention for too long).Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
