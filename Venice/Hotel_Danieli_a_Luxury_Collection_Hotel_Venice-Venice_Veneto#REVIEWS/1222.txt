You can't top the location of this hotel, located just around the corner from St Mark's Square. Our room was comfortable and quite large by European standards. The staff was attentive and very helpful. Free internet was available in the rooms, although it was somewhat slow. Breakfast is included with the (quite pricey) room rate, and the view from the rooftop restaurant is fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 21, 2015Dear midwesttraveller2015, Thank you for your kind words with regards to the high levels of service received.
