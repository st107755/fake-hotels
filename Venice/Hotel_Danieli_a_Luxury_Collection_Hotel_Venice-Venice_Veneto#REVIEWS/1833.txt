We stayed at the Danieli for 3 days last week and have to say this hotel is truly magnificent. It is breathtaking when you first arrive and see the golden staircase. We had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal, it had a small balcony where you could stand and take in the views. We were really well looked after from the reception, Concierge and maid service all done with a smile and very professional. Thank you Danieli for a truly memorable stay.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 10, 2013Dear Antoinette T, Thank you for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
