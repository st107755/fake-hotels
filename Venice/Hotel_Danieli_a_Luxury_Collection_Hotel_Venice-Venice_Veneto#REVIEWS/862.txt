Stayed here for three nights in August with my husband and teenaged daughter. Staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. Hotel room was beautiful, surprisingly spacious and oh so comfortable. Bathroom was huge and luxurious; beds and pillows were fabulous. Location was terrific. Among the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in - I would highly recommend the Hotel Danieli! BTW - we requested a room on the lagoon but did not get one but in retrospect, it was probably quieter to NOT be overlooking the lagoon. Not having a view did not detract from our visit in any way.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 19, 2016Dear SAJ06880, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
