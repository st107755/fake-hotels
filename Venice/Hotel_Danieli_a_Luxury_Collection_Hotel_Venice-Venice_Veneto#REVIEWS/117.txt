I was with my friend & her husband for the day in Venice & want to have a few drinks at Hotel Danieli as I had been there previously a few years ago & I was desperate to show them how beautiful the hotel was.  As we walked in a man behind the reception desk called out to us & told us they werenâ€™t having visitors today.  I explained that we were going to the bar for drinks .  We ignored him & started to make our way to the bar when he ran after us & insisted we leave .  He was so so rude & we were literally escorted off the premises . The three of us were smartly dressed & I had never experienced such rudeness & arrogance ever.  It was very upsetting . That man definitely  needs to go on a customer service course .
