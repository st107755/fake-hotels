We spent three nights in the Danieli to celebrate a special birthday. The staff could not have been more attentive and made us feel as if we were their only guests. Our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The location is perfect for exploring Venice, and the views from the restaurant are magical. We'll treasure the memories of our trip and look forward to returning soon.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 12, 2016Dear Guest, Thank you for your feedback and for choosing to stay with us, we look forward to welcoming you again to the Hotel Danieli on your future visits to Venice.
