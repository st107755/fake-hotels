What a great holiday. Private water taxi (and it really was just for us) from the airport, under the Rialto Bridge, along the Grand Canal and finally straight to the side door of the Danieli; a really friendly and courteous greeting at reception, our room ready at 11am. We were given the recently renovated rooms, large by Venetian standards but luxurious, the bathrooms in marble and plenty of toiletries, towels, robes and slippers. All of the staff we met, from security to the discreet but efficient bar staff, were friendly but not intrusive. We did take breakfast one day, expensive but then you don't need to eat again until evening, and the view from the terrace is breathtaking. This really does rank as one of the best hotels I have stayed in, and I look forward to returning inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 17, 2014Dear ThatsMySunbed, Thank you again for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
