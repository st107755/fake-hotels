We had a great pair of adjoining rooms that looked out on the waterfront.  They were very large for what I think of as typical in Europe and well appointed.  The rooftop patio is a great venue for breakfast and dinner.  The staff were very helpful at every opportunity.   The location is great, right next to the Doge's Palace ad Piazza San Marco.  When it was time to go, a water taxi whisked us away from the hotel's door on the canal.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
