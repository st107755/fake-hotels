The Danieli is a "grand old dame" with historic significance that is well preserved. The ambiance is great - beautiful lobby, live music in the Bar Dondolo every evening, fabulous rooftop views for breakfast. The location is excellent - particularly useful in the heat of summer to come back to for brief rests during sightseeing adventures. The concierge is attentive and responsive to all needs. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. With Starwood Platinum upgrades - a suite, welcome gifts etc, I really can't find anything negative to say.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 7, 2017Dear 37Frequenttraveler, We appreciate you for taking the time to post your positive  comments and we look forward to have again the pleasure of your visit in the very near future.
