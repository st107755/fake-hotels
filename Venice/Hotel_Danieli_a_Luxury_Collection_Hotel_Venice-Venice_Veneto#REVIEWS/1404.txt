A luxurious experience.  On arrival, I was greeted by the concierge, security and bellman who escorted me to reception.  Stella immediately made me feel at home. I was pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to a lagoon view room.  I asked the next day to change to a room with air conditioning as it was not turned on in my section of the hotel yet and the weather unseasonably warm. Marco at reception helped and immediately moved me to a new room with A/C.  Breakfast on the terrace is heaven. The view of the lagoon is stunning. You can enjoy the breakfast buffet or order what you prefer.  The Danieli is perfectly located  it's steps from Piazza San Marco,and the S. Zaccaria vaporetto stop. Grazie to Stella, Marco and the entire staff for making my first visit to your beautiful cityâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 27, 2015Dear Brian P, We appreciate you for taking the time to post your comments and we look forward to have again the pleasure of your visit in the very near future.
