We stayed in the hotel Danieli for a long weekend and had the most wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful inside and is set right on the grand canal near St Marks square, perfect location with water taxi stops outside. The food in the restaurant was truly wonderful. The staff were very friendly and most helpful. I would highly recommend this brilliant hotel.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 8, 2016Dear Scott S, I would like to thank you for your recent visit to Hotel Danieli.
