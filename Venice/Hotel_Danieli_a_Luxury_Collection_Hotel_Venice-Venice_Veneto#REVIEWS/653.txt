We stopped here for a drink as advised by some friends and WOW the views were amazing, the only roof top terrace I know of in Venice.  Simply stunning on a beautiful day!  We ended up having a 2c lunch here with a bottle of champagne and dessert for the best part of £420 although for that standard of food you can't complain, even the taste of the small bits cabbage blew your mind!!!  Wasn't too bad really, even more so when your getting charged £150-200 for mostly average pizza / pasta dishes elsewhere!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 8, 2017Dear Ja F, Thank you for your positive comments!!
