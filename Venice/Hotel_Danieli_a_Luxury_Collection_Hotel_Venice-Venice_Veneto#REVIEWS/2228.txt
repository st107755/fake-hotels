This hotel is amazing and we absolutely loved our stay. The location is fabulous and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They provided us with all the information we needed, and gave extra help when required (I broke an acrylic nail and the concierge immediately made me a reservation at a beauty salon to get it fixed, along with a map of how to get there). It is expensive but one can easily see why. Our room was beautiful and we were upgraded and received a bottle of wine as we were on our honeymoon. We would definitely love to return to this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: January 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 4, 2011Dear RebecaH, Thank you for your feedback and for taking the time to post your favourable comments on the Hotel Danieli and we hope to welcome you back soon.
