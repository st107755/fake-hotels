When you enter the hotel, you will feel like Angelina and Johnny from their movie, The Tourist. Seriously, as soon as you enter the hotel, you will feel the luxury it brings.  The floor, since its made of wood, can be quite noisy especially in the middle of the night, when everyone is sleeping. The room we had, which was 4X (can't remember, but you had to go to 2nd floor, walk past that floor lobby, walk upstairs via tiny stairs until you reach the room. The room is so hard to look for, that even when we asked a housekeeping staff where the room was, she helped us find until she can't and just said that she's new there.   The toilet's bath tub is also leaking so when we took shower, there was water all over the place.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 24, 2016Dear LloydMarby, Thank you for your review of our hotel.  I am sorry that you felt that the ancient wooden floors creaked and that you could hear the people walking above and I also regret to hear that you felt your room was small but each are very individual and vary in size and we have different categories.  We are limited with what we are able to do with the size of the room owing to the age of the building. I sincerely hope that this experience will not deter you from choosing Hotel Danieli or Starwood Hotels for your next visit to Venice. Please feel free to contact my office directly and I will be pleased to assist you. Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager Read more
