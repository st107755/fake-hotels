This was my first & last try at the Danieli. It was outrageously expensive and not up to par. The service was terrible, the room had a great view but was poorly furnished and not particularly well kept.  The building was beat up, the food very mediocre and there was an attitude that you were lucky to be staying there. There is no comparison with the Chipriani or the Bauer, both far better.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 8, 2012Dear Stuart K, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli.
