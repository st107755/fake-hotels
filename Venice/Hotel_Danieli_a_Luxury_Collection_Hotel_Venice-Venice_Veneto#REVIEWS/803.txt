This was the 1st stop on our honeymoon and we weren't disappointed.  The hotel was built in late 14th century and divided into 3 separate buildings to accommodate family, we stayed in the main building, lavish velvet decor in dark burgundy, golds, etc. our room had a balcony overlooking the canal and each morning we would see the vendors setting up, and all food, merchandise being brought in on the boats, gave a great feel to what the city was about.  Our rooftop view and breakfast was one of the best of our whole honeymoon, which included Venice, Florence, Rome & Paris.  We had a great view of the Santa Maria Della Salute, delicious croissants and excellent cappuccino. Pigeons are the norm around all of Venice, they visited during breakfast but nothing that couldn't be ignored.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare
