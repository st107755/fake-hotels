The Danieli is a great place to stay. Full of history and the rooms are lovely. We have just got back (end of October) - the only downsides are the rooms are very warm - but they may have turned on the heating now and the shower is cramped - but they are tiny details.  The staff are helpful and friendly, everything is beautiful and clean. The breakfast buffet is great and the view is awesome!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 3, 2015Dear Pilbs, Thank you choosing to stay with us on your recent visit to Venice.
