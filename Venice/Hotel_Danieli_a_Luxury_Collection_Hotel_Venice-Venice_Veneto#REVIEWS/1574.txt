The hotel is undoubtedly beautiful and has maintained its original wall, stair and ceiling features. Its is optimally located by the water and only a minutes walk from the square. The terrace holds stunning views with an excellent selection for breakfast including fresh fruit. My only negative point is that the rooms are rather dated even in the new part of the hotel, and are quite dark even in the morning. Having said that I imagine the same would be true for most of the hotels in Venice so this is no exception. A great experience all in all.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 30, 2014Dear Lady_D_of_Marylebone, We appreciate you for taking the time to post your comments and we look forward to have again the pleasure of your visit in the very near future.
