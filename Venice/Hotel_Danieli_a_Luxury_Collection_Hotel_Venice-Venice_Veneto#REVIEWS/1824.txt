We are on an organised trip stayed here 3 nights room 148 - amazing OLD WORLD décor - our room was understandably small and very old world (particularly the bathroom), it faced a small canal that attracted very loud gondolier's (singing/booming from 3.30pm to 6.00pm).  Overall I found this room very noisy - corridor noise, noise from rooms on top and to the side, garbage collection 7.15am every morning -  understandably this is the price you pay to be 'on the front row'.  Now to the restaurants - the breakfast room is STUNNING - a deck (you can sit inside or out) over looking THE canal - brilliant view - great food - great service (beware of the smoke salmon addicted seagull), we did have a group (about 50) dinner which was as expected for the size of the group - just - nothing…Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare
