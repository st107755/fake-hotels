If you like historic hotels, look no further. This hotel really tops as one of the historic hotels we've stayed in. There are tons of elements still in place including real physical keys for each room, and the original window holes looking out onto the water. We were separated into two towers, and both room were vastly unique and different from the other. The property really feels like an old palace with rooms everywhere to be found in nooks and crannies. Really suggest there be some renovation on the product though, as the case goods are very old and smell old - the musty smell isn't pleasant as you open the closet and drawers. Also, our window faced the river and didn't block out much of the noise. We barely slept the first night.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 3, 2019Dear lileewhoo, Thank you for your kind feedback, we genuinely appreciate your positive comments and suggestions  as well as your constructive criticism.
