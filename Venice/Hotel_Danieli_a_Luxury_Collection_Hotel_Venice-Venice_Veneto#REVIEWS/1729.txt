...really fit for kings and queens and comes with the price tag...I did not stay here but I heard I had to at least stop in for a drink, it being world renown, and I did...I can see why I was told that. First amazing beautiful architecture. They really bring the outdoors inside with trees, hanging planters and ceiling/skylight. The atmosphere was great, everyone upbeat about being there including the staff. Great wine/beer selection and a bit more pricey then places in the area. You get like snacks to eat with your beverages, as seems to be the usually. Was really beautiful and I suggest to at least pop your head in if not in the market for a pricey glass of wine!Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare
