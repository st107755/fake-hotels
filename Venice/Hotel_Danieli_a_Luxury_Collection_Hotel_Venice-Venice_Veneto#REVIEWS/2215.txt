Danieli hotel is well known as a fantastic hotel.  The palaces which host it are beautiful. However it exceeds all our (high) expectations. Even if we had a minor problem. But as soon as I  informed about it to Mr. Bollani, Front Office Manager, immediately he solved it in such a nice way, competently and good manners, that rarely you find it in other institutions. The whole staff was well trained, helpful and nice. The hotel itself is a monument that is worth for a visit. Much more, to stay there. My wife and I are delighted to recommend the Hotel Danieli for a very special experience of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
