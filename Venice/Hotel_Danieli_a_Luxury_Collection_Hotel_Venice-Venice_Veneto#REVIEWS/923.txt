The hotel is a museum of beauty.  The lobby is elegant and picturesque.  Our room was over the top.  The furniture was that of a king of yesteryear, while being completely contemporary.  The bedroom was lovely.  Nice chocolates every night and slippers left by each side of the bed.  The bathroom was HUGE.  Had two showers and a bath.  Great soap and hair products.    Breakfast was pure elegance.  Servers were very helpful and kind.  They even let me take a set of jellies home to give as a gift.   Our room had two small balconies overlooking the canal.  What a real treat.   I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.
