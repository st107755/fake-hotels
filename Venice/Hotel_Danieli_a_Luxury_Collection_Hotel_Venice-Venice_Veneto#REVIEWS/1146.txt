We recently stayed at the Danieli for 3 days and had a great time, I don't really have anything bad to say about the Hotel but I do think the 5stars are a bit of poetic license just because of the history of the Hotel. The room was nice, the bed was exceptional but the bathroom lacked a bit of 5 star treatment as did the dressing room, a lot of the fittings and furniture in these two rooms were very warn/used and could do with replacing. While I appreciate everything is in the venetian style and taste that doesn't really stop a 5 star hotel updating the bathrooms now and again! It seems like there are a lot of tourists, mainly Chinese coming into the hotel lobby to just take pictures, while I really don't have a problem with this, I do have a problem with then having to queue upâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 16, 2015Dear Richard S, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your observations from your last visit with us and we do hope to have an opportunity to welcoming you back.
