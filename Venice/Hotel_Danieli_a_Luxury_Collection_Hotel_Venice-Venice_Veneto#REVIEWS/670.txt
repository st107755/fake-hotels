My twin sister and I stayed at the hotel Danielle for 4 nights to celebrate our 50th birthday.  The hotel is in a great location, the service is impeccable.  We eat in the rooftop restaurant on our birthday, 4 adults all had the taster menu with wine and my 15 old niece had the best vegetable soup she had ever tasted with a seafood pasta dish.  The food was delicious, service was tentative but not intrusive. Would definitely recommend, a little pricey but worth it as the food was stunning and the wine choice was marvellous.  A lovely treat a bakewell cake in the room for our birthday.  Would definitely go back, the foyer is wonderful a great place to sit and watch the world go by. All of the waiters and bar staff are very friendly and helpful. Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
