The staff is very good and very attentive. The rooms and buildings are lovely. The only sad part was the arrival of two huge cruise ships coming in way too close to St. Marks Cathedral and the gondolas during breakfast.

I am sure the ships add pollution, crowds and water erosion to a place that can not handle anymore.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 4, 2016Dear Sabrina521, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for choosing to review The Hotel Danieli on Tripadvisor.
