The Hotel Danieli, like it's sister the Gritti, are hotels built on what was once the homes of Venetian merchant class nobility. The four story atrium off the front lobby is breathtaking, and has been featured in multiple movies. The rooms are classic luxury - not modern - and very well-appointed. Good service throughout the property, and the food is reasonably good. The location is prime - literally a block away from St. Mark's and the front of the hotel faces the Mediterranean at the outlet of the Grand Canal... and this is the problem. Everyone who visits Venice walks on the street in front of the hotel and it is absolutely jammed with people from dawn to well after dusk. Once inside the hotel, you won't be bothered, though, so this inconvenience is only temporary.Read moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
