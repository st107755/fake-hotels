We stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Danieli in Venice, it was easy to get to from the Vaporetter (water taxi), the lobby was beautifully decorated, the front desk staff not only check you in but take you to your room and show you everything. Our room was spacious and had a separate small room for the fridge and closet, great to have suitcases out of the bedroom. Nice bathroom and the bedding and curtaining was beautiful too. The best part of the whole experience was the rooftop restaurant, it was not too high so you felt part of the Grand Canal, there was so much to watch on the canal, it was mesmerizing. Breakfast too was amazing up there.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 12, 2013Dear DPS140752, We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed your stay and also that you appreciated the food, the accommodation and professional service as well as the facilities that the Hotel Danieli offers.
