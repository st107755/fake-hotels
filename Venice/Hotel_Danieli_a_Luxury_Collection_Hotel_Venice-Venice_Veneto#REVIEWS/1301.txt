Beautiful hotel, more like a museum, but missing some of our modern comforts. The doors are tricky, the showers small, rooms are loud (thin walls, as well as people in alleyway below at all hours of day/night), floors are creaky (you will hear every person who passes by your room and every step above you.) It is fancy, but more like your grandmother's fancy than your cool friend Cindy's fancy.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 20, 2015Dear NJ_APS, We are truly sorry to hear that you were dissatisfied with your recent experience at our property, this grand old lady was built in XIV century and steeped in history and we deeply regret that it  failed to meet your expectations.
