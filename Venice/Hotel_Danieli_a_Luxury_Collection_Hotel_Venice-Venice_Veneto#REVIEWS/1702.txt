We stayed here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and it is one of the best hotels I have ever visited. Our room was fabulous, room service, staff and restaurant were all excellent, totally 5* in my opinion. We also had a room on the front looking right over the water which had the most fantastic view. Incredibly expensive but definitely worth it for a special occasion.Read moreDate of stay: December 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 12, 2013Dear Kerry S, On behalf of the Management team at The Hotel Danieli, we would like to thank you for completing your review on TripAdvisor.
