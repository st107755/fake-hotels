This was the first stop on our romantic getaway and it sure set the new standard on luxury hotels. Our room had a sitting room, office and two separate bathrooms.  Our view of the main canal was amazing! We could watch the day trippers arrive by ferry and leave at night. The lobby of this beautifully maintained hotel was exquisite with their Murano glass chandeliers and decorations.    The bed was large comfortable, pillow top with ample spine support. The marble floor and tiling was a welcoming awakening trekking around the maze of Venice streets.  Medium pace wifi for those working while tripping. Large room service menu (premium), delicious but pricey (52â‚¬/pp) breakfast buffet.  So glad it's part of SPG! Will defiantly stay here again!
