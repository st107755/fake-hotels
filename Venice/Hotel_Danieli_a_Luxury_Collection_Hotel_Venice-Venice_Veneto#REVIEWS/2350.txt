I see a lot of people on the site do not like the hotel. I think the problem is expectations. It's an old hotel with old decoration. The rooms have old decoration. However, I liked it very much. It almost takes you back in time and that is something I looked for when I went to italy. Rooms were a bit small, however, very clean and nicely decorated. The concierge was very helpful. I would stay here again if I went to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2008HelpfulShare
