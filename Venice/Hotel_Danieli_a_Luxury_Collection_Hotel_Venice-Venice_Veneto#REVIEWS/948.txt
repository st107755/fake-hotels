I can't say enough how wonderful the staff is at this hotel. Fantastic, top notch service. The hotel is is right on the water and a very short walk to St Mark's cathedral. It can get crazy busy in the square so beware. Our room was small but well appointed. The A/C was excellent which is not always the case in European hotels. The bathroom is adequate,a bit small. Plenty of towels. There isn't a separate shower stall so you shower in the tub. Plenty of closet space. Breakfast is a feast and is on the top floor. You can sit in the terrace and enjoy beautiful views. A wonderful hotel.
