My bedroom, dressing room and bathroom were larger than my flat,  The decor was  pure venetian and opulent.  Bed huge and very comfortable.  Food first class as was the service.  Breakfast overlooking the Grand Canal in bright sunshine, making the morning sparkle.  Staff attentive and courteous.  Had a special birthday dinner six courses with specially chosen wine for each course,  served on Morano glass which had been specially designed for the Hotel.  An experience never to be forgotten.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 3, 2016Dear Sue G, Such a pleasure to read your “fantastic” review, thank you for choosing the Hotel Danieli for your recent trip to Venice.
