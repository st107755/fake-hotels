Our experience here was very nice. Our rooms were comfortable and very clean, although they did not have the best views. The staff was friendly and helpful, except sometimes at breakfast when it was hard to get their attention to ask for coffee. We ate dinner there on one night, and the food was not worth what we paid--pretty unimaginative and average, but edible. The view from the hotel restaurant is lovely however, and it is good for breakfast. The real selling point is the location, right next to public transportation and Piazza San Marco. The concierge was incredibly helpful with dinner recommendations as well.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 23, 2016Dear Elizabeth F, We appreciate you taking the time to add your comments to the TripAdvisor your review on The Hotel Danieli following your recent visit to the Hotel.
