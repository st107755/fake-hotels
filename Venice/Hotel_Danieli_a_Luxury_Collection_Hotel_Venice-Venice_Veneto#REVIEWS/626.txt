Just returned from a delightful stay at the Danieli in Venice. From the moment we entered the lobby I felt special. The check in was swift and friendly and the staff extremely attentive. The hotel accommodated our room requests without hesitation and our rooms were ready even though it was before check in time. The breakfast was superb and with a view to die for and a glass of prosecco it was the perfect way to start the day.The hotels location is perfect. I would definitely stay here againRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
