Grand classic European hotel. Luxury rooms, attentive staff Breakfast location has stunning views over Venice - delicious breakfast, though the pastries were not that great. Concierge team very very helpful. Hotel comprises 3 connected buildings - we stayed in the right hand building - decoration in the public areas in our building were a bit "tacky". Bedroom was comfortable and spacious - mild criticism was the shower in the bathtub, rather than stand-alone shower.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Responded Aug 15, 2017Dear RabaulUSA,  Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli.
