It is truly an amazing location nearly next door to San Marco.   We were fortunate to get a room in front overlooking the water.    Spectacular view.      The room decor seems a bit dated and stale.   Bathroom was nice. I don't think the front staff, where you drop off and pick up your room key each time you come and go, were the most friendly.   Reception during checkin was great.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 28, 2017Dear Dan F, Thank you for your review.
