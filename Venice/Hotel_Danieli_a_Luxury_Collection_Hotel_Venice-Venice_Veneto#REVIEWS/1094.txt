Not friendly or helpful staff especially the concierge. When asking for a nearby restaurant was off handedly told 2 restaurants in Italian without being shown where on a map or how to spell restaurant names or how to get there.   Reception also slow and mildly rude.   Expensive but good location. Beautiful grand lobby. Nice enough rooms.   When checking out asked for help from bell desk three times but got no response. Eventually lugged 3 suitcases myself down staircase (the lift did not go to the reception floor) with 3 kids in tow.   Overall not a particularly pleasant hotel. Would not go back.

I am sorry that on this occasion we let ourselves down.
