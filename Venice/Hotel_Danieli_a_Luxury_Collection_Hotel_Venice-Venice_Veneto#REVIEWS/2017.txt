While I have not "stayed" at Hotel Danieli, I have had several dining experiences on the roof-top.  The view is to die for....both night and day.  I would suggest "an afternoon" drink  or lunch experience.  The dinner we had was the pre-fix meal which was okay and rather pricey. But again, the experience and view is one that I would not miss.  Also, just having the opportunity to go inside and experience the building itself is worth the dining experience.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jul 9, 2012Dear travelbugqueen, We are glad that aspects of your experience such as lunch, dinner, service delivery and location were all to your liking.
