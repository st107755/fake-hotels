We stayed at the Hotel Danieli on Bonvoy points for one night before embarking on a cruise in the Adriatic. The staff at this busy hotel was courteous and helpful. The hotel's location on the Grand Canal is perfect for a short stay, as it is very close to St. Mark's Square and the Doge's Palace. The common areas are very grand, and the hotel is a tourist attraction in its own right. Our room was lovely with an excellent shower and bathroom. We did not have a view of the canal, but that was not a problem for us. The highlight of our stay was dinner on the terrace, where the white tablecloth service and cuisine were excellent. We enjoyed a magical evening with friends as the sun set over the Grand Canal.Read moreDate of stay: September 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
