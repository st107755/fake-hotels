The hotel is in a prime location with access to water taxis, ferrys, walkways, galleries, restaurants. The staff are helpful, professional and attentive, namely Fillipo on concierge as well as Stella on reception.   We upgraded to a double room with a terrace ( balcony) that over looked the lagoon. The room was luxuriously furnished, clean and functional. The view from the terrace is spectacular.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 31, 2015Dear pominsydney, Thank you again for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
