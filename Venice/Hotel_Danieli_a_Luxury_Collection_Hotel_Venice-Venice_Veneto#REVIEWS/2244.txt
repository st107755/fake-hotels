We have just returned from a short stay in the Hotel Danieli.  We thoroughly enjoyed every minute!  The hotel is beautifully run with courteous and friendly staff (especially the concierge who were fantastic); the breakfasts were delicious and evening meals superb.   Two children - aged eleven and fourteen - were very impressed by the attention to detail and, of course, stunning location.  Only down side was that you have to pay for internet connection.  Otherwise no complaints and would highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2010HelpfulShare
