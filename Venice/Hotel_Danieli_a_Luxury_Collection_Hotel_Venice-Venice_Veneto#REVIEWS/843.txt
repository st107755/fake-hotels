We stayed here in a lagoon view suite.  Dinner at rooftop restaurant.  The terrace had very good food, good service and a suburb view!  Even though we had booked two months ago my husband still had to tip 20 Euros to get a table at the rail.  Worth it!  So romantic.  Suite a little worn but immaculate.  Bed linens were best ever!  Recommend for a splurge!Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear Reesesmate, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
