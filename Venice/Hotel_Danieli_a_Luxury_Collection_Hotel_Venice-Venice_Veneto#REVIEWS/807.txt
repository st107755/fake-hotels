Danieli is a myth and it is really a beautiful hotel in a very classical style, restaurant on the roof have an amazing view in big canal and city ... during warner days terrace at restaurant allow to enjoy it even more! The hotel is a bit old and would deserve modernization.... nonetheless I really had the feeling to be Johnny Depp in Tourist, even I was not in suite with Angelina Jolie)))  Location of hotel is not the best in the city and you can find other hotel with more charming decoration and better location ... more affordable!
