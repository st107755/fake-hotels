We have stayed in this hotel 10 years ago and were very disappointed at how over rated it was then. My family went back to have dinner at the roof top restaurant as a special occasion after having many great meals in Italy during the past two weeks. All I can say is it was shocking. Empty restaurant, no ambiance, poor food, bad service and then a bill for 600 euro. It was the worst I have experienced ever. So bad that this is my first review to trip advisor. Really don't go.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 12, 2013Dear Sarah S, Thank you for taking the time to post your comments about your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli.
