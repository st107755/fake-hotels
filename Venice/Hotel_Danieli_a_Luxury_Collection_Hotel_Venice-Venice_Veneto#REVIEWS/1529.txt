We first stayed in Rome , then Florence, ending our trip in Venice! What a huge surprise! And I mean huge , as in the size of our room!! All previous rooms were very small, too small!! Even though we didnt spend alot of time in our rooms, it was so nice to come in at the end of a long day to the Danieli!! We will come back! It's at the top of the $$$$$$$$, but so worth it! An amazing restraunt on the top floor, with a beautiful vista of Venice .
