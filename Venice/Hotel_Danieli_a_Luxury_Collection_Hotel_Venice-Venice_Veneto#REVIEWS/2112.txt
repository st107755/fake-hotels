We have just had three wonderful days in the Danieli Hotel.  It is exquisite, the staff are attentive but not obtrusive, the building is amazing.  We took breakfast on the terrace; fabulous breakfast, everything one could wish for and the view stupendous. Drinks in the bar in the evening were delicious and accompanied by lovely bar snacks. We upgraded to a room at the front, great decision.  Highly recommend this hotel.  Slight downside; ground floor loos not great.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
