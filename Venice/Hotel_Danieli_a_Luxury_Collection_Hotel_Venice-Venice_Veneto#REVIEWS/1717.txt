Was in room 65 for 3 nights. Checked in with a group after 3, all rooms weren't ready. Of the group we had the smallest room and WITHOUT AC! The front desk said "how lucky you are to be in a part of the original palace!"  We would have rather had the AC part of the hotel.  Was told to open the window which we did but bugs flew in and it was noisy. This room was VERY small and over furnished with random chairs.  Bathroom was built for one; water was luke warm at best. Asked to be changed but no go!  Bar staff was great; desk staff not; bar staff gave good service. Lobby was not as impressive as hyped up to be.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 21, 2013Dear 1julia2013, I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you had with the room assigned and your arrival experience.
