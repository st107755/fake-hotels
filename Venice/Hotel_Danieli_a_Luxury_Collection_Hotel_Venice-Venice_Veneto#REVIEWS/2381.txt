Stayed at this hotel for three nights, we loved it. The hotel is in a fantastic location in the heart of Venice for a bit of luxury. Check-in was smooth, the receptionist and concierge were very helpful and friendly. Rooms were of a good size and bathrooms also. This hotel bar and lobby areas are beautiful just beware of the bar prices although this is to be expected in a five star hotel.  All in all loved this hotel, just wish we could have afforded a suite!!Read moreDate of stay: December 2007HelpfulShare
