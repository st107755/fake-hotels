We stayed three nights at Danieli in a junior suite with window over a canal.  The room was remodeled and had an amazing bathroom, however, generally it was too dark for my taste - it might me the venetian style.  Perfectly clean and good service.  However, I do believe concierges make great hotels - in this case the concierge was not very knowledgable or helpful.  (e.g. he sent us to a mesuem on a Tuesday which apparently is a day off at the meseums).  I have not been to other hotels in venice but compared to 5 star hotels in other places in the world I give them 4.  PROS: centrally located, you can be the first person in the Doge's palace as it is next door CONS: centrally located :)Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
