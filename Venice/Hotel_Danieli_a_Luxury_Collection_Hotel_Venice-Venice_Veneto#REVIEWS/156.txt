From the moment you enter, you have a sense of elegance, history and refinement.  The check in process was impecable by a Young man name Philippe.  The room was splendid, beautifully appointed, quite spacious and very quiet.  Concierge service was superb.  The only downside of our stay was with the food and beverage facilities.  While all very nice, the service was at best indifferent,  Overall an excellent stay with the exception of the resaurant and bar facilities.  I highly recommend the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
