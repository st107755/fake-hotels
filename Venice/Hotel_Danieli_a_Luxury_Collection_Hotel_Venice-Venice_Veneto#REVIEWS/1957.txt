The Danieli has a reputation of almost legendary status. The current reality is a once lavish hotel that is becoming tired, tatty and living on past status. The room was lovely if tired and dated, with a great view out across the lagoon. Service was mixed; mostly impersonal and curt, at times bordering on rude, certainly often languid. They seem to focus more on weddings and conferences these days so on the Friday night we were unable to use the famous Terraza Danieli (the only restaurant in the hotel) as it was full of wedding guests and on the saturday it was simply "Closed for a private event". By contrast, on the saturday evening we went to the Cipriani for dinner and it ws magnificent. The food was sublime and service was outstanding. A cut above the Danieli I'm afraid.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 2, 2012Dear Tony150357, Firstly we would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience at the Hotel Danieli in Venice.
