Just returned home from Venice and our stay at the hotel Danieli, which was for 4 nights.   Our arrival at the side entrance of the hotel in a water taxi was a touch of class; the staff were quick to approach us and ensure our luggage was checked.  The young lady at reception had a lovely demeanour and a sense of humour, this was lovely to see. Check in was quick and we were pleasantly suprised to receive an upgrade, it was an internal room, so no glorious views.  The room was beautifully appointed and the service in respect of cleaning was extremely good.   We decided to try the terraced bar and after 100 euros and just the four cocktails, we left satisfied with the stunning views. We decided not to utilise the hotels restaurant facilities, I am sorry but no meal for 4 is worthâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Responded Aug 12, 2017Dear Dave C,  Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel.
