This was our return visit number three over 20 years. We are pleased that the standard has remained high, with the owners keeping the hotel in its original state, with service to match. We loved the terrace for breakfast and drinks, and the (always) professional approach from the staff. A very relaxing place, with the ground floor salon a lovely venue for drinks or just sitting to admire the architecture and decor or the palace. As ever, the location of the hotel is perfect - the vaporetto stop is just across from the front door, and the waterside is a window on the life of Venice. A truly memorable place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 9, 2014Dear eyefordetail2, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
