We have stayed at Danieli 4 nights and it is what we expected....great experience, nice service and back in time. As a young man I was often in Venice for carnival AND then stayed in Little albergos...just dreaming of THE Danieli...now years later we were there to stay AND just before taking off to Pzris with the OriÃ«nt Express...a great souvenir for ever.Read moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 30, 2015Dear peterpalo, Thank you for sharing your positive  feedback on the visit which is very much appreciated.
