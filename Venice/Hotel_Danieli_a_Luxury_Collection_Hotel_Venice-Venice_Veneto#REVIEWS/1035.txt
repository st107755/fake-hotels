Beautiful hotel in magical Venice! The Danieli makes you feel as if you are staying in a palace. Beautifully decorated in true Italian decor. We had a large room overlooking the main canal. Furnishings were top notch and palacial. Perfect location on the main canal in the center of everything and a short stroll to the square. Service was excellent. Highly recommend eating dinner on the rooftop restaurant which overlooks the entire canal.  Could have been the most romantic setting I have been in. Food was excellent for both breakfast and dinner. Highly recommend this hotel! Would definately return!
