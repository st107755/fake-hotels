This was our first visit to Venice and choosing to stay at the Danieli was the best decision. The location is fantastic, the hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. The decor truly reflect the history of the buildings. The staff were helpful without being intrusive. Free wifi was available only in the lobby but we were able to use the wifi without feeling obligated to order anything from the bar. We were blessed with extremely fine weather in late Autumn hence the rooms were slightly warmer, opening the windows allowed the autumn breeze to cool the room down naturally. We did not have a room facing the grand canal, but the experience was just as memorable. The staff were helpful without being over the top, personally I much prefer than the over the top service at some third worldâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 30, 2013Dear riva_europa, Thank you for taking the time to post a review about your stay with us.
