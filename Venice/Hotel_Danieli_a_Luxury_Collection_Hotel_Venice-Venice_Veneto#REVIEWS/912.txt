Perfect arrival with taxi on the side entrance, promt and kind service, impressive lobby and caf√® with international clientele, you could spend hours there just looking at the interiors-atmosphere-peolpe! It's of great inspiration if you are an art lover. Small rooms, with refined details. Don't forget the roof top restaurant terrasse with stunning view of Venice. It' nice to be in the center of the trafficated (by tourists) Venice and contemplating it's beauty from the clouds. Expensive but worthy.Read moreDate of stay: January 2016HelpfulShare
