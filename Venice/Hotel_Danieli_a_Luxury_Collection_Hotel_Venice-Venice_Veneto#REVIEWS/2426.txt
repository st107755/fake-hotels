Apart from the great location, the hotel is terriby stuffy. The decor is worn and dated and ostentatious in a tacky sense. I do not understand how it can be labelled a 5 star hotel. The staff are rude and unhelpful and the restaurant, while it does have a great view, serves shockingly awful food deapite the prices they have the audacity to charge. Don't waste your money staying or eating at this hotel!!! Read moreDate of stay: October 2006HelpfulShare
