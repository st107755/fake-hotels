First of all, location is perfect! The hotel has a very old-school luxury style. The breakfast at the terrace is great (very nice view).  Rooms are expensive: after being upgraded twice we found ourselves in a suite that was still relatively small in comparison to what you could expect in any other city for that price.  I don't know what you can have in other hotels of the city for this price, but be ready to stay in a very nice but rather small room if you choose the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 29, 2012Dear aqwzsxedc, Thank you for your review, whilst I was pleased to read that you enjoyed the location and the breakfast provided by the team, I was very disappointed to read of you experiences in your room regarding the size. Being a XIII century Gothic building, are limited with what we are able to do with the size of the room owing to its age, I sincerely hope that this experience will not deter you from choosing Hotel Danieli or Starwood Hotels for your next visit to Venice. Please feel free to contact my office directly and I will be pleased to assist you. Yours sincerely Christophe Mercier Hotel ManagerRead more
