This is not only an incredibly well located hotel, it is beautiful as well.  Although it does not have as large a loby as some, it is well appointed and gracious.  We were received with great warmth and smiles.  The staff could not have been more welcoming.  Be sure to have breakfast in their charming breakfast room overlooking the Grand Canal - not only was the food and service excellent, the view was stunning!Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 26, 2013Dear believerdeb, Thank you for your taking the time to post a review of your experience at the Hotel Danieli.
