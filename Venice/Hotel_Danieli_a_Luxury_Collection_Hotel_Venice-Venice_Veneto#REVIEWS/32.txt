This is one of the oldest hotels in Venice, but it is very nice. We had a balcony overlooking The small islands off of Venice. The service is outstanding! There was a bottle of wine and homemade cookies waiting for us when we checked in.It's also very close walking distance to St. Marks' square.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
