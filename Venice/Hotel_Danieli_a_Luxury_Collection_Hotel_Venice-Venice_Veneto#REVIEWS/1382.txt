The hotel is beautiful, our room overlooked the lagoon , the view was lovely and to see the large cruise liners passing up close was a interesting . The hotel is 600 years old and the decor and furnishings were superb . As you would expect Venice is a very expensive city and be prepared to pay. The staff in the hotel were very accomodating, the service was excellent, but outside the hotel it is very busy.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 18, 2015Dear Peter B, Thank you very much for your recent review of our property on TripAdvisor.
