The service at this "five star hotel" is shoddy and impersonal compared to average hostels across Europe. We are on our honeymoon with mostly basic accommodations & this was supposed to be a big splurge.  The bathroom was full of FILTHY towels when we checked in. The concierges are too busy and snobby to help anyone. The wifi, which is free at street caf√©s around the city, costs 15 euros/day and is slow. They won't give you an iron, but will charge you 9 euros a piece to iron clothes for you. To nickel and dime guests that are already paying a fortune is criminal. The best part is the location, the opulent historic furnishings & the people watching, but if you want 5 star service or even just the minimum you would get at a holiday inn, you should go elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 15, 2014Dear Steph31009, I was surprised and disappointed to read of your negative experience during your stay at the Hotel Danieli. Your experience does not align with the high standard of service we strive to deliver to all our guests and for this I sincerely apologise.  In regards to the internet charges, allow us to say that we have implemented a free wireless connection in the public areas. In accordance with the Italian Law, for fire & safety reasons, the use of iron is not permitted in the rooms.. We very much look forward to seeing you again.
