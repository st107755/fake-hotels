Spent 2 nights here for our Silver Wedding - upgraded from a superior room to a suite in the Palazzo Dandolo after I asked if an upgrade would be possible. The suite was spectacular - Murano chandeliers and mirrors everywhere, antiques and beautiful damask soft furnishings - could not have wished for anything better! We were also treated to a bottle of fizz and chocolate dipped strawberries. The best bit though was the fabulous breakfast on the roof overlooking the lagoon. Service throughout was excellent- friendly and helpful. Only downside was poor coffee at breakfast and in the bar. It really was a stay to remember (no complaints about the very quiet air conditioning despite  temperatures soaring into 30s)Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 17, 2015Dear heathergill, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
