Despite paying €500 a night breakfast was not included. No tea/coffee making facilities were available in the room, but nevermind as for only €12 you can have a single cup of tea in the lobby - what a bargain, 50% more expensive than St marks Square. The service was variable. Despite leaving a big tip in the lobby the waiter was downright rude. The bedroom was tiny and dark, no iron was allowed in the room. The mini bar was not replenished and we had no drinking glasses for water, and no complimentary water. To add insult to injury the concierge recommended a dreadful restaurant that served burnt pizza. To top it off I was overcharged and still have not had a refund depsite continually contacting the hotel. Totally overrated.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
