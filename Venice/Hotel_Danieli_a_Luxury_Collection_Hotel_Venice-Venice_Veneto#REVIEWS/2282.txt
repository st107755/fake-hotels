You would never discover this hotel by the nondescript front of the building (actually, it's three buildings joined together).  Once you enter the hotel, take a step back to a time that enjoyed period Venetian architecture and Old World service.  This is a luxury hotel, so be aware of the cost.  Even if you can afford a short stay, this is a hotel that memories are made of.  Don't overlook the restaurant balcony for a spectacular view of the Venice waterfront adjacent to San Marco.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
