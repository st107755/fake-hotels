We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Danieli. It was a surprise for me from my  husband to celebrate our 7th Wedding Anniversary and we had great expectations, but unfortunately we left feeling rather disappointed with the Danieli experience overall. The hotel is in a fantastic location and the views from the breakfast terazza are simply " to die for ".  The entrance hall, lobby area etc is very impressive, you can just feel the history. However, beyond that the bedrooms and the standard of service certainly don't match the "Italian hotel Royalty" hype that the Hotel's website would have you believe!  We have stayed in all standards of hotels all over the world, we particularly love travelling to Italy, but i would not award the Danieli its Luxury 5 star label. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2007HelpfulShare
