Many times to Venice, but our first at The Danieli. The building itself is absolutely beautiful , once a late 1300 Palace. From the moment you arrive the service is first class. We were checked in by Giacomo Santi he was amazing, made our stay memorable. We had a top floor suite with a balcony view of the grand canal. Priceless! Breakfast buffet, with omelet station, was great! Hope to come back again someday!Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
