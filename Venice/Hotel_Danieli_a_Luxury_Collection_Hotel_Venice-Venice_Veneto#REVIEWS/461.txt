Stay here for the joy of the sweeping views over the Lagoon and of lounging in a traditional Palazzo. But room, service (courteous but rather phoney) and food are ‘just’ very good, not outstanding, as one would expect from one of the most renowned hotels in the world. We were not blown off, and thought that there was too little to justify the very steep rates (other 5-star in town can offer equally good standards at half the price).Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare Response from Hotel Danieli B, General Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 8, 2017Dear Mauro M,  Thank you for your feedback regarding your recent stay at Hotel Danieli.
