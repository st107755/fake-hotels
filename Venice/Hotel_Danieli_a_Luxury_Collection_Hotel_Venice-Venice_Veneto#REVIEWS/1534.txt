Spent three nights here in April as a special birthday present to myself - for the same price I could've have had a two week holiday somewhere else! I chose this hotel over the Gritti and the Cipriani but in retrospect think I made a mistake. The staff were friendly enough and the breakfasts were good (amazing views from the terrace), but the hotel feels corporate and impersonal. Frankly once inside the (not very spacious) room we could have been in any number of much cheaper hotels - we didn't have the most expensive room but at 700â‚¬ per night nor was it cheap! We also had to ask our room to be cleaned/serviced on the second day as it got missed! The average rating reflects what you get for the extraordinary prices paid.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 23, 2014Dear sphoenix2013, Thank you so much for taking the time to post your constructive feedback on the site following your stay with us which is greatly appreciated.
