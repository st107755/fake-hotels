We stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon; the hotel itself was lovely. Very clean rooms, excellent location & good food. However, the staff were awful, during our stay only 2 members of staff cracked a smile, all others were surly and didn't say 2 words to us. Our keys were practically thrown at us by the concierge each day and when we asked for help it was met with blank looks. Due to the staff we will never stay here again, such a shame as the hotel is lovely.
