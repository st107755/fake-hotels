After spending a week at The Gritti, we expected a bit of a let down...NO WAY! Hotel Danieli was an exceptional experience!  We had the suite overlooking the Grand Canal on the mid-level, we were able to stand in our windows and take shots of each other from each window, overlook the crowd below, the marketplace if you will. Beautiful room, incredible service and we had a great, fun time in the hotel lobby bar listening to the performer sing "The girl from Ipanima"...or so he thought!  ;-) Great to awake with the sounds of commerce in the city on the water!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 7, 2016Dear Gregory B, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
