Check in was effortless. The suite was ready and clean. The hotel is magnificent with old world charm, and d√©cor. the hotel water taxi is prompt. Hotel is centrally located and very close to the pier. The breakfast options were plentiful if your not gluten intolerant. It was difficult for my wife because they had no gluten free bread or pastries, which we found very unusual for Italy. I found the Concierge to be a bit rude and unfriendly, as if he were doing us a favor. We never had lunch or dinner so can't comment on that.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
