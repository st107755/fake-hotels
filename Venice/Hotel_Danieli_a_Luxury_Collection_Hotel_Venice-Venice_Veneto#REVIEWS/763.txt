We stayed at this amazing hotel for three nights in September.  It was perfect, the room was great and the view from our window overlooking the Grand Canal was incredible. We had breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, couldn't stop looking at the great view.  We really loved the lounge, nice to sit and have a drink or coffee relax on comfortable chairs and listen to the piano player who also sang.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to go back.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 9, 2016Dear CherWhitby, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli.
