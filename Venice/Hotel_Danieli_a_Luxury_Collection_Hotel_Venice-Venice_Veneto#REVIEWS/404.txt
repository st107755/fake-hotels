We had a fantastic stay at this amazing hotel! Right from the start we couldn’t have been treated better!  The reception was so friendly and helpful and staff went out of their way to help!  We treated ourselves to a room on the frontage to the Lagoon and it was beautiful everything taken care of even down to a lovely bottle of wine and biscuits provided for our special occasion which was really appreciated!!!  The hotel’s interior was out of this world more like walking into a palace we were blown away!  The staff that serviced the room were so sweet and a lovely lady wished us a happy anniversary!  The restaurant is incredible and the views from the balcony were vast and beautiful, one morning it was sunny and we joined other guests by taking some lovely photos!
