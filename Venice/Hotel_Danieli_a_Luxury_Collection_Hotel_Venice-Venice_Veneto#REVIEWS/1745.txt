This hotel was full of old world charm.  Very very expensive but we knew it was.  Lovely building.  Our experience was coloured by the lack of warmth and lack of friendliness of staff.  Roberto from concierge was the exception.  Stella on checkout could not have been less helpful or less warm towards us.  Maybe I was not wearing the right clothes because I was certainly wearing a smile. At $1000 per night we expected to be treated a little better.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 4, 2013Dear kyamra, Thank you for sharing your feelings with all Trip Advisors readers and with us.
