This is one of the great hotels.  We got an upgrade to a lagoon view room which was excellent.  Breakfast on the terrace, overlooking the lagoon  is one of those unforgettable experiences - but watch out for the seagulls looking for every opportunity to swoop for some of your food!   The lift (elevator) to the restaurant is quite well hidden, just off the main corridor.  Arrive and leave by water taxi.  Leave time as there is often a gondola traffic jam as you leave the hotel.  The bar opens out onto an ornately decorated and furnished lounge area.  A great place to relaxRead moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 12, 2016Dear Martyn K, We look forward to welcoming you back in the not too distant future and please do not hesitate to contact us at any time if we can be of assistance.
