For many years we stay in Danieli and it is always the time of the best moments in Venice for us. Itâ€™s a great pleasure to come back again and again and feel there like at home.

We love sitting at the terrace with the incredible view. Here we engaged many years ago ...:)Read moreDate of stay: June 20193 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
