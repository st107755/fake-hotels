My Family of 9 visited Venice and the Hotel Danieli in late June.  We had a great stay, our 4 rooms overlooked the bustling Grand Canal and we were centrally located, right around the corner from the amazing Piazza San Marco.  The Hotel Staff was great and most accommodating (Thank You Franco and Melania) - the Lobby and Lobby Lounge are spectacular.  We look forward to our next visit to Venice and to staying again at the Hotel Danieli.  Thank You.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 19, 2016Dear craig_g_Schwartz, Thank you for staying with us and we look forward to seeing you again at the Hotel Danieli!
