Stayed for 2 nights and had a great time. Spacious room. Excellent beds and very quiet. Only the door key was kind of tricky. A nice lady assisted and we finally made it inside on our first night...We greatly enjoyed the lobby and the bar. Nice drinks, even though quite expensive. But worth it, with all the appetizers included. Location is prime and cannot be beaten. The place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 10, 2017Dear pbigler, Thank you for taking the time to post a review about your stay with us.
