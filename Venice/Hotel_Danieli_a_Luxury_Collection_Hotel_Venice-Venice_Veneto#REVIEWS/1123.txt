The Danieli is a truly exceptional hotel. It is a breathtakingly beautiful palazzo in a superb location and with a reception and conciergery second to none. I have stayed at the Danieli many times but each time I stand amazed as it seems not only to maintain the highest standard but -- miracle of miracles -- to get even better. I love every minute I am inside its doors, for glamour, for fantastic service, for exquisite food. I travel the world but my favourite remains the extraordinary Danieli.
