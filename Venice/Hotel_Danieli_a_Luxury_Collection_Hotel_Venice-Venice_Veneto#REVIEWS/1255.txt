This is one of the best hotel. It is outrageously expensive but as a Starwood Gold member I used cash plus points and that came out to be very reasonable otherwise I could not have been able to afford this hotel for few days. When we checked in it was slow but I did get upgraded to a deluxe suite and that was  extremely luxurious and lavish.  The view is just out of this world and I have travelled to about 100 countries and 500 cities but my favorite place is Venice followed by Hawaii. It is also a part of luxury collection hotels and is very prestigious and has big name We took a gondola ride which starts right across from the hotel. It is very convenient in every way but it is very expensive.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 24, 2015Dear Gotofly2, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your observations from your last visit with us I do hope we have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the future, Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
