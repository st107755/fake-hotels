Whilst our 3 night stay was fantastic, can I give everyone a word a caution. On all 3 mornings we had a lovely breakfast in their roof terrace resturant, after each one we were not presented with a bill or asked for our room and we believed that the breakfast was included in the price of the room. It was with some shock at checkout to be presented with a bill for over â‚¬160. So beware despite not signing for anything we were charged!!!Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare
