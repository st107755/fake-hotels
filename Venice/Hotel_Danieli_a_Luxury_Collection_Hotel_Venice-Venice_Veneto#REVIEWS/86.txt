The location is great. We had a luxury lagoon view king bed room with balcony and I would highly recommend it. It is located in the newest part of the property and I can appreciate that. The balcony is perfect and a must considering the heat, humidity and musty odour of Venice) . It's is pricey but I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Venice. The housekeeping and turn down service are great. The staff of the hotel are excellent in every roll. The breakfast is lovely as well.  Lagoon view and location is much better that Grand Canal located hotel.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
