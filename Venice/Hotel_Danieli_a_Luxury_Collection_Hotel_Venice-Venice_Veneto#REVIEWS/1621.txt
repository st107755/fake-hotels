It is a shame that such a beautiful hotel overprices its food and drinks to such an extend that only few people use them (the bar is mostly empty). We had ONE cocktail each for a total of €38 and expected sensations, instead we got something any corner bar in the states would be ashamed of, it was barely shown the alcohol. After this we decided against breakfast at € 53 each and went to a bar in the side street for capuccino and cornetti. And for dinner we greatly enjoyed La Osteria alle Testiere which is pricy but wonderful sea food and wine with very attentive and friendly staff and not the snotty twits who work at the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 12, 2014Dear Namiya, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli.
