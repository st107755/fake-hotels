I had a lovely time at Hotel Danieli in June 2014.  The property is beautiful and very convenient to most Venice sites.  We had a lovely balcony room that overlooked a small canal.  In late afternoon and evenings the gondolas would glide past below and often a gondolier was singing or playing music.  Such a quintessential Venetian experience.   The beds were very comfortable and service was excellent.  I will most certainly stay at the Danieli should I be lucky enough to visit Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 9, 2014Dear AuntBootsie, Thank you so much for having chosen the Hotel Danieli whilst recently in Venice and for having taken the time to share your feedback on Tripadvisor.
