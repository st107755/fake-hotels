The Danieli captures the spirit of Venice so very well. Its location - well it's in almost every picture of the Venice you ever see, right alongside the Doge's Palace and Bridge of Sighs. It's opulence - old and fading, yes, but that's Venice, isn't it? The possibility of noise - yes, but again, what do you expect if you choose to stay on one of the most famous tourist strips in the world. We had an excellent few nights here, on the third floor of the middle aged building (the 19th century one, to the left of the old one where reception is located). A great view, a very comfortable and well appointed room, helpful and friendly staff for the most part. And the restaurant is excellent, too.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 7, 2012Dear Warren B, Thank you for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
