When we arrived at The Danieli we were shown to a room which instantly smelled very musky and old so we asked to move room and the other room was far better. This hotel is definitely over rated and is nothing like a 5 star. The toilets on the ground floor are really grotty and yuk and to be honest we didnt even fancy using them as they were so old and dirty. I cannot understand why they dont spend some much needed money on the place. Breakfast was nothing special at all and below average but the rooftop terrace had nice views. I would urge trip advisor members to ask to move bedrooms if they are given a musky smelling room as some rooms are much better than others. Hotel is greatly overpriced.
