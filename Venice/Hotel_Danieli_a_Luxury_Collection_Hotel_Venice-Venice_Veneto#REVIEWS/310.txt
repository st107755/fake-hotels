We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Danieli during a recent trip to Venice.  The location is perfect, mere steps from St. Mark's Square and the remarkable sites therein.  We found the rooms to be among the most spacious we have stayed in Europe, with the bathroom particularly large and luxurious. The wi-fi worked adequately, and the concierge was more than helpful in suggesting restaurants and arranging reservations. Taking in the history of this hotel, alone, was worth the stay.  While pricey, the Hotel Danieli is well worth the cost.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
