The hotel staff were amazing, unfailingly polite and friendly.   I was expecting a stuffier atmosphere and was pleasantly surprised.   Our room overlooked a side street and canal.  It was spotlessly clean and well maintained.   The heating in the bathroom was hard to adjust but we were cool enough in the bedroom.  When we left, the staff came to say goodbye.  We felt like royalty.  Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 13, 2015Dear UKMother, I will be sharing your kind comments with my team, and I know how pleased everyone will be to hear that their efforts to deliver an exceptional experience have been appreciated.
