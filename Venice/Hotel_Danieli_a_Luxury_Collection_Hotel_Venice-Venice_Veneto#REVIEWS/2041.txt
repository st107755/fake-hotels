Okay, so we booked this hotel through our Starwood points, but you can consider that its around 350 a night, all I can say is this hotel is Amazing, classy, convenient, luxurious, everything you can think of. I did not have much expectation from it, but it ended up as being Amazing. The location doesn't get better then this (as this IS the main part of the city). One thing, everything in the hotel is super expensive (but once you walk in, you know this right away, its Venice's version of 5 star).
