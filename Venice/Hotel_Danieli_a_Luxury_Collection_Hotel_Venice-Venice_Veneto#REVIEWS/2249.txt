We had a beautiful experience at the Danieli and recommend it highly.  We chose to arrive by private boat and entered into the lobby from the water.  The lobby is very impressive and elegant.  We arrived at 10:00am and our room was ready.  I did email the concierge before the trip to have them meet us personally and set up dinners and tours.  They were wonderful.  Very attentive and prompt.  This hotel gets my best rating as it made my trip in Venice so special and romantic.  The hotel is very "old world" and I love that feel, heck....you're in Vencie.  Will recommend to everyone.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare
