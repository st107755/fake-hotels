We booked in to a nearby 5* hotel which was awful; leaving the hotel, we went in search of somewhere nicer and walked into the Danieli- what a relief! Beautiful decor and they had a room, staff were attentive and kind and we were quickly booked in and moved. Expensive and you can get cheaper deals via the website, but under the circumstances well worth the money. Looking forward to breakfast on the terrace!   Massively superior to the Metropole a few hotels down.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 2, 2013Dear 186233Sue, Thank you for your fantastic feedback regarding your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli.
