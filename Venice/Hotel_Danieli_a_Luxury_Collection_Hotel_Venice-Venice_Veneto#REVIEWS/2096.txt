This is a superb hotel, in a cracking location, The room is big and comfortable. litterally a couple of minutes walk from St Mark's Square, and seconds from the airport water bus stop.. The room and public areas were lovely. We saw no evidence of the staff being unhelpful, quite the contrary, they were very efficient, friendly and welcoming. Recommended.   The only thing that I don't like is the wireless internet service is only available in the hall; not in the room and there is extra cost for internetRead moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
