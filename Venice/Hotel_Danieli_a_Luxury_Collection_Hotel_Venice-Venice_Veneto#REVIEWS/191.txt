I will admit to being biased. The Danieli is my favorite hotel in my favorite city in Europe. I have been visiting the Danieli since the mid 1970’s and my wife and I stayed again recently for a week.  It was perfect...again.  The location and service are without equal, and the charm and character are palpable. The fact that the former Palazzo that is the Danieli today was built in the late 1300’s is mind boggling enough; that the Danieli still carries its original charm and elegance forward today as well as it does is simply amazing. Treat yourself; get a room overlooking the Grand Canal and marvel at all that those who have come before you over the past 6 centuries have witnessed from your very same balcony.Read moreDate of stay: February 20196 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
