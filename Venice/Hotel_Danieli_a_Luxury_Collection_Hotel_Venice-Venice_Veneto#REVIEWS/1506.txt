After paying an enormous amount of money to stay here for five days we were very disappointed. Staff were average and rarely cracked a smile except for the bellhop, piano man and beautiful lass doing our room. Service was below par for this type of place. Beautiful decor but that's not all your stay is about. Always had to request service in lounge, many times just walked out.  We loved Venice and did not let this spoil our stay. Very disappointed.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 16, 2014Dear Farquharmarl, We are sorry to hear about the challenges you had with your recent experience at the Hotel Danieli.
