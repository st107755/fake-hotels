Fabulous location and worth every penny.  The staff was wonderful.  The restaurant was delish.  The rooms were great.  There are lagoon rooms with balconies large enough to sit on a chair and enjoy the view.  They have a private landing within the hotel for private boat and gondola service.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear Marli0209, Thank you very much for posting your review following your recent stay with us at The Hotel Danieli.
