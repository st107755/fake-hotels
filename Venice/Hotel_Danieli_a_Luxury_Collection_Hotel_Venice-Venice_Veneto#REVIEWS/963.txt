I read the reviews before I stayed at this hotel and I was a little put off by the spooky reports, as I am terrified of spooky places.   I have to say that I was not at all fearful during my week at this hotel! If anything, it is rich in Italian culture and is a wonderful Italian experience! I generally prefer modern/contemporary finishes but the rooms were pleasantly comfortable! The morning roof top breakfasts were a hi-light with views of the Venetian canals. I'd definitely recommend this hotel, even if it doesn't seem quite to your taste, you won't regret it as it is a unique, once in a lifetime experience that captures Italian luxury perfectly!
