From the moment we arrived via water taxi we knew this was going to be a wonderful experience.  The lobby is grand and the service very good.  The rooms are small and the front desk is quite congested(they need to work on this).   The concierge is one of the best we have ever dealt with.  Best of all is the rooftop restaurant.  The view is spectacular and our dinner and breakfast was excellent.  If you are coming to Venice, this is the hotel to stay at.  Right near everything.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 28, 2016Dear KWRref, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
