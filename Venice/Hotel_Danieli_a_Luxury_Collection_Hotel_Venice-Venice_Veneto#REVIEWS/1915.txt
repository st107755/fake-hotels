We recently stayed at the Hotel Danieli and had a fantastic experience! Great central location, our room was well appointed and very comfortable and the staff very service oriented.

We will definately return to experiece the charm of this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 20121 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 8, 2012Dear John T, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and I certainly hope that your future travels to Venice will bring you back to the Hotel Danieli.
