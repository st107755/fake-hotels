We had lunch over here ( club sandwich and chicken sandwich and 2 glasses of wine) and paid a 100 euro. Toilets are dirty and smelly and there was no toilet paper. staff is unfriendly. Maybe typical Italian behavior by the way. You will get used by the rudeness but a hotel should be polite to paying guests in my opinion. It is very busy in front of the hotel, but that's the whole of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 1, 2015Dear Rishma D, Thank you of your review of the Danieli.
