Amazing hotel to stay. We had our wedding photos there so extra special. Can understand as per previous reviews why people may feel aggreived with the cost p/n. The breakfast on the Terrazza is incredible. Reception not particularly warm with the greeting. Claudio who was lurking around the bars was particularly impressive. would stay again Only for a v.v.v special occasion.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 17, 2015Dear Ryan M, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
