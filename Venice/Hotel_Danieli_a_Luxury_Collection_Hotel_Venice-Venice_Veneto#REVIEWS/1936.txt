We have spent only one night at Danieli but it was fantastic. Starting with the staff that was top friendly and helpful all was on the highest possible level. Even the room didn't have the front view it was well compensated by the view from the restaurant terrace where you can spend an hour looking at Venezia. The breakfast was also fantastic offering both the international and Italian food: fresh, tasty and various. The direct trip by boat from Danieli to the airport was another nice experience with this hotel. The only possible problem with Danielinis that it is not cheap at all but you understand what you are paying for as soon as you come in: it really looks like an old Venetian Palace!Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 22, 2012Dear KirillIvanov, There is nothing more rewarding and encouraging than your recognition of our daily commitment to meet our Guestsâ€™ requirements, expectations or .. dreams and we thank you most sincerely for sharing your experience with us and with all the Tripadvisor comunity.
