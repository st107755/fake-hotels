All of the superlatives used by visitors are well deserved, and rightly so at the price.  Stepping into the Danieli is like arriving as a house guest at a Venetian palazzo.  The decor is simply stunning and the public places are very comfortable and stylish.  We found our bedroom very dark, and it was virtually impossible to work out how to change the lighting - why luxury hotels insist on having a complicated system rather than simple on/off switches is a mystery to me.  We eat in the roof terrace restaurant, as we have often done before, even when not staying here and it was a delight as always.  The staff are charming, and the location cannot be faulted but I'm not entirely sure it's worth the expense.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 8, 2016Dear Samir S, Thank your for your comments, we appreciated them.
