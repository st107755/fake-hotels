I stayed at the Hotel Danieli in 2002, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Venice, but can't quite give the hotel a glowing review.  It's certainly a lovely enough hotel, the staff were very nice, and the common areas out of a movie set.  The location can't be beat either, 2 minutes from St. Marks and 30 seconds from the vaporetto stop.  The rooms however are small, old-fashioned and more functional than pleasant.  The food was nothing to write home about.  I was able to get a great rate (Starwood was offering a special at the time) and this made up for the negatives, enough to recommend the Danieli, but to also advise prospective guests that several other high end hotels are very close by and deserve a look-see before reserving.
