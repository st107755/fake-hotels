This hotel was absolutely outstanding.  This building started its life as a 15th Century palace and it shows.  The marble columns, floors and stairs were superb.  Our suite consisted of four rooms and was large enough for our complete comfort.  The rooftop terrace provided a sweeping view of the Grand Canal while we enjoyed our cappuccino and hot breakfast.  The property is located adjacent to the Doge's Palace and St Marks Square which made it very convenient to walk over there at will.  There is also a vaporetto stop right in front.  I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 11, 2016Dear James B, Thank you very much!!
