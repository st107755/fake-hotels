Over the years I've stayed at both the Danieli and the Europa & Regina.    The Danieli is obviously the more famous and an icon of the city in itself - the interior is just wonderful and the rooms overall of a high standard.    Personally I prefer the Europa & Regina not because it offers better amenities or service but for the main reason of location.    The Danieli is situated in the most touristic part of the city,  this is not so much of a problem off season (which seems to  be getting shorter and shorter) but a real problem for me at least at any other time.   It's now been a few years  since I was last there but I'm sure the standard is as high as ever.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 20, 2017Dear rc51, Thank you for your review for your previous stay.
