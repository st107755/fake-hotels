We stayed here for two nights before leaving on a cruise. The location couldn't be better. Located right near St. Marks Square. The hotel staff was very helpful. The breakfast on the terrace was excellent, with a beautiful view of the Grand Canal. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are very beautiful and very comfortable. It is however very expensive, so keep that in mind.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 28, 2014Dear Laurier824, We appreciate you taking a moment to let us know about your recent experience at our property.
