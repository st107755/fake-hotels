We stayed a week at Danieli Hotel for a family vacation and I can only recommend this hotel.  Great room with a perfect view over the lagune, super staff (caring, warm, very welcoming), beautiful terrace, perfect location and a unique Venetian atmosphere and experience.  I'll definitely go back to Danieli when I go back to Venice Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
