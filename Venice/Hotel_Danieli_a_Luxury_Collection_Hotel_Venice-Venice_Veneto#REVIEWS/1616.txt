My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. The hotel was outstanding, staff very friendly and helpful and we were upgraded to a luxury double room. I have never slept as soundly, the bed was so comfortable and spacious. Unhurried breakfast on the roof terrace in the sunshine was an experience not to be missed, the view over the Grand Canal was stunning and we even saw a Turkish ship arriving and the crew were all standing to attention round the ship in white uniforms and they shouted out several greetings as they sailed past, fantastic! We were so glad we decided to stay here, the hotel contributed to a magical holiday.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 20, 2014Dear Ailis M, I was pleased to learn that you enjoyed every aspect of your stay with us.
