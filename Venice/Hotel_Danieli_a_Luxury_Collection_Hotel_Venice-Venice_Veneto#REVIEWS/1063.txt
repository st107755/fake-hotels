The Italians know how to do things right. Take this historic, opulent hotel for example. It is so exquisite, it's history and the guests who have stayed here are A+. If the front of house staff wanted to put on airs, they could with portfolio. And yet, the staff is lovely, the concierge are all gracious and kind. At 11 pm when we could not get the TV to work properly an IT guy showed up within minutes, friendly as could be, to fix the issue. Of course, the bedding and linens and bath towels are lux to the max. Walking thru the halls one can feel the legends come to life. Then, out on the street, perfectly situated for a leisurely walk, one is back in present day. Happy for the time at the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 29, 2016Dear lisabinnyc, Thank you for your review of the Hotel Danieli.
