My wonderful husband booked us in for 4 nights to celebrate my beating cancer for the 2nd time! I have loved this hotel from afar for years. In reality it exceeded my dreams. The entrance is more beautiful in reality. The whole hotel is living history and beauty. Our room (double deluxe) was fabulous. The staff so very helpful. The complimentary taxi to Murano. I could go on but I won't spoil it for you!  This hotel is an absolute must on anyone's bucket list of places to stay. I'm sat waiting to enjoy my final evening with dinner in the Terrace Restaurant. Again another must do, if only for the view.
