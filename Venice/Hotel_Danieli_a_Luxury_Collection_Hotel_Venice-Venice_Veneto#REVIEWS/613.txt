Classic beautifully furnished luxury hotel in an excellent location, but very expensive like most things in Venice.  The standard rooms are adequate in size though and renaissance vintage furnishings and beautiful marble bathroom. Staff are superb , spoke good English and always helpful. Stunning lobby and bar and roof terrace restaurant has excellent views over the grand canal. Though excellent location for key sites,  outside hotel is noisy and extremely busy with mass of tourist visitors to the city and awkward to walk through due to large tour groups as well as mass of other tourists etc. Recommend visit during off peak season.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
