I have always dreamed about going to Venice and there was never any question about where I would stay. The Danieli was just as I had pictured it would be. From the first time I stepped into the beautiful lobby to the upgraded luxury lagoon view with terrace room. The location cannot be beat. A stones throw from St.Mark's Square. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. The terrace restaurant was lovely with wonderful views. Venice is a magical city and I will return to both the city and this glorious hotel.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 8, 2012Dear travelmanagerone, Thank you very much for your recent review of our property on TripAdvisor.
