The postives - incredibly beautiful if you like renaissance.  Extremely attentive, helpful staff.  Location couldn't be better if you want to be near the crowds of St. Mark's Square and the Bridge of Sighs.  The most phenomenal view of the Grand Canal from outside on the terrace at the restaurant for breakfast.  Now the cons - the expense.  We were prepared for high prices.  Some really gauge.  The restaurant was 53 Euros for breakfast per person and the food was just ok.  We ate one lunch meal - a total of a bowl of soup and four raviolis for 154 Euros.  That's just not right.  And we see so many others who have said the same about the food.  Also, I think at a high end hotel, some of the video (such as tv or movie) should not cost an arm and a leg.  One movie was 36 Euros. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 3, 2015Dear mendn13, Thank you for posting your review of the Hotel.
