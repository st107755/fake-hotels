3 Buildings awkedly connected very close to St Marks square. The Center  Building is a Classic old Palace with a beautiful lobby (often crowded with Tour Groups). Most rooms lack views but are well decorated and quite comfortable. Hotel lacks a gym. Prices for Rooms and Bar/Restaurant are shocking, even for high priced Venice. Service varies from friendly and helpful to disinterested. Front desk team are excellent although often overwhelmed by check ins and outs. Concerciege staff is a bit jaded and often above it all, but when in the mood can be helpful. Other Venice Hotel choices at this price are better picks but if you have points to spend this is a decent way to spend them.Read moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 18, 2012Dear Howard M, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli..
