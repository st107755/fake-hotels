Hotel is at the perfect position, 2 min walk from Piazza San Marco. During stay in September, Riva dei Schiavoni was not significantly frequent so it was not crowd and noisy. You can reach an entrance even with a taxi boat which is very romantic. Service is excellent. Employees at reception, concierge, bar, restaurant are very kind and professional. Rooms, stairs, lobby are extremely clean. The most amazing point is restaurant at the top of the hotel. It give you outstanding view of Grand Canal, San Giorgio Maggiore and Giudecca. Breakfast is good.Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
