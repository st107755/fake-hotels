We visited this hotel in June for our 30th wedding anniversary.We were delighted to be upgraded to a suite. Reception staff (especially Natalia) were so friendly. The hotel is very close to St. Mark's Square and was an easy walk to most attractions. We also enjoyed Sunday brunch at the hotel which was excellent. A truly memorable holiday.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 28, 2016Dear MrandMrsJG, Thank you very much for your recent review of our property on TripAdvisor.
