Fantastic location, all the main attractions of Venice are within walking distance. Harrys Bar is only 10 minute walk. The view from the rooms is wonderful, only if you are in the right rooms! We had paid for lagoon view room. However the first room that was allocated ( in the old main site)had a very poor outlook and only when we paid for an upgrade did we get a room that the price justified. Multiple levels and confusing layout. Highlight is breakfast on the roof top terrace. The concierge is helpful as are the staff. However the porters will not take your luggage to the river taxi, which is about 100 meters over a bridge.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 8, 2012Dear Sushil R, We are truly sorry to hear that you were dissatisfied with the first room you occupied that failed to meet your expectations.
