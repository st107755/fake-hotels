The Danieli is a destination in its own right.  The lobby and upstairs bar are stunning - steeped in history and romance.  Unfortunately, so are its prices.  The rooms are nice - a standard room with the Starwood Gold upgrade was comfortable, but with no view.  Its worth a look, but you can do more for your money.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 8, 2012Dear Wrldtvlr27, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli..
