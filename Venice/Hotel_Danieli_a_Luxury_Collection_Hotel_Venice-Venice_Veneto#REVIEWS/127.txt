Hotel Danieli was a great; we loved the atmosphere, service & location. We stayed 3 nights prior to our cruise and 1 night at the end of our cruise.  The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, the lobby was amazing all the marble and history words really canâ€™t describe.  We also had breakfast each morning at the roof top restaurant which was outside and had a speculator view of the Grand Canal (great for watching the sun rise & the cruise ships come into port).    Even though the main area outside of the hotel was very busy, we quickly walked to the tourist areas as well as the local areas.    The service was exceptional, everyone was so friendly & helpful.  We would highly recommend Hotel DanieliRead moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
