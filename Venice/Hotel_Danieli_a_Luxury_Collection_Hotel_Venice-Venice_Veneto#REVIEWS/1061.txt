We stayed at the Danieli for our first wedding anniversary and the team made the trip truly special. Firstly, we got an upgrade in our room as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne upon arrival to celebrate the occasion! Our room was located in the old part of the hotel and beautifully renovated. The 3 story lobby is pretty spectacular as well as the incredible views from the restaurant and roof terrace! The location is also perfect for all the sightseeing, yet can get a bit crowded in front of the building because of that.  I can highly recommend this hotel for a very special stay!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 29, 2016Dear EstherMD87, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback on your experience here at The Hotel Danieli.
