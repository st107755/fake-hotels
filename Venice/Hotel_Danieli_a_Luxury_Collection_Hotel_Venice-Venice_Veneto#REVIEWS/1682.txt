It's a superb location for breakfast, but for dinner it's poor quality and grossly over-priced. The cover charge at 16 euros a head is scandalous given that you are already a guest of the hotel. Nobody's bread and grissini are worth that and the service is average at best. When they ask you if everything is alright, the waiters do not really listen to the answer! I ate fish and chips Danieli style which was like Marriott pool bar food, yet more greasy, 49 euros for a mercilessly small portion. If this is the best you can do Starwood, hand over this property to someone who will do it justice.
