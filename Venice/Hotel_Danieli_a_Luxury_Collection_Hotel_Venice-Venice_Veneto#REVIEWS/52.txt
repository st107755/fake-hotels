My husband and I were recently on an anniversary trip to Italy and decided to spend a night in Venice at the Hotel Danieli.  While the hotel is absolutely gorgeous, imagine my disappointment when my upgraded room view was a brick building.  I focused on getting my platinum status this year to use suite nights throughout Italy.  Needless to say I was not provided with a suite, which I can understand as the hotel was busy.  However, to be given a room with a view of a brick wall is not the way to treat a platinum member.  There is no incentive to continue to use Marriott exclusively, I guess I will have to try Hyatt or Hilton and see if they appreciate my business.Read moreDate of stay: September 20193 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 18, 2019Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review. We are extremely sorry for your disappointment concerning the room assigned, regretfully upon your arrival the hotel was completely sold out and we were unable to extend an upgrade. Venice is an unique and special city, with its characteristic narrow streets , the Hotel Danieli is situated in the heart of the city, surrounded by some of the most monumental and famous buildings and palaces, probably the brick building you saw form the window of your room was the world-known Doge's Palace. We hope that  at least,  during your stay you enjoyed the breath-taking view terrace were you had your complimentary breakfasts as Platinum member. Looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back soon, we remain Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager Read more
