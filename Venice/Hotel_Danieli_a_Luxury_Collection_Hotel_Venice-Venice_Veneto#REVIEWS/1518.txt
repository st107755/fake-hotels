Wow. What a fabulous Hotel. The concierge, Roberto & Damino were fantastic, so so helpful and always smiling. Roberto advised us of a restaurant in the Arsenale area of venice and it was the best food we had all week. The Hotel itself was superbly situated within walking (short walk max 5min) to St Marks, The Doges palace, the bridge of Sighs and directly outside was the water bus stop which was so convenient to access Sante Maria de Salute etc.. Our rooms were very clean and extremely comfortable with beautiful opulent Italian decor. The Daniele gondolas were also directly outside the hotel and were very reasonably priced at â‚¬80 for a lovely 30 min tour. When I go back to Venice again (fingers crossed) The Daniele will definitely be the place I will be staying.
