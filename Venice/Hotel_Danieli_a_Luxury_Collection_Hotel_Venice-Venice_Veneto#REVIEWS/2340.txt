We stayed there for two nights, overall impression is very good, breakfast is served on the rooftop from where the view of San Marco lion and entire lagoon is something to remember for a lifetime. Few minutes walk to all important landmarks in Venice, the interior is excellent. I would try a different hotel when I visit Venice again, but I have no reservations in recommending this one.Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
