While the property is historic, and the staff patronizing, the service, amenities and overall experience were quite disappointing.   It took 2 days and 5 requests just to get a TV remote that worked.  At $700+ per night, you’d expect shampoo etc., each day, a pen with the notepad, prior guests cleaning tag picked up off the middle of floor, etc., etc., etc.  Breakfast buffet was mediocre at best, stale bread, limited selection, way overpriced.  In short, all the little things that should be standard given the self-promotion done by this property were sorely deficient or non-existent.   Hardly the “Luxury” claimed or expected.Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 16, 2019Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
