My husband booked the danieli as a surprise for my 40th birthday. It was a amazing, the staff were extremely helpful and polite they couldn't do enough for you. The breakfast was brilliant lots of choices and you could even have a lovely glass of prosecco. If you can, book a lagoon view too as this was truly breath taking!
