I can't say enough great things about this hotel... we were only there for a few days prior to a cruise but the hotel itself is amazing and the staff were exceptional.  Our room overlooked the water and its views are breathtaking.  The food, of course, is delicious and the restaurant upstairs is a great place to grab breakfast and get your day started.  It's right in the middle of everything so you can walk to many of the sights. I really can't say enough about the staff either... upon arriving they were very helpful and gave us the history of the hotel which made it even more interesting.  This will definitely be the place we stay when we visit again next year.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 15, 2017Dear tonygomez14, Thank you for your very kind comments concerning your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli.
