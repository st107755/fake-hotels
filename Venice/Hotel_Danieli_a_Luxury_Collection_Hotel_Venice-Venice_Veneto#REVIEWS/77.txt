What a wonderful time staying in this epic historic piece of Venice. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay and the staff was quite accommodating. We only had one glitch with our Suite in that we requested a king size bed and it was 2 doubles pushed together, not so good for our 30th anniversary. The staff quickly took care of it by changing the bed and discounting our stay. QUITE IMPRESSIVE!  The hotel has exquisite charm and beauty being right on the water and walking distance to the square. The food was excellent and eating on the top floor veranda was breathtaking! Thank you for a great stay and memorable experience!Read moreDate of stay: August 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
