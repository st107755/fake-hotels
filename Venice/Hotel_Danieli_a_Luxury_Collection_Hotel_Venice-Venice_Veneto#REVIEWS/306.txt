Booked in yesterday (Monday) after our sensational stay at the Gritti Palace last year. however from the initial greeting we received from the aggressive Black Security Staff in the hotel lobby on arrival, we decided to try and cancel our room and on asking to see the Concierge about his attitude, he decided he could speak little or no English and just wondered off mid sentence.

We are extremely sorry for the initial impression you had concerning the attitude of our Security Staff and Concierge upon your arrival at the hotel. I am surprised about our concierge speaking a little English, since all of them fluently speak at least Italian and English, I can only assume that the person you met was a luggage attendant. Being a place that people will make a special treat to visit, located in the heart of Venice, we have to supervise the main entrance of the hotel to make the Danieli even more secure; I am sorry if our staff did not use the appropriate behaviour in welcoming you. I am sure it was not in their intention in any case, we will intervene to correct their attitude. In occasion of your next visit to Venice, please do not hesitate to contact me directly. Again, thank you for your feedback and  best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager Read more
