The hotel accommodations were arranged by the tour company we were touring with through Switzerland and Northern Italy, Sunrise Tours out of St. Louis, MO.  The hotel was lovely, very easy walk to St. Mark's Square, and in the perfect location to walk or use water taxi to see and do whatever one would have a mind to see and do.  The service was excellent, friendly, helpful and very professional.  Breakfast buffet was excellent, we ate on outside terrace just outside the dining area and the view was breathtaking.  We would stay here if/when we are fortunate enough to visit Venice again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 8, 2012Dear Kgiberson, Thank you for your feedback and for taking the time to post your favourable comments on the Hotel Danieli and we hope to welcome you back soon.
