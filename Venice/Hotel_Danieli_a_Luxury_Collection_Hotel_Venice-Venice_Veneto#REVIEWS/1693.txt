I have stayed at this hotel several times over twenty years. I look forward to returning to this great hotel every time I come back to visit Venice. The renovation of the rooms is wonderful. Upon arrival I was upgraded to one of their rooms with a terrace on the Grand Canal. A room with a view that has no comparable. The staff has been very attentive and gracious just like every other visit I have had. I look forward to my next visit back to a beautiful place and a wonderful hotel.
