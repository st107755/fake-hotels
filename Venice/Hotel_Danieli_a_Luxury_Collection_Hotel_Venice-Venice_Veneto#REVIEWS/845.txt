What a lovely hotel! We stayed here as a group of 6 friends and enjoyed every minute. The hotel is spectacular on the inside and so well located, only 2 mins walk to St. Marks Sq. The sunday brunch was worthwhile on the roof as the views were amazing. A perfect place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear Jess B, Thank you for posting your review on the TripAdvisor following your recent positive stay at the Hotel Danieli.
