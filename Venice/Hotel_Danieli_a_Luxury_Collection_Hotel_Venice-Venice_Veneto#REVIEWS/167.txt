Thank you hotel Danieli for the most wonderful stay. The room overlooking the doges palace was beautiful, the staff were so kind and courteous, the location in Venice is amazing for getting around. Our favourite part is the terrace restaurant we stayed there all afternoon on the first day and enjoyed our breakfasts there every morning. I canâ€™t wait to return again and again. What a wonderful place. Read moreDate of stay: February 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
