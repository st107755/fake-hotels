From the minute our trip started to the hotel with transportation that they had provided we knew we were in for a treat.  First class, top notch hotel in Venice.  We decided to upgrade to a suite with a view and it was worth every penny.  Large room, comfortable bed, and large elegant bathroom.  Will definitely stay again when back in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 25, 2016Dear Susan V, Thank you for your review of the Hotel Danieli.
