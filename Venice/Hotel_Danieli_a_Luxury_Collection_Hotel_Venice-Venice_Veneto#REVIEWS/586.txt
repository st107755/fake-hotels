We stayed for 3 days and this included the Feast of the Redeemer which celebrates Venice emergence from the Plague  It's a magical city and this wasn't our first visit. Logistically you must do your prep and plan what you can move yourself easily. If you can't then your transfer options from the excellent airport become more expensive  This is a unique hotel and it's heritage amazingly preserved. Fantastic location and the rooms just amazing.   Service excellent and utterly professional. Relatively speaking Italy is a wonderful noisy country and Venice no different  Don't stay here if you are worried about the bill Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 19, 2017Dear Andrew, Thank you for choosing to stay at The Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your kind review on the TripAdvisor website.
