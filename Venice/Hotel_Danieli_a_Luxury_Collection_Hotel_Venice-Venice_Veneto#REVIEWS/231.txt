The service is top notch. Check-in was gracious and smooth and every time I called or emailed the concierge they delivered fast and efficiently (I complained about the toiletries and they brought me better ones). Rooms are small (at least the deluxe room I stay). Breakfast is generous (maybe they should present it better???) and views from top-roof are lethal. I missed a Nespresso machine in the room (I had the impression that this is a staple for all Luxury Collection member hotels).Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
