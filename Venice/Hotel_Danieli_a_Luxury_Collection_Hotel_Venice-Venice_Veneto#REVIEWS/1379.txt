Great location, fantastic history.. but don’t depend on the concierge service. They forgotten to collect us from the airport (service ordered and confirmed three months in advance). We booked water taxi on our departure the evening before – and it was forgotten again. On a positive side – breakfast at the roof restaurant is really something special and unique! Few tips: try to have a room in the main building, two other buildings were constructed much later. Ask for the porter service with your luggage – there is plenty of stairs and lifts are constantly out of order. At the roof restaurant – don’t leave table unattended even for a moment. It will be taken by birds immediately.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 20, 2015Dear Ryszard W, We are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay at the Hotel Danieli.
