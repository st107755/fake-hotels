My visit was outstanding in every way. We begin with the speedy efficient work of the bell staff unloading our luggage from the water taxi to prompt room delivery.   At check in there was no wait. When our room was ready they insisted on showing us around the hotel and the features of our suits.  This hotel is appointed with a wonderful blend of modern conveniences and lots of old world charm Justin case you might forget about the wonderful city you are visiting. The restaurant on the 4th floor is elegant and one f the best in the city.  I am in hotels every week. Danieli gets my very highest recommendation.  Bravo!
