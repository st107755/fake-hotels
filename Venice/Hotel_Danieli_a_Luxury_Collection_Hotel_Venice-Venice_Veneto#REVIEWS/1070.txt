Please accept my profuse apologies for the issues you experienced during your stay with us. The issues you described were inexcusable and I cannot apologize enough for them. This is certainly not the level of service that we want our guests to leave with, and while I understand that we only have one opportunity to make a first impression, I would love for you to give us a chance to make this up to you and show a side of the Hotel Danieli that we are exceedingly proud of. I hope that you will give us this chance. Should you decide to give us another chance, please reach out to me directly and I will personally see to it that you have an amazing stay with us. I hope to hear from you soon.  Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
