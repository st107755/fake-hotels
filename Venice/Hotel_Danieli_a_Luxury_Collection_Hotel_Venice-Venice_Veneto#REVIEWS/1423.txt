We have been staying at the Danieli almost every year for over 20 years with a short gap of 4 years until this year.  One of the most important features for us is that the very high standards of hospitality are maintained consistently year in and year out.  The housekeeping, service and comfort are flawless throughout and just what you would expect from one of the best run hotels in Italy - never mind Venice.  When we heard that there was a new general manager - Snr Silver Carpanese - who had been appointed recently we are concerned that the previously achieved high standards may have slipped or the emphasis changed perhaps to a more corporate feel.  I am pleased to say that is definitely not the case and that perfection continues and perhaps even enhanced if that is possible. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 26, 2015Dear Orfordness, Thank you for giving us again the opportunity to take care of you on your recent visit to The Hotel Danieli.
