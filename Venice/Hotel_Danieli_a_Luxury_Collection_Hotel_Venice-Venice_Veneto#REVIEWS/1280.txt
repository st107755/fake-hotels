An excellent luxury hotel, adjacent to St Mark's Square and looking out across the lagoon. We booked via Expedia and weren't disappointed. It is not cheap but you get luxury, elegance and very good (understated) service. We had two connecting rooms and lots of space. Dining was prohibitively expensive for us (there are of course many other options) but breakfast on the Rooftop Terrace was a real treat. Panoramic views, a great way to start the day.  Overall would highly recommend. A place of history and character. And excellent Italian service.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 17, 2015Dear Mike H, Thank you so much for your review!
