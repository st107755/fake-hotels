The building for Hotel Danieli dates back to 1387 when it was a home of some wealthy families next to the Doge Palace and Saint Mark's Square & Basilica.  The hotel has excellent service and opulent decor. They have a rooftop restaurant where you can survey the boat traffic in the ship channel and the opening of the Grand Canal - great breakfast buffet.  The restaurant for lunch and dinner was nice, but not to our preferences as much.  We preferred eating out at other restaurants for lunch and dinner.  They also have a great bar and on many nights a great piano player / singer.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 8, 2016Dear Alex H, Thank you for taking your time to provide your comments.
