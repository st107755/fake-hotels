Just got engage & what a beautiful hotel to stay at, it's a magical place and already, my partner & I are planning to go back. We stayed for a few nights & it was a magical time, relaxing with breath taking views from our Luxury Lagoon room balcony. Excellent service & fantastic resturant upstairs Terrazza Danieli, having lunch on the roof top over looking San Marco. Thanks Hotel Danieli for everything & fond memories will live on.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 10, 2013Dear BrizA78, We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed your stay and also that you appreciated the food, the friendly and professional service as well as the facilities that the Hotel Danieli offers.
