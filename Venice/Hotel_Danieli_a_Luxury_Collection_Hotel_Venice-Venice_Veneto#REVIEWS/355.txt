From the moment my wife and I arrived on June 1 until we left on June 3rd the service was outstanding.  First, the front desk recognized that my wife and I were celebrating a special anniversary and upgraded us from a water view room to a wonderful 3 room suite with a balcony. He also recognized my Starwood Status and Amex Status.  The reception desk was spot on!  The reception desk could only be topped by the concierge staff.  They took care of any need, any recommendation, anything we requested with friendliness and professionalism.  While this is a VERY expensive hotel, I felt the combination of location and service was worth it.  Great experience all around!Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
