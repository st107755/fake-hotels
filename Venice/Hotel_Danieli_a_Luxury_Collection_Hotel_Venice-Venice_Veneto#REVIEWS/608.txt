My wife and I travelled here on the Orient Express from London and celebrated her birthday in a Venetian gondola (well....not the WHOLE day!).  The hotel is exceptional without being ostentatious, the staff are for the most part friendly and helpful but bear in mind that they are often extremely busy dealing with a host of guests who speak neither Italian nor English.  Breakfasts were scrummy with an English option, tho' not real back bacon of course and no proper bangers; lovely tho all the same, with terrific views up the Grand Canal.  Dinner would have been an expense too far I'm afraid, so we ate in a little cafe off St Mark's Square. Go for it! You only live once.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 26, 2017Dear Montur, Thank you for your fantastic feedback regarding your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli.
