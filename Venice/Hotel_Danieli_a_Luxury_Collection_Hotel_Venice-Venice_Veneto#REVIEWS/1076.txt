A really good hotel if you get a discounted price.  However, if you pay full price then it is not living up to the standards. Room is very nicely decorated (we stayed in newer part of the hotel) but without an "oomph". Mattress and linen are of high quality but pillows were very hard. Breakfast buffet was a big disappointment, compared to another hotel I stayed a night before which was twice less expensive. The choices in buffet were rather limited, especially selection of breads and pastries.  Internet kept logging you off and you had to relogin.Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 7, 2016Dear YUNATONI, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel. I was glad to read you enjoyed your stay and that you found your room to your liking. I was however sorry to read that you did not appreciate and enjoy the breakfast selection served in the Terrace Restaurant.  I would like to advise you that we are forwarding your remarks to our Restaurants Director to give that area immediate attention. We would also like you to elaborate the reason behind these scoring to allow us to better serve you and our guests in the future. Kind regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
