I do think this is the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in.  You feel like you are in an old romantic movie.  The rooms stay true to the Venitian style with fabric walls and beutiful draperies, the lighting all seem to be from Murano.  Everything about this place is beautiful.  The hotel has a water taxi stand on the canal that can take you anywhere you need to go!  The only reason I only gave this hotel 4 stars is because you can't just go to the restaurant to get a cup of coffee or snack, you have to call room service which isn't convenient if you are heading out for the day.  The hotel is next door to the Doge's palace so you are practically staying in St Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 18, 2014Dear TCM327, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and I certainly hope that your future travels to Venice will bring you back to the Hotel Danieli.
