Fantastic stay at the Danieli - next door to St. Marks and Doge's Palace - opposite multiple boat stops, so easy to get to anywhere - fantastic service: typical lag between call and delivery < 5 minutes; concierge remembered to book me a table at a great restaurant 2 days later as the restaurant was closed in between with no reminders  Only issue: restaurant charges cover charges even to hotel guests!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 9, 2011Dear Jude2410, Thank you for your feedback and for taking the time to post your favourable comments on the Hotel Danieli and we hope to welcome you back soon.
