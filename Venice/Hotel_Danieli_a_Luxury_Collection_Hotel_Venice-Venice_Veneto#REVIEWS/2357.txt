We stayed for one night at the hotel Danieli on July 9th and the experience was perfect from the moment we arrived till we left. We stayed at beautiful room 76 in the older building and it was perfect, great size and beautiful decoration! The staff was gracious and kind and helpful all the way.  The hotel is stunning, I felt (and was treated) like Joan Collins!  Congratulations to the Management for maintaining such a top notch hotel throughout the years.  We are already planning to return (very soon I hope!).  Grazie Danieli!Read moreDate of stay: July 2008HelpfulShare
