I travelled to Venice with my wife on the 19th February - 23rd February 2013 and stayed in room 262 (Lagoon View). A wonderful 14th century hotel that is exceptionally well located (literaly minutes from the Doge's Palace). The hotel staff are very courteous and the attention to detail is excellent. The Lagoon View rooms offer a wonderful view but be prepared for the noises from the various water taxis coming and going pretty much constantly through the day and night.  Dinner at the hotel restaurant is of a very high quality but prices are very, very expensive (this applies to most of Venice).  Room Service costs are also very expensive so exercise some caution when ordering!Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 28, 2013Dear Robert M, Thank you again for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
