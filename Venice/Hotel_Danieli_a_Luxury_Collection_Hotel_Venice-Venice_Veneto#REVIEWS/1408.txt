We had planned to stay at a rental apartment in Venice but on arrival, found it to be a total dump. With a few clicks on the Starwood app, I reserved a basic room at the Danieli. On arrival less than an hour later, we were met at the front desk by Stella - an extremely welcoming and lovely person. She upgraded us to one of the Dandolo Suites - a very happy surprise! She then walked us to the room which was stunning - double-height ceiling, silk wallpaper, Murano chandeliers... Venetian perfection. In addition to the beautiful suite, we enjoyed top-notch service from housekeeping (who went out of their way to find my daughter's lost blanket), the concierge team, and everyone at the rooftop restaurant where we enjoyed a delicious daily breakfast with the best view in town.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 13, 2015Dear cmmnj, Thank you for choosing The Hotel Danieli for your visit to Venice, it was a pleasure to have you stay with us.
