This hotel, surely rates near the top of unique hotel experiences. The location right by  Piazza San marco, is ideal.... The hotel is stylish and an experience.

Breakfast on the terrace is a must when staying at this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 1, 2014Dear staffano2014, Many thanks for recently staying with us whilst visiting Venice and also for having taken the time to provide us with your positive  feedback.
