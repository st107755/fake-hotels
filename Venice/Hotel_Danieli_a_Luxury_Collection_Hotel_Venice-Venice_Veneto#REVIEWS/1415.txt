A once in a life time experience is to stay and eat in this hotel. While I imagined better seating and tables on the roof top dining area, the service, quality of the food and most importantly the view from the top of this hotel is simply breathtaking especially when the sun is setting from the south. The hotel interior is a masterpiece with rich history. It's also great that this hotel is affiliated with spg.com so you can collect lots of points during your stay.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 8, 2015Dear FirstClassLuxury001, We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed your stay and also that you appreciated the food, the friendly and professional service as well as the facilities that the Hotel Danieli offers.
