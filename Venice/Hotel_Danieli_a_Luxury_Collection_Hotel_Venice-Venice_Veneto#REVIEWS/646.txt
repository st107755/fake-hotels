You cannot beat this hotel for location.  Walking distance from San Marco and the water taxi takes you right to the check in dock.  But you pay for the convenience.  The hotel is showing its age...and the proximity to the canal (especially when it rains and the tide is in) makes the place smell overly musty.  But as they say, on a clear day, and when you can swipe away a pigeon or two or twenty two, the bar and terrace on the roof is spectacular.  So, stop complaining.  After all, this is Venice...a city worth visiting, at least once.  Put up with the crowds and odors.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 23, 2017Dear LAR1942, Thank you for taking the time to complete a review of our hotel.
