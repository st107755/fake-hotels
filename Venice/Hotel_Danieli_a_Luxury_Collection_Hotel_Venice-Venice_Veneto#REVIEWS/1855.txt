My son and I stayed here in August.  We found a good deal on Expedia, otherwise we could not have afforded to stay here.  The lobby is beautiful as are the bar and staircases.  Our room was charming and spacious complete with Murano glass chadelier! The staff were helpful and competent.  It was our second trip to Venice and staying here was amazing!  We went to the Lido on the private motor launch shared with the Hotel Excelsior which made the trip out ever so much more delightful than public vaporetto.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 2, 2013Dear Barbara Z, Thank you for your review, the team and I were delighted that you enjoyed the stay and found the service that you received from the team to be good.
