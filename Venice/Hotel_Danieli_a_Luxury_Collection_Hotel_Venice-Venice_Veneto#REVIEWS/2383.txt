We had a great experience here, but I read reviews first and knew what to expect.  A 5 star hotel, in old Europe terms, The Danieli is an amazing place.  Do ask to be in the old building ahead of time.  Do have the breakfast there once.  It's expensive, so pig out & enjoy!  Some of the best food we had.  The free hotel boat to the Lido was a must.  Next time we'll stay on the Lido, but it was great to stay right in the middle of it all, at a great old hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2007HelpfulShare
