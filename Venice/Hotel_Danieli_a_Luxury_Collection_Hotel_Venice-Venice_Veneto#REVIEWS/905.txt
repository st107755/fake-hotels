This hotel is truly stunning and location to match.... Our room was upgraded on arrival, which was a lovely gesture..... Our room was in the building on the right of the main hotel, beautiful room and very clean... I was looking forward to a cup of tea in the morning only to find no tea or coffee facilities in the room, also outside noise with what sounded like carts being pulled up and down the side street and shouting at 6am every morning, I'm so pleased we took earplugs..... To stay at this hotel is a defiantly must and would highly recommend to anyone going to Venice..Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
