When I travel I usually select an ultra-modern hotel but decided on hotel Danieli based on a recommendation from my travel group.  So glad I listened because I didn’t realize that I would appreciate the old world charm and breathtaking beauty of the lobby and guest rooms.  I experienced  First Class service, dining with breathtaking views of Venice, evening turn down service and a hotel in the center of all of the action.  Steps away from San Marco Cathedral, Café Lavena and of course a romantic gondola ride. The concierges anticipated or needs and there were services that were provided that I have never had before.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
