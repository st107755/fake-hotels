Had a fantastic stay at Hotel Danieli last week.  It is absolutely stunning.  Our room was fabulous, with a great updated bathroom, plenty of space.  In particular, they were very gracious about a misunderstanding about us having our children, and made great accommodation with rollaway. The lobby and overall architecture is truly breathtaking.Read moreDate of stay: April 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 6, 2013Dear flowers40, Thank you very much for your recent review of our property on TripAdvisor.
