We stayed 3 nights at the Danieli as part of our honeymoon.  It definitely has the 'wow' factor for many reasons.  The lobby and public areas are breathtaking - you really will be open-mouthed when you first see them.  Our bedroom was small and dark (and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen!) but given you are in a 14th century palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal - you forgive this!  Service was excellent, we had champagne and chocolates in our room on arrival which was a simple but nice touch..  It's VERY expensive, even for venice so beware when ordering food and drinks!  We had a problem with our room that the management dealt with swiftly and incredibly professionally - with no quibbles but just a fantastic goodwill gesture from the hotel for the trouble caused. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2007HelpfulShare
