We have just returned home after spending 3 truly memorable nights at the Hotel Danielli. We had a lagoon view room, which we  recommend as the views were stunning. We were put into room 10 which we have since found out is a very famous room (George Sands) stayed in there. The staff could not do anymore for you. What a wonderful way to spend our 9th anniversaryRead moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
