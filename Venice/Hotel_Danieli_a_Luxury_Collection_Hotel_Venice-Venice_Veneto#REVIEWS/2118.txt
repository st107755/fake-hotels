The location is fantastic. Next door to St Mark square.Grand Cannal frontage. Arrival was warmly recieved. Rooms are quite aged,but since its building history dated back over a hundred years,it can be chaarming. Signiture staircase leading up to the first floor is impressive to take picture! Excellent location of restaurant on the top open air terrace, I Feel is the best view to have breakfast and to dine esp. with live jazz trio in the evening.  All that being said, you feel they really push for the value,since room price is wuite hign.But all 5 star luxury properties are. Service is considered nothing special for price paid. We feel its because to has over hundred rooms. And the location and layoput of the lobby is that it gets heavy guest traffic flow from small door entranceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
