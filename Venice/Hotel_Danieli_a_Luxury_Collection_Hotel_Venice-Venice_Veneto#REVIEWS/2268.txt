Our stay was suppose to be 3 nights but we only stayed 1 night. The service was so cold-it seemed like we were bothering them for anything. I don't think they like Americans! The room was dinghy and old-the bed felt like I was sleeping on hay. i could not move in the shower. The only luxury about the hotel is the beautiful lobby-big deal you are not sleeping in the lobby. I would find something cheaper where they treat you better and the rooms can't be any worse!Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
