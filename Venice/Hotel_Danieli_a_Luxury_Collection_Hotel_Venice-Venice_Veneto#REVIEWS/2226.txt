We changed our reservation at the last minute so we could stay at this beautiful hotel.  We were not disappointed.  Our room was fabulous and overlooked the grand canal.  The decor was elegant and the service was top notch.   I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay at 5* hotel in Venice.   It's pricey, but well worth it !Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
