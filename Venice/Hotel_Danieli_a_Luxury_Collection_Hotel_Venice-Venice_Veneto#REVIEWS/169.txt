This hotel is a treasure located near San Marco. Rooms are elegant, very well organized and spacious. The lobby is very impressive, including the lobby bar with elegant lights and amazing flower arrangements. Staff is friendly and helpful too. Special thanks to Natalia for the information provided at the check-in. The roof bar/restaurant is a must on a sunny day for the gorgeous view. Vaporetto station is just in front of the hotel. Overall an amazing experience, a feeling that you live in a palace. The lobby is perfect for photoshooting, but also each floor has a beautiful elegant design.
