This hotel from outside to inside or stunning. But YOU do pay for it!! We did not stay at this location due to nightly pricing...but we did sit down to have (2) drinks at the bar. It comprised of one Crown and Coke...the other was a simple House Wine. The bill in US dollars was 62 bucks.If you think this is a bargain...then please book your stay here and drink all day or until your $$ runs out. I say go for a visit...say you there and move on to get your drinks, food and etc.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
