I went around and around on this hotel(it was my 3rd choice)…I was booking through American express and it is listed in the Centurion book..SOOO How bad could it be??? Well I was hoping to book rooms at the Bauer or Gritti Palace but they were not available (amazing by the way, but on the other end od square) so my concierge at Amex said this one is good, so I did it. Location was amazing! This was the last leg of our Itay family trip (Rome, Tuscany, Firenze, Venice) Family of 5 ..3 kids 21, 19, 17.. When we first arrived at the hotel I thought what in the world..seemed so old and out dated!!
