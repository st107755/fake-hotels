What an amazing property. From the moment you enter you feel the history of Venice surround you. It is truly gorgeous. The service was excellent and a wonderful location. The rooms were beautiful and roomy with all the modern conveniences. There was a security guard stationed at the entrance which made it nice and prevented many tourists from just walking thru the hotel just to look. This made sitting in the lobby bar for a drink before dinner very pleasurable. The upper terrace for breakfast had an amazing view of the water. I would highly recommend Hotel Danieli.
