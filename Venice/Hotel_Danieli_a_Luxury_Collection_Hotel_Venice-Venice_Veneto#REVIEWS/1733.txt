We spent 2 nights in this beautiful hotel located on the Grand Cannel. Excellent location near ST. Marks Square. We had a king bed with adequate room & bathroom space, with large closets for longer stays. This is a beautiful old palace which has been converted into a hotel. A very nice roof top terrace overlooking the Grand Cannel and most of the city.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
