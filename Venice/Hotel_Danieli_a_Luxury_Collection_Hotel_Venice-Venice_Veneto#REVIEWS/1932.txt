Such a beautiful hotel. Because of our SPG gold status, they upgraded us to a beautiful luxury deluxe double room. The staff was friendly and attentive. Because its a small hotel, the front desk and taxi area can get crowded...just be aware if you are in a hurry to leave. The bell captain was very attentive, however, and found us a water taxi out on the square because of the backup at their own dock. Beautiful rooftop restaurant - just be aware of the astronomical prices! They also charge a 12 euro per person cover charge even if you are a guest at the hotel. But overall wonderful hotel, great location and service. Will definitely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 24, 2012Dear naush76, Thank you for your feedback and for taking the time to post your favourable comments on the Hotel Danieli and we hope to welcome you back soon.
