From the moment we entered this beautiful building we were treated like royalty by the staff. Friendly, attentive, caring.  The room was gorgeous...we had one of the front rooms in the 17th Century part of the hotel. The view of the lagoon, watching the hustle and bustle of the water bus and gondolas and seeing the fantastic buildings each day was fabulous.  The domestic help maintained the room beautifully. Room service was prompt. Hotel service was excellent and staff were patient and helpful.  This hotel is gorgeous...but no hotel is worth anything if the staff and care is not up to scratch. The team at the Danieli got it just right.  A perfect holiday.Read moreDate of stay: March 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 3, 2015Dear Jim M, I was very pleased to learn how much you enjoyed your stay with us and I would like to thank you for letting me know how impressed you were with the service you received.
