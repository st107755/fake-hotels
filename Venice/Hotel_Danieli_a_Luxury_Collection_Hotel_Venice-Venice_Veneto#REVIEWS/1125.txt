Although an old hotel (a former Palazzo from the 15th century) one can't deny being in a GRAND OLDE HOTEL!  The personnel is super efficient,the food was superb , at breakfast!  and , if staying in the back rooms, they are very quiet, and a very wonderful "air" about them which is hard to explain.  We enjoyed our stay tremendously. The evenings in the bar were very nice and relaxing to the music of the fabulous piano Player and Great drinks. Would recommend it to anyone over a certain AGE!!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear Ludwig71937, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
