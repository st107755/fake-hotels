We were there for Biennale. The rooms are quite old and does need a renovation. The staff is not very friendly- Concierge guys are a bit intimidating even as they stare you down as you walk in. What I do love is that this hotel has its own speed boat docking area which is very convenient to and from the airport! Itâ€™s location is excellent!

I am very sorry to hear that you found the room you were allocated not to be to your liking, please allow me to extend my sincere apologies if we were unable to entirely meet your expectations.  We always encourage our staff for an helpful and friendly approach and we know too well that an improper attitude can make a real difference. Once again, thank you for your constructive criticism; in spite of this average experience, we all hope that you will allow us another opportunity to display the type of hospitality you expect and deserve in the future. Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager Read more
