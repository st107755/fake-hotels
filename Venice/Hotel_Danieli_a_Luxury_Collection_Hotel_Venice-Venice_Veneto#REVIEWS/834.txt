We stayed in August 2016 on the night of our engagement - words cannot describe this beautiful hotel. Super attention to detail and the reception staff were extremely helpful. Showing us to our room in the right-hand wing, which was luxurious and wonderful to stay in. We had the perfect night and will return when we are next in Venice - it was flawless. Definitely worth paying for breakfast - it was slightly cheaper at reception than I had seen advertised - what a stunning way to start the day, do not miss this!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear samandbecca, Thank you for your great comments about our Hotel Danieli; It is always great to read such great feedback as your own and I will personally pass on your kind words to our staff.
