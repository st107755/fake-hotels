Since the chances of returning to Venice is small, we thought it was worth it to stay somewhere memorable! It was definitely worth it! The hotel is gorgeous and the service is excellent. If you walk around the hotel you will find there is almost like a different theme  to each area.   Our room didn't have a view but was compensated gorgeous decor and marbled bathrooms.   We would like to thank our friend Carlo Tobaldo for getting us a room at a great price and convincing us to stay there!!Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 22, 2016Dear Patu18, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
