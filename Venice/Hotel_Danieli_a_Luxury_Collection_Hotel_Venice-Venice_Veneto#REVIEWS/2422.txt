In Venice Oct Of 2006 ....Stayed at the Westin Regina last year same time.  Felt better overall at the Westin....But there is something to be said for the grand show of this old stately Hotel Danieli.  Found everything average..Felt it was time to fix the place a bit..everything was a bit ragged at the edges.   Location great...no complaints about staff or service....but know praises either.   So my average overal experience is just that.  By the way I note other travlers complaining about price vs value on many properties like this one.   Shop them early and deal direct with the Hotel.  $$$ Values a plenty to be had at all of the best Hotels with a bit of effort and early bookings. Read moreDate of stay: October 2006HelpfulShare
