The best thing at the hotel is the breakfast on the rooftop, food was great and the view was beautiful.   Reception area looks pretty cool too. Location was perfect for our first time in Venice. We could access everything we needed and the important attractions were walking distance.   The rooms are very traditional in style but we had a nice big dressing room and bathroom which was great and spacious.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 28, 2017Dear Jade G, We are glad that aspects of your stay such as breakfast, food and location were all to your liking.
