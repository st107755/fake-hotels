This is a must hotel to visit.  We stayed from Friday - Monday.  It is stunning, in style and price! The staff were very friendly and accommodating - I felt the room we were given was too small and had no view, so they changed it. Breakfast on the roof  was breathtaking. We could have stayed all day.  You may have to linger around for a table outside.  We did not bother with any other meals here after reading other reports.  Of the three restaruants we tried I would only recommend THE MET at the Metrople Hotel.  It has 2 michelin stars for a good reason. Don't bother with Da Fiore, this has 1 star but I can't see why! The position of the Danieli could not be improved on, right next to St Marks square.  If you want to spend the money on a romantic hotel this is the one.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
