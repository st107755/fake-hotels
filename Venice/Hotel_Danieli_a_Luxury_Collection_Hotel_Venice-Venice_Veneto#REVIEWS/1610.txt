My husband and I had a wonderful stay in this beautiful old hotel. The reception staff made us feel very welcome as did all the hotel staff - there was a grumpy younger guy upstairs in the roof bar but he didn't mar our first experience of overlooking the grand canal in all it's late afternoon glory. It is very well situated near St Marks square and we didn't have any trouble finding delicious places' to eat and drink down the alley ways near the hotel. I did think that it was a little over priced as I am sure that there are many nice hotels in Venice but we had a beautiful room ( no view but ... ) and it was super comfortable. I would definitely recommend it if you want to splash out for a little bit of luxury.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 3, 2014Dear LisaDubai, We are grateful for your support and look forward to welcoming you at Hotel Danieli in the future.
