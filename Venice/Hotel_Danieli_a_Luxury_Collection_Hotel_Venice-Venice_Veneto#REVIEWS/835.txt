We (couple + 12-year-old daughter) only had 24 hours in Venice pre-cruise, but staying in the Danieli made this a really special visit. From the private water taxi booked through the hotel (we were met in the baggage collection area, so we didn't even have to lift a finger with our luggage), the comfortable room with stunning view of the grand canal, the location a couple of minutes' stroll from St Mark's Square - everything was perfect! Breakfast and dinner on the Terrazza were the icing on the cake.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear Madeline M, Thank you for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
