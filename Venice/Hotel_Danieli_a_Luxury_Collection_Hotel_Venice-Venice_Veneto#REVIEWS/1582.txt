This hotel is breathtaking. From the moment your water taxi drops you off at the entrance you are welcomed by friendly bellboys and greeted into the stunning lobby. The lobby of the Danieli alone is worth the stay. The architecture and the sculpted walls are a sight to see. The rooms are spacious with classic furniture. You get complimentary macaroons upon entry :) The view from the room is directly on the waterfront overlooking the gondolas. The hotel has its own gondola rental space which make it convenient to take a ride. The hotel is a step away from St. Marco square where the best cafes and sightseeing is done.   The breakfast terrace overlooks the beautiful waterfront. Overall the service was great and the staff were very helpful.Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 22, 2014Dear Ash T, Thank you for your comments and for staying with us.
