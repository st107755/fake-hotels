We loved this hotel - could have spent hours a day on our terrace overlooking the water.  The restaurant on the roof is perfect for breakfast each day, the live entertainment in the lobby is fun, and the location is perfect for walking everywhere.  You will not be disappointed with this hotel.  One more thing:  use the concierge for help with booking boat transportation, dinner reservations, and walking tours.  They were extremely helpful.Read moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
