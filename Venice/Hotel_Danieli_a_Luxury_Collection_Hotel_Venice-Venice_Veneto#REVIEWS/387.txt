It is a very nice hotel with a lot of history.  You can’t beat the location. The staff is attentive and the view from the deck at the restaurant is unmatched.  I didn’t give it 5 stars because while it is a 5 star hotel and it is worth the money in most ways, because of the location and age the rooms are small and old. It is what it is but compared to other hotels in the price range it’s a fair fault. Also the workout room is super small. But they so have free water bottles there. Keep that in mind.  And unless you are paying top dollar, don’t expect your room to come with a great view.  Highly recommend the place though. Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
