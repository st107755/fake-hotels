We spent New Year's Eve here - a 3 day visit with our teenage children. The rooms are a nice size and some have a great view over Venice. The hotel restaurant is a highlight, with amazing views from the terrace. Breakfast is a bit limited, but the dinner is very good, and very expensive. The New Year Cocktail dinner was a big, big disappointment though: a cheerless room, with a limited selection of very uninspiring food and an understocked and understaffed bar. Incredibly expensive for what was provided! This was a "trap" we need not have fallen into!Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 8, 2015Dear David011158, Thank you so much for taking the time to post your feedback on the site following your stay with us which is greatly estimated.
