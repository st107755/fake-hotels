My husband and I stayed at the Danieli for two nights after disembarking from a 12 night Mediterranean cruise. First the positives: Venice is a magical place and the hotel is a short walk to St. Mark's, the Rialto Bridge and the other famous sights of Venice. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The hotel is made up of three old palaces, with the emphasis on old.Now the negatives: our room was small and the sink in the bathroom was cracked. The floor tiles were also worn and a few were broken.  A glass of tap water in the lobby while we waited for our room to be made ready cost 4 euros and a cup of coffee was 8 euros. The for sale bathrobe was of shoddy quality. All in all, we would not stay at this hotel again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2010HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 14, 2010Dear bhrdoc , Thank you for taking the time to share your review of the Hotel Danieli.
