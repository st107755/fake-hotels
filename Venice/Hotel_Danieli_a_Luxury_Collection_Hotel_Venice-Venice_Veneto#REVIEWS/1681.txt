This hotel is beautiful. It's located right on the Grand Canal. The rooms are fantastic. The service is top notch. Venice is without a doubt the MOST romantic city in the entire world. Danieli is the best hotel in Venice. I have stayed in others and this is the best. They make movies here for a reason. If you are in love or want to be, this is the place to stay.Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 2, 2014Dear paul1009, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your observations from your last visit with us I do hope we have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the future,  with best regards, The Hotel ManagementRead more
