Amazing views from this hotel built in the 1400s.  Great history right off of San Marcos square.  My only recommendation is to get a higher floor, since it is on a main walkway and dock area, the street traffic can be loud on the lower flours.  Highly recommended hotel but it is pricey.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 14, 2016Dear Bill H, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
