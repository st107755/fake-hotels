Beautiful hotel although ridiculously expensive food and drink. Went for my birthday in December and the main reason we stayed here was for the roof terrace but it was closed for refurbishment which we were very disappointed about, we asked for a room upgrade and they refused. They made me a birthday cake which was lovely and far too big for two people and then charged us 40 euros for it. Cocktails were a ridiculous price, 14 euros I think. Our room was lovely and big and beautifully decorated as where the corridors and landings. Our view was rubbish though, basically a brick wall.  The staff there were very polite and efficient although sometimes standoffish. Lovely little box of chocolates left in the room every day.Read moreDate of stay: December 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 7, 2016Dear MelissaJC71, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your observations from your last visit.
