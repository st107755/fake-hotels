The good thing is that the rooms are very nice, clean and spacy. Very elegant in colors and style. It was a true Venetian room that my wife and I did like so much. The one NOT GOOD experience I had was in the checking in as my room was not ready and when I returned to the hotel, it was given to someone else. This was a check-in mistake that should nto be done. I recommend that they change the carpets in the entrance as they are old and not safe.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
