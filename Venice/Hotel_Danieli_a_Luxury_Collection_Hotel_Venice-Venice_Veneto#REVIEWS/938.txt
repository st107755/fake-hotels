I love this hotel and it is absolutely brilliant hotel at venice, Italy. Firstly we had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal. Also,we had a jr. suite with a balcony over the canal next to the hotel. The staff is amazin and all of them provides us nice service. They have lots of staff always on duty. They treat everyone as a guest.It iis truly the place to stay in Venice, though it was not so much cheap but better.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 19, 2016Dear VanWolfe58, Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli.
