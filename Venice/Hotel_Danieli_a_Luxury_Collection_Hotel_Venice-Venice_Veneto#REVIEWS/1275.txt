We stayed stayed at the Daniel for 2 nights in July for our 25th wedding. The hotel was amazing, beautiful public rooms and amazing panoramic breakfast terrace. The staff were efficient and helpful, breakfast was excellent. Our room was slightly disappointing we got the lagoon view as requested it spotlessly clean but it was quite small and the view although amazing was a smallish window that you had to stand up to look out off. However the complimentary sparkling wine and cookies and turn down service made up for it. Ideal for easy sightseeing. Had lovely stay and would definitely go back.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 17, 2015Dear Suzanne R, Thank you for taking the time to share your review with us, we look forward to seeing you again soon.
