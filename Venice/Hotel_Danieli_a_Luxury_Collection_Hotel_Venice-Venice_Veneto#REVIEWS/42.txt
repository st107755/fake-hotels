Had a great time here. Lovely lobby. Interconnecting rooms with our kids. Great breakfast. They were able to help us find gluten-free options for family member with celiac disease. Helpful staff. Close to San Marco without being in the middle of everything. Fantastic furnishings. Wish we could have stayed longer.Read moreDate of stay: November 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
