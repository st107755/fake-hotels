Hotel was good.  Great location and convenient.  Regardless of age of the hotel, 1000 per room per night your expect the ac to work properly.    We had 2 rooms and the ac wouldn't cool the rooms below 76 degrees.   The rooms were humid and horn so our stay wasn't comfortable.   Breakfest was good and nice views.  For that kind of money you can stay at another place that's more luxurious.   Or simply stay at a 4 star and spend your money on other things.

Please accept my apologies for the issues you experienced during your stay with us. The issues you described were inexcusable and I cannot apologize enough for them. This is certainly not the level of service that we want our guests to leave with, and while I understand that we only have one opportunity to make a first impression, I would love for you to give us a chance to make this up to you and show a side of the Hotel Danieli that we are exceedingly proud of. I hope that you will give us this chance.  I hope to hear from you soon.  Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
