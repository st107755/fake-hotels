When we are in Venice, we always visit the Terrace at the Danieli.  We used to have a great Sunday brunch over the past years, staying practically all day there, but this has now been limited to a noon until 3.30 slot.  However, you must visit, if not for lunch, but for a drink on the terrace from 3.30 to 6.30.  The view is wonderful.  My only slight moan is that the nibbles which are served with a quite pricy drink, are very disappointing. Ours were 3 small bowls of very soggy crisps.  We actually stay at The Gritti Palace and have also visited The Cipriani on several occasions, and neither of these hotels serve soggy crisps but a good selection of nibbles.  I know, a bit of a moan, but when your two drinks cost well over 50 euros, I think a better selection .please.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
