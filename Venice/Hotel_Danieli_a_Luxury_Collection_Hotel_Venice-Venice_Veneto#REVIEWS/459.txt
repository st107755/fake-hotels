There really should be more than 5 stars allowed. This hotel was simply divine. The design of the hotel was like a beautiful castle. The daily breakfast was simply delicious. The rooms and views were breathtaking. The service exceptional. I plan to visit again next year and stay for one month. Venice was amazing and being at this hotel made it a memory that will live with me forever! quick note, be mindful of which vendors you tell that you are staying at this hotel. They will over charge you based on the caliber of the hotel you are staying. This hotel is the best of the best!Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
