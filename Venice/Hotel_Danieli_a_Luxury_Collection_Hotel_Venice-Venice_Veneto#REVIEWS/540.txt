The hotel is a gracious old building (a collection of three buildings).  The room we had was very comfortable.  Whilst the hotel is located on the banks of the Grand Canal inside it is very peaceful.  The service was impeccable - particularly the housekeeping staff.  The one disappointment was the roof top restaurant.  I terrific location and views - the food was very overpriced (even for Venice) and very ordinary.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 28, 2017Dear Phillip G, Thank you for your positive review, we are sorry that you did not appreciate our rooftop Restaurant and sincerely hope to have soon the pleasure to welcome you back.
