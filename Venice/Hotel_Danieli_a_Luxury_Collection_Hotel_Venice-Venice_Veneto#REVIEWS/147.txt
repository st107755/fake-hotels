We had a long weekend that we stayed at this property.  It's beautiful and directly on the water.  Even though it rained the entire time we were in Venice, this property made it still magical.  The rooms and the history were stunning.  In addition, the breakfast was spectacular.  I would caveat my commentary that we did have a beautiful room with a view of the water and a balcony....not sure how other rooms with less stunning views may be perceived.  Tiny gym....this could be improved.....as in, no more than 2-3 people can be in it at the same time.  Also, I would echo another reviewers comments that the property allowed filming on the main staircase for some television show....it was ridiculous.  We were trying to catch a flight and they were in the way of all of the guestsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
