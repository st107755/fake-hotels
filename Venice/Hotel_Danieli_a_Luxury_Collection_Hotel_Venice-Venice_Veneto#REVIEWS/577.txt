We had a beautiful time at this hotel. The view from breakfast was breathtaking. The breakfast and lunch was delish. The service was great. The rooms were a little small. You can definitely add a roll away in a room w/ a king bed if needed for a 3rd person. I can't wait to go back with my family. Amazing!! Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
