Located within a stone's throw of Piazza San Marco, this was a great place to stay with a large group, including some with mobility limitations. The hotel is surprisingly large, with three interconnected buildings. We only had a chance to see some of the newer rooms and can't speak to the range of rooms available. Some of our rooms had rollaway beds, which made them very crowded.The service overall was excellent, but slightly impersonal, perhaps because of the volume of tourists who come in every day. All in all, while clearly a luxury collection hotel, we are probably going to explore other hotels in Venice in the future rather than return.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare
