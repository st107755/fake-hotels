this is a really nice historic hotel in a perfect location. pulling up at the jetty on a river taxi from the airport feels very cool. nowhere is cheap in venice so tough to talk about value for money. only thing that let the stay down was the slow service at check in as they were understaffed. Bottom line, id probably come back next time as didnt discover anywhere better.Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
