What a great hotel.  Our water taxi from the airport pulled right up to the door and immediately your bags are taken off and you are escorted to the front desk for check-in. The front lobby in awe inspiring and reminds you how opulent hotels used to be.  Upon check-in you are then escorted to your room and your bags are automatically sent to your room.  The rooms are a little small but quite comfortable and again opulent.  The staff is amazing and ready to serve every request.  The hotel is right in the middle of all the top attractions of the Grand Canal and is worth every penny .Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear Mike L, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your positive comments from your visit with us.
