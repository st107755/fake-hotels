We had visited Venice before but this time we were taking my 77 year old parents. It had been some years since they'd travelled abroad & we were determined to make it a lovely and memorable time. We worried about choosing a "luxury hotel" as we didn't want Mum & Dad feeling daunted or to risk encountering the sort of arrogance & standoffish'ness you can meet in some establishments. We needn't have worried. The Danieli was perfect from first encounter. Each & every member of staff was kind & attentive & very lovely. The views over Venice were just spectacular at breakfast, the cocktails in the evening were delightful. The hotel is just as you'd expect an ancient palace to be. Only more so. My parents dancing down the glorious staircase was a sight to behold!
