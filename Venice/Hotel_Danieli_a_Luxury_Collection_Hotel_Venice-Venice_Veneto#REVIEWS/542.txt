We have a very special time at Danieli Hotel. We celebrate a birthday, and at last time I requested a cake 1 night previous the arrival. I knew at that time was a little bit hard to confirm the cake, and Gabriele from Front Desk made toward the impossible to confirm my request. It was very very impresive how he did it. And also the cake was delicious. The views of hotel was also unfforgetable. I realy recomend this hotel in Venice. congratulation to all your staff! Keep on the way... Kindest regards from Mexico!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
