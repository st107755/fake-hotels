If it is location you are looking for then look no further.  Yes, this is pricey but it is in the middle of everything - close to Vapparetto, close to San Marco, easy walk to everything.  Rooms are small and "over done" for my taste but very nice.  Breakfast was included in our rate and the buffet was very good, the view was even better.  Only knock on the place is that you must leave your giant key at the front desk when going out and must retrieve it again upon return.  This is elegant but causes delay on the pick up if all the front desk folks are busy with other guests.  Also, seems like a bit of a security concern because you could really ask for any room key - not sure how they know the room is yours...Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
