We stayed here in Oct, it is a beautiful hotel located in the heart of Venice. Service was amazing. Great location.

We had a view of the canal and the rooftops which were breathtaking.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 7, 2012Dear SynthiaB, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay and had the time to experience some of the exciting sights and places in the vicinity.
