My friend and I recently stayed in this hotel.  It's a lovely Grande Dame of Venice.  The location is absolutely perfect, the staff welcoming, helpful and friendly, and the rooms extremely comfortable (especially the beds).  My one disappointment was immediately after arrival, we went up to the roof terrace for a drink on the recommendation of Reception.  This was 6.00pm.  A very surly barman said they were closing in ten minutes.  We sat down anyway, to admire the view.  People came in after us and were served with drinks.  We were completely ignored.  This was our introduction to Venice.  Totally unacceptable and we told both the barman and the reception.  This was the only incidence of rudeness we experienced.  EVERYWHERE else was charming.  We didn't let it colour the restâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 30, 2015Dear Julie T, Good day and thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
