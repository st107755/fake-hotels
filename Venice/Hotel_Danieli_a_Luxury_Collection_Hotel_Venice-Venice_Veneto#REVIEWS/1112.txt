Charming hotel, with a soul.  We got an upgrade for the night of the 31 of December and our room( a suite with the view on the canal, San Giorgio, San Marco, Chiesa Del Redentore) was just a dream. In the room and in the hotel itself you smell the atmosphere of the ancient Venice, with an elegant touch.  The dinner of the 31 on the Terrazza Danieli  was a nice event...the terrace has a stunning view and the best point of observation of the famous midnight fireworks, but the food and the wine offered were absolutely not worth the price. The music(electric piano and a singer) was out of contest..we suggest something more classical and in tune with the place, like a string quartet.  The breakfast though was good.
