Thank you, Robin Turner, at AmExp !!!!  This was the last stop on our 25 day holiday and we certainly saved the BEST for last !!!   A water taxi brought us right up to the hotel's side entrance (and picked us up to take us to the airport when we left) - ALL very convenient.  The Danieli will arrange the taxi service for you, if you ask.   The hotel is stunning - be sure to look at the photos - and the attention to detail at the reception desk and elsewhere is terrific.  The concierges were more than helpful in helping us plan dinners and events.  Breakfast out on the terrace was a great start each day.  They will prepare eggs any way you wish.  BUT - probably the greatest asset of the hotel is the "room with a view".  Be sure to reserve a front room looking out over the water. …Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 2, 2015Dear Patricia W, Thank you for such an excellent post.
