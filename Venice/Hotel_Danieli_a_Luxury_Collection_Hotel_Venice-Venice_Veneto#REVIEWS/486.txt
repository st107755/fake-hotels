The Hotel Danieli IS history.  To me Venice is spectacular and to be treated with a stay at one of the city jewels is very special.  Lobby is remarkable. Rooms and corridors are not my taste with Belle Watling (the madam from Gone With the Wind)  heavy red velvet   Definitely GO TO THE TERRACE for breakfast or meal.  The views are fantastic.  BUT keep someone at the table to fend off the pigeons.   .Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare
