I have stayed at the Danieli four times over the years and continue to be in love with its elegance and grandeur.  Perfectly located at the center of everything, this is an ideal base to explore Venice.  Breakfast on the roof is not to be missed.  Unless you are going for the view, dinner is not really an option here given the price and the abundance of alternatives just steps away.  Stefano in the restaurant deserves special mention for the good care he took of our son.  This type of effort separates the extraordinary from the merely ordinary.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 4, 2017Dear John D, I would like to thank you for your kind review and really look forward to welcome you for the fifth time!!
