Hotel Danieli made our experience in Venice!  From the lobby, to our room, to the  rooftop Terrace, everything was just gorgeous!  Our room in the 2nd building was spacious and the decor was elegant. The staff at checkin and checkout were so helpful, and the concierge as well. They even have umbrellas to borrow as you are going out the door in case in rains (we should have grabbed one!) We enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Sunrise on the Terrace. Staff at the restaurant super nice as well. Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
