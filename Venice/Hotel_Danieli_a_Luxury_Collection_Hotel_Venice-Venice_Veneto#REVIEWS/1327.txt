We decided to splurge on our recent Venice trip. Yes, this is a beautiful hotel and the lobby is stunning...HOWEVER, the staff is cold and the service is absolutely terrible.  I was shocked at how small our room was for $1000. a night - there was not even a place for both of our suitcases.... and we never got so much as a welcome or thank you the entire time we were there.  The roof top restaurant was going to be our special night out and with reservations a month in advance and knowing it was our anniversary they attempted to put us where we did not have any view..and our food was so average - NOT 5 star. Seriously so disappointed although the view is beautiful.  Two of the days we had to stand in line to get into the hotel it was so crowded.
