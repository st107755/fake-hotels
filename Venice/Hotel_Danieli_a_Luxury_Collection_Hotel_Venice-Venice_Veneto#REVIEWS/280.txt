Stayed at the Hotel Danieli while on a 3 day visit to Venice. The hotel is full of charm and elegance and is one of the oldest hotels in Venice. We even saw the hotel depicted in a painting from the mid 17th century.   This is not a cheap hotel! This is a once in a lifetime place to stay. The view from the rooftop bar is magnificent, but a beer will cost you 18 Euro and even a soda is 16 Euro. But, the hotel is absolutely magnificent.   Treat yourself to splendid and imagine yourself watching the merchants and high society stroll by the plaza walk. Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
