This hotel was above & beyond what we could have expected.  The hotel & staff were 5 star all the way.  We had room 202 it was spacious & comfortable, beautifully decorated.  You cannot pay for a better location hands down.  Included breakfast was fabulous & the view priceless.  Breakfast is served on the rooftop with views of the canal that are endless.  Don't even second guess this place.  You can walk to all main attractions,  great dining options all within walking distance & a very safe area all around.  Can't wait to go back.
