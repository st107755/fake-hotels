Let me preface that we are SPG platinum and arrived here after staying the spectacular Westin Florence.  We were given a choice of a suite with no view vs a tiny room facing the canal.  The Westin had upgraded us to the presidential suite facing the Arno.  The views of the Grand Canal were spectacular.  Complimentary breakfast in the rooftop restaurant was spectacular.  The whole building has a musty, damp smell.  This is Venice, I get it.  Also we couldnâ€™t change temperature in the room.  Hotel Danieli was a bit too formal.  I hate having to give the key to the concierge.  The lobby was an over 60 crowd at night.  Read moreDate of stay: January 2018HelpfulShare
