So much to take in at the hotel you hate to leave.   Our two room suite was beautiful.  The rooms are furnished in period style Venetian.   Our parlor had its own powder room and comfortable seating with balcony with a view of the Grand Canal.   The roof top patio is a must visit.  Sit outside and enjoy the view.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 8, 2018Dear Ilume, What a lovely review!
