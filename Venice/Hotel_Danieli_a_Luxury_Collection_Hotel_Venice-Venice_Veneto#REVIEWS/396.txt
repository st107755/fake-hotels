Just returning home from a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time we were met at the airport, the private boat transfer, the room, dinner with an amazing view until getting transferred back to the airport, everything was perfect.  Service was faultless, our room with balcony was beautiful, and the dinner was fantastic.  Thank you so much to everyone for making my wifeâ€™s special Birthday an incredible birthday   I would recomend this hotel  to anyoneRead moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
