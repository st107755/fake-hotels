Beautiful Hotel, fabulous location, the restaurant serves a FABULOUS breakfast and has probably the best view in all of Venice. The concierge was very gracious and helpful. Excellent service "downstairs". What was disappointing was the room cleaning (substandard) and the bed (HORRIBLY uncomfortable). Venice is fabulous but plan to stay elsewhere upon our return.Read moreDate of stay: May 2010HelpfulShare
