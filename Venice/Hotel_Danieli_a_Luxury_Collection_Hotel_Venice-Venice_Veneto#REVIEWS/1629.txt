Staying at the Hotel Danieli was like a trip back to a more elegant time.  The hotel is simply amazing!  The architecture and d√©cor were beautiful.  Our room was large, and the bathroom was large and gorgeous!  The staff was friendly, and accommodating with all our needs.  The Terrace restaurant offers breathtaking views of Venice and the food was fantastic.  I highly recommend staying here. I recommend taking the water taxi if you do plan a stay here.  It is great to have a taxi pull right up to the door of the hotel and the bell staff remove your luggage.  So much better than pulling the luggage across the cobblestones of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 24, 2014Dear TNByrd, Thank you very much for your feedback and we are happy to learn that you had an excellent stay and that you enjoyed both the accommodation assigned and the staff attitude.
