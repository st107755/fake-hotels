We just spent 2 nights at the Danieli and we were absolutely not disappointed. Refined service and very sophisticated, its not cheap and neither is it intended to be. Location, history and the roof terrace all add a special X factor to your stay.   We were delighted by the service and extra guest value delivered by the management in room 380 Monday - Wednesday this week. Unexpected and so appreciated. Thank you.  I also suggest guests use the facilities such as the amazing concierge who were so helpful and smiling throughout - restaurants / maps / water taxi to airport (which we highly recommend over the Vaporetto) and keeping our cases and special Venetian masks and glass gifts safe.  Oh and the tiramisu was amazing in the bar.  Thank you team Danieli.   Ellis couple.
