Stayed at this beautiful hotel earlier this month, the water taxi drops you off right outside the door, and our welcome was very friendly. The reception, lounge/bar is spacious and very impressive. Our luxurious bedroom overlooked the lagoon with superb views of Venice. Breakfast on the 4th floor terrace also overlooks the lagoon, and offers an extensive choice of menu beautifully prepared and presented. The freshly cooked omelettes to order are superb. Staying at this hotel is a 5 star experience all round.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 29, 2015Dear gatu189112, Thank you for writing about your stay with us, we greatly value the feedback we receive from our customers and know we can only improve if we truly listen to what our guests are saying about us.
