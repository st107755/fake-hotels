We decided to stay at the Danieli because of the great location in central Venice.  Indeed, the location is great and very convenient (vaporreto stop to anywhere in the city, including airport, right in front of hotel entrance) but the hotel is old and completely outdated compared to worldwide luxury standards.  The room was alright but rather small. The major drawback was the lack of light from the outside. Shutters are closed at all times as the view from the rooms windows is right on other rooms !   So if you expect to spend plenty of time in the room, do not stay here or you will feel deeply depressive... For us, as the weather was georgeous, we spend a minimum amount of time in the room.Read moreDate of stay: February 2008HelpfulShare
