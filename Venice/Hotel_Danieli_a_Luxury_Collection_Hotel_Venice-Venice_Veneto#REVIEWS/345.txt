Our family was welcomed at the Danieli from the moment we arrived.  It’s central location on the Grand Canal and proximity to water taxis and busses makes it the most convenient for traveling the city.  Once you walk in through the doors, you feel like you are brought back in time with the architecture and decor...breathtaking.  Staff was courteous and genuine at all times.  Don’t miss this part of Venice! Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
