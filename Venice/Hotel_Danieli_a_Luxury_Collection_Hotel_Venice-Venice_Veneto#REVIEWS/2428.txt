Never spent so much money to be treated with such disdain.  The staff was indifferent and not at all helpful.  Carried our own luggage right past the bell staff who were busy chatting it up with female acquaintances.  Were recommended a restaurant  but not favored by a reservation by the concierge.  We arrived to find no seating available.  Could not even get seating at the hotel dining room.  Will never return. Read moreDate of stay: October 2006HelpfulShare
