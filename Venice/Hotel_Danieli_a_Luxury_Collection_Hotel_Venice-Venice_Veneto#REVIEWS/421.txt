Just spent three wonderful days at the Danieli after 10 previous visits to Venice. I always wanted to stay at this beautiful hotel and it did not disappoint my expectations. The room was spacious with a super king sized bed. What was truly amazing was breakfast. The quality and choice unbelievable and a superb view of the lagoon. Can't wait to return. Best location I have stayed in for seeing the city.Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
