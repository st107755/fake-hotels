This hotel is a museum; stunning architecturally and of  tremedous historic value, but lacking the levels of comfort and luxury that its price tag implies.  We stayed there for a long weekend and were dissapointed with our room and bathroom wich seemed to have the same decoration it probably had in the 50s with all the wear and tear to go with it. It is unquestionable that the staff do their best to provide the best possible experience but the "hardware" simply isn't there.  If you are considering the Danieli then you are clearly willing to pay a high price for your stay so my suggestion is : Visit the Danieli for dinner to marvel and the public rooms - but stay at the Cipriani for real comfort and luxury.Read moreDate of stay: September 2009HelpfulShare
