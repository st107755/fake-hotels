A lovely old fashioned place to stay so close to St. Marks yet only a short stroll away from the quieter side streets.  A wonderful place to relax after a day wandering around Venice.   We stayed in the older part of the hotel - the rooms were a good size and the bathroom was acceptable although decoration was a little shabby. Staff were helpful and concierge recommended some very nice restaurants. Well worth booking dinner whilst you are there - the views from the rooftop restaurant are spectacular and the food is wonderful. Service very good, a little too fast would be my only criticism, but you are not rushed from your table. Breakfast was amazing.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 24, 2012Dear explorer077, I was pleased to learn that you enjoyed the perfect location of the Hotel in the Heart of Venice, indeed for travelling around Venice with ease and visiting most of its major attractions and sights.
