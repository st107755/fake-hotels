We started with a private gondola which pulls up to the front door. The rooms were spacious and clean. The Amex platinum upgrade helped. If you take money out of the picture. This place was awesome.

It's worth it.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 24, 2012Dear bobbylupo, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback on your experience here at The Hotel Danieli.
