My wife and I came for Carnival and had a beautiful room overlooking the lagoon. From the moment we arrived by "Private Transfer" to the end of our stay the entire staff had a friendly helpful professional greeting for us, we felt like family. During Carnival we rented costumes right inside the hotel and with a few modifications we added (Fantastic Masks by Ca' del Sol) we had a ball walking and entertaining all we encountered. What fun, what a great hotel and plan to return next year for sure and stay only at the Hotel Danieli!!!!!! Can't wait. We took a "Private Transfer" back to the airport and what a great experience no lines, no waiting we were escorted all the way to the security check point. Great job worth every penny, highly recommend this hotel.
