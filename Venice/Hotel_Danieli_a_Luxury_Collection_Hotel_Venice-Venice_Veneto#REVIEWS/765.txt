To stay a night at the Hotel Danieli is to stay a night in a museum. Be sure to wander the floors and take in the art on the walls as well as the furniture and lighting. The check in counter can get a little busy, but the rest of the hotel is quiet and old. The brunch on the terrace each morning can not be topped. Mimosas are available. The location is ideal as well. We enjoyed the complimentary Gino Mazzuccato water taxi from the Danieli to Murano for a demonstration and tour. We were treated very nicely and there was no pressure to make a purchase.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 9, 2016Dear Dave B, Thank you very much for posting your review following your recent stay with us at The Hotel Danieli.
