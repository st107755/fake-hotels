I just needed an escape, Venice was that...this hotel us that ... Seamless service and great front of house...  Harrys bar and Grand Canal for lunch..  I recalled my daughter raking her first steps between sofas in the lounge 21 yrs ago...she's been trouble ever since.  Its one of my favourite hotels, up there with Sandy Lane and George V....  Well done, loved my short stay.  Captain Medley Isle of Man  Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare
