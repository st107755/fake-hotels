Danieli is a hotel with 6 stars history (14th Cent. palace) 4-5 stars service (Starwood hotels standards) and 10 stars price. Rooms need urgent renovation (like Sacher in Salzburg for example) ie retaining old style but new beds, closets, windows etc.. Overall it's not worth the price as 80% of it goes to image and location.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 9, 2011Dear Nama j, We are truly sorry to hear that you were dissatisfied with your recent experience at the property and that the rooms you occupied failed to meet your expectations.Please rest assured we have been aware of the challenges presented by the property over the years and we have made good progress with an extensive  soft refurbishment since the beginning of the year.
