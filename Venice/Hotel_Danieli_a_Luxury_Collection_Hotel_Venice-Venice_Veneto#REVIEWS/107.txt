Most amazing hotel in the perfect location on San Marco. Roof top bar is a bonus. Rooms are lovely, beds are Marriott (say no more), restaurants are great too. A perfect place to enjoy Venice. They also have great links with tours to avoid rip-offsRead moreDate of stay: July 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
