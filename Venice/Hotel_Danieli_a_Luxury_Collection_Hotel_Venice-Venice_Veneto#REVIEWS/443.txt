Didnâ€™t stay at this hotel but found out about them through google recommendations. This is a five star hotel and they certainly met the mark. Lunch was absolutely beautiful. The food was mouthwatering and there was plenty of it. There was also an extensive wine selection and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. Lunch was towards the pricey end of the scale but considering this was a special occasion I think it was worth it. A big thumbs up from me. There is also a great view from the outside terrace which makes for some good photos.Read moreDate of stay: December 2017HelpfulShare
