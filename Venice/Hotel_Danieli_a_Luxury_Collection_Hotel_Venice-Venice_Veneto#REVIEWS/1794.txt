I was a bit hesitant about this place after reading all the reviews about the service but I am happy to report we did not encounter that at all. The service from checking in to the concierge and the restaurant were all wonderful.  To start, we were welcomed to an upgraded room and prosecco (due to my Starwood status). We also opted for the free breakfast as my amenity which is well worth it since it's 39 Euro per person otherwise. The view from the restaurant is amazing.  The concierge desk is very busy but they were helpful with our needs and requests. Overall a wonderful stay in a beautiful and enchanting city and hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 18, 2013Dear BigBlueOcean7, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and I certainly hope that your future travels to Venice will bring you back to the Hotel Danieli.
