We didn't stay here , but on reflection that might have been a good move. The location is just off St Marc's square on the waterfront, We did however visit the hotel and made ourselves very comfortable in the bar area where we sampled several of their cocktails and hospitality. The stunning interior is something to behold and the entire experience was wonderful. I would definitely visit here again as the staff were friendly and service excellent.
