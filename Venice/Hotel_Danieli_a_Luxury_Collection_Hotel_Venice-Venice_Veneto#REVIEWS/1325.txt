One night stay in June exceeded high hopes and expectations, lived up to its reputation as an old world gem. Renovated, elegant room in the main building, personally escorted to room after check-in. Numerous small delights, helpful and attentive concierge. Let us use gym and a private room for repacking bags after check-out.   Highlight of the stay was breakfast on the terrace, front table. with a view of the harbor.   Amazing. Will visit again.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 6, 2015Dear Captain_Starwood, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and I certainly hope that your future travels to Venice will bring you back to the Hotel Danieli.
