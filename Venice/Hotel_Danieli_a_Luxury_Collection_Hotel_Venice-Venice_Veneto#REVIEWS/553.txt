The staff are amazing. I had many interactions with the younger Concierge and he was very polite and informative. The lounge at the lobby was my favorite for my Gin and Tonics at night. The bar and restaurant up on the roof -oh my, incredible. My room was period orientated and perfect for one person. Why would you stay anywhere else...this place is just magical. Thank you team, perfection reached!Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare
