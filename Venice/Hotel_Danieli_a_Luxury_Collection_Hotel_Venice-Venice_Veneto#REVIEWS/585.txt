This place was exactly what we imagined Venice to be... and more. Amazing location, can walk to so many different stores and restaurants. View from our room was amazing (pictured), perfect sunsets. And the breakfast restaurant's views and food was perfect! The lobby bar could have a little better food menu, but it is a lobby bar... Very old and historic looking, just like it should be!Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 19, 2017Dear JayWo33, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback on your experience here at The Hotel Danieli.
