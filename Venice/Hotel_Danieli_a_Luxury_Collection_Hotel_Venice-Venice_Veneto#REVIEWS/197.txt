The Danieli is a legend - and that's its problem. Trading on faded - or lost - glory is Venice's trademark, and the Danieli's glory has long since gone the way of the Republic itself. Lost to history. Tiny rooms, enormous prices, indifferent service. Perhaps a century ago it was effortlessly classy and the haunt of the beau monde. Today its packed with misled tourists who bought the hype. Not even well located, right on the doorstep of the hordes on St Mark's Square and the Riva dei Sciavoni, places real self respecting Venetians avoid if they can. Snooty and inefficient service, a constant feeling that you're being ripped off and the real luxury life of the city is elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: February 20194 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 4, 2019Dear owen m, Thank you for your sharing your detailed feedback of your stay.
