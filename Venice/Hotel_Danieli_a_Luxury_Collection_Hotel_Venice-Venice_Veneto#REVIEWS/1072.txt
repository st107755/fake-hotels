Absolutely fantastic, would return here every time, this is the best hotel i've ever stayed in, due to the friendliest staff, lovely rooms which they upgraded us when we arrived, the biggest bed i've ever slept in, balcony, sent us champagne & cake, also red wine & canap√©s. The view from the dinning room is breathtaking,& the best full breakfast experience.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 23, 2016Dear pratley62, Thank you so much for having chosen the Hotel Danieli whilst recently in Venice and for having taken the time to share your positive feedback on Tripadvisor.
