The Hotel Danieli is one of the most beautiful and opulent hotels we have ever stayed in.  You feel like royalty; the atmosphere is exquisite.  The location is also primo.  Walking distance to everything.  Be sure to get the Gondola ride with music....the most romantic way to start your evening.  You pay the price at the Danieli.  Beauty and perfection costs, but it was worth it for this gorgeous hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
