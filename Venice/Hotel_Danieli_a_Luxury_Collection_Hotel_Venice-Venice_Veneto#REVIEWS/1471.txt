Absolutely beautiful property.  Wonderful staff.  Location on the Grand Canal and adjacent to Piazza San Marco makes Danieli THE hotel to stay at in Venice.  The experience is enhanced with their own private water taxi entrance right into the lobby.  4 staff members met us and took care of our every need.  We were upgraded to an Executive Suite with balcony and stunning views.  The perfect place to unwind.  Walk out the front door and a Vaporetto stop is right there, water taxi stand 30 meters away and numerous gondolas available.  The fun shopping and nightlife is just around the corner.Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 9, 2014Dear AntonCh-aD, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay and had the time to experience some of the exciting sights and places in the vicinity, appreciating the ideal location of the Hotel and the room upgrade.I was also pleased to learn that you liked the service and attitude of the staff.
