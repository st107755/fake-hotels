Stayed in another hotel but visited the rooftop terrace bar for a few drinks and enjoyed the view. Stunning hotel, amazing views and made some great memories on the terrace. Yes, it's pricey but such a great story we can now tell and pleased to have enjoyed a few hours on the famous hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
