Very nicely situated in Romantic Venice, but woefully over-priced and over-rated.  Were here four days. Stuck in elevator once; took 15-20 minutes before help arrived.  Our room had a fine view of the shutters in the building next door.  Enough said.  Spend your hotel dollars this way if you must, but you can find better value elsewhere.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 16, 2015Dear MeSDG , Thanks for your post.
