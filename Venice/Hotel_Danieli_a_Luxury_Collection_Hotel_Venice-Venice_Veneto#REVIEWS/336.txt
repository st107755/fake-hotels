We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. We had the most amazing gentleman at check in. He gave us the choice of multiple rooms and showed us each. He also showed us the room that was used in the movie The Tourist. The hotel itself is something to behold. So lovely with so much history. The rooms are definitely dated with chips in furniture etc. do not expect a perfect room but it is worth staying there for the experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
