In 1980 spent our honeymoon around the corner at the Hotel Commercio e Pellegrino; quaint and friendly but very budget-minded. We watched people go in and out of the Danieli and joked about getting a room. So this was an important stay for us. And it lived up to our hopes. In every possible way one is treated with the highest respect and patience. There was a problem with my getting the type of bed I requested, so I was upgraded to a lagoon-view room. Opening the windows let in all the sounds and smells of the waterfront. A short but fabulous and memorable stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 27, 2015Dear Mark I, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback on your experience here at The Hotel Danieli.
