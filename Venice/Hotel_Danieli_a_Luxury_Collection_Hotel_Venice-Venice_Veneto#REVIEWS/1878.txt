Beautiful hotel set in the heart of Venice. We got a canal front room and we were in heaven. The hotel is old but beautifully kept and is a true piece of art.

It is expensive but one amazing experience.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 11, 2013Dear ZeBray, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli.
