I first fell in love with the Daniel Hotel when watching the movie "The Tourist".  When we planned our Venice, Italy trip last year - we knew it would be magical and complete with a few nights spent in the Daniel Hotel.  From the moment we arrived we received red carpet treatment.  The room was spectacular with a beautiful view.  The restaurant view was fabulous along with the food.  Octopus, seafood risotto, and so much more.  Breakfast was fabulous too. Concierge wonderful, all employees friendly.  We had a few things we needed to ship back to America and they found us boxes and took care of making sure they got to us upon arriving home.  WONDERFUL WONDERFUL.  Surpassed our most beautiful dreams.Read moreDate of stay: March 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 20, 2017Dear Tammy C, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
