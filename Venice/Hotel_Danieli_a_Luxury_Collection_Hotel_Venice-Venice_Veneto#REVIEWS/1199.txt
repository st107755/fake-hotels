I heard so many wonderful things about the Danieli, I believe I may have had my hopes up a bit. The lobby is quite beautiful, and quaint. It seemed to be always full with guests at each desk, having to wait sometimes longer then you would like. Service was just ok. We thought it should have been better. Location was great, close to the square. Room size was great, with two large closets. Shower was a little small. Especially loved the towel warmer, and bathrobes. We enjoyed music late night in lobby bar.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 8, 2015Dear Jfurlyn, Many thanks for recently staying with us whilst visiting Venice and also for having taken the time to provide us with your feedback via Tripadvisor.
