We stayed at the Hotel Danieli and loved the location because of its closeness to Piazza San Marco and all the top restaurants and attractions.  The staff was very helpful and friendly as well and we couldn't ask for a better location.  We had also stayed at Gritti Palace 4 years prior and both hotels went above and beyond our expectations, but Hotel Danieli wins out due to its location.  Our rooms were nicely laid out and the breakfast buffet was top notch.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
