Venice has many fine hotels but of them all the Hotel Danielli is the Classic Best Hotel & it occupies undoubtedly the best Location in Venice - facing the Lagoon / Grand Canal junction & only a few steps from San Marco & the Dogeâ€™s Palace. Classic elegance. Like the Gritti but with a better location & views. Professional staff which was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. All the details are covered. Lagoon view rooms are amazing & this is the real Classical Venice. Enjoy!Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
