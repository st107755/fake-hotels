This luxury establishment of the Hotel Danieli takes the guest back in time when service and beauty were paramount. The elegant lobby is truly breathtaking, and the rooms are decorated in an old world style with modern touches. We stayed three nights pre-cruise and one night post-cruise in two different room styles so we really were able to experience the gorgeous ambiance. The hotel also kindly allowed us to check in to our rooms hours early both times so we were able to relax and enjoy the city.
