Liked this hotel for the most part.  TERRIFIC location in the heart of everything, great lobby, nice room, large closet, helpful staff.  However, I did not know before I booked here that the hotel is actually two separate buildings.  The "pink building" is apparently the original and has been renovated.   Our room was in the "white building" next door which is connected by a ramp on the second floor.  I knew the hotel was old and was looking forward to the "old world feel" of it, however for the room price ($1394/night), a 35 year old bathroom isn't quite acceptable.  While I would still recommend the Danieli because of its other pluses, DEFINITELY request a room in the renovated building!!   Enjoy Venice - it's wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: June 20081 SaveHelpfulShare
