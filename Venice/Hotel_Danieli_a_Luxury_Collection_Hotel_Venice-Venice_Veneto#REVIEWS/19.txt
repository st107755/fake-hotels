My wife and I had been to Venice once before. I was not crazy about the city after my first visit as we had been there in July when it was hot humid and crowded. This time we went in October before the Alta Acqua. We also stayed at the Danieli, which we had not done the first time. I found the experience much better, in large part due to the hotel. It is beautiful, with great food and service. I recommend it highly.Read moreDate of stay: October 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
