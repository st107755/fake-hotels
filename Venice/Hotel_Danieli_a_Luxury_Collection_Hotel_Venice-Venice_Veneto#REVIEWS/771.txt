Our last morning in Venice found us strolling through San Marco square around 7.30am. We wanted to experience the coming to life for the day before all of the tourist crowds descended upon this wondrous city. Staying at Hotel Danieli was beyond our budget, however we decided to have breakfast at the rooftop restaurant there where the views over the Grand Canal were second to none. â‚¬52 per person may seem extravagant however the variety of food, the excellent service and last but not least the views on that perfect morning with beautiful blue skies and a slight cool breeze were magnificent. I will never forget that very special breakfast on the last morning of our epic holiday. One day I hope to stay at this beautiful hotel too.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 29, 2016Dear Mary J, All of us here hope that your journey back to home was a pleasant one and that it will not be long before you are back with us for another visit.
