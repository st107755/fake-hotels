The Danieli lives up to its reputation as a 5 star hotel.   It sits on the Grand Canal.  The atmosphere is superb.  Our room was beyond perfect.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The food is first rate.  However, the staff really elevates the Danieli to something BEYOND 5 star.  We visited in December and our travels were hampered by thick fog.  This was a family trip.  My arrival was seriously delayed.  However, my 2 college aged sons arrived on time (almost a full day before I did).  We had arranged transportation through the hotel.  The driver was there to pick up my sons and guide them through customs and immigration.  He delivered them safely to the hotel.  The Danieli's staff was aware that my flight was delayed....they made sure that my sons were checked in and well takenâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 4, 2017Dear Kristi J, Thank you for giving us the opportunity to take care of you on your recent visit to The Hotel Danieli.
