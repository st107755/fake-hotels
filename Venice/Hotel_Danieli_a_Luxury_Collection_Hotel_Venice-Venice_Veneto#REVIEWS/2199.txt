After staying at the delightful Goring Hotel in London I arrived in Venice. I had asked for full service from the airport to the Hotel.  No one was there and the Hotel desk at the airport told me I did not have a reservation with them. They told me my only option was to book a water taxi myself and pay cash.  After walking 10 minutes with my luggage I arrived at the water taxi area. The driver informed me that I had far too much luggage for one person.  That was none of his business. I finally arrived at the  hotel two and  and a half half hours after landing.  To say that the staff was arrogant and disorganized was an understatement .  I was told to wait 15 minutes and my $1200 US /night room would be ready.  I sat in the lobby while waiting and enjoyed my $12.00 cup of tea. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare
