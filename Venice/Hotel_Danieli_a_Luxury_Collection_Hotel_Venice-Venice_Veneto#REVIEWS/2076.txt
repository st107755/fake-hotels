Just home from 3 wonderful nights here- the hotel is beautiful , so full of character in the old wing . The view from the 5th floor terrace , where breakfast is served , is captivating , and the choice of fresh fruits, cheeses, breads , cooked eggs etc etc , was enjoyed . Sadly the bar charges were horrendous, so We were not tempted to hang about in the impressive surroundings ! The situation of the hotel , so close to St Marks square is terrific - and so handy to the vaparetto in and out to the airport . There are lots of lovely looking hotels in Venice - but it is so hard to find your way around the little back streets , I don't know how a new arrival would find them ! Definitely get a phone number and someone to meet you!  The danieli is a perfect place for a romantic break !…Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 8, 2012Dear sessiagh, Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post your review of our Hotel danieli.
