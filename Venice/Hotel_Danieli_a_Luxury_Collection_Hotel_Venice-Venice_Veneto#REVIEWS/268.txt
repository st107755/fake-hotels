First time in Venice and I wanted my wife and I to stay in an authentic, luxurious Venetian Palace.  This hotel was it.  Our room was in the Palazzo Danieli Excelsior portion of the hotel and was complete with a balcony room facing the Grand Canal.  It was everything we dreamed a hotel in Venice would be.  Just a short walk to the Piazza San Marco where St. Mark's Cathedral and the Doce Palace is located.  By all means, have dinner at sunset on the rooftop restaurant called Terrazza Danieli.  What a way to experience Venice as the sun sets over the outer islands.  Spectacular views and great food.Read moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
