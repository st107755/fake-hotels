Once upon the time....when you enter the Danieli, you will have a feeling of a "Fairly Tale" and you are a little princess.  Your breath will be taken away by its beauty. The most gergeous Hotel Lobby I have ever seen.   I remembered to see it first time on the Film "The Tourist" with Angelina Jolie and Johny Depp... Then I google...and here we go...  I did not sleep there, but still very impress.  My husband and I went there for a dinner on the Roof Terrace Restaurant...as it was our Wedding Anniversary.   The food was very good, but not cheap...quite expensive you may say.   The location of the hotel is perfect.  I will be in Venice again next week during "Venice Carneval"... I am falling in love with Venice :-)Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 11, 2013Dear MultiCultiTante, Thank you for your visit to Hotel Danieli and for sharing your positive experience at our Terrazza Ristorante.
