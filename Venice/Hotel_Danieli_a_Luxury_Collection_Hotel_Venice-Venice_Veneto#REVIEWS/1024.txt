My wife and I stayed for three nights to celebrate our Ruby Wedding anniversary and the Danielli did not disappoint. Our room was a fabulous 4 room suite and was just superb. Staff and service were very professional and efficient, however we felt that in all departments they could have been more friendly towards the guests, we had just come from the Ritz in London where the staff were much friendlier and customer focused. That aside the building is just magnificent and the views from the rooftop bar are to die for. Location is fantastic just next door to the Doges Palace and St Marks Square.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 28, 2016Dear David W, We are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay at the Hotel Danieli and that you appreciated  the suite assigned and  the location of the building.
