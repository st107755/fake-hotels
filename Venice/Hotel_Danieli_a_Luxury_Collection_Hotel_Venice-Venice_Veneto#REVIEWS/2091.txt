My fiance and I had a short break to Venice and stayed at this hotel. We were impressed with the friendliness, knowledge and helpfulness of the staff. The location of the hotel was great and the recommended restaurant from the desk manager was excellent. Breakfast was nothing special though the croissants they served were fresh and tasty.We would stay there againRead moreDate of stay: November 2011HelpfulShare
