We’ve been to Venice before, but always wanted to come back and stay, this time, at the Danielli. If your going to stay here, you may as well do it in style and arrive from the airport by water taxi. The main lobby and bar area is just stunning as are, of course, the must try bellinis. Location next to San Marcos is just perfect. The only reason we haven’t given it five stars is the rooms (well, at least our room), aren’t blow-you-away. They are dated, in a nice way, but a little cramped (although we knew to expect this). The bedding, however, is heaven. Perhaps next time we’d opt for a bigger room...at least that gives us a reason to return to this wonderful city! Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
