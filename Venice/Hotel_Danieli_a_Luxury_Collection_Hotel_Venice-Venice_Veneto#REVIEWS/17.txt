Arriving after a terrible luggage mishap resulting in a missed train, the Danieli welcomed us warmly.  The main building, Dandolo, is a charming old lady with beautiful rooms.  We were put in room 8, which has the windows on either side of the front door on the second floor.  We thought it was going to be loud, but it really wasn't.  The windows open, there is a separate dressing room in addition to the sitting area, bed area, bathroom (which was all marble prettiness but up a step - so be aware!)  We were able to watch the fireworks from the windows - awesome! As we were going to be there for New Year's and figuring that restaurant reservations would be a must, we attempted to contact the concierge early.  Early communications were difficult but we persevered.  Recommendationsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 20193 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
