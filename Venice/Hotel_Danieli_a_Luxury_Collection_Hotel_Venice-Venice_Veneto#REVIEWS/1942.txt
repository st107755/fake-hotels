This hotel is very close to St. Mark's so perfect for wandering around Venice. Also the vaporetto stop is just opposite. Our room was in the old part and very comfortable  backing onto a canal where we could watch the gondoliers slowly taking their customers on tour. We had a delicious breakfast every morning on the terrace which offers stunning views of Venice  across to the island of San Giorgio. Never went for dinner but the lights of Venice would be fantastic! Service was satisfactory and the linen immaculate. Staff were friendly so our stay was an enjoyable one.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear lafamosaItaly, Thank you for choosing to stay and the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your favourable review on trip advisor.
