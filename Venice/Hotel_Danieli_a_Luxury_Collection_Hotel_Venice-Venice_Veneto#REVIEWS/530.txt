save your pennies for a trip to this exotic hotel. yes, its been there for hundreds of years but don't sweat that ...its elegant, great wifi and rooms that will make you fee like true royalty. plus, no parking..just a gondola can pull up or do the boring thing and walk in. it's just a blink away from st marks - y'know that big church thingee. bottom line: when tourists are walking in taking photos of the main room you know you are in a special place. and finally, don't miss the awesome historical painting of VENICE in the main room. its big and should be i a museum..but oh yeah..this place is a museum.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 8, 2017Dear Tom S, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your feedback on TripAdvisor we do hope that you will continue to return to our Hotel Danieli in the future.
