This elegant hotel is located directly on the Grand Canal and next to St. Mark's Square - the location doesn't get any better than that in Venice.   Our room was in the main section of the hotel and was spacious and well appointed with every thing you would expect in a 5 star hotel.  The king size bed was very comfortable with nice linens and soft pillows.  And we started every morning with breakfast in the roof top garden restaurant with fantastic views of the canal and excellent food. This historic hotel is actually 3 connected buildings.  The lobby features a dramatic  two-story staircase and gorgeous Murano glass chandeliers in the lounge. Despite being an old city, Venice is magical and our stay at this hotel was wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
