Arrive by river taxi outside the hotel- stunning entrance with murano glass chandeliers all around and views of the upper floors. Decor is decadent looking and walls are fabric finished. The hotel is made up of three interconnected buildings off different ages. The roof top terrace for breakfast and dinner has spectacular views across the coast line. If you have the option to have breakfast included, it is well worth it- it literally has everything and champagne is included.  Only downside was check in as it was somewhat chaotic with a lot of people and not enough staff but the delay was not significant.
