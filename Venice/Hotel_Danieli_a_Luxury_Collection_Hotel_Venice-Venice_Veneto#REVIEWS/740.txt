What can I say about the Danieli? Simply, its amazing. We got engaged here and I couldn't fault a thing. All the staff were so kind and friendly and really made our stay very special. Our room overlooked the lagoon and standing on the balcony watching the sunset and the boats was simply magical. I'll never forget the weekend we had here.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 1, 2017Dear FL8937, Thank you ever so much for taking the time to post on your review of your recent stay with us here in Venice.
