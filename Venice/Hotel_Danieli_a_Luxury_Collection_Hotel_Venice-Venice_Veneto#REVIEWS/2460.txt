We stayed at the Danieli in August during a ten-day trip to Italy with our three children (11, 16, 19) and found the hotel to be over-priced and the staff indifferent at best.  The accommodations were spacious, but the furnishings were old and the beds were not comfortable.  We had just stayed at the Westin in Florence, which was fabulous - and we expected to get the "heavenly beds" at the Danieli, since they are part of the same chain.  Big disappointment!  As an aside, our kids thought the hotel's lobby and staircases looked like a cross between Disney World's Tower of Terror and the Haunted Mansion. Read moreDate of stay: August 2005HelpfulShare
