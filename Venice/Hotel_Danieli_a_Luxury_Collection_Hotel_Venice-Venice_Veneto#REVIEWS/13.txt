I visited the Hotel Danieli with my daughter to have a meal on the terrace ... the views from here across the lagoon are so beautiful ... we asked recommendations for wine  and food ... the meal was superb ...cannot fault the quality and the attention given to us by Salvatore was fantastic .. nothing was too much trouble ....he looked after us from arrival to leaving .. making sure that we had the best experience of the restaurant !!! We will definitely returnRead moreDate of stay: September 2019HelpfulShare
