The Hotel Danieli is a remarkable Luxury Collection property located just steps away from St Marks Square and is situated right on the waterfront with incredible views.  The Danieli has a rooftop restaurant where I luxuriated in incredible views for the days I was there having breakfast while soaking in the 180 degree views of Venice!  Some of my best pictures were taken from the rooftop restaurant!   As a platinum member I was so fortunate to have been upgraded to a suite with a stunning marble bathroom that was enormous!  The room was absolutely lovely and the bed was so comfortable - I slept very well at the Danieli!   Overall the Danieli is a beautiful and the location makes it quite a gem in the beautiful city of Venice!  Highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Responded Jun 28, 2012Dear Travelgirl22310, On behalf of the Management team at The Hotel Danieli, we would like to thank you for completing your review on TripAdvisor.We are glad that aspects of your stay such as breakfast, service delivery and location were all to your liking.
