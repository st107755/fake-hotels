Perfect location, walking distance from the port and st Marc square. The hotel is very clean but our room was absolutely tiny. The service was great but very slow to check in. The rooms do not have basic facilities you would expect in any "luxury" hotel. No iron and ironing board, no coffee or tea etc.  it's a great hotel but I don't understand how it is categorized as luxury?Read moreDate of stay: June 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 1, 2017Dear sghat, Thank you for your review.

Looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back soon, we remain Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
