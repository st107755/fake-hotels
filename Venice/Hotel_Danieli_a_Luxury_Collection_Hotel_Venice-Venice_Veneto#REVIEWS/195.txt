Beautiful hotel with the best view of the city at their terraced restaurant to watch sunset.  The location is also very center. The hotel is on the higher price but given that it s in san marco and a luxury hotel with so many beautiful view and decoration, it is so worth it.  I will definitely stay here again if my wallet allows it next time!Read moreDate of stay: March 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
