What a wonderful place to stay in Venice.  Central and iconic.  During our stay the main grand lobby area had some renovation works underway, I would assume the lovely reception would feel even more grand.  That said as it was we would stay again.  The place leaks history and feels very grand.  We are glad we stayed here.

We did not eat here, so cannot comment, the piano bar in the main area had ambience and was a nice place to endâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 20, 2017Dear KentMadmum, Thank you so much for taking the time to post your constructive feedback on the site following your stay with us which is greatly appreciated.
