If you are looking to impress first thing in the morning or last thing at night this is your place. The breakfast room Is al fresco and you overlook the lagoon ( gondolas and various boats) itâ€™s a restaurant at night so you get the same with pretty lights. Our suite Danola was perfect with canal view. Location is fantastic, 15/40min walk to Realto Bridge ( romantic pizzas/wine) depending on how many kisses and hugs you have on the way.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 22, 2017Dear Twoveggies, Thank you ever so much for taking the time to post on your review of your recent stay with us here in Venice.
