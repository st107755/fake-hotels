What a great hotel. They really go over the top with the service. Wife an I took a nice Gondola ride and asked the bar tender if he could get me a bottle of wine. Two minutes later he shows up with a bottle of wine, in ice, with cups and a jar of nice nuts to enjoy our ride. Now that's class. one building is over 600 years old with the second one called the "new building" since it was built 300 years ago. The hotel will also arrange for a nice trip to Murano to see the glass blowing factories.Read moreDate of stay: July 2009HelpfulShare
