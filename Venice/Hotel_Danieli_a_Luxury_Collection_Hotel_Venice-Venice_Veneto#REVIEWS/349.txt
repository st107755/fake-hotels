Great view from room with a balcony. Quite an expensive treat but worth it if you want to impress. We spend a lot of time watching the boats passing by/gondoliers/tourists and reading.  The concierge was good and quite helpful (water taxi service was amazing waiting for us before the passport gate. The breakfast terrasse is great but the service is very average and the food is decent but not 5 stars at all. Overall location is good, close to san marco and opposite valporetto stop. You can just escape quickly the crowd.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
