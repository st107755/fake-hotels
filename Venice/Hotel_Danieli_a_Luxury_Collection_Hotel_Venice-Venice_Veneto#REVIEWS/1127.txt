Had a wonderful time at the Hotel Danieli, a perfect setting for a long-weekend break. The private water-taxi was extremely useful, and the concierge service was brilliant. Particularly appreciated advance bookings for the Gallerie dell'Accademia and a number of concerts. They also recommended one or two restaurants in the city, which were uniformly excellent. The hotel itself is very grand, but the staff were refreshingly friendly and informal. We were a little worried that we might receive some rather off-hand service as we'd only booked a (relatively!) inexpensive room, but the staff were very obliging and helpful (and bravely tolerated our terrible attempts at Italian!). Very happy, and would definitely recommend.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 15, 2015Dear Farradane, We appreciate you for taking the time to post your positive comments and we look forward to have again the pleasure of your visit in the very near future.
