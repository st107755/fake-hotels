I had a lovely stay at the hotel but not sure if it was worth the EUR600.00 per night price tag!  It is in a great location right on the Grand Canal and only 5 mins walk from St Marks Square.  We were luckily enough to be upgraded to a Canal View room which was located on the top floor with the most amazing views of the Grand Canal.  The room however was very small and the bathroom even smaller.  The roof top terrace has lovely views over the Grand Canal and you can enjoy drinks here in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning.  Prepare for the waiters to be a bit slow  which should not be expected from a 5 star hotel.  The inside of the hotel is stunning which is why I imagine the hotel has such a good reputation.  And I'm sure the suites and higher priced rooms are amazingâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2007HelpfulShare
