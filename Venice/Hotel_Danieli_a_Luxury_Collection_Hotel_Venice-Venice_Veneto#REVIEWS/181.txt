My stay was during a business trip and corporate event. Location - a 3 minutes walk from San MArco square is great. Hotel delivers outstanding service level, interior is jaw-dropping and full of historical heritage. View from roof restaurant is amazing. I wish to stay there once again.Read moreDate of stay: May 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
