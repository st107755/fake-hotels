We had high expectations for the Danieli for the last 2 nights of a trip to Italy and they were well met.  Other than a bit of delay at check-in the service was superb (and the man who checked us in remembered us by name 2 days later when we checked out which is always nice).  Thanks to our travel agent we were upgraded to a corner canal view room which was stunning.  Breakfast at the Terrazza with the view of ships coming and going was relaxing and elegant.  The Danieli is considered a luxury hotel and the prices match that but value for money was excellent and we would absolutely stay there again.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 30, 2015Dear JandVVancouver_BC, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your favorable review on trip advisor.
