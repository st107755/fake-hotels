Hotel Danieli is a level 7 (of 7) SPG hotel.  It's location is fantastic and the property is truly historic, dating back at least 600 years.  The view from the terrace at breakfast is absolutely stunning. I will definitely be back again.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 11, 2017Dear Guest, Thank you for your fabulous review!
