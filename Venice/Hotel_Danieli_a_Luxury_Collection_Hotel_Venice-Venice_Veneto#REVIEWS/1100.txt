The lobby area sets the scene after be dropped off at the Lagoon jetty from the launch outside. It is an historical gem, marble everywhere and beautiful wood panelling. It is important they do not out you in the new section of the hotel the additional expense of an upgrade to the old traditional part and rooms is well worth the expense. The service and staff are good by Italian standards but remember Venice is a tourist trap and things can take a while. The traditional rooms are very authentic dating back hundreds of years and that is the attraction. We would stay again and recommend to friends.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 9, 2016Dear Mark O, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your feedback on TripAdvisor.
