We had a great experience at the Danielli. I found the lobby to be beautiful, the rooms were large and the bathrooms some of the nicest in all of Italy. The lobby bar was our favorite after dinner hangout. The breakfast Terrace alone was worth our room rate at this hotel. The views are incredible. There were only two negatives about the hotel for us...the service was a bit stuffy. The staff was extremely attentive, but a bit arrogant. Also, we had bedbugs. We woke up to welts on our legs and actually saw with our own eyes a bedbug on our nightstand.   Overall, we adored Venice and had a wonderful time at the Danielli.
