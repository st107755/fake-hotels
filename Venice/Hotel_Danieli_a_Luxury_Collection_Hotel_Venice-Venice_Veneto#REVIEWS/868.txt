We stayed for one night at the Danieli and I would recommend it for all Venice travelers.  Quiet, comfortable, homey and a solid part of Venetian history.  Concierge and hotel staff are always aware and ready to help you. All speak fluent English.  The hotel has a coffee shop in the lobby and a wonderful terrace restaurant on the top floor (which is also the breakfast area). If you would like to dine on the terrace, you have to book a month in advance as it is listed as a top restaurant in Venice.  Rooms are spacious and quiet. Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel if you are a guest. Some of the rooms have been recently refurbished.  While expensive, it is worth the experience.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 7, 2016Dear Mark A, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
