Awesome location, great staff!  Beautiful property.  When we pulled up in our private water taxi to the special side entrance I knew it was special.  The hotel is over 800 years old and was once a private residence!  The lobby is beautiful and they had it decorated for Christmas!  Our room with the private balcony overlooking the grand canal was the best!  This is really a special place that is in a great location.  Right next door to the Doge Palace.Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
