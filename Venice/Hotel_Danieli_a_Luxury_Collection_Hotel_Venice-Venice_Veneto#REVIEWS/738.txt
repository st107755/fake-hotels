My wife and I recently returned from a one week stay at Danieli.  We booked a Dandolo Suite and were upgraded to what they called a "partial view suite". The suite had a 30 foot terrace overlooking a side canal and the main lagoon and had exceptional views. Pulling up to the hotel in a water taxi is a great experience and the service provided by all was wonderful.  The hotel generously recognized that we were celebrating my wife's birthday and really went above any beyond with their gestures.  The public spaces, lobby and bar all added to the great experience. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone interested in spending some time in Venice and I hope to return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 1, 2017Dear jeff w, Thank you for choosing the Hotel Danieli whilst visiting Venice.
