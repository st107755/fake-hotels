I have wanted to visit the Danieli for years and on a recent trip to venice we went for morning coffee. It totally lived up to my expectations. The staff were courteous and welcoming and friendly. We had coffees orange juice and my daughter had a cocktail which she said was the best she had ever had.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and although the staff were attentive they didn't rush us. We sat and chatted in the lounge and had a wonderful morning. I would love to go back.Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 10, 2015Dear Sallykl, Thank you for taking the time to post a review about your recent F&B experience with us.
