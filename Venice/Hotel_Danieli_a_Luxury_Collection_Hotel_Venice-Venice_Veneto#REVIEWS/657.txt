Pros:    - lobby bar has a great atmosphere for late night drinks and music   - great location 2 minute walk from St. Marks Square   - great check in service.  I want to specifically point out the stellar service by a ms. Graziani who went above and beyond in making you feel welcome and tailoring our service.  Cons:   - the restaurant at the hotel was good quality but overly priced.   - free boat service to Murano was nice but it would have been courteous to be warned about being greeted by a glass factory representative and forced into a 30 minute sales meeting.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 2, 2017Dear HotayMa, We would like to thank you for your valuable, constructive and detailed report.
