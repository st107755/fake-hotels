We loved our stay at this property. So much history and very interesting decor. Great location to walk or catch a boat to everything you need. The check in staff and front desk were very friendly and helpful. The highlight was out room, I think there are a variety of rooms and have different decor, our was lively. I felt like I was staying in a palace and only my pictures can really show how beautiful it was. Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
