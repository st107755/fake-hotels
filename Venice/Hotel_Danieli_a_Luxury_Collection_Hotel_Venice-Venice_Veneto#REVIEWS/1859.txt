In the moment you are entering the hotel is taking your breath away- the hall is extremely beautiful, luxurious and magnificent! But you are living not there(unfortunatelly), but in a room with an old( old not antique)  furniture and the atmosphere of .. a bad-groomed place. I can understand that you are paying A LOT also for a central location, history and importance of a hotel itself, but at the end a hotel is a place where you are sleeping and taking shower and in Danieli you are not doing it on a 5star level. I would rather reccomened comming to Danieli for a drink in the bar than accommodating here.
