The first time I stayed at Danilie was some 25 years ago, afterwards I visited Venice a couple of time and stayed at different hotels. Well I visited Venice with my wife for two nights on the first days of October, and since this one was a very special trip. I decided to go all the way and reserved a Suite with "THE VIEW" at this magnificent hotel. I can report that my decision was highly rewarded. Believe from the moment you first step in to the moment you have to leave. You will experience luxury and quality all the way, if you are looking for something special your search has come to an end.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 24, 2011Dear JorTC, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
