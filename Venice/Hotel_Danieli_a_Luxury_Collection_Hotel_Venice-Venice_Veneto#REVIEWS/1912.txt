We welcome every feedback, both positive and negative, as this is the best way to evaluate and so to improve the level of our product and service. We share your disappointment for the reported inadequate room attendance.

Please rest assured that your comments will not go unheard. An immediate follow up at an operational level has been arranged in order to ensure an accurate cleaning program for each guest room at all times. Once again, thank you for your constructive criticism; in spite of this average experience, we all hope that you will allow us another opportunity to display the type of hospitality you expect and deserve in the future.
