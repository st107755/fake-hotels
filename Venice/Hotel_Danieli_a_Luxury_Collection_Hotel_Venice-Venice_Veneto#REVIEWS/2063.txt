Stayed here for a night during the carnival - it's really very special. The location is perfect, the vaporetto stops outside, the building itself ornate and magical. Lovely room, didn't have breakfast, but attended the Venezia Romantica Ball, which is held here anually. Have been previously, also to the Minuet Dinner Dances - all fabulous. Bar is expensive but great for people watching.   Those who've noted that the bar shuts 'early' at 1.30 don't know much about Venice - public transport is very thin on the ground after midnight (and believe it or not, bar staff have to sleep) and Venetians in general go to bed early - many bars close at 11. So my suggestion would be to the couple who were miffed about not getting a drink at 1.15 would be - go to Vegas.Read moreDate of stay: February 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 10, 2012Dear quiettraveller045 , Thank you for your review for your stay during Carnival.
