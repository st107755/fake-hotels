We celebrated our silver wedding anniversary at the Danieli. Spending four blissful days in the beautiful city of Venice. The hotel is sumptuous with every attention to detail. The staff in all areas of the hotel were courteous and welcoming. Breakfast on the 5th floor terrace was the perfect way to start the day. The views were spectacular across the lagoon and towards St Mark's Square. We enjoyed a delicious evening meal on the Terrace followed by cocktails in the Dandolo bar.  A truly memorable stay. Thank you.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear Tracy J, Thank you so much for having chosen the Hotel Danieli whilst recently in Venice to celebrate such a special anniversary and for having taken the time to share your feedback on Tripadvisor.
