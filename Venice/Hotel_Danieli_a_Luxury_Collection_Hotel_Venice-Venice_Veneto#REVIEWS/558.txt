This hotel is amazing. Location wise, right on the water, close to gondola stations and water bus stations, and water taxis. We're 2 minutes from St Mark's Square. Literally tons of shops and restaurants surrounding the place. The hotel staff are super friendly, the concierge is very helpful. The rooftop restaurant is beautiful, especially for breakfast. The rooms are very clean. I highly recommend choosing this hotel and would return again.Read moreDate of stay: August 20171 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
