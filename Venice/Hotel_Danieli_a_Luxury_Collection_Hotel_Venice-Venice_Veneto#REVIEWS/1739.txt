The hotel has a unique atmosphere, full of luxury, history and a great service. The room was very nice with great room amenities. I stayed at the hotel in November the weather was not very good and it was so nice to have a warm towel after I took a shower, those kind of details made my stay so comfortable and memorable.    Locations is great just few steps to the San Marcos Square and Cathedral, Ducale Palace,etc.   This is a great option for a Romantic tripRead moreDate of stay: November 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 11, 2013Dear Lety_11, Following your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli, I wanted to take a minute and extend an electronic thank you for taking the time and effort to fill out our online survey.Feedback from our most valuable guests, such as yourself, is indeed vital for our future development.
