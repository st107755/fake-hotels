Always have wanted to go to Venice and it lived up to my expectations 200%. A beautiful city and the carnival was magical. Stayed at Hotel Danieli just a short walk away from St Marks Square, so a fabulous location. The hotel is beautiful, breakfast and dinner in the upstairs restaurant fantastic. The view was breathtaking. The only downside is that (as usual) for a high class hotel is that you end up paying a high price for drinks! Also be careful what bottle you order at the hotel bar in the main reception area, as you are likely to end up with one you didn't order and paying more, which was disappointing service by the bar waiters..Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 19, 2013Dear Valmai E, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli. we have read with great interest your evaluation and we welcome both your encouraging comments as well as the less appreciative ones as they represent a vital instrument in our daily commitment to create memorable experiences for our Guests.
