I loved this hotel so much! May be the best I have ever stayed in. Full of character, and history! From the time you arrive at the water door you know you are somewhere special! The lobby is breathtaking and just walking around the hotel was magical. It's in a great location for exploring Venice and just listening to life below my room made my stay there so special. Great breakfast and food was amazing! Palo? the bartender was full of great local information and I can't say enough about the staff and hotel itself. Simply stunning hotel!Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
