My husband took me to Venice for a birthday treat.  Staying at the Danieli made this an unforgettable experience. It's a truly lovely place with superb and friendly service in a perfect location . We stayed in the old part of the hotel in great comfort and enjoyed the feeling of being in a palace. The staff could not have been more helpful - nothing was too much trouble and we benefitted fro their local knowledge as well as enjoying the welcome we got whenever we returned from our explorations of the city. The food in the Terazza restaurant was amazingly good and the view from there in a sunny day was just stunning. One of the best hotels we have every stayed in!Read moreDate of stay: November 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 25, 2015Dear lilywall, Thank you for posting your feedback and for choosing to stay with us.
