My wife and I went to the Biennale for 3 days and had a wonderful time at the Danieli! The cost is not for the faint hearted, but it is quite central and provides easy access to the major sites of Venice. The rooms are wonderful and the staff very attentive. I would suggest getting a private boat taxi from the airport to save yourself the hassle of a 90 mins water taxi / bus to the hotel. It will save you an hour travel from the airport. If you are in Venice for longer, it may be economical to stay elsewhere, but for short trips, I would recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 4, 2015Dear Dr_Miami, Thank you very much for taking the time to leave your kind feedback following your recent stay at The Hotel Danieli.
