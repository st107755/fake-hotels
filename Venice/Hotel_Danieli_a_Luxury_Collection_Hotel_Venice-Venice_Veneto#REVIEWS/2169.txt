Stayed at the Danieli for 3 nights prior to a cruise - as a 5* hotel this is a joke and simply living on it's past reputation. Queued for 15 minutes to check in which wasn't a good start...........breakfast was good and the views fantastic, even managed to get an omlette the 1st morning - but other mornings a 9 person / 20 minute queue for the poor guy on his own cooking to order!!   Checked in on a friday afternoon and immediately went to the restaurant to try to book a table for dinner on the Terrace on Saturday night - the staff laughed and said that of course they were always full.........no apology or alternative suggestions........very Italian.  The room was large though in desperate need of a revamp - the bathroom was a 1970's vision in brown marble with lighting so dimâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
