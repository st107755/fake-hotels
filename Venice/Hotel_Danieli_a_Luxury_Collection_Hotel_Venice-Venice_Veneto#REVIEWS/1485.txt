We stayed for 3 nights for our 10th anniversary  and were not disappointed at all. The hotel was by far the most ideally located out of the other ones that we saw, the decor was luxurious, the food amazing (although we only had breakfast here) and the staff were ever helpful. I have seen reviews that the staff were curt and unwelcoming however I did not experience this and found them extremely helpful at all times. Sometimes people respond curtly if you are curt with them? The drinks and food wee won't cheap at all however we are out every night as we wanted to experience the more intimate Italian experience and we were not disappointed once. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, a very pleasurable stay.
