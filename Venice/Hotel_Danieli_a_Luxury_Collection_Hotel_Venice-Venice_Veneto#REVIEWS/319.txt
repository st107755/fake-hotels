Recently stayed one night here and it was beautiful.  Very old but very stylish.  Loved how you could get water taxied right to the side door.  Real keys for the doors.  The rooms were small but very elegant and beautiful.  The shower over the bath was a bit difficult to get going but it was extremely clean and tidy.  Chocolates by the bed, lots of goodies in the bathroom.  Right beside St Davids Square and all the shopping, restaurants.  Breakfast was amazing on the roof top.  Beautiful views and watching the cruise ships come into port was a sight.  Loved our stay.Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
