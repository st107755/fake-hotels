Phenomenal location, stunning hotel, can't wait to go back.   So close to all the main sites of Venice, it allowed us to explore the city at our own leisure.   Stunning atrium and superb bedrooms, great bar with lovely music in the evening.   Worth the money.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 10, 2017Dear chrishobson84, We are all waiting for your return to Venice!
