The hotel Danieli is in the heart of Venice.  It's right on the Grand Canal, and is in the perfect location.  The inside is grand and stately, and the rooms are lovely and a good size, particularly for european standards.  One of the most amazing things about the rooms are the room-darkening shades.  Quite helpful for trying to adjust to the time change!  We had a wonderful trip to Venice, thanks in part to the hotel Danieli!Read moreDate of stay: April 2007HelpfulShare
