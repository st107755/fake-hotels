We came here for a lunch choosing the tasting menu with the wine accompaniments, whilst having a few days away with friends in Venice. The Danieli was chosen for lunch on their Wedding Anniversary, on a fantastic day, the lunch was also fantastic. The staff were slightly aloof though, in contrast with other hotels and restaurants we dined at. The view out over the lagoon was great, the whole experience was great, including the great bill, however that was expected and we would do it again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 9, 2016Dear seabedW, Thank you for choosing us and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback on what appears to have been a very enjoyable lunch for you.
