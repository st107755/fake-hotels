Arrive by private water taxi, rooms overlookng the Canal are worth it. Decor amazing. Eat on the Terrace at least once.  However we found the staff were better dressed and presented than many customers whats happening to standards these days?  I dont want to see other peoples knees and flip flops unless its on the beach. Location is amazing and busy areas are easy to escape from. Good Piano bar some people danced.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
