I was spoiled: room upgrade plus lovely little gifts. Great breakfast (but you should skip lunch, you will find a scale in the bathroom). In the middle of everything. I was in one of the "side" buildings, on the 4th floor. I could hear the water but no noise from people at night. Beautiful view and all the vaporetto lines nearby, together with the Alilaguna from the airport. You can walk everywhere, if not take the vaporetto.  Good value for money: you get to live in a movie for a few days. Not suitable for tourists that want all rooms to be identical, that is a plus for me.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 18, 2016Dear  janelitamirta, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay and we hope to be able to welcome you back soon.
