You can always find fault if you look hard enough - so here goes. We booked the Danieli as part of our Ruby Wedding celebrations.  The plan was to stay at the Danieli in a junior suite for 3 nights, travel to Lake Garda and stay at the Grand Hotel, Gardone (see seperate report) for three nights and then return to the Danieli for an overnight stay in a "basic" room for one night before returning to Scotland.  So this report deals with the two stays at the Danieli.  We arrived by water taxi and were treated with great courtesy and efficiency by the staff.  Our junior suite room (room 8) was very oppulent and overlooked the Eastern end of the Grand Canal where it opens out into the lagoon.  The windows were single glazed and shuttered so did not provide effective sound insulationâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2011HelpfulShare
