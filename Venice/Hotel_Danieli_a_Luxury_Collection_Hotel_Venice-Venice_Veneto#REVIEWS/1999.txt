We stayed one night in Venice at the Danieli for my birthday.  The first room we were given (650 euro booked for a lagoon view through American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts) was a shoebox with very little character, one tiny window,  and no place to sit.

This room was much better, high ceilings, Venetian looking furnishings, 2 large windows, much larger bathroom (room 302).  I can't imagine staying in the tiny room they showed us at first for our one night in Venice and I'm happy they willingly changed our room.  As for dinner...the view is stunning.  It's a wonderfully romantic elegantâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
