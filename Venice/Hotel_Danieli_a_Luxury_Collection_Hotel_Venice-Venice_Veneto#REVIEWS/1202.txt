The Hotel Danieli was chosen because we wanted a location close to St Marks Cathedral. We reviewed many properties in Venice before choosing the Danieli. We did not want to stay at a private island resort as we wanted to come and go freely without commuting to the city by water taxi. The Danieli is rich in history and ambience. The decorations and art in the hotel are beautiful. Our room was impeccable and extremely comfortable. The staff could not have been kinder or more helpful. Special nod to Alessio at the concierge desk and Giorgio at the front desk. We were 1 block from St Marks and overlooking the Grand Canal.Location, location. The view from the rooftop bar/restaurant were spectacular.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 8, 2015Dear Patrick K, Thank you for choosing to stay with us and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback on what appears to have been a very enjoyable stay for you.
