The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful as well as the view!  Be prepared to pay a 16 Euro cover charge per person, just to sit down.   We had a group of 4 for light dinner and drinks, and got a 400 euro bill.  (64 euros was the cover charge).  The food was ok, nothing special.  You pay for the atmosphere and the scene.   We weren't staying at the hotel we just came for dinner.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 23, 2014Dear Kira812, Thank you for your comments with regards to the dinner you had at our Restaurant Terrazza.
