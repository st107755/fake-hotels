This is an absolutely stunningly beautiful hotel with an equally amazing location in Venice. From the Murano glass chandeliers to the classic decor this hotel is perfect for a romantic stay. The buffet breakfast on the rooftop is delicious and has a wide variety of foods along with the million dollar view of the Grand Canal.    It's location cannot be topped.  Close to San Marco square, the Bridge of Sighs and at least a million restaurants.  Their service is as top notch as the surroundings.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear RofoBeth, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and I certainly hope that your future travels to Venice will bring you back to the Hotel Danieli.
