The hotel is more beautiful than it's pictures.  We were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a a balcony and a view of the canal.  The bed was very comfortable.  The hotel staff and service was wonderful.  Especially loved the delightful buffet breakfast.  Also the proximity to St. Mark's square was fantastic.  Each evening we were able to enjoy the square, it's food and entertainment and have a short walk back to the hotel and it's services.  Wish we could have stayed longer.  Will definitely go back to the Danieli if we return to Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 9, 2016Dear CindyMaryland, Thank you for your review.
