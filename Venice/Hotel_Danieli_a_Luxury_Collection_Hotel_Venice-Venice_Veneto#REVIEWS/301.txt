What an historic hotel to experience.  So to experience this adventure you have to overlook the conveniences usually taken for granted in a 5 star hotel.   But you have to realize that you are a guest in a 600 yr old building.   Biggest drawback is the very limited and small bathroom.  Bed comfy and rooms clean and well decorated in Venician decor.  Would highly recommend a stay here.  Great location as directly beside St. Mark piazza, in addition to great eating and shopping! Read moreDate of stay: September 2018HelpfulShare
