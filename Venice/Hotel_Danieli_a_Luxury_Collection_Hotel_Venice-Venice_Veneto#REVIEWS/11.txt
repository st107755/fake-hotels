Every time we return to the Danieli, it is like coming home.  The atmosphere remains as it probably was years ago, the service attentive and welcoming, and just the feeling of walking out in the morning (before the tourists arrive) to the spectacular views of Venice make it an experience every time.  I will only add that as a hotel in the traditional style, the experience and the welcome (including the rooms offered) only gets better if you return regularly. Overall the Old Lady of Venice, and the Dandolo palazzo rooms in particular, is well worth it.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare
