Of course the Danieli is special but it needs more effort to make it outstanding. When you are paying over €600 per night you expect the basin in the quite small bathroom to hold WATER and when it does not and you tell Housekeeping you expect it to be fixed. It was not.   When you are spending €95 on a main dish  you expect the stones to cook the beef to be HOT, they were not.   Excellent location, great breakfast and good front desk service but for the price not best value.

Please accept my profuse apologies for the issues you experienced during your stay with us. The issues you described were inexcusable and I cannot apologize enough for them. This is certainly not the level of service that we want our guests to leave with,  I would love for you to give us a chance to make this up to you and show a side of the Hotel Danieli that we are exceedingly proud of. I hope that you will give us this chance and to hear you soon. Kindest regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager Read more
