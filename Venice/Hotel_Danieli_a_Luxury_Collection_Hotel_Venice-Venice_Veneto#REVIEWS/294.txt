It is true, Hotel Danieli is beautiful to look at, but the service was below average. I suspect the very wealthy would receive greater attention. The room was very dark and quite small with limited power points and poor WiFi. The reception was brisk and cool upon arrival, no time for a friendly greeting. Do not book a water taxi through the hotel. They double the price.  I was so excited to visit this place, my first overseas holiday. I felt so very disappointed by our lack of a welcoming greeting upon arrival.
