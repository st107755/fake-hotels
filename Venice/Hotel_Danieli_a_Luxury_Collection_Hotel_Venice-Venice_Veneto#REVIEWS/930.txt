Really liked Hotel Danieli.  Our room had a view of the Grand Canal.  It was comfortable and we loved the location.  Walk out the front door, turn right in first alley and our favorite bistro was first location on left.  All the local gondoliers frequented too.  We gravitated there every day for a light bite and Prosecco or beer.  Also ate at the rooftop restaurant for breakfast and dinner (on one occasion).  You can't find a better view for dinner!Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 22, 2016Dear Ryla_M, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your fantastic feedback on TripAdvisor.
