One of the grande dame hotels of venice but now part of a group....such a shame as not as good as the Gritti Palace. Do you want upmarket customers or conventions of classless business people? This weekend you were overrun with the latter which meant no lunch on Friday for us at the restaurant! Check in average and the concierge really miserable....this is meant to be a five star hotel guys... Breakfast service really awful and muddled but good food. Dinner was good but expensive and the restaurant almost empty but for a rather noisy piano. You live on your location but care not for your guests! We won't be back I am afraid but will leave it to the badly dressed convention crowd...Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 18, 2013Dear PenguinTuk, Thank you for taking time to review our hotel on Trip Advisor. I am sorry to hear of the issues you faced while here with us and do wish that I had been aware while you were with us.  I can quite understand how frustrated you must have felt with regards to the Ristorante Terrazza being so popular and not being able to be seated straight away. I am so sorry to hear that the service you experienced was not to the standard you come to expect from a hotel of our caliber, I will be sure to follow up with the team. We look forward to welcoming you back in the not too distant future and please do not hesitate to contact us at any time if we can be of assistance.Warm regards, The Hotel ManagementRead more
