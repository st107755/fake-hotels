This is a beautiful old hotel with fabulous decode in great location on the main camel with boat access to the foyer. You truly know you are in Venice. A few creaky boards and stairs but the add to the allure. The roomsRe spacious but variable from ordinary to excellent. The breakfast lets them down in range, service but location is 10/10.. our third stay and would always stay here.Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
