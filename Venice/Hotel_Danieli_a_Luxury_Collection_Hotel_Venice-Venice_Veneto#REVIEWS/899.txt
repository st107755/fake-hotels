We have stayed here a few times. We like the lobby bar (where some very decent cocktails can be had) and we especially like the rooftop terrace restaurant, probably the best views in town. The rooms are opulent and we prefer to stay overlooking the Grand Canal. Bu even on the higher floors, passing tourists on big ships can possibly see in if you have the curtains back! It's decidedly central, and personally I like arriving by launch from the airport. Just perfect.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 26, 2016Dear D64, Thank you for staying with us,  we look forward to seeing you again at the Hotel Danieli in Venice!
