They call it the most famous hotel in the world, and I have nothing but raves.  It was only by travelling during the dead of winter and with an amazing Starwood Points deal that we booked this hotel.   We got one of the rooms on with a balcony- in the renovated part.  The view was amazing- of the grand canal and Saint Mark's square- literally like staying in the middle of a post card.  Venice itself is kind of a parody of itself, but this hotel, by itself, made our Venice stay a memorable one.  It's located right on St. Marks square- wouldn't want to see the crowds during the "high" season for sure.Read moreDate of stay: January 2010HelpfulShare
