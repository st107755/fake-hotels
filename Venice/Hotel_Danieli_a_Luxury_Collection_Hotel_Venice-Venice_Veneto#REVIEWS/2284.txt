If you want to keep your girl happy - fyl here to venice and put her up in the Danieli.  This was the single most romantic weekend of my life. The hotel and the experience was wonderful for the get go.  Venice is like a floating museum and hotel is at the heart of it all. As soon as you walk in you know you are somewhere very special. Strolling up that staircase is one of the best experiences of my life. You feel like  a princess.  We were in the old section of the hotel as they upgraded us for free. It was amazing. The Concierge were quick and helpful and we were just able to feel that everything was special - The breakfast terrace is especially wonderful.   100% recommend it for any coupleRead moreDate of stay: February 2010HelpfulShare
