We had been bitterly disappointed in Harry's Bar so we stopped in here for a nightcap. The building, fixtures and fittings are stunning. The staff match up to the environment, they were welcoming and very helpful. The cost of the drinks matched what you would expect in a top quality city hotel. Not cheap but well worth it for the unique experience.
