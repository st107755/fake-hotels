We stayed at the hotel last week and were amazed by the service and the well preserved hotel. The decoration is just beautiful and public areas such as the restaurant at the top and the lobby are worth visit even just for a drink.  When we checked in the FO agent was nice and welcoming we even were escort to the room by a lady who explain about the building.  The hotel located at the center of everything, all was walk able. The only think which was bizarre to me is the fact there is no espresso machine in the room, I understand this is an Italian regulation but still the hotel should offer a solution to his guest.  Can wait to my next visit at the hotel :)Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 20, 2015Dear Nirit M, Thank you for posting your review of the Hotel.
