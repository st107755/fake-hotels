We were told prior to our trip that Hotel Danieli was not what it used be anymore. Being such an iconic place, however, we decided to stay there anyhow. This proved to be a very good decision indeed.   We had never been to Venice before and the hotel turned out to be perfect for this first time there. We were upgraded to a very nice room with a wonderful view, and Danieli's prime location, a stone's throw away from Piazza San Marco, was essential.   The staff was incredibly helpful, especially the concierge, who took care of our every need.   Overall, a perfect stay.
