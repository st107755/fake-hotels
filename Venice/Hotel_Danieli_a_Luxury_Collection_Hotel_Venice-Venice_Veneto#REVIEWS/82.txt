My husband and I stayed one night at this hotel. The location is center for sights in Venice but be aware it is extremely crowded outside of the hotel. The room was very large and we were upgraded to a canal facing room which had beautiful views but was loud with all the traffic outside. Recommend if you donâ€™t mind very large crowds.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
