We booked a 'four nights for three' offer through British Airways, which added an extra pleasure to staying in this marvellous hotel. It's a palace of a place to - just enter through the lobby doors to realise you're somewhere very special indeed. It's located right next to the Bridge of Sighs and about 4 minutes' stroll from Saint Mark's Square and commands a breath-taking view across the lagoon from its rooftop restaurant. There just can't be a finer vista while enjoying a superb buffet breakfast.  The staff are attentive and friendly, the bar prices are a little expensive - but what the heck, you're in the lap of luxury and you have one free night's stay at the end of it!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear Brianwiz, I was pleased to learn that you enjoyed the perfect location of the Hotel in the Heart of Venice, indeed for travelling around Venice with ease and visiting most of its major attractions and sights.
