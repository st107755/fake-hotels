Absolute luxury in every way.  Unbeatable position beside the lagoon. Next door to the Doge's palace. 200 metres from St Mark's square.  The staff were perfect in every way,  Our room was immaculate with a wonderful bathroom.  There is an excellent terrace restaurant with one of the cities best views. Not cheap though, I wasn't too happy with a 32 â‚¬ cover charge.  The next time I visit Venice, This is the hotel we will stay in. We won't even look elsewhere.  Arriving to the door by water taxi is a nice different experience. A half hour trip from the airport,  great funRead moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 23, 2017Dear Madeiramakem, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your positive comments from your last visit with us I do hope we have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the future.
