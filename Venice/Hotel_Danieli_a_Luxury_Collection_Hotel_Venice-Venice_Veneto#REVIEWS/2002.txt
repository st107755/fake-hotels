First, do not believe the bad reviews!! We are completing a 2 night stay, and we have been thrilled.  The personnel have been very friendly and helpful, the room is beautiful, the breakfast buffet outstanding, along with a view that's breathtaking, along with a perfect location. I recommend the Danieli without hesitation.  I only regret that we are leaving in the morning.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 18, 2012Dear javert8817, Your kind comments are greatly appreciated.
