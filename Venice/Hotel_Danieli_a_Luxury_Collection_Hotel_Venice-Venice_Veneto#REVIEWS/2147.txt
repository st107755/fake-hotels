(+): Wonderful hotel - Inside wonderful decor - very good breakfast with unforgettable sea (grand canal) view- good service - spacy rooms & very comfortable. (-): We booked 2 adjacent rooms. Unlikely, we failed to get adjacent rooms, but it was not a real problem since the rooms are spacy. It was easy to manage our luggage in one room. We would prefer a free internet in rooms. It is free in lobby. (*): A real palace life.Read moreDate of stay: July 2011HelpfulShare
