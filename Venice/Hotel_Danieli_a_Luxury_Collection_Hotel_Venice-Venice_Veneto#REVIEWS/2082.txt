We stayed at the hotel from Dec 26 to Dec 28, in a deluxe double.  The room was not worth the money and looked nothing like what you see on their website.  However, the Hotel in itself was very charming and beautiful, it is a shame that their deluxe double was so old.  I recall one comment here saying that if you want to camp at your grandma's house then go ahead.  I had the same feeling while staying at this hotel.  I paid to stay in a hotel that has a history, but I didn't expect to stay in a room that is equally old and worn out as the age of the hotel!  Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
