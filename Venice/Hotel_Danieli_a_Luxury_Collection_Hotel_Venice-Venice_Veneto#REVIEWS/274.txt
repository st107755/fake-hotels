Really a lovely hotel, although expensive even for Venice. One of the few properties we have stayed that merit photos in the lobby.  The rooms are comfortable as you would expect and the service is passable. The only real drawback is that the property is too close to St Marks and the associated major attractions, meaning every lost soul from every cruise ship is pretty much standing outside the hotel. Hard to get back to the hotel even through the back streets.   Tip: unless you are really uncomfortable with fresh pastry, coffee, and a short walk; skip breakfast at the hotel and step outside with the locals. The food is better and you’ll save €100 day to blow on something else.  Other than that, exceptional.Read moreDate of stay: September 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
