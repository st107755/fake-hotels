One of the best in the world.  A real classic,  Resturant was superb, Have your meals on the roof top for a great view.  Bar service great.  Had a lot of bottles picked up on my trip and they never charged corkage.  Make sure you are in the old section, along the grand canal.   Service the best.  Took over 50 pictures of the inside, and the food,  Have a big poster of the place now hanging in our family roomRead moreDate of stay: December 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
