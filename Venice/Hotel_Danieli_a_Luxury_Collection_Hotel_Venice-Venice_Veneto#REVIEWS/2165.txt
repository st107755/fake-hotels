This hotel is pretty and the room was nice. Service was average at best. We were there in August and it was right in the middle of a crushing amount of tourists. The best thing about it was having breakfast in their rooftop restaurant. The view is wonderful and the food was good. We wouldn't stay here again. We've stayed in a smaller hotel a bit out of the center of everything and enjoyed it much more.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
