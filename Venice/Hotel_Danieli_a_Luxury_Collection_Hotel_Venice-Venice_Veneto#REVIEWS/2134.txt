Arrived by water taxi and we were checked in promptly with the Receptionist taking us up to our room.  The room was on the 2nd floor with superb views over the Lagoon.  We had champagne and chocolates with a card congratulating us on our 25 years.  The hotel certainly has the WOW factor.  Service was fantastic, rooms were out of this world, beds so comfortable and the whole place spotless.  Had a meal on our anniversary on the terrace overlooking the Lagoon where the waiters were brilliant.  Can not fault this Hotel and would defy anybody to do so.  It was pure luxury for us and we were made to feel very special.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 30, 2011Dear Jayne B, We were thrilled to read that you and your husband enjoyed your stay with us and it is always wonderful to hear that our associates provide a high stand of service to our guest as they are a great asset to the Hotel.
