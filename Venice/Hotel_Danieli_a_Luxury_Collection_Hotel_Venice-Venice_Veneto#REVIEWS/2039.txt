Stayed here one night in the premium deluxe room.  Was given a very nice room on the top floor in the Casa Nuova block with a partial view of the lagoon from our windows. The room was very venetian an spacious extremely the bathroom.  It was also very good that I was given late checkout at 4pm. Service wise, the receptionist Frederica provide extremely friendly service on arrival and she remembered us on our Check out day. Very impressed with her professionalism and enthusiasm.  Well done!! The lobbies and corridors and stairs were all palatial. Would certainly return again if I can afford it again.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 18, 2012Dear sporetravel01, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at The Hotel Danieli in Venice.We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed your stay and also that you appreciated the food, the friendly and professional service as well as the facilities that the Hotel Danieli offers.
