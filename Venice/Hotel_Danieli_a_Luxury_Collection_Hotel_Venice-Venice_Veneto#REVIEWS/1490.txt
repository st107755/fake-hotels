Beautiful lobby area and wonderful bathrooms in the bedroom. Fantastic location and stunning views from the top terrace where you have a spoiling breakfast with everything you could want.  Definitely worth having a drink in the lobby with a great pianist but the drinks are expensive.  The rooms are quite dark. The reason I was disappointed by this hotel was the staff, sadly they were incredibly slow. After being there 4 days I got stopped at the door when trying to come in as they didn't recognise that I was staying there. There was a lack of personal touches and good service to be able to give more stars sadly.  If service was better this hotel would of got 4 stars because it's beautiful and so well located Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 14, 2014Dear S-2-7-N, Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli. I am sorry to hear that you had some issues with entering the hotel and service levels. Whilst we do try to deliver service to a high standard for all our guests, usually the bar in the Lobby does get very busy  and it is necessary for our security to make sure that the entry is regularly monitored in accordance with health and safety standards.  Please be assured that our management team and I take these comments very seriously and we would like to thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, it is only with our guestâ€™s feedback that we can continue to improve.
