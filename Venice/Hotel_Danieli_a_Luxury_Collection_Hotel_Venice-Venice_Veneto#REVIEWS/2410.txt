Was nervous about staying at the Danieli after reading all the reviews.  I was very pleasantly suprised that my experience was outstanding.  The front desk took us to our rooms for our approval.  The restaurants that were recommended were great, and I found the staff throughout the hotel warm and friendly. The room was dated, but not musty or dirty.  I am an experienced traveller, stayed at the best hotels, and have nothing to complain about after our stay  at the Danieli Read moreDate of stay: May 2007HelpfulShare
