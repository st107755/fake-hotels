We chose the Danieli after much deliberation as to which of the luxury hotels to stay in in Venice. We were most impressed.   Service (concierge especially) excellent, bear in mind this is one of the finest hotels in Italy and the staff know this and what clientele this attracts.   Very good (upgraded) room, great views from the balcony over the lagoon. They even laid on a bottle of bubbly to recognise the special occasion. The highlight has to be the breakfast terrace overlooking the lagoon and the evening dining in the same location. Stunning, both the view and the food (Wagyu Beef recommended).   Note that this is an expensive hotel. The extras bill at the end will be hefty by any size wallet but in our opinion certainly worth it. Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
