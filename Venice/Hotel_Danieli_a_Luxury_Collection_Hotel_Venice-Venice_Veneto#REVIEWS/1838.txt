We stayed here pre-cruise for 2 nights and it was absolutely wonderful.  It is hard to believe the poor reviewers stayed in the same hotel.  The staff bent over backwards to assist us in every way, including helping me with my rusty italian, and thanking me for trying to communicate in italian.  The location cannot be beat, as it is right on the Guidecca and a block from St Mark's.  Stay here if you can.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 5, 2013Dear George F, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli.
