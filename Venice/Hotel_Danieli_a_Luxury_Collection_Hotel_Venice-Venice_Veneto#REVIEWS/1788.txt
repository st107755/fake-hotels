A 3 night relaxing stay in superb surroundings. Luxury Double room met every need, but be prepered to pay considerable more for a Lagoon view. Quality but expensive, although you get what you pay for. The view from the terrace resturant whilst enjoying breakfast is second to none. The hotel is in the ideal location for all the main tourist attractions. We will be returning.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare
