Every need was met.  The staff was wonderful.  We were directed toward places that were not as touristy which really made the holiday.  The view from my room was breathtaking.

I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fantastic Venice experience.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 13, 2014Dear Ken G, We appreciate you for taking the time to post your positive comments and we look forward to have again the pleasure of your visit in the very near future.
