We stayed for 3 days in a regular room. Cleaning and service very good almost excellent, but the room was really noisy and the aspect was poor and sad to pay U$D 700 per night.  Breakfast very good with an amazing view and excellent location. The bar was very good and check in and out very fast.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 7, 2015Dear RBRTW2015, Thank you for your review for your stay.
