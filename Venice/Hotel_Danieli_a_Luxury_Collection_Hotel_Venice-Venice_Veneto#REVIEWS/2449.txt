We stayed 10 days at the Danieli and loved every minute of it. The history, the charm, the romance, we fell in love all over again. Service was top rated and every one was extremely helpful. We toured the city and each night coming back to the hotel seemed like we were coming home. Our room faced the bay which added to the romance. We did not get a chance to use the pool facilities. Over all the experience was fantastic for us both in hotel accommodation, and service. Our only "getting used to" came when we reserved a king / queen bed, and they had put 2 beds together. I guess Europeans dont have king / queen mattress.  We are going back and will stay at the Danieli again!! Read moreDate of stay: March 2006HelpfulShare
