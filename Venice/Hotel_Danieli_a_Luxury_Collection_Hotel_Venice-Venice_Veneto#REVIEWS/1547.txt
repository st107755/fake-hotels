This hotel does look good and the location was right near St. Marc's square. It looks great but the desk people act like they can't be bothered to talk to you. I learned a very good lesson always pick a hotel not by it's online pictures but by if the hotel is in the top 20 on trip advisor. I would never go back. It was over priced and customer sevice was not good.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 5, 2014Dear RyanF861, I was surprised and disappointed to read of your negative experience during your stay at the Hotel Danieli.
