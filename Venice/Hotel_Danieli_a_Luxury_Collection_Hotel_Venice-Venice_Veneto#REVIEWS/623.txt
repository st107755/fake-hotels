Unique Hotel in a unique location close the St. Marks.  Great roof top restaurant for breakfast over looking the Grand Canal.  The room was excellent  also with a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. The service was good at check in, the restaurant and bar. Concierge was helpful.  The only negative was the boat  (vaporetto) stop close to the front of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
