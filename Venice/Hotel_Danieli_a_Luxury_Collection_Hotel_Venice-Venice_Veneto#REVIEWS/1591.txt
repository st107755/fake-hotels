The best thing about this hotel is the lobby.  And the views from the terrace restaurant are wonderful.   After that it's unacceptable. The rooms are outdated and very small yet very expensive.  It is a serious letdown after the St. Regis in Florence.  There is nowhere to put luggage and not enough space to unpack. The bathroom is very small (one sink, no counter), the mirrors are chipped and darkened and the room is so poorly lit it's impossible to apply makeup.  Continental breakfast in room is 50 Euros.  Dinner on the terrace requires taking out a mortgage.  I will never stay here again and certainly can't recommend it to anyone.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 9, 2014Dear Mary C, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli on Tripadvisor, following your stay with us. While we are delighted you found the lobby and the Terrazza views pleasant, I was most concerned to hear of your disappointment with the size of your room. I am sorry if this misled you as to our location in any way. Our room sizes do vary,  clearly we failed to meet your expectations in terms of value and for this we sincerely apologise.  I would be delighted to speak with you personally should there be anything I can help with, or if I can assist with making any future reservations.
