My wife is a frequent SPG visitor and for our 25th anniversary she wanted to visit a "luxurious" hotel in Venice.  Mission accomplished!  The hotel staff went out of their way to make our 4 day visit  very special.  We were upgraded to a balcony suite overlooking the Grand Canal.  My wife was given 25 roses, and champagne was already on ice in the room.    The suite itself was oversize with 2 bathrooms, a living area, "office", incredibly comfortable bedroom, and a huge bathroom with a giant marble tub and separate shower.    The location is fantastic.  Yes, there are crowds nearby but in Venice there are always crowds nearby.
