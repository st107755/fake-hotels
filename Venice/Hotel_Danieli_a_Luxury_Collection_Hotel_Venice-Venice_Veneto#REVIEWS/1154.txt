If you seek perfection, you've found it. Fantastic hotel, great atmosphere and staff. It looks very authentic and classic, but the rooms are still quiet.

Great view over the river, and very peaceful area.Read moreDate of stay: December 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 5, 2015Dear NielsFXSB, Such a pleasure to read your “fantastic” review, thank you for choosing the Hotel Danieli for your trip to Venice.
