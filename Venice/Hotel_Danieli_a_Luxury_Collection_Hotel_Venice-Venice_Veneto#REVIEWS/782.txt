We spent the last 3 nights of our European honeymoon at the Hotel Danieli. I had dreamed of staying at the hotel since I worked for a luxury travel company years ago. The hotel lived up to everything I had hoped for. We truly felt like we had walked into a Venetian palace. We received an upgrade to a room in the original part of the palace, at the front of the hotel, with views of the canal. The complimentary breakfast upstairs was excellent, and the views from the roof terrace were even better. The service was second to none, and every last detail was considered. Worth every penny.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 18, 2016Dear mperroni, Thank you for your favorable review and may I take this opportunity to thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli.
