We stayed for 4 nights in the "Luxury Collection", which means a huge renovated over the top gorgeous room, but not a great view. It was apparently a view of the "lagoon", but when looking out the window, it was literally a brick wall. However, the location was amazing, and the service impeccable. But for the cost (over $600/night), definitely not worth it. We were told we would have a King size bed, they pushed two twins next to each other, and called that a King. Just know that to set expectations. We also had to walk up/down 2 separate flights of stairs (or take two different elevators) every time we had to go back and forth to our room. Not a great set up, BUT the hotel is gorgeous, and we loved our room with the huge marble bathroom.Read moreDate of stay: April 2010HelpfulShare
