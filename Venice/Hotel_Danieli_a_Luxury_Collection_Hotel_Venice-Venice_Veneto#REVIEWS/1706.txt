My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Danieli with his work back in September. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. Our room was wonderful and the staff amazing. If I was ever going back to Venice this is the hotel I'd stay at. The location is wonderful! Close to St Mark's square and the views of the water eating breakfast every morning were breath taking. One of the best hotels I've stayed at in Italy.Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 4, 2013Dear ChristieLynne81, I would like to thank you for alerting us of your experience.
