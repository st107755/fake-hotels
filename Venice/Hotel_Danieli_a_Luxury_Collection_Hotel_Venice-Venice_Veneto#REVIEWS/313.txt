Itâ€™s a gorgeous old palace.  Sometimes old can be uncomfortable but not here.  The room was perfect. Good bed good ac good water. We had a great sleep.   The breakfast terrace was breathtaking. Our advice is to plan on a long leisure meal to soak in the atmosphere while sitting on the terrace.   The lobby bar is a perfect escape from the tourist crowdsRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
