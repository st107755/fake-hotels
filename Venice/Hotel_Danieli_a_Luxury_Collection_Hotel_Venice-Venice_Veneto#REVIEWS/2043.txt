My wife and I have just stayed in this hotel for four nights. The location is excellent being so close to St Marks Square and the water buses. The hotel has so much character that we just stared in awe at the decorations, pictures and amazing Murano glass chandeliers. Our room overlooked the water at the front and it had fantastic views. Yes it's expensive but then so are most things in Venice. If you want cheap stay somewhere else - if you want class stay at the Danieli!Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 9, 2012Dear Traveller5star, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
