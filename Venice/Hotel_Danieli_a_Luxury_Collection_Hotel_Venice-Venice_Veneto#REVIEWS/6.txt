We had an afternoon Tea experience at this wonderful luxury hotel (actually it was for 3 people) and it was a surprise.  The downstairs reception area is a "work of art" in style and glamour, as well as being very comfortable.  There are beautiful stained glass windows and Murano Chandeliers to show case the surroundings and make your experience sumptuous.  We did not know what to expect from an Italian tea, having only the English High Tea to compare it with.  We had finger sandwiches, fresh scones, the local carnival cakes, patisserie delights, prosecco and a selection of teas.    With the hectic sightseeing of St.Mark's Square it was a refreshing counterbalance in a very relaxing setting.Read moreDate of stay: February 2020HelpfulShare
