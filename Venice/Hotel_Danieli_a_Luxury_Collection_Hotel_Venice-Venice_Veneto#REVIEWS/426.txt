Stayed here during carnival to experience venedig and one of the most famous palace hotels. The price is really high so also our expectations had been huge.

I kindly ask you to accept my profuse apologies for the issues you experienced during your stay with us. Some issues you described were inexcusable and I cannot apologize enough for them. This is certainly not the level of service that we want our guests to leave with, and while I understand that we only have one opportunity to make a first impression, I would love for you to give us a chance to make this up to you and show a side of the Hotel Danieli that we are exceedingly proud of. I hope that you will give us this chance. Should you decide to give us another chance, please reach out to me directly and I will personally see to it that you have an amazing stay with us. I hope to hear from you soon.  Sincerely, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
