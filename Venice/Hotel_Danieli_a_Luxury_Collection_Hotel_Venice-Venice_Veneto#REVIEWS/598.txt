Wow we recently stayed at the Ritz, London and it was  great. The Danieli was equally great. Whilst the reception area is small and busy we were quickly greeted and shown to our room. The receptionist was brilliant and showed us around. The Bistro and Terrace restaurants were outstanding the latter having the edge with its great out door offering. From Breakfast on the terrace in the morning to Dinner in the evening it is a brilliant location. The staff throughout the Hotel are great and always attentive. The food of an evening was brilliant and the morning buffet selection excellent. The location of the hotel is superb for all of the main sites of Venice.Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
