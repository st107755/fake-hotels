we stayed at the danieli at the start of our cruise in the older part of the hotel. we were upgraded, without asking, into a suite without a view. the room was tired and in need of refurbishing however, service was excellent and the breakfast was fantastic. it was served in a magnificent room with great views and service. at the end of the cruise, we again were upgraded to a suite ,but this time in the renovated part of the hotel. it was fantastic! truly, 4 stars. iwe were sorry to leave.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 16, 2012Dear doctorbob10, We are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay at the Hotel Danieli and that you appreciated the comfort and spaciousness of the Suite.
