Beautiful old hotel steeped in history. We had a very comfortable stay with a large soft bed, great shower and of the course the hotel is in a great location.

We couldn't fault our stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 2, 2015Dear WibblyWoo, Thank you for favorable review and may I take this opportunity to thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli.
