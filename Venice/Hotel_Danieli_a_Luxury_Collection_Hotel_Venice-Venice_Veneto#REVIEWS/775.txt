The Danieli had been on my 'bucket list' for years, but for one reason or another we'd never visited. When I finally got round to making a reservation, I was a bit concerned that the liveried staff and grand appearance might make us feel uncomfortable. I couldn't have been more wrong! We were made very welcome - every member of staff we met was welcoming, helpful and friendly. We were in a very comfortable updated room at the side of the hotel (although in appearance it was updated to the 18th century!). The high point (on the 3 days it didn't rain) was breakfast on the Terrace. The food is an 'OK' buffet, but the experience of eating in a formal, outdoor dining 'room', which overlooks Venice is incomparable. I was so pleased I'd booked room+breakfast.
