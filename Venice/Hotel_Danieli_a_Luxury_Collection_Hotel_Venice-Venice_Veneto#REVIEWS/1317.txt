From the moment we arrived we were made feel welcome and valued. Our suite over looking the Grand Canal was wonderful. If you can afford it I recommend upgrading to a suite with canal views. Opening the windows onto the Juliet balcony and hearing the sounds from the canal boats and people below.   We ended aperitif each evening downstairs in the lobby bar, highly reccomend a Bellini pre dinner.   Fantastic location within walking distance of all major sites.   I will definitely be back.Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 13, 2015Dear Freqtraveller53, I have passed your kind words to all the team who are indeed very grateful and we do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back on a future visit to Venice.
