Extended over I believe three historical buildings (therefore, the individual rooms may differ), overall a very charming and romantic place. Please refer to other reviews .-) Had a dinner in the garden restaurant downstairs facing the Lagoon, after a late arrival: very pleasant service, nice view, nice food and wine. Breakfast: there is nothing like a relaxed breakfast in the quiet courtyard. However, giving four points only because the breakfast selection was just average (perhaps above average in Italian terms). WiFi in the room somehow whimsical: there were periods when it not just slow but down.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 21, 2016Dear Petr H, Thank you for your visit to Hotel Danieli and for your comments concerning the breakfast.
