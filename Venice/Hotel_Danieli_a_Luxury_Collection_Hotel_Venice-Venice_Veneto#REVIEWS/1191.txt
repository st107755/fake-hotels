My husband and I stayed in this hotel a few years ago.  It was a very lovely stay.  The customer service was magnificent.  They made us feel like we were very important people.

The bathroom was actually a good size it had everything we needed, very clean and lighting was very bright.   We were offered a free ride on a nice boat to the glass factory.
