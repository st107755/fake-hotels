We had a lovely time at the Hotel Danieli and we chose a Dandolo King 1 Bedroom Suite for our 3 night stay.  Without question the foyer, bar, concierge and reception areas are gorgeous spaces.  The grand staircase could be in a museum.  The rooftop terrace for dining was outstanding, both for quality of the meal and the incredible view.  The location of these 3 connected palazzo's that comprise the Hotel Danieli was terrific and one of the reasons we chose this property for our second visit to Venice.  It's close enough to the action but a beautiful place to return to after touring the city.  There are plenty of people, vendors, gondoliers, etc just outside the front door and for us that was part of the appeal.  It's well-known Venice is overcrowded with tourists like us.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
