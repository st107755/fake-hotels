I was not a hotel guest, we just ate there. By far the best view you can have with a decent meal. Really OK considering that Venice offers a lot of standard pasta-pizza-salad stuff for outrageous prices. The 200% premium you pay in Danieli is worth it. The service is good as well they have seven waiters for 14 tables so you will get attention. The maitre d' is the only exception. Impressive blonde with cool attitude. Interesting in its own right... We guessed she could be Dutch but were afraid to ask :-)   Well recommended for food with a view, would not lodge there..Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare
