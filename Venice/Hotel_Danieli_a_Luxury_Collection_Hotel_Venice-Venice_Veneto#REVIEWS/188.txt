When you walked into the hotel, you get approached immediately for check in which was very nice. And of course when you stay in hotels like this, you obviously stay for the service and convenience. The St.marco Plaza was very close. When we were there, the carnival was going on so it was very convenient to just walk out and get the carnival vibe. Getting to the hotel is super convenient just a few stops away by the boat. Overall experience was very good.Read moreDate of stay: February 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
