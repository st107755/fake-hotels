So many things I would love to do if I managed the Danieli as it is so sad to see what surely must be one of the most beautiful hotels in Europe slowly falling from grace . Curtain off the bar area to make it more intimate , get rid of all the dried flowers , make the reading room on the left into a tearoom, change all of the lighting ,put some heaters on the rook deck ,  change some staff ( except Elana for she is brilliant ) I could go on and on doing things to polish up this spectacular gem .  Because of its beauty it remains 5star but the quality is in reality 4 star but it could  and should be 6 star .  But for all its faults the Danieli is still an amazing hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 10, 2016Dear HeathcliffDublin, We are extremely grateful for your support and your suggestions and, we would like to thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to our attention.
