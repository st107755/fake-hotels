We arrived during one of Venice’s worst flood, but that did not lower any standards at the hotel.  The front desk was friendly and efficient, our room was clean, the restaurant was operating as normal, and they provided room service when the elevator was not running.  Hotel Danieli is located near the mouth of the grand cannel, one can get here by water taxi from the train station.  A few steps away from the hotel front entrance, there is a water taxi dock, public boat transportation dock as well as gondola stands.  One should avoid the gondola stand in front of the hotel called “Gondola Danieli”.  It has nothing to do with the hotel, nor does it have any standard at all.Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
