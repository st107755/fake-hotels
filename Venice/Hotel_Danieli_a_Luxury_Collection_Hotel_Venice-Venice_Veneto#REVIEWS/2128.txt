We were so fortunate to get married in Venice two years ago and the Danieli made the whole experience perfect! We were given a beautiful room in the old part of the hotel with a seperate dressing area, plenty of room to hang up my bridal gown. We booked our wedding reception at very little notice in the restaurant and also used the terrace. The staff were amazing so professional and although the Danieli is expensive I believe you get what you pay for. The hotel provided extra special touches which we did not organise including beautiful displays of flowers. I cannot recommend the Danieli enough! The good news is we are going back in two weeks time to celebrate our anniversary - I cant wait!Read moreDate of stay: October 20112 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
