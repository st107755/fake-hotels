Wonderful setting for a hotel which in fact is 3 separate buildings ( linked). We paid for a deluxe room with a view of the waterfront and it's what we got. It's an old hotel and as such must be difficult to keep "up to scratch" than something built in the last 20 years. They do a reasonable job. The room was big enough and the "distressed" furniture was very distressed, in fact it needed replacing. The television did not work but we can skip that we didn't want it. Beds are comfortable and the room is serviced well - the carpets are in good condition and wall coverings are fabric rather than paper. What let this room down was the bathroom. A shower over a small and narrow bath is, in my book, an absolute "no no'.  It's both dangerous and unpleasant to use; rather ditch the bathâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
