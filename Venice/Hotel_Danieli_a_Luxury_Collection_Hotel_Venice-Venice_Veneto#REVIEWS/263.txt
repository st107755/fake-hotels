Extremely poor value. All vegetables cold and poor selection overall and most deserts gone before 3pm and not replenished. Service stroppy, never their fault.  When finishing our coffee cigar smoker put on next table and immediately lit a very large smelly cigar - time to leave. Why are cigars allowed in a restaurant?  Most expensive but worst meal for a very long time and Danieli nor bothered.Read moreDate of stay: October 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 15, 2018Dear patjohn62, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli..
