third visit to Venice and a different property each time, first being the Gritti palace and the second being Bauer. i must say the Danieli was the best amongst the three.  since our booking was through American express platinum we were upgraded to the Grand Dandolo suite. many thanks to the Danieli for accommodating this upgrade.  the suite was a real treat and was like living in a medieval palace. the living room was huge and appointed with antique furniture and light fittings. Although the hotel is very old but rooms are maintained very well and we could not have asked for better.  the hotel has a wonderful terrace where we went for breakfast and evening drinks. some amazing views of the venice !!Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
