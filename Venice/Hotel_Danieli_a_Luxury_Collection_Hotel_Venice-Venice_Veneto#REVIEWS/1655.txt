We have just returned from a three night stay which was perfect. Truly beautiful hotel with a luxurious room and facilities, fantastic bedding. Very comfortable beds. Staff polite and helpful. We didn't eat in the hotel preferring to try the local caf√©s but the menus were very very tempting if somewhat expensive. But only to be expected in five star luxury in Venice. Wonderful location on the edge of the lagoon with the water bus stop, water taxis and gondolas on the doorstep. A few steps away from st marks square. Definitely the place to stay, fantastic.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 4, 2014Dear Millbury, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
