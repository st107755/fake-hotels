I have stayed at the Danieli many times over many years and every time I enjoy the experience more.   The exquisite palazzo with its beautifully decorated rooms,  the service at reception and the concierge desk are exceptional. This time I had a special treat. -- I met the chef Dario and was able to tell him in person how delicious, innovative and beautifully presented my meal(s!) had been. I must also mention the terrace dining at the Danieli -- famous for the most beautiful view in Venice. Altogether the Danieli offers the best and most outstanding hotel experience a guest could possibly have. Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
