This hotel has one of the best location in Venice, 100 meters form Piazza San Marco and 50 meters form Dodge Palace.  The building is amazing, very nice entrance, nice corridors, and wonderful terrace at the roof, where you will take a very complete breakfast, with a lot of fresh fruits, and I love it.  You can see the Lagune of Venice during breakfast and the view is lovely.  My own regret is about rooms.  For me nothing special, I was really expecting something very comfortable for this price (1800 â‚¬ / night, written on the door ... !) it's of course not what I pay but ...  You will not find adaptor for electricity in your room, the mini bar is very poor, bathroom, also ...  You like luxury rooms, don't choose this hotelRead moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 29, 2012Dear Jerome A, Thank you for posting your review. The Hotel Danieli has recently undergone a soft refurbishment of some Suites. The design does mix more traditional elements with modern touches reflecting the rich history of the hotel since its opening in 1822 whilst at the same time achieving a more contemporary look and feel. I am very sorry to hear that you found the room you were allocated not to be to your liking. We hope to have the opportunity of welcoming you back again soon Kind regards, Christophe Mercier Hotel ManagerRead more
