The hotel is in a very convenient beautiful location. Decor and design are lovely. Views from The roof top terrace are beautiful . Hotel Staff was helpful except for concierge desk that never smiled or looked up. When asked for a dining recommendation they were not happy to give one. If you asked them to call a restaurant for a reservation and there was not one available they never offered an alternative. The rooms were lovely and clean . The breakfast buffet was great. The shops and sights were very close by and convenient to walk. Gondolas / boats came up close to entry on front and up to the side of hotel. Bellmen were very prompt and courteous. Rooftop terrace view was the best part of the hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 20, 2015Dear lisadmass, We appreciate you taking the time to add your comments to the TripAdvisor your review on The Hotel Danieli following your recent visit to the Hotel.
