This has to be one of the most amazing hotels in the world. It looks like its from a film set with incredible views across Venice. Arrived by vintage Italian boat to be greeted by wonderful staff. Food in the restaurant is fabulous. Location is as good as you can get and the rooms with their views over the lagoon and the gondolas were perfect.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
