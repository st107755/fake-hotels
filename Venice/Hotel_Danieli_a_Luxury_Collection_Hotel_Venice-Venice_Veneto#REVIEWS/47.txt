As the first come in we see the old building from outside, but inside we got surprise how beautiful the interior, that's why i call it's really VENICE. Because when u came in here you will feel like so comfy.  The important thing is this place is very very strategic. You can reach everywhere through this hotel. If you want to take the water taxi or the gondola it's very easy because you just need to come out from the hotel and it located in front of the hotel :)  The room perfectly clean for me and when we come out from our room, the housekeeping always come to get it dress up. So when we come back we always feels like so amaze. We've stayed here for 5 days.  What we really like here is, we can have the perfect view to enjoy our breakfast everyday. It was awesome.
