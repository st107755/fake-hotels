I had a room with a view on the lagoon (1.300 â‚¬ per night) and because of the very old windows I was forced to stop my sleep g at 6.30 AM because of the noise coming from the outside...absolutely not acceptable!Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 24, 2014Dear Francesco_Carozza, Thank you for taking the time to post a review about your stay with us.
