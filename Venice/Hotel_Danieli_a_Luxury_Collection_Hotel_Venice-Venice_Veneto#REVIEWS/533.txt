We went on a river cruise from Budapest to Nuremberg, then flew to Venice for 2 nights at the Danieli, then home on the Orient Express to London, this hotel was part of the luxurious experience, especially the rooftop terrace restaurant/bar.We had a suite on the 3rd floor, two bathrooms, lounge and huge bedroom.All furnished in the Venetian way! We have stayed in Venice many times in the last 45 years and all the hotels have been lovely, some basic, some rather grand, but Danieli beats them all. The ambience of a Doge's residence along with discreet but friendly staff was super. Yes its pricey, but I believe you get what you pay for and could not fault a thing.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear mrsc2b-11, Thank you for favorable review and may I take this opportunity to thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli.
