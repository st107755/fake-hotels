Amazing! I stayed at the Danieli with my sisters during Carnivale and the rooms and location of the hotel truly are incredible. Having been upgraded as an SPG Gold member, we received a renovated room with a small balcony overlooking the water. Incredible! The hotel really makes you feel like you are back in the renaissance. Gorgeous! The concierge was also very helpful when we were there, suggesting many good restaurant options. Trying to get them to answer over email, though, was less smooth. Having also stayed at the Gritti Palace, I do admit this is more central and easy to use as a base to maneuver the city. Looking forward to our next stay!Read moreDate of stay: February 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 11, 2017Dear  bleuette623, Thank you for your kind words, please don't wait too long to come back!
