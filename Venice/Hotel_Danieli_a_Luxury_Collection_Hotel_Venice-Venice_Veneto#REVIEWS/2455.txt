We stayed at the Danieli during the Carnaval 2006. Although it is a Palace, we found it too expensive for what you finally get for your money. OK Daniel has a historic background... but does it justify the price? The size of the room was fine but the bathroom wasn't what we should expect from a "luxury collection hotel". You almost had to shower in 30 cm of water because it wasn't flowing out as it should be. Toilets were also defect. In the morning only cold water was available. If we have to stay in Venice again, we would definitely try another hotel. Read moreDate of stay: February 2006HelpfulShare
