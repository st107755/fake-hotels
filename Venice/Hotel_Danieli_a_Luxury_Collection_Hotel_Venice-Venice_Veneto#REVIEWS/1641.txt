We were a little nervous of staying  at the hotel after reading some of the reviews,so we were very pleasantly surprised to find a wonderful hotel.The staff all seemed polite and helpful, from Marco in reception to all the staff in the terrace restaurant.The breakfast may seem expensive but by Venice standards it is good value and the view is breathtaking.We were lucky enough to be given a room with a lagoon view which was amazing, we can't wait to go back.Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 2, 2014Dear Ashley C, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
