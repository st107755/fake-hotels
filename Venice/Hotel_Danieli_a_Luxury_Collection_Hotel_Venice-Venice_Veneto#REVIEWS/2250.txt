stayed 3 nights at the Danieli inspite of reviews criticizing its service. They were right. For a hotel that charges > $1000 a night for a basic room, Starwood should be embarrased. Rooms dark and nothing special. No help with bags coming in by water taxi. Rushed through our $26 martinis on the roof bar (great views though). The crowds in and around the hotel (St Marks Square) from the cuise ships unbelievable.
