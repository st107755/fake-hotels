We just got back to Los Angeles last night but we left our hearts in Venice at the Danieli Hotel! The staff was beyond nice and accommodating to all our needs. The Concierges were super helpful and attentive at all times. The check in and check out was so pleasant. And the room was unforgettable - a beautiful Dandolo Suite, recently renovated and designed by the French world known architect P. Yves Rochon. The Danieli was one of the most memorable hotels we have every stayed at (on par with the grandeur of the Ahwanee Hotel in Yosemite but with beautiful updated rooms) from the grand lobby entrance to the details in the room, to the perfectly located entrance right in front of the Vaporetto stops. Our experience from the moment we walked into the beautiful lobby transformed us.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 18, 2015Dear NJS55, We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed your stay and also that you appreciated the location, the room and the friendly and professional service as well as the facilities that the Hotel Danieli offers.
