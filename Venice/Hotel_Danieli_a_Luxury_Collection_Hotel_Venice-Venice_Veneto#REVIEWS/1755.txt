Wonderful hotel right in the centre of everything in Venice - with astonishing views of the Lagoon (if you dont book a room with a view Id seriously consider choosing another hotel, as this is one of the hotel's major attractions).  The buildings ooze old venitian charme and the central Dandolo palace is a historic gem - nothing less. In spite of the hubbub outside everyday - once inside the hotel, everything is calm and beautiful.  Service by everyone from maids doing the rooms to front desk and consierge is truely top quality - and genuinely friendly. The rooms are also nice, but will need a renovation quite soon in order for this hotel to maintain 5 star rating. Nothing wrong per se - but the little things are starting to look  a tad worn.  But Id come back - any time .Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 27, 2013Dear nikolai69, I am very pleased that your enjoyed your time with us and were able to enjoy the fantastic views our property has to offer.
