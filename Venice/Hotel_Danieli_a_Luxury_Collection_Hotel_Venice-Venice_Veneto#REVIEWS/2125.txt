This hotel combines a classic, historic ambiance with 21st Century service standards and a totally professional and caring staff.  Our compliments to General Manager Antonello de' Medici for this accomplishment!  We had an elegantly appointed room in the 14th Century wing overlooking the laguna.  Another treat was being able to wake up to cappucino and an elegant buffet breakfast on the sunny roof terrace overlooking much of beautiful Venice.  This is a gem of a hotel with an excellent staff.Read moreDate of stay: September 2011HelpfulShare
