From the moment we first stepped into the magnificent lobby of the Danieli to when we left, we were treated warmly by the friendly and professional staff!  I travel frequently and have stayed in many high-end hotels. Check-in is a critical first impression. The woman assisting us (I'm so sorry I didn't note her name) instantly made us feel welcome! I appreciated the Platinum recognition and room upgrade to a beautifully appointed junior suite overlooking the Grand Canal.  The room was spacious, the bathroom grand, and the view out our multiple windows - amazing!    The location of the Hotel Danieli is perfect.  It is just a short 2 minute stroll to St. Mark's Square, hidden, charming streets and canals at your back door, and all options of water transportation out the front. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 3, 2013Dear Tami K, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
