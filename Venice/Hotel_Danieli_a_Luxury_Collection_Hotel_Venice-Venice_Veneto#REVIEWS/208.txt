This hotel is absolutely gorgeous inside!  Although we did not have the pleasure of staying at this beautiful hotel, we walked in and had drinks and appetizers.  The hotel is stunning from the very moment you walk in!   The hotel is located just steps away from Saint Marks Square and you will miss it if you're not looking because the outside does not do it justice.    Just stop in for a drink and take in the beauty of this amazing hotel. Read moreDate of stay: October 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
