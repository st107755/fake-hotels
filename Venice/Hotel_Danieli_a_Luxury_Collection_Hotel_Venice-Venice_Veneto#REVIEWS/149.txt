So lucky to be able to stay twice at this beautiful hotel. Our room was perched above the grand canal and the balcony perfect for watching the busy traffic on the water and people below. This must be one of he best views from a hotel room in the world - so if you can stomach the cost you should go for it! Breakfast on the top floor verandah was a treat every morning with a buffet to suit the palace.  Also had dinner up there one night which was delish and watching the sunset hard to beat. Absolutely no buyers remorse staying here!Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
