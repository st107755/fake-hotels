Simply beautiful hotel. Exceptional service - do not miss the rooftop terrace. Go to the bar or restaurant, doesn't matter, just kick back and enjoy the view. Stayed in the Punta Della Dogana Suite, stunning. Highly recommend. Even if you can't stay, wander into the lobby, and then to the bar. The views will not disappoint.Read moreDate of stay: June 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 12, 2015Dear nikikilov, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
