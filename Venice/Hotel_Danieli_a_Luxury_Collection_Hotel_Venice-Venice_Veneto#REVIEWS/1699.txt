The hotel itself is beautiful.  The staff was excellent. The location is ideal.  Easy access for arrival/departure and the location allowed for quick trips back to the hotel during the day.  Sit in the bar for afternoon tea or a cafe and admire the decor.  An absolute must is breakfast in the upstairs restaurant. The view is fantastic and the staff was impeccable.Read moreDate of stay: November 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 14, 2013Dear Jcbaroque, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
