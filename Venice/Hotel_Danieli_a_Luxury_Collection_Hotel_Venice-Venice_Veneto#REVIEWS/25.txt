This hotel is absolutely beautiful and in a really great location, easy access to ferries, water taxis, and st mark's square. But the price is high for mediocre service. Front desk and concierge services seemed chaotic and unorganized. The hotel restaurant had a good for breakfast service, highly recommend paying the discounted rate in advance if you're staying for several nights, balcony views are amazing. However the dinner menu selections suggested high quality, but there were hardly any staple choices and what we ordered fell flat for us given the high prices. We felt much better ordering room service or eating in the evening lounge area on the first floor with a very nice cocktail. Clean, authentic looking rooms though.Read moreDate of stay: November 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 25, 2019Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

I hope that you will give us this chance and to hear from you soon.  Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager  Read more
