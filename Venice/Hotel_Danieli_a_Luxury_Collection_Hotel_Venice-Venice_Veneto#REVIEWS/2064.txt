The Danieli is wonderful property. The old lobby, vernadas and common areas help deliver the opulant style of life in Venice of a certain period. Arriving and departing by water taxi was a luxurious Venetian experience. Our room was junior suite in the oldest building.The suite was small. The lack of light that gave the room a bit of a gloomy feeling.The bathroom was as big as the bed chamber and the most luxurious part of the accomodation. I had to keep reminding myslef that the price is for the5 star  antiquity, not the 5 star comforts of a newer property. Service was slighly less than we expected. We appreciate a laid back luxury experince and normally pay to experince it.We found the staff a bit disengaged, which made us work a little harded to have our "ideal luxury"â€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
