Third visit to Venice and we try and stay somewhere different each time. Danieli is a unique and beautiful hotel. Service is outstanding. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace overlooking the grand canal is an “oh” moment as it is simply beautiful. We didn’t dine in at night as a jacket is required in the rooftop restaurant for dinner (not for breakfast) and when we are on holidays my husband likes to dress casually and remain relaxed so we would walk to one of the many piazzas and choose a different location each night. I would definitely recommend staying at the Danieli. It’s location on the grand canal is perfect. Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
