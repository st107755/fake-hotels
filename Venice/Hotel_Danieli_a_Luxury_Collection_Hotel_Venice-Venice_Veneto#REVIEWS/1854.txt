We know Venice very well and have stayed in some of the best hotels in this beautiful city over the years.  We also know the Danieli and have had many happy meals and celebrations there. The stunning and historic public areas are breathtaking.  A drink in the bar or a meal in the restaurant are a must for any visit to Venice.  However, after our recent two night visit to the hotel, I wouldn't choose to stay here again. My wife and I were first shown to a room in the oldest part of the hotel.  It was nice enough but rather shabby.  We immediately noticed a VERY strong and unpleasant smell from the drains in the bathroom.  I called reception and a maid was sent who suggested that the smell was awful and that we should ask to move rooms as there was nothing that she could do. â€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 3, 2013Dear LondonJc, Firstly we would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience at the Hotel Danieli in Venice.
