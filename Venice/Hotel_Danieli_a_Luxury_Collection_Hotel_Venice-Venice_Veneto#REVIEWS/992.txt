A wonderful hotel.  After reading some negative comments I wasn't sure what to expect.  There was a complaint about long waiting time at the check in. From the moment we stepped through the door from the water taxi through to opening the door of our room took 10 minutes.  The staff were, without exception warm and friendly, and the service was brilliant. Special mention to the waiters in the Terrazza restaurant, great ambiance and super food.  We had a room with terrace overlooking the lagoon, it was worth every penny. Such a view, and great watching the gondolas and vaporetti crossing to the other islands, with a glass of champagne in our hand after a wonderful dinner.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare
