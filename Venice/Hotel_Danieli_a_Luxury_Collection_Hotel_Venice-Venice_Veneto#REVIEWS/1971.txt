Opulent, romantic and very special. Spent a few nights at the danieli as part of our honeymoon in July 2010 and it's the only hotel I would recommend in Venice. Great location, ambiance, staff and scenic vue in the morning from breakfast terrace. The antique and classical decor fits perfectly with Venice's spirit but try ask for a light and spacious room as some can be slightly stuffy.
