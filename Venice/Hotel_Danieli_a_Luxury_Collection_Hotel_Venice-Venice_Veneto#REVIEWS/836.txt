As we were starting our Mediterranean cruise in Venice we decided to stay at the Hotel Danieli. The hotel is in a great location. Thanks to our upgrade to a room with large balcony, we had a fantastic view of the Grand Canal. We even saw our cruise ship arrive in the morning which was a great site. Room was nice, it was large enough with very comfortable bed. Breakfast was great with a fantastic rooftop view of the Canal. Staff were very good and helpful. Hotel was a bit pricey, however, we loved our stay.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 4, 2016Dear AlohaOutrigger, Thank you very much for taking the time to leave your kind feedback following your recent stay at The Hotel Danieli.
