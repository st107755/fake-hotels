Just returned after 3 day break in Venice. Arrived by water taxi organised by hotel which was spot on. Room and hotel very comfortable and the reception area is a must to see.

Breakfast was included and whilst the standard was ok if you had to pay the prices separately the quality wouldn't reflect the price.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 5, 2014Dear stuart2809, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for choosing to review The Hotel Danieli on Tripadvisor.
