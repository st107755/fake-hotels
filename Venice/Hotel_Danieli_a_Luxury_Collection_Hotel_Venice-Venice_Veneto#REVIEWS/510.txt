The hotel is located exactly at the centre of Venice. Transportation was readily available with water bus. The hotel was elegantly built. The interior was wonderful for photo shooting and indeed we booked it for engagement photo shooting. Photo shooting in the hotel needs booking beforehand. Initially we were only allowed to shoot before 8am when the hotel was less busy, however after further negotiation by our photographer with the hotel, we were allowed to shoot at 11am. The hotel manager was v helpful and assigned a member of staff to help with the shooting so that no one got into the way.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 2, 2017Dear Zenon Y, We are pleased that you appreciated our Hotel Danieli and have chosen it for you engagement photo shooting.
