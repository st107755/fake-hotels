Well, the Danieli is an absolute stunner of a hotel. If you're looking for opulence and elegance, your search ends here. The Danieli is literally next door to the Palazzo Ducale. The hotel is a former residence of several Doge's, and is alive with   history. Step out of the hotel, turn right and you're at the famed Bridge of Sighs. The Danieli is located in the Castello District of Venice....it just happens to be right on the boundary of San Marco, the epicentre of all things Venice. The location could not be better, unless you have rooms at the Basilica or Palazzo Ducale itself! This really is a premier hotel, in a premier location, in a premier city. Danieli was used as a location for the movie "The Tourist" (Jonny Depp, Angelina Jolie) and gets a more than favourable mentionâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: February 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
