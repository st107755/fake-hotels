My first visit to Italy and I could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Hotel Danieli.  This former palace is in the best location on the Grand Canal and steps away from St. Mark's Square.  This beautiful hotel, filled with marble and murano chandeliers, was a joy to experience.  The service too was impecable.  We had a water taxi pick us up at the hotel to make our flight home and a Danieli employee met us when we pulled up to the dock and he took care of our bags and helped us check-in at the airport!  We were pleased with the personalized service and hope to go back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
