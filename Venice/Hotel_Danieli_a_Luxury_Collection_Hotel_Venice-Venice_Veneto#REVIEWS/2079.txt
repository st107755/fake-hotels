Hotel Danieli definitely lived up to all of our expectations. My husband and I were there for New Years 2011-2012. We made reservations for the dinner in the grand ballroom and enjoyed the celebration. It was an elegant evening. We enjoyed getting dressed in black tie attire and celebrating the evening. The food was tasty and the wine/champagne pairings were excellent. There was beautiful music during dinner and festive dancing music after dinner. The best part of the night was being able to watch the fireworks from the windows in the ballroom. The hotel was grand beyond words. If you are there for the New Years, its a must to also make reservations for the brunch in the restaurant the morning of January 1st.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
