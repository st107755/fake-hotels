We have stayed here several time and the Danieli is our favourite Venetian hotel. I have only given it four stars for value because you really do pay for what you get but that is not an issue in my view. Bargain it isn't but you do get what you pay for!  We also love the Gritti (there is an old world theme here....) but keep returning to the Danieli!  Some reviews have commented about 'surly staff'; we found one or two could possibly be described as 'professional' but the moment you dealt with them and treat them as humans, their warmth and true excellence shines through! Don't forget that this place is used to very rich arrogant 'foreigners' who talk down to staff and treat them as something they trod in.  I am not a fan of sycophantic false service. We didn't get it on thisâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 1, 2014Dear Slaav, Thank you so much for taking the time to post your constructive feedback on the site following your recent stay with us which is greatly appreciated.
