A very overpriced hotel, breakfast is a complete ripoff, 53 euros. Table staff have no idea, lean across you while eating to retrieve plates etc. the service to Murano is a complete take, its all about getting you there so you will buy something. I would suggest other hotels to stay at, half the price and double the room space. Some of the staff were quite surly, i felt like i was ripped off which left a dirty taste in my mouth.Read moreDate of stay: January 20196 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Resident Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 23, 2019Dear Noel,  thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay at the Hotel Danieli.
