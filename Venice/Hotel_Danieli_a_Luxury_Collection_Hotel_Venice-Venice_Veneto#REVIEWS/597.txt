We were very velcomed in this hotel. It was great in every sense. The roof top terrace and breakfast was just incredible. The staff was very kind and overall i belive it is the best place to stay in venice. The room we had was big enough and it was a suite. It was well prepared before we arrived. Everything was clean. I recomment this hotel to families and couples as well. Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare
