This hotel is truly an eye opener.  Absolute luxury with very professional and helpful staff.  A great large Lounge in the lobby.  The drinks were probably a little expensive however they always are when staying in the best of the best hotels.  The decor was amazing.  The ambiance and the vibe were warm and relaxing. The bedroom was large.  The only downside to our stay here was the room was on the ground floor facing the canal therefor quite noisy early in the morning with the clunking of the rubbish boats etc directly under our room from quite early in the morning but I guess it's all part and parcel with Venice. Everything including the main square is just a minute or two walk from the front entrance. If you can afford to stay here make sure you do.
