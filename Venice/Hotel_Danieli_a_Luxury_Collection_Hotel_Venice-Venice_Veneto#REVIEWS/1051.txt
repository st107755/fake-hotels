I took my mum there as our last stop (4 nights) from Croatia and it turned out to be one of the BEST hotels i have had stayed so far. I travel for work and leisure often and have stayed in many big chains (Hilton/Hyatt) and some boutique hotels and Hotel Danieli has truly exceeded my expectations in every single way!  We had a nice prosecco and a very delicious cake with a candle waiting for us as we entered our room to celebrate my mum's 66th birthday!! We had a great time in the amazing property, bravo to the team for making our trip so special.   I will be back again, no doubt!Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 8, 2016Dear epingy, Thank you for visiting us at the Hotel Danieli.
