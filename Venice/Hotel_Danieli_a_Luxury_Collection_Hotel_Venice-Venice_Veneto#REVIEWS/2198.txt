So, we stayed at the Danieli because of its reputation and the room rate was hugely expensive.  The rooms were nice, but the service was distinctly average.  The hotel bar was extorionately expensive, a beer for 9 Euro, a Gin and Tonic was 18 Euro!  I had a glass of Cloudy Bay for 18 Euro (almost as much as a bottle at my local wine shop!) and the glass was tiny, three mouthfuls and it was all gone!    It was a beautiful setting and the interior was amazing, but it simply did not represent value for money.  For the half the rate, you could have paid for a suite at the very close by Best Western, with more facilities and just as good service.Read moreDate of stay: June 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 10, 2011Dear Guest, Thank you for your review of the Hotel Danieli.
