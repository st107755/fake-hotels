Stayed here with friends and was so very disappointed - found staff very rude most especially in the Terrace restaurant where we were made to fell very unwelcome. Started on arrival, reception was full of Americans checking in and the staff were lovely and took ages with each one - then came our turn. Different experience completely, we were rushed through check in  and not even given a smile or a map as the others had been given. that attitude basically continued throughout the weekend...shame as it is a lovely hotel but just do not book if you are from Europe - you will be made to fell like a second class citizen !Read moreDate of stay: August 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 28, 2014Dear fourtoone, Thank you for taking time to review our hotel on Trip Advisor. I can quite understand how frustrated you must have felt with regards to the attitude of staff at our Ristorante Terrazza and upon check-in. I am so sorry to hear that the service you experienced was not to the standard you come to expect from a hotel of our caliber, I will be sure to follow up with the team.  Again, I truly aplogize if you felt that the Front Office agent did not handle your arrival in an appropriate manner, I can assure you that this would not have been his intention, there are no differences among our guests. I sincerely hope that your mixed experiences will not deter you from choosing the Hotel Danieli for your next visit.
