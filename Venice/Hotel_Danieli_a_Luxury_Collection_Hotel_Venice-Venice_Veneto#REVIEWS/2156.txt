As axpected, a great haven in the very hot month of August, didn't want to leave our room. Wonderful interior, clean and the beds heavenly! Visited Venice for the first time for my 40th in August - the history and location of this hotel is wonderful! Staff not overly friendly but efficient and resolved small problem with special package booked in record time. Would return every time!Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 5, 2011Dear Satravellar, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
