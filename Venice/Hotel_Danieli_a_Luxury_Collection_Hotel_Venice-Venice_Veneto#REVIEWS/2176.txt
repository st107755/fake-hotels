We picked this hotel for the location which was perfect but everything else about it was over rated. It is certainly does not justify the rack price that their website quotes and over â‚¬50 for breakfast that was not worth it! Fortunately we took advice from a previous reviewer and booked a deal through hotelsclick.com so didn't feel as ripped off as we could have been! Long queues and reception to check-in and check-out (over 20 minutes) and the staff are so unfriendly and just look down their noses at you!  It is a shame as the hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location but the staff need some training in customer service.Read moreDate of stay: March 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 2, 2011Dear Yvec, Firstly thank you for taking the time share your valuable feedback.
