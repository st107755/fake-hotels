Went in for afternoon tea with the intention of possibly staying at the Danieli at a later date. After viewing all the cost cutting, ie paper towels in the loo and shabby broken toilets we changed our minds.  We ordered a pot of tea which cost a fortune and when it arrived we were given a pot of water and a teabag which we were expected to open and put in the pot ourselves. As the tea bag was not strong enough we asked for another one which we were charged Â£8 euros for.  There were no biscuits with the tea and the service was slow and unfriendly.  Do yourselves a favour and if you want to go somewhere and be treated to luxury go somewhere else!Read moreDate of stay: February 2008HelpfulShare
