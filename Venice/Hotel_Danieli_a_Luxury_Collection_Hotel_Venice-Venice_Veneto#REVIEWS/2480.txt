Worth every penny for all the comfort and convenience.  I stayed there for two nights prior to embarking on a cruise and never experienced any problems.  Water taxi service was efficent and convenient.  Check-in smooth and timely.  Room was gorgeous with all the comforts.  Especially nice experience after a long overseas journey.  Food was expensive, but then so is most everything else in Venice.  And well, the view from the rooftop terrace was amazing at any time of day.  Concierge service hospitable and accurate.  In a nutshell, I would stay here again and pay whatever they asked. Read moreDate of stay: August 2004HelpfulShare
