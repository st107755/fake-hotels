Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Danieli. The rooms were superb and the staff amazing and attentive. The hotel is spectacular and was everything we had hoped for. The position is ideal next door to the Dogeâ€™s palace. Concierge helped us significantly and went out of their way to assist us with a courier issue.  Will definitely stay again.  Thank you !Read moreDate of stay: December 2019HelpfulShare
