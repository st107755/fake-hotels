My experience in Hotel Danieli was amazing! The hotel itself is already very historical and beautiful but all the staff was beyond great. Every single of them was nice but I would like to express my special appreciation to Giulia Anastasi who was our CSM for the group. She was on top of everything and I was very impressed by her excellent service. Our group had enjoyable stay thanks to her. Also, the staff for the restaurant were very supportive. Our group had dinner there and all of 120 people were saying that the food was unbelievably amazing!! Definitely must-go hotel in Venice!!Read moreDate of stay: February 2018HelpfulShare
