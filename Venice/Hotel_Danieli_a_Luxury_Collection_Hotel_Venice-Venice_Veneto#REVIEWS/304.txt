The hotel location is excellent just a few steps from San Marco cathedral and Piazza. The historic building is beautiful with many parts built in the 14th and 17th century with beautiful art work. The hotel staff were courteous and friendly. It is quite expensive but it was a very good experienceRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
