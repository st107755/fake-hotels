First of all let me tell you that design is my passion and i HATE antique styled hotels! But but but...I decided to give the Danieli a shot as it's talked about so much. OMG was I shocked. This place is a masterpiece! It's not for backpackers and it's not for penny pinchers! This is a classy place to savor luxury at its best. It's old school and old world posh! Are the rooms dated and old? Of course they are but here it's feels good. Are the staff arrogant? Of course they are but it just feels right! Is it overly expensive? Of course it is and it's worth every penny! Splurge @ the Danieli! And if you really want to be impressed then get room 242 with the balcony!!
