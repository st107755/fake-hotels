Yes, the lobby is spectacular, and, while my wife and I would not spend what it costs to stay here (we stayed a few hundred feet away for less than half the price), we did want a late-night drink to savor the location. A pianist was wonderful, and took requests. It's not the bartender's fault that my neat shot of single malt Lagavulin was 24 Euros (!), or that my wife's Amaro was 15 Euros -- but she asked for no ice on a chilly evening, and it came with ice. No problem, said the bartender, and came back with the same drink after removing the cubes -- ice cold. Not so classy, right? Can't speak to the rooms, which I'm certain are fantastic, but a cheapskate staff attitude tells me we wouldn't like it here anyway.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 21, 2016Dear Andrew K, Thank you for your review at our Lobby Bar.
