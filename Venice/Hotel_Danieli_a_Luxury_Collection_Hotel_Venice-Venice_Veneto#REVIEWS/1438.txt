This hotel is the most amazing place. As soon as you walk in the foyer, you are struck by its beauty, with the marble staircase and the arched balconies above.

You cannot visit Venice without going to the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: April 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 2, 2015Dear yvonne l, Every day we try to provide the best service we can as we do it with our heart for guests to have mostly enjoyable and memorable experience with us.
