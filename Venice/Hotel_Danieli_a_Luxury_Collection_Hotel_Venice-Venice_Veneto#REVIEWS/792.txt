Just back from 3 nights at danieli booked by my husband as a birthday surprise . We arranged airport transfers through concierge desk -expensive but a very professional and efficient service .  We had a lagoon view room - amazing views towards grand canal . Room itself was spacious .large bathroom with all amenities .room cleaned well and lovely turn down service .there was a bottle of prosecco and a small cake waiting in the room.   We had Sunday brunch at the terrace restaurant .a great experience .food and drink excellent and views breath taking .  Breakfast had a good selection and service was good   Only slight negative was the receptionist at check out -didn't make eye contact and didn't actually speak to us   Have noticed the really good reviews all from guests staying inâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: November 20161 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 4, 2016Dear fabfun2, Thank you for choosing to stay at with us at The Hotel Danieli and We look forward to welcoming you back when you are next in Venice.
