We has an excellent stay of three nights at The Danieli Hotel, perfect position for seeing the sights. Friendly staff throughout the hotel that were happy to help with any enquiry. Super breakfast with a stunning view, one of the best around. Room was extremely and elegant, in keeping with the style of the hotel, overlooking the prison cells of The Doges Palace!.  One suggestion would be coffee/tea making facilities in the room.Downside - we found the prices in the bar very, very pricey. Overall a lovely hotel for a stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare
