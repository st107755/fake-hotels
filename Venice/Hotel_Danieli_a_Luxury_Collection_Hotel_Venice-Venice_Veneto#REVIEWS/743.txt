We stayed three nights at this beautiful hotel in July.  What a treat!  We had a large room overlooking the Grand Canal.  The staff was exceptional, friendly, and attentive.  the room had a tub and shower, and was very large by European Standards.  Even though it is pricey, I cannot recommend this lovely hotel highly enough!Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 25, 2017Dear kcinhtown, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
