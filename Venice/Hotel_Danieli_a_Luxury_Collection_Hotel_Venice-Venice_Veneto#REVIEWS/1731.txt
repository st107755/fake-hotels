Can't say enough about the staff and accomodations...we arrived a bit early and were asked to wait in the incredible lobby where we enjoyed a much appreciated apertif.  We were brought to a beautiful room, overlooking the grand canal with incredible linens and tapestries and a marble bathroom.  While not expansive, the room was more than adequately sized.  The staff made our stay magical, giving us recommendations, arranging transports to Murano and the main land.  When we return to Venice, we will return to our friends at Hotel DanieliRead moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
