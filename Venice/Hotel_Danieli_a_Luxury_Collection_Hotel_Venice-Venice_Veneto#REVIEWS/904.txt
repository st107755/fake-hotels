Two couples  celebrating their 40th (Ruby) wedding anniversary we chose this hotel because friends recommended it.  Well we were not disappointed.  As all the other reviewers mention the view from the roof top restaurant is truly fabulous!  Breakfast here has to be the best in the world!!  The staff are fantastic and were so helpful, courteous and kind.  The concierge all helped us to use the vaporetta and booked restaurants nearby which were excellent but we also ate lunch in the hotel which was delicious and I would recommend.  Its THE place to stay in Venice and it made our special anniversary very special.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare
