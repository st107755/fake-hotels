We were here for 5 nights and had a fantastic stay.  The bar is a beautiful relaxing area, the food and snacks are great. On arrival our room was a bit disappointing due to the lack of wardrobe space.  As they weren't very busy they gave us a free upgrade to a suite which was amazing! The staff are all very friendly and attentive in the bar, restaurant and reception.  Rooms are very clean.  Not a cheap hotel but for a special visit, well worth it.  The only negative comment I would make is the breakfast is served quite cold despite it being kept in warming pots.  The plates are cold which means your food is cold before you sit down to eat yet the selection and taste is great.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 22, 2016Dear  Julie B, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your feedback on TripAdvisor.
