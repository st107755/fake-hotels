We stayed the hotel Danieli during Aug 3-10 of 2017. During the stay, we had a very good quality of service in every aspect, such as house cleaning, concierge service, request and breakfast etc. We liked the interior design and decoration of the hotel and the hotel room. It is sophisticated and elegant. We also recommend to have breakfast during the stay because it will be your most unforgettable experience in your life time. Hope I will visit hotel Danieli again in the future.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
