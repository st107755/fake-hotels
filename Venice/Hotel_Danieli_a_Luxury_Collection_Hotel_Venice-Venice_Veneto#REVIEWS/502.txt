My parents and I stayed in the Hotel Danieli October 4-6, 2017.  We accidentally left two brand new purses (that we just bought three days prior) in our room when we checked out.  We reported it to the hotel and they said that no one found them.  They were not sympathetic or helpful in attempting to resolve the issue.  Security should be a priority, and we would have expected so much more from a luxury hotel.Read moreDate of stay: October 20172 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 11, 2017Dear Lindsey H, I deeply regret for the inconvenience occurred during your stay at the Hotel Danieli. I would like to emphasize  the importance we attribute to security, in our hotel it is the first time we have to face a similar situation.  As I have already mentioned  over the phone during our conversation last Monday October 9th, 2017, the Italian law does not allow us to proceed with internal investigation before we will deliver a report to the police, thatâ€™s the reason why I asked you to do so. Without an official document we cannot even claim a liability with the insurance. As agreed, once I receive copy of the report, that I hope you can send me soon even from an US office,  I will immediately transmit  the file to the local authorities and the insurance company.  I look forward to talk to you soon to clarify what was forgotten in the room since in your previous correspondence it was  mentioned  one purse only, while in this review, you are now reporting that 2 different  items are missing. Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident managerRead more
