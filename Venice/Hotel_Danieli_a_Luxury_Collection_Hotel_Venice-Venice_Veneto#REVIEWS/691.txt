The hotel itself is beautifully decorated The rooms are spacious & luxuries  The lobby is huge and unique The location is convenient The price is high but you do get what you pay for. The restaurant is on the top floor with a huge balcony with a view The restaurant offers delicious food, tried both breakfast & dinner. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: December 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 30, 2017Dear Nevahmore, We would like to thank you for taking time to write us your kind comments and for recommending us!
