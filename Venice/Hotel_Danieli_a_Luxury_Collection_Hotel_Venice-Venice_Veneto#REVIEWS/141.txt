This hotel is a legendary Venice Hotel! It is in an amazing location right by St. Mark's square. The concierge could be a bit more attentive, but the room was so nice the view was excellent and it is an historic palace. What more could you want in Venice! When we arrived they had a bottle of wine and local deserts in our room waiting, a great start to a very nice trip.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
