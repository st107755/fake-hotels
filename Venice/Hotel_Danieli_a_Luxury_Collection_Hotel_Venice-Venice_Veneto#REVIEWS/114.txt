We stayed at the hotel for our wedding in Venice in a Dandolo Suite. The hotel and suite were absolutely beautiful and exceeded my expectations in every way; however their customer service truly set them apart.   My wedding dress was lost by Lufthansa on my way to our wedding. The hotelâ€™s concierge went above and beyond their job description to help me get my dress. They knew me by name as soon as I entered the hotel, and treated me like royalty. I am forever grateful to them for their help.Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
