Stayed at the Danielli in November 2008 and it was lovely.  Nice room with good bathroom and plenty of space.  Breakfast on the rooftop restaurant is memorable because it has a wonderful view - luckily it was included in the price we paid as it is expensive otherwise.  Great location - as close to St Mark's and a main vaporetto station.  No complaints except that the prices in the bar/salon de the are so high that we went out whenever we wanted a drink or coffee.Read moreDate of stay: November 2008HelpfulShare
