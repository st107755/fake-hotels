The hotel is in a very central location and gives and the impression of ancient majesty as you enter the lobby which is luxurious. It is a good way to lure tourists in but the overall facility isn't all that shiny. Even though it was very big, my room had many issues like broken furnishing, humidity and cracks on the walls, dirt , a faulty toilet flush and a shower with low water pressure. The toilets in the conferencing area located in the basement had some signs of dirt and very old fittings as you can see In the pics.  Breakfast and bed were quite OK, but the overall experience was disappointing... Probably not worth the price you book it for..
