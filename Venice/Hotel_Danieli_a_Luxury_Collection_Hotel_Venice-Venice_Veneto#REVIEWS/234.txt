The Hotel Danieli is incredible! There service was amazing, the room was impeccable, and it was such an exciting experience to stay in a 14th century palace! They treat you like royalty here!! The food was excellent, the hotel was overall tidy, and the staff was welcoming and kind. I would definitely recommend this hotel!!!👍👍👍Read moreDate of stay: October 2018HelpfulShare
