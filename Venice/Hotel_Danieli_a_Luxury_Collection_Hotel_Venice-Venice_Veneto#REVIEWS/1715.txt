The lobby is very nice.  Knock out ornate beauty.  Can see the positive impact for a romantic visit.  However, the rooms leave something to be desired.  If you are unlucky to be on street side, it is very noisy both late night and early morning. In fact the second night, I went to sleep with my Bose noise cancelling headphones on. Also, room was fairly warm with no AC or other way to control temperature.  Had window open but that made noise issue worse.  Breakfast on the top floor is nice, but not all the food was keep warm enoughRead moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 24, 2013Dear FrankChatham, We appreciate you taking a moment to let us know about your recent experience at our property.
