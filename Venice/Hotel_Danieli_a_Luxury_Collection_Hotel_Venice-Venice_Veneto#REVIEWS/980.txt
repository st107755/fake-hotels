We stayed for 4 nights at the danieli.  The hotel itself is lovely, feels almost like a museum as you come down the stair case.  I would say the room, especially the bathroom could do with an update though.  Our room overlooked the canal at the side of the hotel and was very peaceful.  Generally service was quite good, we had a few mix ups with room service at breakfast, my wife being a coeliac and a language barrier issue led to some interesting trays being delivered. We would recommend having drinks on the terrace, you'll have a fantastic view of Venice although you will be paying for it with your drinks bill.  We also had two meals at the hotel restaurant, which was exceptional, although not a great offering for a coeliac my wife was happy having the same thing both evenings.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 14, 2016Dear AMac82, Thank you for choosing to stay at with us at The Hotel Danieli and ee look forward to welcoming you back when you are next in Venice.
