This is a great location - on the waterfront and next to the Doge's Palace! We found all the hotel staff courteous, friendly and efficient. Our room (in the Casanova building) was enormous and well furnished and we had a side view of the lagoon. The roof top terrace, where we took breakfast, is a great asset - a wonderful place to start the day particularly when the weather is warm and sunny as it was for us! We were slightly concerned having read some negative reviews on Trip Advisor but we could find no fault! We had a wonderful experience and would recommend Hotel Danieli!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 27, 2015Dear Grey_Nomad8, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
