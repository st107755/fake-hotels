Well, this place is old what can I say.  The rooms were nice, clean... but very old - plaster walls cracking, old furnishings.  Some of the lower floors are like something out of the Shining... a little creepy but fun to go and spook yourself (they keep the lights dim or off and its empty).  They gave us free bottles of wine which was nice.  The breakfast, although it costs about $70US was worth it just to sit on the Terrace as the view is unbelieable.  The location is great but I actually would have preferred it to be set back from the main drag a little.  You walk out of the hotel into a mob of 10,000+ it is a bit hectic.Read moreDate of stay: June 20061 SaveHelpfulShare
