The hotel is beginning to show its age. In need of some upkeep and renewal. Plastic plants in otherwise beautiful and historical reception area is NOT the answer. A real shame and bad taste!  Some of the Staff is sometimes a little arrogant and in need of some training and motivation although the younger members were really helpful.  Terrasse restaurant is so beautiful but where are some of the more traditional Italian dishes we come here for?  Concierge services not optimal.  Surely you can do better.

Please accept my profuse apologies for the issues you experienced during your stay with us. The issues you described were inexcusable and I cannot apologize enough for them. This is certainly not the level of service that we want our guests to leave with, and while I understand that we only have one opportunity to make a first impression, I would love for you to give us a chance to make this up to you and show a side of the Hotel Danieli that we are exceedingly proud of. I hope that you will give us this chance. Should you decide to give us another chance, please reach out to me directly and I will personally see to it that you have an amazing stay with us. I hope to hear from you soon.  Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager  Read more
