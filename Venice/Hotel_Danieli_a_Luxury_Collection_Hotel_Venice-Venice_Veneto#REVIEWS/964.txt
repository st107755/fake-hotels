I've been to Venice five times, most on day trips, but 4 years ago we stayed at the Palazzo Stern.  This time we thought we would go even better and go to the Danieli for three nights. Big mistake. Our room was at the back of the hotel and very hot. Too hot to sleep in. So the first Friday night was not at all good. The hotel did take this board and it was better on the Saturday and Sunday.  At 7am on Saturday and Sunday morning (and at 0520am on Monday) we were woken by huge crashing and banging at the back of the hotel. This sounded like recycling rubbish being collected. On the Monday it lasted from about 0520 to 0700.  So very poor sleep.  We had a small glass of wine each on the terrace (18 euros each).  Great views but you are bombarded by a flock of pigeons every minuteâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 28, 2016Dear Irvinedoc, Many thanks for recently staying with us whilst visiting Venice and also for having taken the time to provide us with your feedback.  I am disappointed to learn that we could not live up to your expectations during your recent stay with us in that you found the room too hot and noisy. I have copied our Executive Assistant Manager in charge of rooms, who will address the issue with room temperature with our Engineer. In regards to the noise, regretfully this is a public  service and even if we asked to postpone it, the Municipality refused. Please accept our apologies for having missed the opportunity to impress you and we do hope to have an opportunity to welcoming you back in the not too distant future and invite you to contact either myself at any time we can assist to ensure your complete wellbeing in travel. Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident Manager Read more
