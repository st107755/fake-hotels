A vacation in Venice, with a room in the Danieli overlooking the Lagoon and Grand Canal.  Truly spectacular.  Venice and the Danieli did not disappoint in any way.  Sure, it costs a lot, but sometimes you actually get what you pay for.  And this was one of those cases.  Our room was a luxurious haven, perched above Riva dei Schiavoni, with a patio with views across the lagoon.   I doubt there is a better room in Venice.  Dining on the terrace each morning, and once for dinner, were likewise a great experience.  Great location.... walk to your left to escape the crowds and stroll along the Venice waterfront.   Walk to your right and you are in St. Marks Square in a few steps.  And the San Zacarro vaporetto stop is directly in front.  Rooms are plush and comfortable.
