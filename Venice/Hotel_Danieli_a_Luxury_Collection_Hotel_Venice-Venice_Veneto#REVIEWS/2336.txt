This is a beautiful hotel and is so convenient to the sites of Venice.  Id would stay here again in a minute.  The staff were very helpful and always willing to help.  The lobby is jawdropping and the hallways to the rooms are very unique.  The room I stayed in was very large but seemed a bit outdated.  No duvet?!?  Wasn't the best room I have stayed in but it was far from the worst.  I would like to try a different room next time.  Id stay here again in a minute.  Food and Beverage is too expensive.  So many better choices outside the hotel and much much cheaper.Read moreDate of stay: May 2009HelpfulShare
