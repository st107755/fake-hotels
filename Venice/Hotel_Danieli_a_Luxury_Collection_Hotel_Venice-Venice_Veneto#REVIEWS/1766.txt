We stayed here during a Tauck tour of northern Italy.  It is an opulent quintessential venetian hotel.  Very expensive but in prime location for walking around Venice.  Views from restaurant balcony can't be beat.  Restaurant prices are out of sight but you're paying for the view.  Food good but not best.   All other hotel services were very good.   Room was spacious, well decorated with ample bath.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear Alan B, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli.
