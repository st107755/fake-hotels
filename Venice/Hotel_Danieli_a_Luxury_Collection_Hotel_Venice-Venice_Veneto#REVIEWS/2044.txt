An oasis in very busy Venice.  Gracious personnel.  Outstanding location--easy access to ship or airport.  Our room was bright and sunny, pristine and had marvelous views.

The Danieli surely exceeded expectations.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 8, 2012Dear Howdy35, I was very pleased to learn how much you enjoyed your stay with us and I would like to thank you for letting me know how impressed you were with the service you received.  best regards, Christophe Mercier Hotel ManagerRead more
