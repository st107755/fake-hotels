I was lucky enough to spend a weekend in one of the suites of this hotel and it was absolutely stunning. We felt like we were transported back in time. The hotel service was impeccable with the staff paying attention to every detail, we even received champagne upon arrival. The concierge was particularly good and had recommendations for the best restaurants and walking tours. It is a labyrinth of a hotel much like the city itself. Highly recommended.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 12, 2015Dear nate_dawg82, I have passed your kind words to all the team and we do hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back when your next travels will bring you to  Venice.
