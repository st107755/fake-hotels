My wife & I stayed for 3 nights at the Danieli for part of our 30th anniversary trip to Europe. The hotel was fantastic in just about every way - the management & staff could not have been more friendly & helpful & we had a lovely room overlooking the lagoon. The rooftop restaurant is truly a great place for an early evening cocktail but also try the same restaurant for dinner - it was excellent. The 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings was excellent, with generous amounts of wine and not wildly expensive, especially given the location and the view!!! Do take a water taxi if you can to/from the airport/station - it is a great way to arrive.
