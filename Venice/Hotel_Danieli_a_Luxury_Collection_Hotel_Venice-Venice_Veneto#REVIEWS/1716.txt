This hotel is a histirical monument, you can feel as you are in a movie. Historical interiors, high ceilings, woodden stairs. Everything is GREAT! The breakfast is on the top floor. It is better if you get a seat on the terrace with Venice view. A big choice of appetizers and juice on the breakfast. Very comfortable and nice hotel! Can recommend for everybody who is ready to pay the price for such high level hotel.Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 21, 2013Dear Silvie M, We appreciate you taking a moment to let us know about your recent experience at our property.
