have been to Venice before, and always wanted to go into the Danieli , but never was able to get there. However this time , my partner made sure we had a visit. We only went to the Danieli for drinks, and even though it was just a bottle of wine, it was so very special. The staff where attentive & the wine choice was superb. The actual feel of the Hotel was romantic and luxurious, meeting all the dreams I had of the hotel. it is certainly worth a visit even to do as we did, and have just a glass of wine in such a beautiful location.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear alexsmumLiverpool, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
