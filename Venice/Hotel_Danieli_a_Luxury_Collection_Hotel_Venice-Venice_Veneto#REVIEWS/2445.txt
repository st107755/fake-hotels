As you can see the hotel reviews in Venice are quite different to other places. How this comes? Yep, Venice is a different place with a different charme and attidude. If you would see Tom Cruise walking around there it wouldn't bother you that much than in any other place. Venice is a star itself, Cassanova is alive - at every corner if you wish. However, we stayed our 4th time there in the Danieli. It was the best stay so far. OK starting with the negative side - Danieli's restaurant...if your stomache is on a tomato soup for entree, just be prepared to spend EUR 25.00 (USD 30.00) for a normal serve. That's insane, istn't it? Otherwise everything else is "normal" Venice" price, i.e. EUR 50+ for a nice steak, etc. On the other hand you can dine out in places for just normalâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2005HelpfulShare
