We stayed here on a long weekend for our 25th wedding anniversary. After watching The Tourist, this was my first choice of hotel and it did not disappoint. The location was fabulous as it was overlooking the Grand Canal within walking distance to St Marks Square and Doges Palace. We took a couple of tours while there: St Marks and Doge's Palace, boat trip to Murano glass factory as well as travelling up and down the Grand Cana. We also took a night time tour of horror stories....I wouldn't recommend it if you are only there for a few days as it was a waste of an evening. Loved Venice except the prices are shocking.....Â£16 for two Lattes to give an example.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 25, 2017Dear Meena S, Thank you for having chosen the Hotel Danieli to celebrate such a special occasion!!
