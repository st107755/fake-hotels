We stayed at the Danieli for a weekend away without children. It was the second time, and it was just as amazing as the first time. You feel like you are in the 15th century, with the deco still intact and Louis XV or Marie Antoinette’s everywhere. The service is impeccable, the breakfast buffet includes Champaign etc. It is on the Piazzo St Marco, so no need to walk much. Water taxi’s stop at the hotel itself, and tourists take pictures from you coming out of the hotel ! It is a bit expensive, but really worth it !Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 5, 2013Dear JefKlak, We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed your stay and also that you appreciated the food, the professional service, the location as well as the facilities that the Hotel Danieli offers.
