I visit Venice nearly every year... One New Year's Eve I decided to spend it in Venice (trying to experience direct cities and cultures). Expecting fireworks over the Grand Canal but instead dodged firecrackers in St. Marks Sq. As for the Hotel Danieli ~ If you stay in a large suite on the Grand Canal > I assume that you would have a 5 Star experience but for the rest of us.. it's grandeur and history did not make up for the fact that I felt I was overpaying for the tiny room.Read moreDate of stay: January 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 23, 2015Dear 15ARC, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli on Tripadvisor, following your stay with us. I was disappointed to learn that your stay in the room you were allocated did not satisfy you. Our room sizes do vary, as do our rates, which vary seasonally, clearly we failed to meet your expectations in terms of value and for this we sincerely apologize. I would be delighted to speak with you personally should there be anything I can help with, or if I can assist with making any future reservations.  best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
