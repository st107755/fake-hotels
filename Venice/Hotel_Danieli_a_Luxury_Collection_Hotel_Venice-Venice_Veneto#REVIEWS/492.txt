Danieli is in an ideal location in Venice, our arrival was smooth and our room excellent. We didn't have diiner in the hotel but had a drink in the bar which was quite expensive, however snacks and mini sandwiches were complimentary, staff throughout the hotel were very pleasant and professional which you would expect in a hotel of this stature The interior is remarkable to see and could not fault our stay. Would definitely return in the future.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare
