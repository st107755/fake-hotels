We had a great stay at the Danieli. SPG gold status upgrade gave us a wonderful room, on a high floor, with a balcony and a fantastic view of the great canal. Staff very helpful. Great location next to all major sights. Breakfast was fine, omelette station very slow. Amazing view on the terrace. Would stay again.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
