The hotel room is beautifully decorated in a rustic Venetian style. The hotel’s location is excellent as well, as it is right next to St. Mark’s square, and many major Venetian landmarks are easily accessible (Doge’s palace, Basilica de San Marco, etc.) In conclusion, the hotel is wonderful and I would highly advise you to visit it.Read moreDate of stay: April 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
