You need to visit this place when in Venice, although if you blink you would miss it, looks nothing special from outside. Made famous from the Hollywood film The Tourist, we went in for a cocktail, & coffee & enjoyed the complimentary snacks & cookies. The place is quite dark inside and full of Americans. The piano player was lovely and it's a must to get the lift to the top floor and enjoy walking down the amazing steps. Lovely.
