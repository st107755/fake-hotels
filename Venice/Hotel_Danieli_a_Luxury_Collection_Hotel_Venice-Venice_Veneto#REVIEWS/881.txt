Always look forward to stay at this hotel. Very strategically located in san marco. The hotel have a very high historical value to offer, very old but very well maintained and kept. Very grand, beautiful, the staff were very nice and very attentive to our needs. The amenities were top notch, the breakfast was superb, the experience of dining at the rooftop restaurant was marvellous! Was upgraded to one of the suite room, and it was a very beautiful and cozy room! Will definitely be back!Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 1, 2016Dear Djunaedi D, It certainly sounds that you have had a wonderful time on your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli in Venice and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
