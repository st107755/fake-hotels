Along with the Gritti, one of the two legendary Venice hotels. The lobby is wonderfully tacky, like a Moorish castle mixed with Venetian elements like Murano chandeliers. The service is above par, and if you score a room on the Canal, gorgeous views. But it has clearly seen better days. Not the most elegant clientele, and the rooms are small for the steep price, even with the generous upgrade they provided. But still, one of the Top 4 hotels in Venice, after the Cipriani, the Aman and the Gritti. Read moreDate of stay: June 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
