Bit of a problem arriving at he airport, no meet and greet, but probably not a problem by the hotel. Thinking about it the man who eventually arrived had our name printed on on a sign, not something you do in seconds following my call to the concierge. No credit but hey ho. Eventual arrival to the hotel good, welcome good and trying to sort out the arrival problem good but no one accepted responsibilty. The suite helped with the lagoon view and the hotel location superb. Staff great and very friendly, concierge had booked other requests and our eventual exit via boat across the lagoon to the airport worked well.Read moreDate of stay: November 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 29, 2016Dear wardy-gb, Thank you for posting your feedback and for choosing to stay with us.
