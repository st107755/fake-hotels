This was an interesting place to stay.  The hotel is old and the layout is confusing which makes it hard to find your room after a hot day traveling, this could be improved with better directions to the room or a floor plan on each floor.  Our room was in building 2 and there was no direction on which floor it might be, so we had to check them all to find it.   We stayed for two nights, the bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent but took a while to drain away (old building so to be expected).  It is very expensive to buy a drink or food at the bar eg 27 euros for a burger and 17 for  a GNT.  We forgot any issues with the room once we enjoyed the 39 euros breakfast - which was definitely worth the money.Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 24, 2012Dear QueenBAus, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at the Hotel Danieli..
