We spent 3 days there prior to taking a cruise, The staff was sharp, accommodating and full of knowledge. If you are staying in the wing where you have to cross over the canal first, finding your room can be confusing the first time. Follow the person bringing up your luggage. The rooms are spacious and very quiet. SPEAKING OF QUIET, DON'T SLEEP IN. GET UP TO THE TERRACE RESTAURANT WHEN IT OPENS IN THE MORNING. THE VIEW ARE SOME OF THE BEST IN THE CITY.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 16, 2015Dear Pixelpanderer, Your kind comments are greatly appreciated, I was very pleased to learn how much you enjoyed your stay with us .
