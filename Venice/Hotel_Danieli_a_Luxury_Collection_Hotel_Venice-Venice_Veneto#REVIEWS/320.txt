This hotel is a beautiful, perfectly managed property. The decor is lovely, the lobby is elegant, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. However what makes it head and shoulders above the rest is THE SERVICE.  I was greeted as an expected guest, my room was ready, the connecting room for my family was ready. Brava to management and staff. Job well done. Please stay here if you visit VeniceRead moreDate of stay: August 2018HelpfulShare
