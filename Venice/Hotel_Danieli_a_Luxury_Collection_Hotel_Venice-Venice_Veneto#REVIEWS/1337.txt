While touring the Doge's Palace, we looked out the window and noticed a roof terrace across the way that seemed to be the perfect place to rest our weary feet after a long tour.  When we left the Palace, we went in search and discovered it was the beautiful Danieli ;Hotel.  Every word we can think of to describe how wonderful the terrace is seems to be some kind of cliche.  So, we have to stick to the facts.  There is no better view in Venice, right at the mouth of the Grand Canal.  The staff are beyond superb, taking wonderful care of us.  We enjoyed crisp cold prosecco and bar food, and a beautiful afternoon.  We can't wait to return for dinner.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 23, 2015Dear skyhoosier, Thank you for your review, the team and I were delighted that you enjoyed your experience at the Hotel Danieli Restaurant Terrazza and found the service that you received from the team to be good.
