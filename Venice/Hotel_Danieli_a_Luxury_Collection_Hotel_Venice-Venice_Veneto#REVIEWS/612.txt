Luxurious hotel because of its rich heritage and famous staircase plus that paranomic view from the terrace. Stayed for 2 nights. The interior is very beautifully decorated. The housekeeping is fantastic and prompt for various demands such as extra towels and hot water (no kettle allowed in venice). However there are misses too as they are pretty booked hence one of our requests was missed out (for hot water on 1 evening). When i checked out, i had to wait for 30 mins because their excellent service meant they will spend a lot more time on those before you. Those at the concierge are fairly dull and i suspect they communicate better with those who are well-heeled or well dressed. All in all, every aspect of it is 5 star, but customer service just fell a little short at 3 starsâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare
