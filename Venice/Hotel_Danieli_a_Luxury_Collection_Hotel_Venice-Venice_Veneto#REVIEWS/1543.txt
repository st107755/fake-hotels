Hotel Danieli  is beautifully  located right in the canal in the few minuets walking distance from the San Marco Plaza. It's a luxury hotel with the well trained friendly and helpful stuff. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is served in the outdoor restaurant with the wide varieties of food. We had stayed in Danieli   couple times and each time it was pleasantly memorable.Read moreDate of stay: October 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 10, 2014Dear Lubov B, Thank you for your visit to Hotel Danieli and we look forward to welcoming you back to soon.
