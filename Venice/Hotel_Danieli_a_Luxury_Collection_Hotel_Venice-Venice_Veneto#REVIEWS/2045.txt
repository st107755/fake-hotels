check in was fine, but it was all downhill from there.  The room we were given was dark and stuffy, with no view.  The air conditioning was non existent.  The positives were the location to the vaporitti, and the piano player in the evening was terrific.  the prices for coffee, water,etc. were outrageous.  The concierge was very condescending and not receptive to assisting.   I would not recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: April 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 8, 2012Dear hyman1818, We would like to take the opportunity to thank you for choosing to review the Hotel Danieli on Tripadvisor.
