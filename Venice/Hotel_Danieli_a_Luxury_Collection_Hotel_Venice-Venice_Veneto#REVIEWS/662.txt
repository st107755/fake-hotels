My partner surprised me with booking this hotel in Venice. Room given to us was facing the churches and canals. It was beautiful. Staffs were attentive. Breakfast was a spread. Housekeeping was excellent. Room was very clean. Do take time to explore around. The hotel feels like a museum. Afterall, it was owned by a noble family in the past.   Location was superb! It was a walking distance to the main attractions. We arrived via a water taxi. The water taxi stopped us at it's entrance.  Went for dinner at it's restaurant one night and the food was delicious. Enjoyed my time there. Will come back if I have the chance.
