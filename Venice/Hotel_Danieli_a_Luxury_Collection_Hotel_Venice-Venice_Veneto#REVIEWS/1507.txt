We stayed at the Danieli for two nights as part of our 12 day tour of Italy.  We loved Venice and we loved this hotel.  The hotel is lovely.  The breakfast buffet served on the the roof top deck was bountiful and the views just gorgeous. For us the location was perfect. It is situated facing the Grand Canal and yes when you step outside the front door it is a busy area but what part of Venice isn't crowded with tourists?  Our room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The Murano glass chandeliers added such a beautiful Venetian touch.  We loved this hotel and we loved Venice.Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 16, 2014Dear Travelbug0517, Thank you for your kind words with regards to the high levels of service received.
