We stayed here three nights in august. Had three rooms and traveled with kids. Two of the rooms were connecting. This hotel is nice but typical Venetian style. The rooms are quite small although the bathroom is decent size. No special touches that one may expect from a luxury hotel. Lobby is impressive but who really cares about that?? Staff was attentive and helped us retrieve a suitcase the airline lost. All in all - our stay was nice but nothing special. If the price is cheaper at any other 4/5 star hotel - save yourself the money.
