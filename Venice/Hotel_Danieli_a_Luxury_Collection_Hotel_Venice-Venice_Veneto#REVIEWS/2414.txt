After a great but EXTREMELY expensive meal upstairs in their no doubt great restaurant, I was for the first time in over 20 years physically ASSAULTED by a member of bar staff when complaining about being charged €48 for two vodkas and coke!

I wrote a letter to the general manager which was thrown in the bin I'm sure. Ironocally we were sampling the hotel for our up coming nuptials and they over €48 have lost a contract towards €10,000!
