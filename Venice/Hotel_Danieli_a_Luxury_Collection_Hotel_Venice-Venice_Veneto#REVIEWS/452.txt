When I first visited Venice in 1979, the Italians that were with me told the Danieli was the best hotel in Venice but I would never be able to afford to stay there.  38 years later I spent 3 night there and loved every minute of it. Venice really is wonderful when the cruise ships start to leave and summer is over.  What a magical place.  And the Danieli is the best place to enjoy it.  The breakfast buffet is probably the best in the world.  We loved it and who would not with the most magical view on the planet.  Staff are perfect in every way.  The hotel is perfect in every way.  I promise you that you will have a great time at the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
