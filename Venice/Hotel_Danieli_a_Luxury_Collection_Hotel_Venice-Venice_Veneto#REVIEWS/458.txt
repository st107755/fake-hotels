We stayed here on an Anniversary trip to Italy and were amazed at the views.  Unbelievable waterfront suite at the Danieli. We enjoyed watching the gondola's the zephyr's and larger boats coming by the balcony, as we had our morning coffee or afternoon wine.  The hotel is a magnificent, luxury european hotel with an amazing lobby and lounge.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
