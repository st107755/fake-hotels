This was my ninth trip to Venice, but my first stay at this hotel.  Best location right on the Grand Canal, a block or so from St. Mark's Square.  Private water taxis go straight to the hotel lobby.  Vaparetto and alilaguna water transportation right in front of the hotel.  The hotel has three parts; we were thrilled to stay in the original, 15th century Doge's home.  Richly decorated.  First class service.  Walked to your room.  Housekeeping attends to the room several times a day.  Fabulous - one of the best ever - breakfast buffets on the rooftop terrace.  Just gorgeous.  Yes, it is expensive.  But a wonderful experience.Read moreDate of stay: October 2019HelpfulShare
