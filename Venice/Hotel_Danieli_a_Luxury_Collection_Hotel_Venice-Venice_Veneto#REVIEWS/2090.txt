Walking in Danieli, it does give you kind of royal feeling because of the unique and traditional decoration. We have requested the standard room with extra bed and it was all prepared for us when we arrived.  It could be reached easily through water bus no 5.1 which stop just in front of the hotel, hence no need to arrange for hotel pick up or taxi at all. They also have their own gondola station though you could wonder around for those independent gondola around Venice too.  The room is beautifully decorated and it has a cute small dressing room, huge bath room and comfy chair and beds.  One suggestion would be the breakfast is too expensive, EUR 52 per person, and there is no package or upgrade related to include breakfast unlike other Starwood establishment that I have stayedâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare
