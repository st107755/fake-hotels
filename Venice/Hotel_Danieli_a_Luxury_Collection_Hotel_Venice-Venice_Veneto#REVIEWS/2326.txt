We just stayed for one week at the hotel, we were in the newer section, the air conditioner does not work, it was very hot, even though the temperature was turned down to the lowest level. The door key sticks, we were locked out and the hotel had to replace a plate for us to get in. The lobby is nice, the breakfast terrace is fantastic with a beautiful view of Venice, the buffet and the service was good. Overall, I'm not sure the hotel is worth the money, the decor of the room was average.Read moreDate of stay: August 2009HelpfulShare
