As Marriott lifetime Platinum Premier Elite with Ambassador status having spent 130 nights with Marriott from the beginning of the tear i expected a better service, gratitude and better allocation of benefits. None of my requests  was approved from early check in to meaningful room upgrade.  Hotel is beautiful and the lagoon view is amazing but even such beautiful view can’t compensate for the arrogance of the reception lady manager, tiny TV ( see photo) and unbalanced tap water pressure. A few years back we stayed at the Gritti Palace and still have great memories. Same chain, sane hotel class but so much different. service and attitude can’t be compared.  There is enough choice around even within Marriott group. Save yourself the aggravation and stay elsewhere.
