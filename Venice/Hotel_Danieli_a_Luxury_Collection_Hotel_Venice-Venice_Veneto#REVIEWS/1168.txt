You just cannot argue with the location of this classic Venice establishment.  Perfectly situated, the hotel offers a great starting point in order to explore Venice.   The hotel itself is older, but sufficiently updated to feel luxurious and comfortable.     One bit of advice though regarding the restaurant on the top floor .... we had a dinner reservation there that we ended up canceling because of the prices.   We traveled (in style) for two weeks in Italy, and this was by far the most expensive place we encountered.  We ate both breakfast and dinner upstairs and the food was good and we got to enjoy the view.    They really mark things up in order to get the nighttime view though.   Just go up, snap a few photos - then eat somewhere else in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 27, 2015Dear Mark M, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli.
