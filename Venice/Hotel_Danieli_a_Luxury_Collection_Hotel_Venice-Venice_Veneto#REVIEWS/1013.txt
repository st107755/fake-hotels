First night we were in a room that literally had rolling floors. We knew Danieli was a beautiful old Venetian palazzo but floors that sloped so badly with prices that were so high didn't make us too happy. We asked for a different room as we had purchased our room with upgrades, if available. The next night we were in a beautiful room with completely flat and even floors. We had a great staff person who helped us. Unfortunately she was really the only staff that was friendly and helpful. We were very surprised at the attitude of the concierges who didn't seem to care about helping out with anything. Same goes for staff in the bar on the 4th floor. We have stayed in smaller hotels before and will do so again as having friendly, helpful staff is invaluable. SPG..
