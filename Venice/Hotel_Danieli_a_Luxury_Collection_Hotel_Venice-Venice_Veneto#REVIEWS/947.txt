We made a mistake. We listened to many people who told us, "Go to Venice but only stay a couple of days, there's not much to do." Boy were they wrong. We had a great time and I took more pictures going from the train station to the hotel. We spent 3-days and two night and every minute was filled with shopping, seeing sights and local attractions. We wish we had spent a few more days in the city and at the Hotel Daniell. The hotel was top of the mark. The staff attentive and the location was perfect. Tourist came into the lobby just to look around and take pictures. And arriving by boat and being taking into the lobby right off the canal was exciting.Read moreDate of stay: June 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 12, 2016Dear Jim R, Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli.
