That is completely overpriced.  Paying for the convenience to everything. (Which it definitely is conveniently located). Although staff is very nice.. They really should give instructions when they bring you to your room.  Ex... Lights, air and shades!!   Balcony room  (even thou it was a lot higher in price) was great!  One if the only hotels we saw on the grand canal in that area that even had balconies.  Wonderful to just sit there anytime of day and people watch and take it all in!  Amazing!
