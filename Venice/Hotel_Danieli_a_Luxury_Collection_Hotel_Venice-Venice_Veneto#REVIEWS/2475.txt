I have wanted to stay at the Danieli for some time - last one on my tick list of the Cipriani, Bauer Palazzo, Gritti Palace and Monoco & Grand. Stayed here between Christmas and New Year 2004. It is true the lobby is spectacular and the lounge is also very charming in a 'faded grandeur deopping to bits kind of way'. We had to wait an age at reception whilst the miserable clerk fumbled his way around the new computer system. Our room was at least in the original palazzo though it was a bit tatty - the bathroom reminding me of a home-made addition. Staff were cordial, breakfast was satisfactory but certainly not worth 62 Euros each and the restaurant is vastly overpriced for the ambeance and the quality of the food. Much better to eat at the Londra Palace just a few Palazzi alongâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: January 2005HelpfulShare
