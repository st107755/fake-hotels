My gorgeous partner and I stayed at the fantastic Danieli Hotel for my 40th birthday in June 2010.  The hotel is amazing, like a palace!  Everything about our stay was wonderful.  The reception staff were very friendly and exceeded out expectations and showed us personally to our room!  We stayed in room 64, we had booked a delux double through Citalila, the room was massive, beatifully done and had the most enourmous bed ive ever seen!  The Terraza retaurant on the rooftop was amazing and had the best views in Venice!  The breakfasts were fantastic as was everything during our stay!!!  The location is great being 2 doors up from the Doge's palace and St Marks Square!  I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Venice as it was an experience I will never forget!Read moreDate of stay: June 2010HelpfulShare
