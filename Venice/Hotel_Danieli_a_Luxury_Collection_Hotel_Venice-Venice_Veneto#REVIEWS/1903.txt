Like another recent reviewer, I have been meaning to write this for a long time and have just gotten around to it.  The Danieli is like no other place i have ever stayed.  While I don't always travel first class, I have stayed at my share of luxury hotels over the years.  The Danieli is the finest hotel by far that I have enjoyed.  Stunning lobby, suite with a magnificent view, and cigars in the lobby bar - what more can one ask for.  The service is outstanding.  What ever we needed, they made happen.  I could go on, but suffice it to say that my next trip to Venice will include the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: December 2011HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 18, 2012Dear jrichardson122, Thank you for choosing to stay and the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your favourable review on trip advisor.
