The Danieli is a magnificent hotel with genuine old world charm and superb service . The location on the Grand Canal next door to the Doges Palace and San Marco is the best in the city. The lobby is palatial with marble columns walls and floors and is as beautiful as any palace you will visit . Our room was in Venetian style with a dressing room and marble bathroom. We just stayed one night prior to taking a Mediterranean cruise and I hope some day to return and stay several days.Read moreDate of stay: October 2012HelpfulShare
