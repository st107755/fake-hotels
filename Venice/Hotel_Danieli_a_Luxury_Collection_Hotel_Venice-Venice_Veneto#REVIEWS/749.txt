The hotel is in the heart of Venice and a few minutes away from St Marks Square and everything that Venice has to offer.  The hotel staff is very nice and helpful. The hotel lobby is amazing and it is a must to have a drink there during your stay.  I have to single out the concierge - especially Hectior - who found my phone when I had lost it!  They sent the phone back to promptly with no hassle on my end.  Thank you! The hotel lobby is amazing and it is a must to have a drink there during your stay.  The rooms are cozy but appointed very nice.Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jan 17, 2017Dear Nick L, It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback from our guest!
