If your looking for the perfect location in Venice this is it!  You can walk to everything from here!  It is literally  steps from San Marco so expect tourists and hustle right outside the hotel door.  The lobby is large and elegant and serene. Music plays from the bar nightly, I took advantage of the free lobby wifi!  The concierge also gave great recommendations for restaurants on  Via Garibaldi.  These restaurants were close by,& outside the tourist area.  Friendly, reasonably priced and delicious Italian food! Room had the most comfortable bed I was ever in!  Bathroom was all marble and huge. Nightly  turndown service guaranteed fresh soft bath sheets !Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 16, 2014Dear Lori S, I am pleased that you did find the service and location superb and deeply appreciate your feedback.
