Amazing hotel with class and price $$$ to match. Perfect location to St. Mark's Square and Basilicia and Doge Palace. Can hear some noises outside if you're a light sleeper. Amazing bed though. English speaking TV channels a plus. Staff is very nice and friendly with great customer service (unlike most Italians we have come across in other areas and restaurants).
