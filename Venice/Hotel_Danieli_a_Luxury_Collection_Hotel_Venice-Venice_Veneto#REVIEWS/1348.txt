We saved this hotel for last.  I've been to Venice before, but staying here made Venice all that much better (if that's possible).  We paid extra for a view of the Lagoon, two large french doors opening out to the lagoon and water front was like having our own private Venice.  The walls were covered in padded materials to match and a marble bath to make it perfect.  The lobby was over the top and possibly the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed, the terrace restaurant was magnificent with views stretching for miles, and the service was excellent.  The location couldn't be better, just steps from St Marcos Square.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 17, 2015Dear James W, Thank you for your comments and for staying with us.
