Greay experience at this hotel!  As soon as we checked in the front desk took us to 3 different rooms and gave us our choice of the one we preferred.  They were all a bit different but all had their own touch to them.  Great start.  The breakfast buffet was incredible.  Wow!  Let me warn you.  This place is not the typical high end hotel.  You have to remember that you are in Venice and that the hotel is old and historic.  You cannot expect the Ritz Carlton somewhere!  It's the historic feel with the touch of elegance that makes this place awesome!    I hear that they have recently expaned the hotel and remodeled it.  I can't wait to go back and see the new Danieli ExelsiorRead moreDate of stay: May 2008HelpfulShare
