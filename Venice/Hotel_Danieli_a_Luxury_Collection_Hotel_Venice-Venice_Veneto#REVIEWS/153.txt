The hotel asked 500 euros extra for our 3 hours late check out request! Incredible!!!! Overrated price/value ratio. It is not very clean... Although itâ€™s a nice hotel, I wont recommend to stay. They charge extremely high!Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 21, 2019Dear Beliz T, I am sorry to read this feedback.

We are grateful for your support and look forward to welcoming you at the Hotel Danieli in the future. best regrads, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
