It's funny to read the comments of people who have not appreciated this hotel.  I returned there last week after several years away to find it as close to perfection as ever.  Superb service; delightful public rooms; great bedroom. Why do so many people not llike it? I suspect it's that at such an expensive place, some travellers expect more extrovert, in your face luxury and obsequiousness among the staff, whereas here everything is done in the best possible taste, which means understated....which those not used to good things often interpret as reserved or even aloof.   Only one small gripe: breakfast coffee could be improved (a minor niggle it shares with its sister hotel, the Excelsior in Florence).Read moreDate of stay: August 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear Michael B, Every day we try and provide the best service we can as we do it with our heart for guests to have mostly enjoyable and memorable experience with us.
