This hotel exudes old world charm and was the perfect stay for my family during our recent trip to Venice . You must experience the buffet breakfast . It is the perfect start to the day with the terrace providing a birds eye view of the Grand canal.and the waterways .the hotel is close to all the local tourist destinations and some fantastic shops and restaurants .you must spend a few hours in the lobby and enjoy a cocktail or some drinks to capture the atmosphere of this hotel . The staff where all friendly and helpfull. Our rooms where adequate for a hotel of  this statue.  The hotel provided our family with a special experience of Venice .Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 18, 2014Dear RickX01, Thank you for taking the time to share your review with us and we look forward to seeing you again soon.
