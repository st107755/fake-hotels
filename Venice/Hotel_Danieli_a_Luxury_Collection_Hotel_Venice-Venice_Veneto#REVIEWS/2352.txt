Hotel is certainly in best location . Resturant seems to be very good , but we had very less option being strict Indian vegetarian . Service of hotel was ok not very great . Check in took us more than 30 mins , since staff was more interested to change shifts rather than attending guests . Except Conceirge and few staffs in resturant we faced lot of problem in language as English was not very common among staff  . I feel there could be better options near by .Read moreDate of stay: August 2008HelpfulShare
