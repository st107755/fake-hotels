This is the second time I have stayed in the hotel the first being in 2004 on a conference when I was disappointed by a very old tired room that simply didn't stack up against what I was paying.  Rooms have now been refurbished (or a number of them) and the makeover was excellent.  The hotel has a great location, is decent value for money, has a nice feel to it and really helpful staff.  Would definitely recommend it to others.Read moreDate of stay: December 2010HelpfulShare
