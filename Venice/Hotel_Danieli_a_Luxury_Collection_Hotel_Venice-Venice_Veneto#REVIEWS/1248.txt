Three years ago I became separated from my tour group. I stopped in to the Hotel Danieli and explained my situation to the Concierge there and he  made phone calls in my behalf to find the tour bus operators and even called our tour office back in Utah, USA to help me. He was a GODSEND to me even though we were unable to find anyone. eventually that day I linked up with my tour group but this man did something that I would never had expected and I didn't even stay at this hotel! I wish I could thank him again as I will always remember the kindness of this wonderful Italian gentleman!Read moreDate of stay: September 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 31, 2015Dear Carlos_Escondido, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
