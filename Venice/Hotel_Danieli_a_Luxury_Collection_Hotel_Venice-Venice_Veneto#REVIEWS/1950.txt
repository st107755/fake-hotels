Each morning we were blessed with breakfast on the roof top terrace overlooking the grand canal. A great way to start the day. Breakfast was always fresh and delicious. Best buffet breakfast I've ever had. The hotel is close to the main San Marco plaza which makes it convenient to find when we were lost, which was often. It is situated directly across from a main vapporetta stop making traveling around via water easy. The hotel and it's history make for a very romantic setting. Staff were very accommodating and service was excellent. Our room was clean and decorated beautifully. a perfect hotel for my first visit to Venice and Italy.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 9, 2012Dear Perthtravelbudgie, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at The Hotel Danieli in Venice.
