We stayed here for 3 nights and then at the Excelsior on the Lido for 4 nights - its like staying in a museum and you cant quite believe that you are here. Staff are incredibly helpful, historic rooms are beautiful (I believe some rooms are not quite this standard) we stayed in the main historic building and it was incredible. you arent in the hotel much - you are too busy enjoying Venice, but this place has a lovely roof terrace that overlooks the lagoon and its worth it for that alone. Get the water taxi from the Airport - makes you feel like James Bond.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 21, 2016Dear superdad69, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and I certainly hope that your future travels to Venice will bring you back to the Hotel Danieli.
