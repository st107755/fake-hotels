We really enjoyed our stay. Staff is very friendly and well trained. Had a problem with our room and immediately got offered another one. If you stay here you must get a room facing the lagoon. It might be more expensive, but its worth it all. Also, breakfast is very good and its served on the best terrace in town. So go for it!Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
