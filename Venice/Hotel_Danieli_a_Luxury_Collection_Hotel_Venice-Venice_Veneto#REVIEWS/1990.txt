We stayed at the Danieli during a brief trip to Venice. After seeing a series of mixed reviews about the hotel, decided to get the most expensive room I could afford and with a lagoon view. Highly reccomend you do this. We got a lagoon room view with a terrace. The room was very nice, breath taking view of the grand canal. The hotel is a 5 star but bear in mind that nothing in Venice is 5 star like we are used to. The hotel is a three building complex. One building newer than the other two. The more you pay, the better room you get. Our room was in the newer building. We found everything okay with the room and our stay. The bathroom was fairly good sized with the exception of the tub which was kind of narrow. We had lunch at the terrace which was very good with a fantastic viewâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 30, 2012Dear ob_speedy, We would like to thank you for your valuable and detailed report.
