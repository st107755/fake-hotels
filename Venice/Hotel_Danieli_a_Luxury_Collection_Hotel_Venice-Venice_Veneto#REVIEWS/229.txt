You can tell this hotel is special as soon as you walk into the lobby. Our room was large and very charming with a view of the canal. Concierge was very helpful and always pleasant to speak with. We found the location to be convenient and the city was easily walkable. Grab a drink in the lobby when you get back in the evening and enjoy the music!Read moreDate of stay: December 2018HelpfulShare
