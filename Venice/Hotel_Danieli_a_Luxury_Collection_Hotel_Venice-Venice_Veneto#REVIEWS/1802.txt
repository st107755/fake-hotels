i think no hotel is better located than this hotel in venice.its two minutes walk to st mark square.all good restaurants and attractions are very close to the hotel.food is expensive but good.water taxis,gondolas and water bus are opposite to the hotel.from 10 a.m to 6 p.m its very crowded around tourist areas so staying inside venice,we could move around in peace during early mornings and evenings we could move around venice in peace as most of the day  tourist leave by then.i can highly recommend this hotel.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 26, 2013Dear satinderujjain, I am delighted that you enjoyed the Hotelâ€™s amazing location in the heart of Venice, the location of our Hotel is indeed ideal for moving around the city with ease and visiting most major attractions and sights.
