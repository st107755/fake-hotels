We stayed at Hotel Danieli for 3 unforgettable days: we got an upgrade through Amex to a suite (magnificent) and ended up paying   a rather low (for Venician standards) â‚¬260 a night for 2 people with breakfast (on the stunning rooftop restaurant): worth every penny. The staff were just wonderful and helpful, the suite was perfect and the hotel is a true Doge's residence dating back to the Renaissance. The opulence is everywhere and it's conveniently located next to Piazza San Marco overlooking the Canal Grande. Make sure you ask for a room in the old part, as the newer building next door is not as charming. 10 out of 10!Read moreDate of stay: November 2008HelpfulShare
