The hotel is beautiful! Yes it's very old but I love the transitional Venetian deco! I saw some people came to this hotel for photos only (it got famous because of the hollywood movie) we took water bus costs â‚¬15 from the airport was about 1hr, its located just in front of the waterbus stop, super convenient! The room we had was quite dim and I really not fancy that red carpet but its ok cos we spent most of our time outside. In fact we were being assigned the last corridor room which is bit more spacious.  Staff are friendly and speaks good English! Free wifi provided which was a surprise! You must try the rooftop restaurant once as its amazing view of the city! Will recommend this hotel for sure!Read moreDate of stay: March 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 24, 2014Dear Kyl L, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
