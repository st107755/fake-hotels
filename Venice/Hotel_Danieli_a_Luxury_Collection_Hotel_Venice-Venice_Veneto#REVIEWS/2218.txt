Outstanding location on waterfront and adjacent to Piazza San Marco, easy access in and out.  Earnest staff but systems are still somewhat manual so things occasionally fall between the cracks. Terrazza Restaurant is expensive but outstanding views and usually attentive service. Our rooms, in the renovated wing, were very nice.Read moreDate of stay: April 2011HelpfulShare
