This hotel is extremely beautiful! The lobby is spectacular. The terrace restaurant is amazing and has the best view! The location is excellent. The only thing that I think was not up to par were the guest rooms. It felt a little small, so did the bathroom. The beds were a little uncomfortable since it was supposed to be a king bed but they were actually two twin beds pushed together. And also it was very noisy. But overall it is a very good hotel!Read moreDate of stay: May 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
