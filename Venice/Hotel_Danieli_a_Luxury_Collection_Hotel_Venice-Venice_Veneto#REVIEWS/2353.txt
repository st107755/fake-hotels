Disappointed in the rooms and service at the Danieli. We also stayed there several years ago and have been to Venice a number of times.  We were disappointed to see how the rooms had deteriorated.  Everything was very shabby.  The service was very average - the staff were not friendly and even though we were the only people checking in and it took approx 25 minutes just to give us our key. However, the foyer is spectacular and the location is very central (also noisy). For the cost, there are better options.Read moreDate of stay: March 2008HelpfulShare
