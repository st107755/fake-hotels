The hotel is insanely good. It must be one of the most beautiful hotels in the world in a perfect location. But the staff are the most charm challenged individuals you could ever imagine. Asking the concierge for a restaurant recommendation can be likened to meeting medusa. Stand back and hope the glare doesn't turn you to stone. It's just bizarre in every way. Massive massive shame, because the hotel is completely wonderful. We will definitely return there but hopefully a hotel manager that is able to manage his team will have taken over by then. My advice to the owners is to fire the current manager and recruit Johanna Vazquez from the London Dorchester. Within 48 hours and probably some redundancies it would be by far the best hotel in the world. Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
