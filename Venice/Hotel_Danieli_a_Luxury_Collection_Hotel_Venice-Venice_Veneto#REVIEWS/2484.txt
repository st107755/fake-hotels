In late April the weather in Venice was pretty good.  The Danieli is in what was once a palace and is an older building but very beautiful.  The rooms were large and well appointed and the bathrooms large also with heated towel racks; it could get a little warm in there.   The rooms were spotless.   After staying in other 5star hotels,  i thought the breakfast buffet was lacking and greatly overpriced.   However, all of Venice is pricey in the better restaurants9much more so than here in the states.   I also thought the room rates were way overpriced compare to the Sacher in Salzburg and Four seasons in Munich.      It was still a wonderful experience to stay there and the gentleman who checked me in was perfect.  the concierge was a little gruff.Read moreDate of stay: May 2004HelpfulShare
