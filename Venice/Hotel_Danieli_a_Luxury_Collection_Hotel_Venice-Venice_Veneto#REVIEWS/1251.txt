The Hotel Danieli is a "Grand Dame", that needs TLC. The public areas are posh and beautiful, but this does not flow through to the rooms.  We had two deluxe rooms that were in dire need of new carpeting, window treatments, upholstery and paint.  I was not expecting this from a 5 star hotel. The roof terrace where breakfast is served is wonderful with breathtaking views. The service there was impeccable. The wi-fi in the rooms can be sketchy.  The hotel is a landmark and is often congested with tourists looking to catch a peek of the beautiful lobby. You may have to wait in line to enter the hotel due to this congestion.  I found this to be rather bothersome. If you are looking for a more secluded hotel the Danieli may not be a good choice.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 24, 2015Dear Chrissyfour, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review as we do value feedback from our guests, even if negative, as this ensures we grow and evolve our business.
