The Danieli is the place where dreams come true. I know because many of my dreams have come true over many years. Always perfection in setting, in elegance, in the care that everyone takes with you.   The lobby is sheer poetry. I never tire of its beauty and get such pleasure just sitting having a cappuccino or a drink and enjoying being surrounded by the sheer  elegance of the place -- and which always include stunning flower displays.
