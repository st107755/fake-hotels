We stayed at the Danieli to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary.   We were collected by taxi and then private launch and arrived at the hotel in style avoiding massive queues at the airport and water taxi station.  Everything was perfect, the room, the staff, the food, the amazing place, champagne etc on arrival.  We were made to feel like film stars  the whole time.  We are already booking for a return visit after Christmas.  On Sundays the roof top restaurant has a delicious and varied multi course brunch with sparking wine throughout.  It is also available to non residents but you need to book.  The views are breathtaking.  We enjoyed the live jazz each evening and the great selection of cocktails. A very romantic place to stay.  We were both very sad to leave.Read moreDate of stay: October 2011HelpfulShare
