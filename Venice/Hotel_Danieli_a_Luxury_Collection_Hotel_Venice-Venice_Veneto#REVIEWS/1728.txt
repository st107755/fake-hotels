Stayed there two nights....amazing location, beautiful room (upgraded to a dandolo suite), great front desk service, amazing view from the terrace where breakfast is served, stunning old luxury. Overall - top notch besides one of the concierge being unfriendly/unhelpful the day we arrived....all the others were much nicer. If you want character, charm, luxury....this is your place!Read moreDate of stay: September 2013HelpfulShare
