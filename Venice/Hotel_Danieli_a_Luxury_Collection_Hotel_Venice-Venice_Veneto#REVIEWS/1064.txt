I have wanted to go to this hotel for a long time. Very close to Zaccaria vaporetto stop so very handy for connections. Very expensive but good service. The original hotel house the admin and bar area. The bar area is good for people spotting. The room was very nice, excellent bed and nice bathroom with good selection of toiletries. The blinds are electric which feels very James Bond and they shut out much of the noise from the busy area in front of the hotel. The luxury rooms with lagoon views have an amazing vista to wake up to. The breakfast on the terrace is the stuff of dreams with unparalleled views over the lagoon. Highly recommended. A treat.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 29, 2016Dear DanielI I, Thank you very much for your feedback and we are happy to learn that you had an excellent stay and that you enjoyed both your stay with us and that you found the location ideal.
