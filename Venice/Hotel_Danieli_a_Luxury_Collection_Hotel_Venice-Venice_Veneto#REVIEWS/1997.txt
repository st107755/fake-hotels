The hotel is very special, the lobby amazing and our room was beatifully decorated in venezian style with a marble bathroom and a lovely view at the lagoon. Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. The breakfast on the roof terrace amazing!! However i would not recommend to go for drinks in the afternoon or dinner up there. Whilst the service within the hotel is impecable, the waiters at the terrace in the afternoon and dinner are slow, very slow, and also not as friendly as one would expect, which can be upsetting given the higher end prices of drinks and food.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 24, 2012Dear hase1, Thank you for choosing to stay with us and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback on what appears to have been a very enjoyable stay for you.
