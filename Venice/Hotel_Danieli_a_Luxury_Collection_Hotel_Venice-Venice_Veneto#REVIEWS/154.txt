I wish there was a ZERO star option! I thought it was a nice hotel and for the price it should’ve been.  However, as we were trying to checkout this morning soap opera was filming at the hotel lobby and staircase that morning.  As were trying to leave the camera crew was telling us rudely to move out of their way and to be quiet.  Like we were an inconvenience.  Might I add that we were trying to checkout and trying to get out of their way, but there was no where to move due to a lineup at the back door.  I feel that it was very disrespectful and rude for the hotel to allow that their guests be treated like that at their site.  Due to this I would NEVER stay here again.Read moreDate of stay: May 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from HotelDanieliB, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 21, 2019Thank you Julieprang for sharing your comments and we do sincerely apologize for this morning’s events during checkout. The filming was authorized to other guests of the hotel for a very short duration in what is usually a quiet period in the lobby area. We had been assured that there would be no disturbance to our guests and that no guest would be blocked access to the staircase and lobby. We regret this was not the case and that this incident negatively affected your stay.  Please accept our renewed apologies and we hope to have the chance to welcome you back to Hotel Danieli in the future and correct this impression. Best regards, Silver Carpanese Resident ManagerRead more
