The staircase of the hotel is the most beautiful hotel staircase I ever seen!  The hotel staircase and lobby area are luxurious!  The location is the best, few steps from the water bus station and few steps from St. Mark's Square. As a photo enthusiast, the hotel is excellent for photos! We enjoyed our stay and also were able to take night photos of St. Mark's Square due to the hotel's location.  I would give it a 5 star except for the bathroom was a little bit dated. Overall, a very romantic Venetian hotel!Read moreDate of stay: July 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear xiaotianshi, Thank you for your review of the Hotel Danieli.
