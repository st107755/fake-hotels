This Hotel is as unique as the city it occupies. A must stay and experience! From the Lobby(service, staff, drinks, d√©cor)  the rooms (cleanliness, sheets, amenities, view) to the breakfast terrace views. This is as good as it gets! Yes, it's old and should stay that way. Everyone wants to modernize Hotels leave it just the way it is. It's spectacular and we can visit and experience a bit of History.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 8, 2014Dear Nina D, Thank you for taking the time to post your review of the Hotel Danieli.
