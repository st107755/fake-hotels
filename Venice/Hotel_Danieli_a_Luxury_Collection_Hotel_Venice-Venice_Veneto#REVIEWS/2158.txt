We stayed at this hotel as part of a Tauck tour, "Italian Lakes."  Because this is in an old mansion, every floor and room is different. We liked our room,which was good sized because there were 3 in my group, but others on the tour said their bathrooms were so small that they couldn't turn around in them.  The hotel is right on the ocean walk and has their own water taxi pier.  This is a HUGE plus. We saw many tourists pulling heavy suitcases through the Venice streets because their hotel didn't have a pier. The hotel  rooftop restaurant provides lovely views.  If you are willing to have a little quirkiness, this is a nice place to stay.  We like this sort of thing, but its not for everyone.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
