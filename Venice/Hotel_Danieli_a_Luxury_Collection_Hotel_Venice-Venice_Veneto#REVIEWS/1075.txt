What a hotel ! It's in the heart of Venice, just next to Palace of the Dodges. The hotel itself is a palace that belongs to a Dodge Dandalo. If you want to be part of medieval age history, you 'd stay here without any hesitation. The only problem is some rooms are just next to the prison part of the Palace of Dodges; view is not much alluring in those rooms , but decoration of the rooms is perfect and this compensates for the view there. Rooms are very clean and they are done two times a day . Restaurant  has  a superb view although food is not as delicous as one may expect from such a hotel !Read moreDate of stay: February 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 7, 2016Dear Julide B, Thank you for staying with us, we look forward to seeing you again soon.
