A beautiful hotel with the main building over 700 years old. We stayed in room 72 which overlooks the Grand Canal and is a Junior Suite. Although beautiful several items leave a bit to be desired on this trip. First, on the balcony was a glass filled with at least 40 stale old dirty brown cigarette butts that may have resided there for days, weeks or years. Surprising the maid service was so lax. Second, the recharging jack by the bedside had been cracked and broken and though mentioned to the office several times it was never fixed nor did anyone care to reply as to why. The bathroom hot water was somewhat lacking and the controls poor. Of course as anyone knows the Danieli is located in the center ring of a circus. Otherwise the hotel is all it claims to be.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 4, 2015Dear Equity007, Thank you for sharing your impressions of your recent stay. I am very disappointed to read that the room you stayed in and the service gave cause to less positive comments and as a result of this, you did not have a comfortable stay. Please accept my apologies for this. I would be pleased if we could possibly mend broken bridges on your next return to Venice and provide you with a more memorable experience, and therefore invite you to contact me directly prior to your next stay.
