We arrived by water taxi and we're greeted by the friendly reception staff . A brilliant start to our stay. Superb breakfast and be sure to get a room in the old part of the hotel, yes the tables may have scratches but they are antique!!!!  The staff were superb in helping us arrange another flight when ours was cancelled due to the air strike. Thank you so much to all at the hotel.  This is a chance to stay in a very historic one of a kind hotel, don't hesitate to go, and make sure you visit the bar when you do!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 13, 2015Dear rmp1david, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback on your experience here at The Hotel Danieli.
