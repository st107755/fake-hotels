The decision to stay at hotel danieli was the only right thing to do. We decided spontaneously to visit Venice and to stay over night. From the second we entered the hotel( wich besides is one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen. So rich in details you seem to be back in the days of old)where we were welcomed so warmly and most friendly up to the little tour we got whilst being brought up to the breathtaking beautiful room. It was a more than perfect experience! Even though we definitely stayed way to short to be able to benefit of all the outstanding services and restaurants offered in this hotel, having breakfast on the terrace with a view beyond belief was that precious with all the friendly staff around that we, by then, really felt sorry to leave. Thank you so…Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 17, 2015Dear Minismi, Such a pleasure to read your “fantastic” review, thank you for choosing the Hotel Danieli  for your recent trip to Venice To know that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from our location to the ambience and style of our Hotel and your room and most importantly the service you received from my team, is simply music to my ears and I am so grateful that you took the time to tell us and others about your experience at the Hotel Danieli.
