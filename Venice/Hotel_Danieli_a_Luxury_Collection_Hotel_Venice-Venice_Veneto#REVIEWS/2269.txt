We came to Venice and had reservations at another hotel. (Rialto)  My family and friend walked into the Rialto and immediately knew that the accommodations were less than what the brochure explained.  Although on the surface, the hotel appeared clean it was dirty, especially the gray, stained mattress.  A one night stay was enough, and that's how we came to the Danieli.  Just pulling up to the entrance in the motor taxi needed no other words to describe the cleanliness, service and excellent quality of the hotel.  It just takes the entrance of an establishment to create the tone and climate one will encounter.Read moreDate of stay: August 2010HelpfulShare
