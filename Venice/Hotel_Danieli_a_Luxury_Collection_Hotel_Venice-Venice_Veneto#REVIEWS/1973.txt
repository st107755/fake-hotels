We returned to the Danieli after 17 years; it is where my wife and I got engaged. Not much has changed. My three young children enjoyed the lavish Venitian style palace, and the rooms had been minimally updated. The problem with the hotel is the lobby. Every tourist in Venice, and that is a lot, comes in through the front doors to take pictures. It makes for a very non private feeling upon return. I was surprised by the quality of food, both rooftop and room service. Overall, Venice is a tourist trap, and I am not quite sure you can avoid it without staying at one of the surrounding islands.
