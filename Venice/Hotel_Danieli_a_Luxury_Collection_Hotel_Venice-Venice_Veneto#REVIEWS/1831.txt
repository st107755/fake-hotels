I was a little nervous because of the bad reviews, but couldn't resist staying in this well-known hotel. I didn't find any of the problems that others have mentioned (well, except the breakfast is super expensive). I'm sure we had the least expensive of rooms, a double room on the top floor of the newer section. The room was beautiful, clean, and I enjoyed the view of the rooftops and off to the right, the bay. The service was perfect and friendly. I watched the front desk deal with some amazingly rude and demanding clientele very professionally. The concierge gave us fantastic directions. One day in particular we had a 3 hour window, and he gave us the perfect walking tour and directions. On top of all that, the location couldn't be beat.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 20, 2013Dear PeacefulSerenity, Thank you for your review, the team and I were delighted that you enjoyed the stay and found the service that you received from the team to be good.
