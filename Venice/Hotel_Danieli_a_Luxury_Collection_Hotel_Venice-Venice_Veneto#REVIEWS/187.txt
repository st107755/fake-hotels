This must have been the best hotel we stayed at in Italy. The rooms were beutifully decorated and cosy and the food we had there was one of the best we tried throughout our stay. We met the general manager who was very courteous and polite, genuinly interested in our experience. Despite being very busy and touristy, Venice preserved its charm beautifully.Read moreDate of stay: July 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
