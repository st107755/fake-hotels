We stayed 3 nights in early October. The building is incredible and the staff treated us like royalty. We we reluctant guests due to the cost but in the end the experience was well worth the price. The location on the water near San Marco made it that much better. Our only regret was that we had to leave too early the last morning to enjoy another breakfast on the terrace. The place does have some quirks but. They added to the charm, the floor in our room sloped about two inches in 11 feet. If you weren't careful you'd lose your balance.Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 14, 2015Dear R1687EXtim, Thank you for your recent review of our hotel.
