We stayed here February 6-11th and had a wonderful time.  The hotel is elegant, in a perfect location to all attractions, the staff very friendly and helpful.  Yes, as noted in prior reviews eating and drinking here is very expensive, but you can work around this as there are so many other places to go in close proximity.  All in all, we loved Venice and would definitely stay here again in the future.Read moreDate of stay: February 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 13, 2014Dear DebbieKirby, Thank you again for your feedback and we do hope that you will continue to make many more enjoyable visits to the Hotel Danieli and Starwood Hotels & Resorts.
