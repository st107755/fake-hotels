The hotel foyer, bar, and staircase are breathtaking. As are the prices of drinks and breakfast.   We managed to get a great flight + hotel deal so - for us - the Danieli seemed like a bargain.   Our room was huge with a walk in wardrobe, twin showers, beautiful marble bathroom, and Murano glass chandelier.  It did look a little faded in places. Rather like a beauty queen in her forties. Clearly, our special deal didn't merit a luxury suite or a canal view. That said: the privilege of enjoying this remarkable destination, with its incredible terrace view and location, made it worthwhile. Mind you: 10 euros for a coffee? and another 8 to bring it to your room? I guess that's Venice for ya... Fleecing tourists since the Crusades... Go visit, if the price is right....Read moreDate of stay: February 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 5, 2013Dear NorwichBeachbum, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your experience.
