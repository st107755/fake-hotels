My mum and I stayed here for 1 night in May whilst visiting various cities in Italy. I booked here as her birthday treat and it was worth the money. We had a room which wasn't part of the original hotel, and on entering I was a little disappointed, but then we noticed the sitting area and second bathroom. The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We had a meal in the restaurant that evening and the food was delicious. We had to eat in side as there was a cool breeze blowing which would have made the evening uncomfortable. The restaurant manager was a lovely young man, very attentive and helpful.
