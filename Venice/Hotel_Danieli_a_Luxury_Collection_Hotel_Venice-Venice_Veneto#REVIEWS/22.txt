We stayed at the beautiful hotel Danielli for 4 nights(Nov.6-10) prior to a Mediterrean/Greek Isles cruise! The hotel is beautiful! We stayed in the Dandolo Suite in the original building! This hotel radiates old world charm! I would especially like to thank Lucca and Giula at the front desk  for making our stay wonderful. The entire staff was so polite.! The location on St Mark's Square was awesome.  We will definately return!Read moreDate of stay: November 2019HelpfulShare
