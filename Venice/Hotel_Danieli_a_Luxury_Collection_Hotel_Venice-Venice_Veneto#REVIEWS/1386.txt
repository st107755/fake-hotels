Arriving - you suddenly realise your are in for a really special time. If you are lucky enough to have a room overlooking the Grand Canal you are in for a visual treat, which you will take away with you probably forever. A drink on the ground level bar will excite you as the carnival revellers celebrate.. Try to go to a fancy dress ball - it's mind blowing. Meals and quieter drinks on the top floor are so special, be it inside or on the wonderful roof terrace. The concierge desk ranks as one of the best in the world in my opinion. They are incredibly helpful. This is a fabulous experience- it will cost! But you will love it. It's an oasis in this chaotic, romantic and Xciting City......luv's itRead moreDate of stay: February 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 15, 2015Dear Simon C, Thank you for your visit to Hotel Danieli, we look forward to welcoming you back to soon.
