Funds permitting there are a handful of hotels one should have visited during one's lifetime. They include, among others, the Strand in Rangoon, the Peninsular in Hong Kong, the Oriental in Bangkok and the Danieli in Venice. Factoring in location, food, service and architecture there are no doubt many good hotels but none better. The staff has, if anything, more poise than many of the guests and are you can count on the concierge to reserve theater tickets or to point you in the direction of a good restaurant. The food is outstanding and a meal on the hotel's terrace is an aesthetic experience. Coming down to earth, is it good value for money / It all depends how much money you have and the value you attribute to it.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 8, 2015Dear Alessandro C, I hope we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future.
