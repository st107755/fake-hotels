I have enjoyed the Danieli Bar in the past.  We were staying with friends in an apartment not too far from the hotel.  I wanted to take our room mates and my wife for one drink here.  The splendor of the lobby and contiguous bar are a treat.  Carved Veronese marble is the material for columns and parts of the walls. Two Bellinis and two cocktails cost $72. plus tip.  It ain't cheap, but it's fun. The quiet atmosphere and pleasant service were a treat.  The bartender/waiter treated us as guests even though, on a rainy day, we were not dressed in our Sunday best.  That's class.  I think it always helps if you speak or try to speak some Italian.
