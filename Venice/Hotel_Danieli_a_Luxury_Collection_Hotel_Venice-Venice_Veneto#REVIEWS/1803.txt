I went to the Hotel Danieli for a long week-end and I did love this place. First of all the location is amazin, very central, close to San Marco. The common area are beautiful and spectacular. The roof terrace restaurant amazing - we only went for breakfast and it was phenomenal. Fantastic view and great food.  The room - I personally really liked it - if you want something new and minimal this is not the place for you. Some of the rooms are older with old bathrooms, but this was good for me as I liked the fact that this is an ancient building and I don't realy like te idea of everything modernized. Bed was very comfortable and service is good.  There is a newer wing with refurbished rooms and I have seen those too - and those are newly refurbished and very opulent.
