Spent one night at the Hotel prior to Mediterranean cruise that started in Venice.  The hotel was beautiful in the traditional Venetian sense and one could not ask for more in terms of location.  My husband and I spent the night experiencing the magic of Venice strolling around San Marco square , shopping and relaxing.  The staff was courteous and accommodating.  The room lovely.  We were just sad that we were only able to spend the one night!Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 30, 2016Dear mfcuan, I was pleased to read that you enjoyed your stay with us as well as the Hotelâ€™s perfect location within the heart of Venice and look forward to welcoming you back very soon!
