We stayed at the Hotel Danielli for 4 nights and we were incredibly impressed with the service and quality of our room.  We appreciated it's old world grandeur, but they've done a decent job at keeping the original style and quirks with the addition of modern features. We slept extremely well (we've found that Marriott mattresses are always excellent), and our bathroom was very luxurious. The breakfast buffet was delicious, with attentive servers and room service was courteous and speedy.  All in all, a very enjoyable stay.Read moreDate of stay: May 20192 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
