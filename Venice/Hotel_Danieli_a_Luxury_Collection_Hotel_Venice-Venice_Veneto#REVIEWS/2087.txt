This hotel was originally the home of the Doge of Venice and you can tell by the splendor the moment you walk in.  It is absolutely beautiful and a 2minute walk from Piazza San Marco.  Rooms are large, beautifully decorated, and have all the amenities including a real blow dryer. The staff was delightfully helpful and genuinely happy to have us.  Even if you choose not to stay here you must at least have tea or a spritz in the lobby while you have a rest. It's wonderful!!! We were able to get a double room for $290 on Expedia. Great deal!!!Read moreDate of stay: January 2012HelpfulShare
