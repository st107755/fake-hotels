The room was standard SPG fair. Tons of staff, great room, wonderful bed, mini-bar, robes, turn down service, in hotel restaurant, etc.  The experience would have been wonderful but for the staff questioning my partner and I or giving weird looks upon returning.  We are a gay couple.  I am black and he is Filipino.  The most aggregious encounter with security happened when we were followed, questioned if we were guests and then followed to our room.  If you're old and white, I suspect you'll have a wonderful time.  If you're anything else, stay at your own risk.  I'll never pay that rate a night to be treated like a homeless person looking for change.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Direttore at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 17, 2015Dear taisho89, Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback.
