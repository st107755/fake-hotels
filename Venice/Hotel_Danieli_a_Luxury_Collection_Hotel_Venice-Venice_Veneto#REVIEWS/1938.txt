This review is a little late. We stayed at the hotel from September 1 to 4. We were assigned a wonderful room overlooking the lagoon with a wonderful view. The room was in the renovated wing.  I strongly recommend breakfast on the terrace. The view is outstanding and quality of food excellent.  The staff and service was excellent.   The location is right beside St. Mark's Square.  We will definitely return and want to thank hotel and staff for a wonderful say.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 22, 2012Dear Harry F, Thank you for choosing The Hotel Danieli for your visit to Venice, it was a pleasure to have you stay with us.
