I stayed here 15 years ago but this was for business. This time we only visited the beautiful lounge and bar area and little has changed. The service was excellent the vodka martini perfectly made and our sandwich selection worthy of an Oscar. Friendly,discrete and efficient staff made our visit most memorable. Totally expensive but worth a visit to absorb the sheer opulence that is The Danieli. Shame we couldn't afford to stay here this time but one has to cut one's cloth and I'll review where we did stay shortly.Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
