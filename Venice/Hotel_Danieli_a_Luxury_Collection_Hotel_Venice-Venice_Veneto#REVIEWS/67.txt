Stayed with my fiancee for three nights. The hotel staff and general manager treated us like royalty and upgraded our room based on Marriott loyalty. Could not have been treated better and the room was an experience all to itself. Our suite was in the oldest part of the hotel built in the late 1300's.  Every item in the room seemed to tell its own story. Our stay will be in our memories forever. Great morning breakfast location on the roof facing the water.Read moreDate of stay: September 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
