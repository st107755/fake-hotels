The location is the best advantage of this hotel. It has also a nice restaurant with a great view but you don't need to stay in the hotel to go there! The room was very small (317). The worst part is the staff, you feel like they were doing you a favor and that the hotel is better than you... I left Venice and went to the Four Seasons at Florence, the price is almost the same but you can definitely see the difference of treatment, it's the opposite! Danieli should train their staff in a different way... I'm very disappointed!
