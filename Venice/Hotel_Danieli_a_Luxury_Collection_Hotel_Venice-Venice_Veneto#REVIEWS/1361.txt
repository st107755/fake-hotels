A beautiful hotel. The entrance and lobby are really exceptional. Staff is very friendly. Prices are very high, what you can expect on a top location in Venice. Still I find the room overpriced. A bit to basic, quite a small bathroom, definitely some refurbishment is required. Wifi is poor quality, and we got it for free but is not the standard. (for this price not standard for free???). Breakfast is very good. Excellent quality. Only the last morning we were served on top level at breakfast. Staff on the other 2 days was slow and not attentive. Again for this proce 5 stars should be the minimum, so 4 is actually under par.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 4, 2015Dear Willem G, Firstly I would like to begin by thanking you for taking the time to write a review.I was disappointed to read that you were dissatisfied with your room and found it small and too basic.
