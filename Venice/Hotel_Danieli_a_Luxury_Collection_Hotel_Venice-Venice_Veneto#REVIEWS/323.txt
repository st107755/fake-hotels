I stayed at the Danieli for one week in an amazing suite. The room was clean, direct view to the canals and the open sea. The welcoming was very friendly, and quick. It has a stunning entrance hall with a bar and the stairwais are unbelievable, some kind of magic with all itâ€™s decorations and the art on the walls. There are two restaurants in the hotel. On of it is a bit more expensive and has a rooftop terrace with a 180 degree view. The other restaurant is just next to it and the food there is just perfect as well! I can really recommend this place!  To the piazza di san marco it only takes you 2 minutes to walk as is it right around the corner.Read moreDate of stay: November 2017HelpfulShare
