The Danieli blew us away. We were able to stay here for two nights with the help of points, and we even got an upgrade to a room with a view. Every inch of this hotel is beautiful Venetian history. We truly felt like we were staying in a palazzo bedroom, and the bed was actually more comfortable than I had expected.The service was impeccable. The concierge and front desk were welcoming and professional. Upon our departure the concierge had a water taxi come straight up to the canal door, perfectly on time and coordinated.   The only negative I could see was the noise from squeaky floorboards above and from the street, but I'm a light sleeper and travel with earplugs, anyway, so it didn't bother me.Read moreDate of stay: October 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 13, 2014Dear Jennifer B, Thank you for favorable review.
