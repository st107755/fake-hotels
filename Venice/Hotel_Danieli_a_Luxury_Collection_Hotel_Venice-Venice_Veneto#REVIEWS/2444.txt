I have just returned from a very disappointing trip to the Danielli.  The staff were very rude. the porters were very lazy. The rooms are poorly maintained, with knocks and chips on all walls and surfaces.  The hotel corridors are dirty and dark.  When these faults were pointed out to the management, we were told all busy hotels are like that, and that our standards were too high.  When we had taken photographs of the offending mistakes, we were threated by the manager.  The photographs and a report of the incident have been sent to Westin headoffice.  This seemed to infuriate the hotel manager further, who seemed more concerned with his own job than with our expensive and ruined trip.  The city has such beauty and charm - stay at a hotel where you feel welcome and comfortable. â€¦Read moreHelpfulShare
