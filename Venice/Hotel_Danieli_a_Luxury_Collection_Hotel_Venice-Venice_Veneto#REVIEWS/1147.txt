We stayed at this hotel for two nights after our cruise from Rome.  The location of the hotel is great and is right next to the St. Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco), just after the bridge that over looking the Bridge of Sighs.  It's right by the Grand Canal and is very convenient for sight seeing and shopping.  The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and the staffs are very friendly and helpful.  We loved the rooftop restaurant which overlook the canal and the busy street Riva degli Schiavoni.  Nice view of the canal!   We had breakfast and dinner at the restaurant and the food was wonderful.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 10, 2015Dear Steve L, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay and had the time to experience some of the exciting sights and places in the vicinity.
