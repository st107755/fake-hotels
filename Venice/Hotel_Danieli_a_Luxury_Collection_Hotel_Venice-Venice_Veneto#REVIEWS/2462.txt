Great hotel in a great location.  The lobby is beautiful as is the entire hotel.  Room was large with a view of canal and rooftops, could see gondoliers right below.  The bathrooms were great, bed comfortable and overall a wonderful place to stay, although expensive.  Breakfast in the roof top restaurant is a must do, again expensive, but worth it.  Would definitely stay here again.Read moreHelpfulShare
