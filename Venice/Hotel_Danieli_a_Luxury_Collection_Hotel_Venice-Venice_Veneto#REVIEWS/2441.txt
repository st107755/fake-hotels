We spent a few miserable nights at the Danieli while stopping through Venice. The hotel was horrible! The complaints could go on forever, needless to say this was by far the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed at! The staff was rude and unaccommodating, especially at Terrace restaurant which was extremely over priced to begin with. We were stuck in a smoking room when we requested a nonsmoking room. The receptionist claimed that it was a nonsmoking room, but there were two ashtrays in it, it stunk of smoke, and had two burns on the carpet along with numerous other stains. The room stunk, and the plumbing was horrible, our tub would back up, YUCK! The hotel is very poorly managed and disorderly. I can't believe this is a Starwood luxury hotel? The only nice thing I can say about itâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: June 2006HelpfulShare
