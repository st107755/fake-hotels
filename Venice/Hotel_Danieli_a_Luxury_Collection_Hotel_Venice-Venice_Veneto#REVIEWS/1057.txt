This is one of the best hotels we have ever visited  - the location, architecture of the main hotel, the history, the staff, the rooms, the food and the service all work seamlessly to give an air of luxury and timelessness. On top of that there are the views from the terrace at breakfast and the views from our rooms onto the end of the Grand Canal and the Lido and Giudeca. This is one to which we will return.Read moreDate of stay: March 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Mar 30, 2016Dear keirach, Such a pleasure to read your “fantastic” review, thank you for choosing the Hotel Danieli for your recent trip to Venice To know that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from our location to the ambience and style of our Hotel and your room and most importantly the service you received from my team, is simply music to my ears and I am so grateful that you took the time to tell us and others about your experience at the Hotel Danieli.
