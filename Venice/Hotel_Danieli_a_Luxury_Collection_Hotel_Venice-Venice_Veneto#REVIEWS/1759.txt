The magic Venetian palazzo overlooking the lagoon and San Giorgio Maggiore. Beautiful interiors, perfect location just few steps from San Marco, good service. The Terrace restaurant gives one of the best views of Venice. The standard rooms may a bit disappoint you but it is fully compensated by the atmosphere.  The higher class rooms are very good taking in consideration the age of buildings. Strongly recommended to get a feeling of the city.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Sep 3, 2013Dear ElainaKh, Thank you for choosing to stay with us and I would like to thank you for sharing your feedback on what appears to have been a very enjoyable stay for you.
