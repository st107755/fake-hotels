The hotel was extremely charming.   I thought the location was perfect and the breakfast was better than I could have asked for.  We were given a junior suite that had a bedroom, a sitting room and two bathrooms.   I didn't have any real complaints about the hotel, but I think that what I found was that they didn't seem really interested in their guests.   The view from their balcony for breakfast was such a great way to start the day.Read moreDate of stay: August 2011HelpfulShare
