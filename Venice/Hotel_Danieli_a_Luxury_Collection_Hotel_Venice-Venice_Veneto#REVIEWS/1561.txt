I've stayed here on numerous occasions for business but find myself sneaking back as one of my excuses to return to Venice.  It isn't cheap but if you want to escape back into another time, the effect that Venice itself has on many, this is the place to be.  The Danieli was built at the end of the 14th century as a private residence.  The place surely takes you back to that time.  I like the private gondola entrance it has on the side; a real treat if coming in from the rail station. This place is unforgettable and should you want an extremely memorable escape, you have to experience this place.  Extensive scenes from the movie, "The Tourist", were filmed here if you want to get a preview.Read moreDate of stay: May 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Aug 18, 2014Dear Burghbear, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for choosing to review The Hotel Danieli on Tripadvisor.
