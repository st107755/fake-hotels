We went to the hotel as the first leg of our Italian honeymoon.  The location is wonderful and the staff at the hotel is terrific.

We took the water taxi from the airport which was expensive but worth it!Read moreDate of stay: March 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 2, 2012Dear traveler0605, Thank you for your review, the team and I were delighted that you enjoyed the stay and found the service that you received from the team to be good.
