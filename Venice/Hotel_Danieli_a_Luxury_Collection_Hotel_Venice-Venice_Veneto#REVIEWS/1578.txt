The third stop on our 17-day European vacation (with two teenagers) brought us to the Danieli in Venice.  What an awesome property.  We had two rooms with balconies that faced the lagoon and had a two-minute walk to Mark's Square.  We loved the staff, particularly the concierge gentlemen, and I would highly recommend a private water taxi from the airport practically right to the front desk!  Overall, it was as nice as we anticipated.  We usually set a high bar, and The Danieli met or exceeded all of our expectations.Read moreDate of stay: July 2014HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 30, 2014Dear ForrySmith, We appreciate you taking a moment to let us know about your recent experience at our property.
