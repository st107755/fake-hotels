We stayed at the Danieli in early September and had the time of our lives.  We had what I believe was a Classic Superior room.  We resided in the main building.  The room was beautifully appointed and very spacious. The bathroom was very large with marble everywhere.  For us, the service was very good.  The concierge was always eager to lend a hand.  The rest of the staff were also very nice as well.  The hotel itself is like staying in a museum and is elegant beyond compare.  The location is simply perfect....A short walk away from San Marco square. THE VIEWS from the rooftop bar/restaurant are the BEST VENICE HAS TO OFFER.  Our stay at  the Danieli was very special and was a time we will always cherish.Read moreDate of stay: September 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Oct 1, 2015Dear Mike1indy, Thank you very much for your feedback and we are happy to learn that you had an excellent stay and that you enjoyed both your stay with us and that you found the location ideal.
