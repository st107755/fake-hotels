Our luxury room had a fantastic view of the lagoon; it was very quiet too, despite crowds below and the boats arriving outside; the hotel itself is glorious in the interior parts; service was generally of a high standard, always pleasant and attentive; breakfast was excellent (though see another review of the disappointing dining one evening); and so we had a great stay. But for the price (and OK, Venice is expensive anyway) I'd have expected a better fitted room and certainly a better bathroom - no walk-in shower, slippery bathtub, only OK toiletries. Would we go back? Probably yes, and if you feel like splashing out on a kind of landmark place, it's a good option.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear JeffStranks, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your observations from your last visit with us.
