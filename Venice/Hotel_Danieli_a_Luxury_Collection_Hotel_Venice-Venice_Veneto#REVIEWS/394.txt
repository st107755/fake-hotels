Probably the best hotel we've stayed in.   Right on the canal and gorgeous.  Treat yourself and take a water taxi to the side door.  Three staff met us, grabbed the bags and escorted us inside.  Wonderful room.   Quiet.  A real treat.  Glad our travel agent picked this one for us.  Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
