Fantastic character, excellent hotel which appears to be split over three buildings (not that you would know it). Really enjoyed our stay. Tip: When you book this hotel, try and book the terrace restaurant as the restaurant is busy. Terrace restaurant doubles up for breakfast and the view is truly spectacular, especially since none the other hotels appears to have a roof terrace.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded May 20, 2015Dear A P, Thank you very much for taking the time to write your positive experience.
