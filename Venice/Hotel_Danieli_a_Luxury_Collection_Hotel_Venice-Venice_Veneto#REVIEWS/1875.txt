The Danieli remains one of the most celebrated hotels in Europe, and it is a wonderful experience to stay here.  Experiencing the passion of the staff, the beauty of the decor, the breathtaking, overpowering entrance hall, reminding you of the Palace it has been takes you into another world.  It is worth it to be pampered here.  We had a 180 degree view from our suite of the Grand Canal, and were treated like celebrities.  This is a landmark in Venice, and part of the heritage of this marvel in the Veneto.  Will stay here again and again.  What an experience!  You are hidden from the maddening crowd, there is a tranquil atmosphere and although it is big, it is still very personal.  Loved every minute.Read moreDate of stay: September 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 11, 2013Dear MICZ, On behalf of the Management team at The Hotel Danieli, we would like to thank you for completing your review on TripAdvisor.
