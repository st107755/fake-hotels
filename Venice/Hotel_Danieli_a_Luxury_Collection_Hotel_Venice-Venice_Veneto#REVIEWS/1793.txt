A very fine hotel by European standards, originally a high ceilinged palazzo with a incredibly beautiful lobby and the location is outstanding, right next to the Grand Canal close to St. Marks Square with direct access to a water taxi landing. We had a very beautiful guest room, very finely decorated including a walk-in closet and marble tiled bathroom. Pricey, especially the food and beverage. A drink in the lobby is $25, and they charge for WiFi in the rooms (not the lobby), which I thought rude considering the price of the room, but they only have about 60 guest rooms and an immense staff, so I can understand how they need to make their money somehow. Definitely worth the price if you can afford it.Read moreDate of stay: June 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 18, 2013Dear jtima, Thank you for choosing to stay at with us at The Hotel Danieli and we look forward to welcoming you back when you are next in Venice.
