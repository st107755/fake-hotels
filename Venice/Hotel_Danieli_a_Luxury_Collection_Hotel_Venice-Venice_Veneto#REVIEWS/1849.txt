The hotel Danieli is one of the best hotels I have ever experienced. The Venetian architecture is outstanding and the location is perfect for all of Venice. The room keys are classic and you always meet very interesting people. We were there During the Venice film festival. Don't miss a day trip out to Lido. It is wonderful. You will not be disappointed in the Danieli.Read moreDate of stay: August 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Apr 3, 2013Dear tgdelb, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay and had the time to experience some of the exciting sights and places in the vicinity.
