I had the pleasure to stay at the Danieli in 2010... for a couple of days. Great memories, historical location, very nice hotel staff... My (our) personal taste is to stay within the old buidling...and a room on the side canal. Do not hesitate to take your breakfast on the roof garden... Great view and amazing feelings to see such beautiful city waking up... Slowly, peacefully...(maybe aroun 07:30am... Not 09:00am went all the tourists are getting in, on loaded vaporettos and running toward the Piazza San Marco). Enjoy your stay...Read moreDate of stay: July 2012HelpfulShare
