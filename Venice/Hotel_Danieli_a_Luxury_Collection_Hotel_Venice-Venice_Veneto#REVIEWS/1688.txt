We stayed in this hotel some time ago and the review is long overdue. Where do I begin, from the second you arrive until the time you leave you are well taken care off. The staff do everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The concierge especially helpful with bookings for restaurants or excursions.   The hotel itself is one of the most romantic in the world. The decor is magnificent and rooms decorated to a high standard with excellent amenities. The restaurants in the hotel itself serve delicious cuisine and great cocktails. Excellent for a romantic stay.Read moreDate of stay: January 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Dec 9, 2013Dear SecoyaGB, Thank you for giving us the opportunity to take care of you on your recent visit to The Hotel Danieli and for trying The Hotel Danieli and I am delighted that we met with your expectations and you felt that it was the perfect hotel choice.
