We stayed at the Danieli as part of a Tauck tour and I must say I was less than impressed.  We were not able to have breakfast on the terrace as a Russian group were there, enjoying oysters and champagne.  The place was like a rabbit warren, some of it very dilapidated, and when we wanted to leave our luggage overnight they refused to help us in this regard.  We won't be back.Read moreDate of stay: May 2012HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 7, 2012Dear BepeAustralia, Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hotel Danieli.
