We booked into this hotel for our final 2 nights in Italy. Our fourth trip to Venice and this hotel has certainly made it the best.

We have had an experience that will never be forgotten - thank you Danieli!Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 4, 2016Dear Vicki R, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Hotel Danieli and for taking the time to post your feedback on TripAdvisor.
