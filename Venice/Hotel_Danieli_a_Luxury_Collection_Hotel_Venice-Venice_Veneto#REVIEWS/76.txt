Spectacular hotel in what is likely one of the premiere locations in Venice.  We were treated well and our room was upgraded as Marriott Platinum Elite guests. Only downside is the cost of everything associated with this hotel, which is also rather spectacular. Would I revisit this hotel on my next visit to Venice - probably not.  A must see, even if you are not staying at the hotel, is the lobby which is absolutely extraordinary.Read moreDate of stay: June 20191 Helpful voteHelpfulShare
