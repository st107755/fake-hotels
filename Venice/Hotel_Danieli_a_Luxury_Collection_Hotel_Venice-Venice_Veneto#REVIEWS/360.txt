Run don't walk away from this hotel. Rooms are old and dark. Keys difficult to use and AC very poor. Best part is the view from breakfast but the hotel is NOT worth the price they charge. We were really excited to stay there but we were much more excited to leave.  We had two rooms one booked with AMEX points. Two or three times they told me I'd used Expedia.Read moreDate of stay: June 20181 Helpful voteHelpfulShare Response from Hotel Danieli B, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jun 7, 2018Dear Mk46127, Thank you for taking the time to share with us your observations from your last visit with us Needless to say, I am disappointed to learn that you did not enjoy your stay, in particular I am very sorry to hear that you found the room you were allocated not to be to your liking, I am truly sorry for any shortcomings that may have occurred and I sincerely hope that this experience will not deter you from choosing Hotel Danieli for your next visit to Venice.
