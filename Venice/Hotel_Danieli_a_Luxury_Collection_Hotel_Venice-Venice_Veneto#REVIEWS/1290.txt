First off let me say you cannot beat the Danieli for location.  The hotel is in the center of everything you want to do in Venice.  The staff was wonderful and the Concierge I met whose name is Alessio, is by far the best Concierge I have every worked with.  He can make impossible things happen in an instant.  The down side for me was the room and bathroom.  My room was old and tired and in need of updating and the bathroom was painfully small.  Most importantly the air conditioning did not work.  It was reportedly on and functioning but the room was unbearably hot all four nights I was there.  I'm not saying not to stay here just know that sometimes Historic and Classic may also mean old.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 24, 2015Dear travelingcoroner, Thank you choosing to stay with us on your recent visit to Venice.
