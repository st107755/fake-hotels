We recently stayed in Hotel Danieli for several nights. We are a family of 4 and had 2 rooms in the renovated section of the hotel. We we thrilled with every aspect of our stay here. We arrived on a foggy cold day by water taxi to the hotel entrance - sensational experience. Our check in was personal and relaxed. A bottle of wine was provided for us to enjoy. The beds were very very comfortable. The hotel has the best position and the breakfast was 6 star. The view from the restaurant balcony is breathtaking. I have read reviews of the Hotel which are critical. I disagree. Thanks to this hotel we had a magical holiday in Venice.
