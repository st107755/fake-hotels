We stayed for three nights with friends to celebrate 40th birthdays, following a trip on the Orient Express, as we wanted the luxury to continue. I've just thought long and hard as to whether to mark the Danieli three or four stars, as I have very mixed feelings after our stay.   Pros: Location is excellent. I got up at sunrise one morning to take photos on the waterfront and around St Marks in the stunning light. It's a must-see and is just steps from the Danieli doors.  Reception and bar area are beautiful and luxurious.  Breakfast on the top floor terrace is amazing. The views are superb and the quality and selection of the buffet breakfast are unbeatable.   Cons:  Service was pretty poor for the standard of the hotel. There was one person on check-in and a queue 10-deep.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Nov 4, 2016Dear Gemma N, I was pleased to learn that you enjoyed the perfect location of the Hotel in the Heart of Venice, indeed for travelling around Venice with ease and visiting most of its major attractions and sights.
