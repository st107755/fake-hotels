Stayed at the hotel last year ...  very excited to be staying in luxury ... wish we hadn't bothered ... the staff who greeted us were rude and very aloof ... infact I was interrupted twice on check-in whilst they served a fellow Italian ... we didn't eat in the restaurant as we were not made to feel welcome ... it spoilt our holiday of a lifetime ... but it didn't put us off beautiful Venice ... just would stay away from this hotel in future .... the interior was stunning ... shame about some of the staff ... the bar staff and cleaners we're the nicest !!!! ... others way above their station xRead moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Jul 27, 2015Dear becks2000, My sincere apologies that you were dissatisfied with your recent experience at the property and I very much welcome your feedback.
