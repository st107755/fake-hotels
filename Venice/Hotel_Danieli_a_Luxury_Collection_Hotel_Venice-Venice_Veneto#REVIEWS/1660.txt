This is a great Hotel well located in Venice. A great atomosphere outside the hotel , nice lobby lounge and good size rooms. I heard its were the TOURIST movie Hotel was based on. You can catch a Gondala directly from the hotel which is a nice touch. A classic building of its era well maintained and staff are excellent. We had a venician ball the last night and it was the perfect location in Venice. A bit expensive but well worth it. The roof top Breakfast with the views are outstanding. We had dinner one night in the upstairs restuarant which was first class. No pool but std for Venice only let down.Read moreDate of stay: May 2013HelpfulShare Response from ExecutiveOffice72, Manager at Hotel Danieli, a Luxury Collection Hotel, VeniceResponded Feb 17, 2014Dear Dwgoldengrove, Thank you for your kind feedback regarding your recent visit to the Hotel Danieli.
