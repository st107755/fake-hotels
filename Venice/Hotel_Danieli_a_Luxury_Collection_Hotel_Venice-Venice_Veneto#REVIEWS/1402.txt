The characteristic revolving doors of the hotel open into the majestic lobby of 14th Century Palazzo Dandolo and from the lobby the decorative marble staircase leads up to the mezzanine giving access to the palace guestrooms, the adjacent 17th Century Palazzo Casa Nuova and to the 20th Century Palazzo Danieli Excelsior.
