We enjoyed three nights in the wonderful Hotel Danieli. The water taxi entrance, as the first experience of the Hotel was grand in itself, with the decor and the main lobby staircase a delight. The room was well appointed, we had a room looking onto prison tiled roof, but for us that was not a problem as we spent little time in the room. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. We found ALL of the staff to be extremely professional, with nothing too much trouble. The hotel has a great central location for the main tourist attractions, water taxi stop and a short walk to some of the many great restaurants in the area. A must hotel for anyone visiting Venice.
