This time we stayed at the Cipriani but visited the Danieli for dinner. Dining at the Danieli was a mistake. The restaurant on the Terrace at the top of the hotel has some of the best views in Venice. But good views don't compensate for mediocre food and surly service. The food we had there was uninspired and markedly less good than we had at other places in Venice. The service was awful, with surly indifferent waiters who had clearly been doing the job for too long treating diners with studied indifference. The cost was astronomical. Most of the main courses were priced at around €60. For a party of 5, the €16 service charge added up to €80, which seems a lot for a basket of bread! Visit for the view but don't be tempted to stay for dinner.Read moreDate of stay: June 2012HelpfulShare
