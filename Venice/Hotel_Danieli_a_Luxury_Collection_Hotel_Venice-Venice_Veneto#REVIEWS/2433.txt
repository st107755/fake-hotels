Great view from the 4th floor restaurant terrace at breakfast but very poor buffet style food which for 50 Euros is a joke. Tinned orange juice at a 5 star hotel? Beautiful medieval interior to main building - the annexes are concrete mediocity. The fire doors outside our romm were jammed open with paer for two consecutive nights - where was the security? Better value could be had by staying else where in Vencie and popping into the Danieli for a drink and phot opportunity in its stunning lounge! Read moreDate of stay: September 2006HelpfulShare
