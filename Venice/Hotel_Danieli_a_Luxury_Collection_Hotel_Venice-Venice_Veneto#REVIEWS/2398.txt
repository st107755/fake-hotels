I'm sure others have said this before me, but the main building of the hotel is beautiful. But most people are not lodged in that building, most guests are placed in this ugly, old "newer" building. The "newer" building was built in the 1960's i think and is a huge eyesore. It's also pretty moldy smelling and has the overall quality of a 3 star hotel. We were upgraded to a suite in the new building that had a balcony and a gorgeous view of the bay. but the beds were lumpy and the mattressed seemed like they were about 20 years old. I hope the have since replaced the them. The furniture was really worn and the carpets smelled and were pretty cheap. The hotel needs a massive renovation!
