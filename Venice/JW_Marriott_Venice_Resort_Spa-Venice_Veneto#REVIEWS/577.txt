We stayed the latter part of our honeymoon-- for two nights and it was just perfect. We were pretty much exhausted from all the travelling we have been doing for the past 2 weeks that JW was perfect for the much needed relaxation. The hotel may be far from San Marco, but we welcomed the fact that it was far from San Marco. There is a complimentary shuttle every 30 mins if you wanted to join the hustle and bustle of San Marco.   We were upgraded to a junior suite I think-- room 235? And it was such a big room! It had a large bed, separate couch/table, and large bathroom. Love the whole design of it. The whole little island was very good as well. It included a family pool in addition to the rooftop pool. It had a pretty good gym-- open 24 hrs. Room service available at all hours.â€¦Read moreDate of stay: July 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 21, 2017Dear Denisse O, thank you for your review.
