It was a pleasant surprise staying at the island Marriot.  We arrived after a 36 hour time of traveling with our luggage lost.  They immediately upgraded our room and took us to our beautiful accommodations overlooking the Olive Garden.  We had two bathrooms and a great bed.  The breakfast in the morning was very nice and the water taxi's to Venice were on time and clean.  Overall it was a very nice experience.  They were late picking up our luggage but I called to remind them and they came immediately and apologized for the error.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 7, 2015Dear Sir,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor.
