Just spent 4 nights and loved every second of it from the island, to the room to the amazing staff.  If your in Venice for more than 1 night this is the place.  The boat back and forth was never a problem and it was never over crowded either.  If you want to enjoy the sights of Venice and enjoy some peace and quite in a 5 star resort than this is the place.Read moreDate of stay: September 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 7, 2016Dear Andrew J, thanks for your review. We are thrilled to hear that you loved every second at our magical Isola delle Rose. I think our private island is an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they donâ€™t leave our island!  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
