We stayed for 3 days at this hotel. It's an upscale hotel on an island in Venice. You need to take their free shuttle to go to downtown Venice. Breakfast is not free for gold members. Customer service is very good, the restaurant is very nice with good service and good food. The restaurant is on the roof top and the view is fantastic.overall we had a very nice experience.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Nov 10, 2017Dear SSM5, thanks for your wonderful feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our upscale hotel, good service and delicious food.  As you mentioned, our Sagra Rooftop restaurant and pool offers one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
