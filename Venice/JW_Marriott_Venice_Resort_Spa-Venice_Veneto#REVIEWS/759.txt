Having been to Venice 5 times, this is by far the best hotel and the best experience. It does have some downsides; it is 20 minutes into town by shuttle boat... thats it!  Thats the only downside.  The accommodation is superb. The food is amazing, especially at Sagra but what was even better was the service, especially by Chiara who couldn't do enough for us.   The pasta was cooked perfectly, seasoned amazingly and served beautifully.Read moreDate of stay: April 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 27, 2017Dear Laurence D, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
