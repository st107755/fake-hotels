This hotel is wonderful!  On its own island, so you are secluded, but close enough to easily shuttle to the main part of the city.    The breakfast is amazing, and the staff is polite and helpful.  The only thing we would have changed is the room air conditioning, but we like really cold rooms.  All in all, fabulous hotel!
