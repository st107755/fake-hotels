Thank you for your kind comments about our fantastic hotel, great food, attentive service and tranquil location.  I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed your dining experiences at our Sagra Rooftop Bar and Restaurant. You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden. One of my favorite dining experiences is enjoying these Venetian-style tapas while overlooking the dramatic skyline of the Lagoon during sunset at our rooftop.   Thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose and we hope to welcome you back again very soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General ManagerRead more
