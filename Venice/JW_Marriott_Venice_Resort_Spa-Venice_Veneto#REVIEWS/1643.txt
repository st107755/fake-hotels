When we pulled up in the Vaparotto to the front entrance, it is exquisite, the color tones are beautiful and relaxing, whites, light blues and browns, we were led to the check in desk, seated and given a refreshing flavored water.  Rooms are very, very large, beautifully appointed.  This is the place to stay in Venice.  Only obstacle is arriving by train, you must first go to St Marks to catch the complimentary transfer.
