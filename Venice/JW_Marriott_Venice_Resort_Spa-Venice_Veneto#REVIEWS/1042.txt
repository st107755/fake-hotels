We are delighted that you and your family had an amazing experience at our resort! It is a major compliment to hear you say that our Isola delle Rose is without a doubt the crown jewel in the Marriott family. We are grateful for your kind comments about spectacular grounds, fantastic staff, amazing views and reliable shuttle service.  We are also thrilled to hear that you had a once-in-a-lifetime family vacation. Our resort offers a number of fun amenities tailored for families. Did you get the chance to make use of our JW bicycles, included in the Resort Package? It is such a fun and relaxing way to explore our private island and discover our century-old park and gardens, which is the home to a variety of vegetables, orchards and even an olive grove with a hundred trees – from which we make our own olive oil for our restaurants.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
