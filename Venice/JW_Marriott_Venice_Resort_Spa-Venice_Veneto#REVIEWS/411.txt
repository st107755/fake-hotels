The hotel was dependably like an American hotel, with even nicer features like heated bathroom floors and fabulous balconies overlooking vast gardens.   October was very foggy so we didn't find views of the city to be as nice.  Need to take a free 20 minute water taxi to get anywhere, but it runs every half hour.  It's a blessing in the morning as that water taxi can take you straight to the bus area for the airport on day of departure.  We would stay here again for the Marriott brand, and would recommend if you mind being a bit out of the way.
