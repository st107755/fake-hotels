We stayed here for 7 nights, so the journeys we made on the hotel's water shuttle, roughly 30 mins each way, and running every 30 mins, was not a problem for us. On a shorter stay we would stay in Venice. The shuttle drops off by St Marks Square, and during the morning from 9 until 11, a water shuttle runs to the train station. Nice to be met every morning by the shuttle area by the ever smiling and friendly Omar! The room was good, but a balcony would have been nice. Some jazz played on some evenings in the bar area. Nice, adult only, rooftop swimming pool.Read moreDate of stay: September 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 16, 2017Dear TravellinTomS, thanks for your wonderful feedback. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay at our magical Isola delle Rose.   I am also glad to hear that you enjoyed spending time at our Rooftop Pool. As you mentioned, we changed the concept of our Rooftop Pool; it is now adults only. We were inspired by exclusive Members Only clubs with private rooftop pools and wanted to offer our adult guests a perfect lounge style pool with a sophisticated but relaxing atmosphere and amazing views of Venice.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
