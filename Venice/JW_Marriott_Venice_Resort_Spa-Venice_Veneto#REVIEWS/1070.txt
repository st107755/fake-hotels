We appreciate your kind words about our excellent hotel, nice rooms and great customer service.  I am also glad to hear that you enjoyed your dining experience at our Sagra Rooftop restaurant. You might be interested to hear that besides the regular menu, we also offer a special menu from the Cicchetti Bar, which are Venetian-style tapas. We offer some of the best cicchetti in Venice, made from local ingredients and those found in our organic botanical garden.
