We had 2 nights stay and really enjoyed everything hotel has provided. Breakfast has the variety and quality. Fruit is fresh and desserts are delicious. Room is clean and spacious. We enjoyed the walk in the quiet beautiful gardens on the island in the earlier morning and in the evening. Shuttle to San Marco square is always on time. Special thanks to the manager Gianmarco Chia who helps us a lot and provided many information sincerely and helpfully. Thank you very much!!Read moreDate of stay: April 2019HelpfulShare
