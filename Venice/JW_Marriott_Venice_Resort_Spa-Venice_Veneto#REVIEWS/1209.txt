The most amazing setting for a hotel. Fantastic entrance by boat, hotel shuttle was excellent and our suite was amazing. The restaurants were terrific and hotel staff could not do enough to help during our stay we would certainly recommend a stay here. It's a fantastic retreat away from the hustle and bustle of Venice.

We are delighted that you were impressed by our resort. What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice proper means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for recommending us and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
