Can't think of a single bad thing about this property except that the dock to get on the ferry transfer was hard to find in the dark. Other than that, the hotel is gloriously grand and luxurious. We received an upgrade, as we are status members, so the room was huge. The breakfast every morning was also magnificent, with prosecco included! I also loved the Roberto cavalli bath amenities. I'd go back to Venice just to stay at this hotel again!
