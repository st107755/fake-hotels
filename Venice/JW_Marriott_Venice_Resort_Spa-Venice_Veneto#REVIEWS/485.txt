What a wonderful resort!  We just returned from our second holiday at this amazing hotel and we just wish we were still there... I have only but the best to say, exactly as the first time last year.

We are grateful for your generous comments about our impeccable and beautiful resort, wonderful ambiance and polite and helpful staff.  Our Isola delle Rose – Island of Roses – has a rich history.

All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
