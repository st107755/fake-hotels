A stunning hotel for our city break to Venice. The staff were superb, really welcoming on arrival and check in, friendly bar staff on the rooftop bar, lovely cleaning team too....  nothing was too much trouble and we felt we were looked after the entire time.  Our room was a junior suite and was really spacious, clean and fresh. We didnâ€™t have breakfast at the restaurant but did use the cafe next door which was great for coffee and pastry on the go!  The shuttle boat ran like clockwork every 30 minutes to San Marco and back and we found it really easy to get around.  Would highly recommend this Marriott hotel.
