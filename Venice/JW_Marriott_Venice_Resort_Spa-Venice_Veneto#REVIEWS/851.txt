This was truly one of my favorite parts of my trip to Venice! The rooms are nice. The breakfast was amazing. The main difficulty was accessing the hotel if you did not do the private water taxi. The main ferry over and then the hotel water taxi over was a bit of a challenge with luggage. It's best to travel light. But other than that the hotel's water taxi over to the central location was about a 20 minute ride, but was very peaceful.  I actually wish we would have spent more time at the hotel during the day to enjoy its beauty.Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 16, 2016Dear Whitnee B, thanks so much for your positive feedback. We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful location, amazing breakfast and peaceful shuttle service.  The next time you visit us I recommend spending time at our rooftop restaurant and pool, Sagra. I think it is one of the best vantage points to admire breathtaking 360-degree views of Venice and the Lagoon. It is also the ideal place to watch the beautiful Venetian sunset. Many guests tell us how much they enjoy spending Happy Hour there while indulging in a glass of prosecco and some tapas from our Cicchetti Menu. It is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
