JW Marriott Venice is a great place to stay. New, modern, and service was exceptional. Giagoro was so friendly and always went above and beyond for anything we needed! You are on your own private and gorgeous island. Easy access to Piazza San Marco via complimentary boat every 30 minutes.

We appreciate your kind comments about our new and modern resort, exceptional service and easy shuttle service.  We believe having the ability to escape Veniceâ€™s hectic atmosphere is a real benefit, our private island being an oasis of tranquility right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
