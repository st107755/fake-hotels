This place is probably the most relaxing spot in busy Venice. A former sanatorium/hospital turned into a fantastic resort, just a 15 minutes boot ride from Markus square. Unfortunately the hotel is not yet ready (June 2015). First night no AC (33 C outside temperature), second night/morning no electricity. We had to shower in the dark. No apology, no comments from the reception. Service is also not quiet ready. Room service showed up at 10.45 pm to prepare the room/suite for the night. Already in PJs there was no need for this anymore. But service personal insisted. Odd.Read moreDate of stay: June 2015HelpfulShare
