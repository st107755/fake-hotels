Great Service and amenities.  Fabulous views of Venice from their Island.  The restaurants on site are really good.  The Michelin 1 restaurant has limited vegetarian options, however.  The employees are very nice, and give very good advice.  There is a complimentary tour of Murano that is offered by the hotel that is worth taking.Read moreDate of stay: August 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 31, 2016Dear mintokjain, thanks for your review.
