Our first visit to Venice and absolutely loved every minute. When we arrived at resort we where greeted by a very welcoming staff. We then given a mini tour of resort and where very impressed with everything that we had seen. They staff accommodation and facilities where true 5 star. Food was delicious and really could not find fault. 2 pools with one being a infinity pool where superb. We will 100% be back there. We would like to make a special mention to the staff that looked after us. Gabriel, Marc, Alexahdra,Alexander, Marina, Salvador, Andrea,Nina and there are others staff we where dealing with that also made our stay very memorable.
