This hotel was as impeccable as things can get. We chose it specifically to have an oasis of rest away from the touristy crowds of central Venice, and it worked perfectly. Service is always with a smile, the spa is excellent, breakfast top notch, as is the 'day to day' food. The real gem on the island is the gourmet restaurant, Dopolavoro. Anyone who goes there should try its fare. It's pricey, yes, but - nice things cost money. The only minor drawback are the small swimming pools - surely, with so much space they could have afforded to invest in something larger. But that is really a minor point.
