Perfect to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice.  The facility has it all, beautiful pools, fantastic workout facilities, top notch restraints and services.  We upgraded to a JR Suite at the concierges suggestion, well worth the small amount of money.  When you take the time to walk the grounds you realize how special this oasis is.  We were not there long enough to take advantage of the spa or cooking classes but of what we did and saw we were impressed.  The shuttle to Venice is an added bonus easy and simple and ran on every half hour.  Wish we could have spent more time and used some of the amenities.  If you like like to visit Venice but at the end of the day need a "break" from Venice I would consider this resort.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 29, 2016Dear Stephen1213, thanks so much for your review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful pools, fantastic workout facilities and easy shuttle to and from Venice proper.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
