We stayed for 4 nights and had an amazing experience.  All of the staff - including Carlos, Luca and all of the guest relations team - were great and did everything they could to make our stay a memorable one.  The hotel and its grounds are beautiful, as are the pools, and it's great to be able to retreat back to the peaceful island after sightseeing in busy Venice.  Breakfast was lovely.  We will definitely stay at the hotel during our next visit to Venice.

We are delighted that you had an amazing experience at our magical resort! We appreciate your kind comments about our great team, beautiful grounds and lovely breakfast.  What we provide our guests at our Isola delle Rose is something completely unique. Our proximity to Venice means that it is very easy and convenient to get to the hustle and bustle of this iconic city â€“ but at the end of a busy day, our private island offers a relaxing sanctuary where you can enjoy first-class facilities, Michelin-starred meals and relax at our award-winning spa. I think it is the ultimate way to experience Venice in luxury and style.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you visit us again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
