Just returned from a 4 night stay at this amazing hotel. Arrived by water taxi straight into hotel on their jetty. We were received with the warmest of welcomes and shown to a beautiful room. We slept sound. Breakfast was very good. All areas were clean and contemporary. Excellent location for relaxation but just a short boat trip into Venice. The hotel provided a shuttle service every half hour.  The most striking thing about our trip, apart from beautiful Venice, was the amazing service from every staff member we met, always helpful and with a smile. We really appreciated it!  The grounds of the hotel are lovely to explore when taking a break from sightseeing. A fabulous stay in a stunning location.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 27, 2016Dear 846Tina54, thank you for your wonderful feedback. We are delighted that you had a fabulous stay! We are grateful for your kind comments about our peaceful island paradise, amazing hotel, warm hospitality, beautiful rooms and stunning location.  We hope that you had the chance to check out our Sapori Cooking Academy. The morning program we offer is such an unforgettable experience. The morning starts with meeting Chef Micki and travelling together via private water taxi to the colorful Rialto Market. He helps you choose the freshest ingredients to take back to the resort where he teaches how to prepare delicious dishes following the Venetian culinary tradition. Plus you get to enjoy the lunch that you helped prepare. It is a fantastic way to immerse yourself in the local culture â€“ I highly recommend it.
