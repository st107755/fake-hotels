We are grateful for your kind comments about our lovely property, beautiful setting and luxurious buildings.   We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.
