We stayed here for 4 nights and had an amazing experience. The hotel is stunning, super clean and fresh, incredibly helpful staff and beautiful scenery. The island itself is just 10-15 mins free shuttle boat ride (leaves every 30 mins) from the mainland and the hotel grounds cover the whole island. The gardens and walks are beautiful, as is the rooftop bar and pool. It was perfect to escape the noise and bustle of the mainland to the oasis that is the Marriott hotel. Would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting Venice.Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare
