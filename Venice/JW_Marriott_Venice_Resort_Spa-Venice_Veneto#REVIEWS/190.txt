Visited during the last week of September. I don't know where to begin. Magical hotel entrance. At the reception the staff were very polite and courteous answered all my question with enthusiasm. The staff at the hotel where amazing all the way, from the Food and beverage to the house keeping. The breakfast was great with a large variety of food always plenty of choices not to mention the great quality. One of the things we enjoyed most was the outside area of gardens they are  breathtakingly beautiful and romantic. The pool areas where clean and tidy  with  SUPER relaxing atmosphere.in overall great experience will definitely be returning next year ! thank you to all who made our stay memorable keep up the good work !
