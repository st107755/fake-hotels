Staying over on a family holiday at the JW marriott Venice Resort and Spa.  The resort is a great holiday experience. The Rose bar provides some convenient and casual drinks and dining options with a choice of kids menu too. For the musically inclined the grand Piano is a great way to occupy yourself while your order makes it way    Service is top class - prompt friendly and courteous- been served on different occasions  by Ivan, Matteo and Turgut very friendly and efficient service at all times- highly recommended for a quick bite, casual drink or something more formal!!
