Situated on its own island. 20/30 minute hotel private ferry ride from St Marco Square. Keep an eye out for the Marriott boat if the water is high it can arrive a few moorings down. Hotel itself is luxury and prices to match which is ok of course. Breakfast buffet is €35 each and dinner can be €100 a head inc wine. Just saying as you have no options other than to go on the boat trip which is fine if the weather is ok. Having said that. Would go back for a 3rd time. One relaxing place. Staff friendly and helpful. Enjoy! Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
