This was an exceptional place to stay.  The Resort is practically new and beautiful.  The staff are the friendliest and kindest people you will meet.  Breakfast in their Cucina Restaurant is quite the experience.  However, be careful of the reception upon check-in attempting to convince you to upgrade rooms in the most polite manner for hundreds of additional euros you did not anticipate to spend - I got fooled, but still had a wonderful time.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 15, 2016Dear Panagiotis1980, we really appreciate your wonderful feedback about our resort. We are also grateful for your kind comments about our beautiful hotel, friendly and kind staff and delicious breakfast.  I agree with your sentiment about our private island being an oasis right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the morning, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that there are days when they donâ€™t leave our island!  Thank you for choosing JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
