This hotel is located on it's own island and has a water transport service every 30 mins to the San Marco square. It's an extreme nice, modern and up to date hotel. The rooms are very nice and quiet, the area around the hotel is nice for a walk or a work out. There are two pools available as well.   The staff is very accommodating, and the rooms are looked after multiple times a day. Prices for food and drinks are extremely high though.....   As a platinum guest we got upgraded to a junior suite, which was a very nice and large room. Unfortunately there is no other benefit of being a Platinum member (no lounge or free breakfast), but we knew this upfront.   We really enjoyed the hotel, especially as it's a bit away from the city.Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 23, 2017Dear ArendJS, thanks for your positive review.
