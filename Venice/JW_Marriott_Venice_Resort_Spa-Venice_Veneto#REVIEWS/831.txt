I attended a 3-day conference in this island resort. I believe it is ideal because of the different spaces it offers for the activities, without running the risk of losing the participants too easily to the charms of Venice. The room on the ground floor was spacious and decorated with great Italian taste. It is, however that they do not have a bath in that huge bathroom, and there is no way to dry your hair decently: either you have a mirror or you have a lamp but not the two together... The food service is exceptional on the different restaurants, not only the food itself but the highly professional staff.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2016Dear Marcela M, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind comments about our delicious food and exceptional customer service.  I absolutely agree, I think our private island and luxurious facilities are a perfect venue for big events including business conferences. Our historic gardens are one of the most picturesque locations with its scenic 360-degree views of Venice. This year we hosted a few weddings and some high-profile events at our park and the feedback was amazing. With it being such a large outdoor facility as well as its island heritage, there is no place in Venice like it.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
