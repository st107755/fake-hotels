Awesome location, friendly staff and lots of space; area to walk, stroll and run - away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. Impeccable manicured laws and an outstanding breakfast spread.

We are delighted to hear you say that our magical Isola delle Rose is one of the best hotels in the world. We appreciate your kind comments about our awesome location, friendly staff, impeccable grounds and glorious views.  We hope that you were able to check out Dispensa during your stay with us. One of the best things of living in Italy is being able to travel its amazing cities and visit their local markets. The inspiration behind our new concept for Dispensa was our desire to bring all the wonderful and traditional products that you would find in any Italian regional market to our guests. We offer a mouthwatering and affordable selection of salami, prosciutto, cheeses and other delicious delicacies from all over Italy. We also feature our own Olive Oil, made from the olive trees that grow on our property. These can be purchased in convenient travel size bottles so that guests can bring home a unique memento of their stay with us.
