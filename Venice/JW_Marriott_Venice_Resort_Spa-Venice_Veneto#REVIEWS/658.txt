This is a beautiful Hotel without question it is unique but this review would be dishonest if I didn't mention the greed of this hotel .  People have paid five star prices to stay here , is it really nessesery  to charge for every conceivable thing ?  Beware of the additional block put on your card €150 per night, so if you are staying for a week that is = €1,050. It is blocked on your card . I do not mean it is pre authorised and you can still spend it ,I mean it is blocked and kept by the Marriott until check out with purchases deducted , so take a credit card for this . Marriott I resent giving you €1000 when I have already paid for my booking , this is an excessive amount, a pre authorisation to confirm funds would suffice!

We appreciate your generous comments about our beautiful hotel, lovely rooms and excellent Sapori Cooking Academy.  Many guests tell us that the culinary classes are one of the top activities to do when in Venice. It really is a wonderful experience. As you saw, guests learn to prepare a whole menu, ranging from the Venetian tradition to the great classics of Italian cuisine. Not only will you enjoy sampling delicious Italian dishes, you will also be provided with the skills and knowledge so you can prepare them at home.   However, I am very sorry to hear that you felt the resort to be expensive. Regarding your comments about the block placed on your credit card, this is a very common practice that is adopted by most hotels. But I apologize for the inconvenience caused.  Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope you will consider staying with us in the future.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
