Just checked out of this beautiful hotel and what a fabulous few days we have had. Fantastic service and courtesy from every single member of staff from the moment we arrived to the minute we left the island. Unbelievably beautiful views of Venice from the rooftop pool and bar area. The regular and complimentary shuttle to San Marco makes this hotel the perfect destination to enjoy all the delights of Venice. We loved having the flexibility of spending time pottering in Venice during the day, relaxing by the pool to enjoy the late afternoon sun and then taking the shuttle back into Venice in the evening. We have absolutely loved our stay, would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future. Read moreDate of stay: July 2018HelpfulShare
