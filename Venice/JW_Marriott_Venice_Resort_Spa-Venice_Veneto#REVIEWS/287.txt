My wife and I celebrated our honeymoon at the property and were blown away with the romantic setting, the amazing rooms and the incredible property. But what really stood out to us was the quality of the amazing staff. Prime example: Teo at Sagra. A kind, thoughtful staffer who engaged with us on so many different topics, offering honest advice about Venice and the property. He made our stay feel even more special.Read moreDate of stay: June 20182 Helpful votesHelpfulShare
