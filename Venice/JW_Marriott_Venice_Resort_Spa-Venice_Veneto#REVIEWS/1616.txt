Location 8/10  On an island situated just outside Venice,with a very good regular free shuttle service.The views are not spectacular  but this is a convenient place to stay.Not quite Venice but if you are travelling with Kids this would be better than staying in the city itself Food 9/10 Very good Breakfast and the Fine Dining Restaurant is excellent.I ws very impressed with the dining at the hotel except for the fact that they give you the smallest glasses of wine ever when you order by the glass. Rooms  8/10 Not large rooms and the design is not special but the rooms are good and a the Residenza you have a garden and a miniscule pool.Still for what i paid this was excellen value in Venice Service 8/10 Check in was slow but the staff at the hotel were helpful.I left my creditâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 27, 2015Dear Mark,  Thank you for your review! We totally agree: we are a family-friendly Resort not only in terms of services and facilities offered to families, but also in terms of activities and attitude of our smiling associates. The wide lush gardens are ideal also for kids playing outdoor, as well the family pool located in the century-old park; Rosalinda and Silvia, our Recreation Staff, take great care of kids with daily games and activities. A cooking class ideal for families takes specifically place on a weekly basis at our Sapori Cooking Academy. Venetian mask workshops are held at the Resort, so families can learn the secret tips of creating your own traditional mask from a local artisan.  This and much more can be lived at our JW Marriott Venice where we strive to provide authentic experiences, taking great care of all our guest... particularly of our youngest ones.  We hope to have the chance to welcome you back soon and remain with our sincerest regards,  Linda Bertoni Marketing & Communication ManagerRead more
