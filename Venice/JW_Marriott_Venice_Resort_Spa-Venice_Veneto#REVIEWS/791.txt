We stayed for 3 nights in late October in a Jr. Suite.  The hotel was an oasis.  The room was spacious, somewhat sparse.  The daily breakfast buffet had an abundant selection, and the restaurant was accommodating to our special dietary requests.   We walked the grounds, the outdoor pool was closed but we found the playground.  The rooftop pool affords a beautiful view of Venice especially at sunset.  The shuttle to St. Mark's was very convenient, and punctual.  The staff was top-notch, friendly and professional.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Dec 7, 2016Dear Luusmeitli, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate all your wonderful comments about our oasis-like resort, spacious rooms, beautiful views, convenient shuttle service and top-notch staff.  Did you have the chance to explore our private island by bicycle? One of the fun activities that we offer is the opportunity to rent JW bikes (included in the Resort package) for the day to discover our beautiful grounds. Many of our guests tell us how they would never expect to have the chance to ride a bicycle in Venice. It is such a lovely activity to do with friends, especially within the setting of our historic gardens with its panoramic views of the dramatic Venetian skyline.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
