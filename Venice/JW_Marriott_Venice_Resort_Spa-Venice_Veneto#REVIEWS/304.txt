A great choice for a resort hotel to stay at in Venice. Enjoy the beauty of nature and piece of mind after a super crowded visit to St. Marco. Free shuttle boat every 30 min from the resort to St. Marco square and back.  The Hotel rooms & facilities are excellent ...Service is superb and the staff are amazing. Everyone at the Marriott was friendly and went out of their way to attend to our needs. Thanks to lovely Erica and her wonderful colleagues at the GOCO spa, Stefano and his team at the roof top pool, Celine at the front desk and Gia's service, we truly had a dream vacation in Venice....Read moreDate of stay: June 2018HelpfulShare
