We cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  Our family stayed here for several nights while in Venice.  We were a bit apprehensive about being removed from the core areas of Venice, but it ended up being a positive.  The ferry ran frequently and didn't take too long to get over to Venice.  In return for being removed, we got lots of green space for our child to run around, playgrounds and obstacle courses, and a great pool for when Venice got too hot and crowded.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  And the rooms were very well-appointed.  We would come back here in a heartbeat.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare
