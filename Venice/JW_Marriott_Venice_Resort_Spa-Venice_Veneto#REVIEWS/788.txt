We stayed at the JW for 4 nights on a recent visit to Venice. We booked transportation to the hotel from the airport, and that was awesome. It's very cool to arrive at this hotel by boat since you basically drive into the hotel. That boat was really fast. The hotel and room was very nice. The grounds are amazing and we enjoyed walking through them. The bathroom was a little odd and it took us some time to figure out the lighting in there. They offer a shuttle to and from St. Mark's square and we used it several times. It is free, but it is also slow. Plan on about 30 minutes each way. Still, it was nice to have it.Read moreDate of stay: October 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Dec 7, 2016Dear 2KauaiGuys, thanks so much for your review. We appreciate your kind words about our impressive arrival experience and nice hotel.  With regards to your feedback about our shuttle service, you might be interested to hear that it can take only 10 minutes from our hotel to San Marco but there are two important things that we always tell our guests. Firstly, for obvious safety reasons, we need to respect the speed limits in the Lagoon and secondly, the dock we have in San Marco is regulated by the Commune de Venezia. We have an allocated time slot for the use of the dock as we are sharing it with two other hotels. Therefore even if the shuttle arrives before the allocated time, it will still have to wait in front of the dock until the previous boat releases the spot.   Having said this, we are glad to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and we thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
