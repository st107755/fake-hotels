Our week long visit at this resort can't really be summarized in words. Right from the arrival in water taxi, it was amazing at all levels. Beautiful and luxurious resort on a private island with wonderful views from all around. Our room was located on first floor with a good view of the lawn and the sea. Spacious, neat and clean room with all the required amenities. Hospitality was outstanding.  Terrace restaurant, or the bar in the lobby, all were great.  There were speed boat shuttles running at regular intervals to the market place for ease of going around.Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
