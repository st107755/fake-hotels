I visited the resort with my Mum for a four night stay. We had high expectations (due to the hefty cost of our stay) but can honestly say they were exceeded. Room was lovely, staff very friendly and attentive. Big thanks to Matteo in the Sagra Rooftop restaurant and Ivan in the Rose bar for the incredible cocktails!! Shuttle service takes you straight to San Marco every 30 mins, so very easy to see the main tourist attractions. The resort itself was very peaceful and the perfect place to come back to after walking around the packed streets of Venice. Can't wait to go back again soon!

We are delighted that you and our mother had an incredible stay. We appreciate your kind comments about our lovely rooms, friendly and attentive staff and peaceful resort.  I agree with your sentiment about our private island being an oasis right outside of Venice. Some of our guests tell us how they like venturing into the hustle and bustle of Venice proper in the mornings, but really enjoy coming back to our peaceful retreat for the afternoon. There is so much to do on our island, from treating yourself in our luxurious GOCO Spa, sunbathing on our beautiful rooftop pool with breathtaking views overlooking the Lagoon to indulging in a delicious meal at one of our restaurants. There is no shortage of activities and things to do at our resort. Some guests even tell us that on some days they donâ€™t leave our island!  Thank you for choosing JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
