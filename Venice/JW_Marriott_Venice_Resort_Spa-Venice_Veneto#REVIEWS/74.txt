The location is simply amazing with shuttles to San Marco every 30 minutes; this is adding a lot to the Venetian experience; the hotel is brand new, set in its own private island, offering clean, spacious, contemporary yet cosy areas; rooms are well equipped with illy coffee machines, very comfortable mattress and pillows. Special mention to the breakfast experience : nice and very welcoming staff, amazing selection of food.Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare
