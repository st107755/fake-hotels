The JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa is spectacular. The rooms are enormous, we were traveling with our kids and two rollaways were set up in our room - plenty of room. Everything was super clean and modern. The grounds are beautifully manicured. The restaurant had fantastic food for breakfast and dinner. The customer service, outstanding. Yes, it is a good 20 minute shuttle ride (provided free by the JW)  from Venice itself however it was lovely to get away from the hustle and bustle as well as the stifling heat of Venice itself. If you are looking for tranquility with proximity to Venice this is the place.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 18, 2016Dear la5280, thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are grateful for your kind comments about our spectacular resort, enormous rooms, beautifully manicured grounds, fantastic food and outstanding customer service.   Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. Plus our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, new Adventure Park as well as an amazing Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to see you and your family again soon!  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
