We spent 3 days in Venice and due to young children we wanted a hotel with a pool. Unfortunately the pool on the room is adults only and we used the pool in the gardens 2 minute walk away. The hotel grounds are beautiful, rooms are spacious and staff are friendly. Its a 10-15 minute boat ride to central Venice and was a nice way to see the city.Read moreDate of stay: August 2019HelpfulShare
