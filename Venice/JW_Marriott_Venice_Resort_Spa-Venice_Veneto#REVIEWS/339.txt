I really could go on and on about this property and the staff. From the moment we arrived we were accommodated in every aspect imaginable. Even when we were leaving, we had to catch a water taxi at Pizzale Roma and my mother was having trouble with her suitcase, we ran into a staff from the hotel who gladly offered to help her carry her suitcase across the bridge.   They take the extra time to remember everyone's name and all wished my mother a happy birthday throughout our 5 nights at the hotel. The boats to and from San Marco and the train station and extremely prompt and leave right on time. If you are looking to relax and enjoy Venice this is perfect. Concierge was outstanding, very patient and informative. They booked us tickets to the attractions we wanted to see withâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2018HelpfulShare
