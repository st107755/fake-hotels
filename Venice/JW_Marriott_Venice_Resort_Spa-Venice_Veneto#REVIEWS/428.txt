To say that the staff is exceptional is an understatement, as you stroll around this beautiful exclusive island, and meet the staff we found them open, engaging and always very helpful. From the daily contact with the guest relations (thank you Sara), to the concierge and bell services (thank you Manuel) coupled with the infinity pool overlooking Venice, and the nightly turndown service we had never felt so well cared for at any other Marriott around the world. I would say that this place is the must stay in Venice.Read moreDate of stay: October 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Oct 24, 2017Dear mnmunch13, thanks for writing a review.
