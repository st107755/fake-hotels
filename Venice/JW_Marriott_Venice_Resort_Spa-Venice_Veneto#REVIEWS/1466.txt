This is a great hotel on it's own island.  I am a Marriott Platinum member so I was upgraded to the "Residence" rooms.  These are separate from main hotel.  The room was very clean and large.  The bathroom was very large as well and included a tub, which we did not use but it looks great.  It included a secluded patio to relax and get some sun.  The staff was very friendly at check in / check out.  The restaurant was nice and food was well prepared and tasted great.  There was a roof top bar, but it closed around 11 pm.  there is a shuttle boat to the city which runs every 15 to 30 minutes.Read moreDate of stay: July 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 14, 2015Dear Ricardo,  We would like to thank you for your feedback related.
