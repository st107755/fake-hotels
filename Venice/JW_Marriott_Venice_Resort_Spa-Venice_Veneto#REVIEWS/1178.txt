Loved the unusual entrance to hotel via water taxi (easier than trying to lug suitcases through Venice to hotel shuttle boat). Kids club was great but annoying that it only starts at 4 years old. Rooms were great. Grounds massive. Family pool was not suitable for families with younger kids (no gradual change in depth so not suitable for any of my three children). However the pool up top was wonderful and they didn't seem to mind is being there with kids. We were there off season so might not be easy to get loungers in peak season. We didn't try their best restaurant but breakfast was excellent, lunch and dinner options were limited and not of standard I'd expect in 5 star place. Location is quite a long slow boat ride to San Marco square but it was so nice to get back to peaceâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: May 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 23, 2016Dear donegalgalabroad, thank you so much for your review. We are delighted to hear that you and your family loved your time at our resort.  Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate the convenience of having your own private island to come back to at the end of a busy day in Venice. Some guests have told me that they found the hustle and bustle of the iconic city to be somewhat daunting when travelling with children, but I believe that our Isola delle Rose provides the perfect respite. As you mentioned our island is very family-friendly, with a family pool, new Adventure Park and a playground, as well as a fantastic Kids Club offering fun activities for our young guests.   Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we hope to welcome you and your family back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
