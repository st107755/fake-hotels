We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay at our resort. We appreciate your kind comments about our attentive service as well as our helpful and amazing staff.  There is so much to do at our magical Isola delle Rose. When the team and I were organizing the excursions that we wanted to provide our guests, we thought of all the things that would be part of the ultimate travel experience of Italy. From interactive cooking classes at our Sapori Cooking Academy to a tour of a traditional Murano glass-making factory, we wanted to showcase our passion for Italy and highlight some of the wonderful and fascinating aspects of its culture and history.   Thanks for recommending us and we hope to welcome you back to our magical Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
