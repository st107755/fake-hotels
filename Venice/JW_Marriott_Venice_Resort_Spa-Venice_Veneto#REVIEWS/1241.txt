Chef Micki really went out of his way to make sure our Italian Culinary experience was great. We took the Authentic Venice and the Sweet and Salty Pastry class. Authentic Venice was incredible. It included a trip to the local market and instructions on how to pick out the freshest ingredients. The market and coffee spot were not in a touristy area and were where the locals shop. We returned to the hotel and cooked up our fresh food. The taste and instruction were amazing. Our 9 yr old son joined us for the class and chef Micki made his experience unforgettable! Highly recommended. The kids club took wonderful care of our younger daughter who was too young for the class and the kids club is just across the hall from the cooking academy.Read moreDate of stay: April 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 25, 2016Dear tingrin3, thanks so much for your wonderful review. I will make sure to share your kind comments with Chef Micky â€“ he will be thrilled to hear that you enjoyed his culinary classes. I am also delighted that your children enjoyed their time with us. Having four daughters myself, I too appreciate a resort that caters to younger guests. I am happy that your son was able to take part in the cooking class. It is such a wonderful activity to do as a family! I think our private island is very kid-friendly, with a family pool and a playground, as well as a fantastic Kids Club offering a number of fun activities.  Thank you for choosing the JW Venice and we look forward to seeing you again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
