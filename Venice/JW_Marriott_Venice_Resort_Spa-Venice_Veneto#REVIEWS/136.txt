Our room was large and very clean, with a beautiful view of the lagoon and Venice far away, the personnel efficient and smiling. The gardens are not italian style. But the SPA is great : very good massages, nice sauna and hammam, the pool is a little bit cold, in april at least. The down side of this hotel is not the location (nice shuttle), but the food. Inside the hotel it is avarage and expensive fot what it is. In the gardens, the gastronomical Fiora del  Dopolavoro is disappointing : dishes are inequal and service is disturbing.Read moreDate of stay: April 20194 Helpful votesHelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Front Office Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Apr 14, 2019Dear Seachel2013, thank you for providing your honest and genuine feedback in regards of your recent experience at our JW Marriott Venice.
