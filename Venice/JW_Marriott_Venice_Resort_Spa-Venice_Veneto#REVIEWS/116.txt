We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. We paid extra for the breakfast which was stale on the 2nd Day. When we complained they made excuse that we dont make special arrangement. At the time of check out concierge came 2 times to the room saying pls leave as the check out time is near.  I was feeling disgusted to celebrating my marriage Anniversary.   Thank You Marriott for ruining my Marriage Anniversary.
