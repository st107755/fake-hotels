This is my first-ever visit to a JW Marriott, and it did not disappoint!  As SPG/Marriott Platinum, I received upgraded rooms (instead of just one) with balcony.  The staff are very professional and welcoming, from the shuttle boat captain to the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff!  The property is very well maintained.  Everything was 5-star quality.  So, despite the trouble of having to take a boat to and from the hotel, it was well worth it.  The grounds and amenities are excellent as well.  It is everything a JW Marriott should be.  Everyone in my party would stay there again!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Sep 4, 2017Dear William L, thanks for your review.
