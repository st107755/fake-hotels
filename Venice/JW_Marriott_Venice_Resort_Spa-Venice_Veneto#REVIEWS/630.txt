Whilst enjoying a trip in Venice I booked to take my wife to visit the Spa for her birthday. From getting the boat across to the hotels private island all the way to returning to Venice later in the day the whole experience was fantastic. The welcome we revived and attention to detail from all the staff was superb. I made the reservation for the spa over email and everyone was so helpful. The spa is amazing, lovely views across the lagoon and facilities are as you would expect well looked after. Thank you for making the trip so special and looking after us on the day.Read moreDate of stay: June 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 1, 2017Dear Anthonyuk26, thank you for taking the time to write a review.
