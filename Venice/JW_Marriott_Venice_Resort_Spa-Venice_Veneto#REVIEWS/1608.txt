We visited the hotel mid May, during a couple of days when the weather was beautiful. We were upgraded to a junior suite , probably because the hotel was very quiet and we are elite members. The hotel felt like a 5 star and the staff were plentiful and mostly very helpful. The roof top bar was wonderful and the views stunning. One thing that I would recommend checking is whether your breakfast is included because we thought ours wasn't and it was ! Because you are on an island it is more of an issue then when you can pop to a local cafe.  This hotel does combine a resort location with a city break so it is best for when you a staying for 4/5 days and can enjoy both the sun and the pool and the city.Read moreDate of stay: May 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Responsabile relazioni pubbliche at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded May 26, 2015Dear Sheenabee,  We would like to thank you for your feedback; we are proud to know you enjoyed your stay at our JW Marriott Venice and that you appreciated the Junior Suite we gladly assigned you.
