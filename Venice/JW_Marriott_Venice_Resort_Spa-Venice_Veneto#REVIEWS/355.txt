I truly enjoyed every minute of my stay at this resort. Everything was top quality from the private boat transfer, check in/out, villa upgrade and amenities. I am a platinum member so I expect A1 service and the JW Marriott Venice did not disappoint. They have a shuttle boat to and from the city every 30 minutes that was very easy to use and always on time. The rooftop pool view was amazing and a wonderful way to relax after a busy day in Venice. I am already looking to see when I can return to this beautiful resort. Read moreDate of stay: April 2018HelpfulShare
