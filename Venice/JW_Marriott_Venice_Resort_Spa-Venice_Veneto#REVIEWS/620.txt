This resort is amazing. From the moment you step into the boat (leaving St. Mark's square and the crowds) you enter in a very exclusive environment. Although the hotel is massive you don't see many guests (you actually see more staff than guests). The staff exaggerate to make your stay perfect.   The island itself is spotless and it is a delight to just walk around and discover its secret spots. Make sure you enjoy both pools - the more exclusive at the rooftop and the more relaxing at the garden.  The rooms are amazing and the perfect place to be after a busy day in Venice.  All in all, a super stay! :)Read moreDate of stay: May 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Jul 5, 2017Dear Eduardo Q, thank you so much for your positive feedback. We appreciate your kind words about our amazing resort, nice pool, beautiful rooms and attentive staff.  We are so proud of the beautiful design of our 19 buildings on our private island, which are the work of the renowned Italian architect Matteo Thun. His main focus was to integrate the contemporary elements of the existing buildings to showcase their unique history and personality, while at the same time enhancing the architectural heritage of our location.  Thank you for choosing to stay at the JW Marriott Venice and we hope to welcome you back again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
