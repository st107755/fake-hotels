Beautiful location, amazing and accommodating staff.  Customer service that is second to none, staff go above and beyond to accommodate requirements.  Thoroughly enjoyed my staff, it made a special city even more spectacular. Absolutely blown away by the staffs hospitality, on our departure we were greeted with macaroons as we whisked away into the Venetian sunset to the airport.  Andrea & Marco were fantastic hosts, a huge thankyou :)  Will definitely be returning, hopefully soon!Read moreDate of stay: October 2015HelpfulShare
