First the pros...The island property is lovely and private; offering modern, spacious rooms away from the crazy crowds of Venice. Now the cons...The boat to the property runs every 30 minutes and can get quite crowded. The ride time is appx 20 minutes. This makes it cumbersome to come and go freely throughout the day. Additionally, if you are traveling with kids who like to snack, be prepared to pay 9 Euros for an order of fries. You are committed to making all of your food purchases at Marriott. Also, their check in lobby is beautiful but horribly organized. The fitness room is excellent and the rooftop pool is sleek and modern with great views of Venice. If I had to do it over, I think I would choose to stay where the attractions are.Read moreDate of stay: July 2016HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 3, 2016Dear jenbzthings, thanks so much for your review. We are grateful for your generous comments about our lovely and private island, modern and spacious rooms, excellent fitness room and great views from our sleek rooftop pool.  With regards to your feedback about our shuttle service, you might be interested to hear that it can take only 10 minutes from our hotel to San Marco but there are two important things that we always tell our guests. Firstly, for obvious safety reasons, we need to respect the speed limits in the Lagoon and secondly, the dock we have in San Marco is regulated by the Commune de Venezia. We have an allocated time slot for the use of the dock as we are sharing it with two other hotels. Therefore even if the shuttle arrives before the allocated time, it will still have to wait in front of the dock until the previous boat releases the spot.   Having said this, we are glad to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and we thank you for choosing to stay at our magical Isola delle Rose.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
