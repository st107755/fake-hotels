We visited for three nights in late March and felt like we had the island to ourselves.  We booked the Uliveto De Luxe room with a church view and a lovely patio area.  There were two separate bathroom areas:  one with a sink, toilet and bidet and the other with two sinks and a shower/tub.  The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and quiet--a nice repose from the hectic and tourist overrun Venice. The sunset views from the bar/restaurant were not to be missed. It was convenient to take the water shuttle to and fro the hotel.  Only complaint:  We wish the water bus ran earlier than 9 am.Read moreDate of stay: March 2018HelpfulShare
