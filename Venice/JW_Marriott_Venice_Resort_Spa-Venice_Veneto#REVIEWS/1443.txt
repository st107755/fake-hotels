Venice without the crowds.  Stay on a private island with a complimentary shuttle, go to Venice when you want, then return to relaxation and sit by the pool if you want.  Marina one of the managers was extremely helpful in locating a better room for our Honeymoon, thanks Marina!  Everything about the property was top notch, from the grounds, the rooftop pool and bar, to the incredible breakfast (free for gold/platinum rewards members) the wifi, etc.  Would definitely return.Read moreDate of stay: August 2015HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, Public Relations Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 18, 2015Dear Brendan,  Your feedback left us so proud and happy, that we would like to deeply thank you.
