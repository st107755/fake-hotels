Awesome secluded hotel.   Getting to the hotel may be considered a lot g trip and labrious, but its well worth it. Get a water taxi to st Marcos and then the hotel shuttle service to the hotel.  Amazing view as we approach the hotel and enter through the 'drive way'.  Best of both worlds with this hotel. So close to Venice centre yet far enough to feel like your totally clear from the hustle and bustle.  Breakfast was awesome. Serve everything.   Rooftop pool was awesome. Cocktail service to the poolside is a bonus. The views from the pool are amazing. You can see st Marcos from there.   Night time views are lovely too, with stars and the low ambient lighting in the distance.  Definitely stay here if your looking for a getaway where you can go into hustle and bustle and escapeâ€¦Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare
