This is a great hotel and the staff were great. We stayed at the JW Marriott for 1 week and enjoyed the grounds, spa, pools, restaurants and our suite.   The advantages of this hotel are the well trained staff willing to help with every wish as well as the great room. The amenities are great as is the free shuttle to San Marco. We'd often have breakfast and head to Venice in late afternoon when the crowds are thinner and stay late into the night.   The disadvantage of the hotel is that breakfast can be very busy during peak times. But really it's a problem that improved during our stay.   Definitely would stay there again and have recommended the hotel to our family and friends.

We really appreciate your kind words about our nice hotel, well-trained staff and great amenities.  I think one of the main benefits of staying on your own private island is the peaceful retreat our resort provides after a busy day in Venice. Venice is certainly an exciting and thrilling destination, with its vibrant culture and rich history as well as the hustle and bustle of its crowded streets but many of our guests tell us that they like being able to come back to our relaxing hotel after a full day on the main island.   Thank you for recommending us and we look forward to welcoming you back to our Isola delle Rose again soon.  All the best, Enrique Tasende, General Manager Read more
