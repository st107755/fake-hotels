We stayed here for a 3 night weekend break without kids.  Wow, what a place. From the moment we stepped from the Water Taxi we were looked after by the staff to the extent that they knew what we wanted before we did.  Simply, cannot fault the service at this place, from room service (Giacozo is brilliant), to the Spa the staff cannot do enough for you.  The island itself is a retreat from the hussle of Venice city, and offers the perfect retreat at the end of a busy day sightseeing. The rooftop pool offers some of the best views of Venice you could imagine.  We would wholeheartedly recommend this Hotel, and cannot wait to go back ourselves.   Thank you Marriott Venice for a magical weekend stay!Read moreDate of stay: August 2017HelpfulShare Response from JWMarriottVenice, General Manager at JW Marriott Venice Resort & SpaResponded Aug 31, 2017Dear sjones2001, thanks for your review.
