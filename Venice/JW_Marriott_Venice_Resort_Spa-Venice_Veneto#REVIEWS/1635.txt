Stay of 3 nights. All services mentioned in the presentation are not all available. I was coming to visit Venise of course and relax in the biggest Spa after a long day of visit....but unfortunatly Spa was not opened yet. We have tried to get a good time to test the Italian restaurant but fully booked because all other restaurant at the hotel are not opened yet. The hotel is wonderfull and will certainly be  one of the best place to stay...when all equipment will be finished.    Read moreDate of stay: April 2015HelpfulShare
